      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power if he is aware that a surplus of £240,794 was shown in the 39th annual report of the ESB issued on 31st March, 1966; and if this factor was taken into consideration by him in deciding that a <i>prima facie</i> case exists to increase electricity charges by seven per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am, of course, aware that the annual report of the ESB for the year ended 31st March, 1966, showed a surplus of some £240,000.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware from the Report that the heavy rainfall during 1965-66 resulted in greatly increased output from the hydro stations; that this taken in conjunction with increased production from the oil stations enabled the Board to finish the year with a small surplus but that had average climatic conditions prevailed the accounts for the year would have shown a deficit of the order of £800,000.</P>
      <P>In stating that there was a <i>prima facie</i> case for the increased charges, I had regard to these factors and also to the reasons for the increases given in the Report and referred to by me in my reply to Deputy Lindsay's question on 28th September, 1966.  As I have already stated I have no intention of prejudicing in any way the consideration of this matter by the proposed Prices Advisory Body.</P>

These officers were recruited under an order made under section 5 (3) of the Civil Service Commissioners Act as female clerical assistants in the Department of Supplies in 1942 and it has been necessary to make further orders periodically, from time to time, extending the validity of the original order so as to permit their retention in the Civil Service.  It is not normal practice to give the names and addresses of the officers concerned in cases like this but if the Deputy wishes to have them, I will be happy to communicate them to him privately.</P>

      <P>I could not, offhand, <Col N="481" /> state how they compare with the previous amounts in relation to the total overall allocations.  I am not looking for a way out here.  The banks closed in mid-May and did not re-open until mid-August.  The result was that lodgments could not be made during that period to the local motor tax accounts for ultimate transfer to the central motor tax account and the Exchequer.  In these circumstances, it is quite conceivable that the amounts then being put through by way of transfer to the Road Fund by the Minister for Finance would, without doubt, have been negligible up to midAugust in comparison with what would have been transferred in a normal year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries if it is his interpretation of the Anglo-Irish Trade Agreement that Ireland has a contractual obligation to supply the full butter quota to Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no contractual obligation on this country to supply the present British quota for Irish butter.  I would point out, however, that we regarded previous quotas as unsatisfactory and that failure to fill the increased quota which we secured under the Free Trade Area Agreement could prejudice our position in seeking further increases in future years when greater quantities will be available for export.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Not this year.  Unfortunately the milk projection for this year was not realised and in order to allocate enough milk to butter production to meet our quota of 23,000 tons, it was necessary to ration the milk available to diversification plants. All of these plants were cut back at an even rate by Bord Bainne.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I went into it very carefully indeed.  The first requirement was to fill our butter quota and I have no doubt that was the right decision.  Our position in the British market has always been weak because we were intermittent suppliers, and it is essential that we meet our quota consistently year in and year out in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Second Programme for Economic Expansion envisaged that industrial employment would rise by 60,000 in the period 1964 to 1970 but, as a result of discussions with industry, the projected increase to 1970 was revised to 54,000.  While employment projections for the years between 1964 and 1970 were not formulated, the increase of 54,000 implied an annual increase of 2.6 per cent.  On this basis, industrial employment in 1965 would have reached 291,600.  According to the latest official statistics, employment in industry in 1965 is estimated at 291,000.  As regards 1966, the only information available relates to transportable goods industries.  The latest estimate, for the March quarter 1966, indicates that employment in this sector was about ¾ per cent higher than in the corresponding quarter of 1965.</P>

      <P>However, in view of the circumstances of this case, I have asked the county manager to reconsider the applicant's eligibility for general medical services and I am hopeful that the result will be favourable.  I will write to the Deputy when I hear shortly from the manager.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>When speaking last Thursday on this Estimate I pointed out that the 2½ per cent turnover tax had resulted in increased costs in the building industry.  Today I want to mention the effect of the new wholesale tax on people who are building houses.  As I said already, a number of items are exempt but we also have a number of items which are subject to the 5 per cent selective tax such as timber, windows, doors, nails, locks and many other items.  These items will put up the cost of houses priced at over £2,000 by another £150 to £200. Again, that is bound to reduce our building programme for the coming year.</P>
      <P>It was quite obvious from the Minister's speech last Tuesday that the number of new houses built in rural Ireland is lower for the first five months of this year than in the same period last year.  We had 2,212 houses sanctioned this year compared with 3,463 for the first five months of last year. That is a reduction of 1,251 houses or about one-third.  We are very often told by the Minister that there is more money available for house-buildings this year than there was last year and that there was more money available last year than the year before.  That statement, in my opinion, is quite incorrect. The net result is that increased costs of materials and of labour reduce the total number of houses built each year.  That situation will continue. Surely, with the taxes being imposed by the Government, they cannot in conscience shirk their responsibilities to poor people who are hit by increased costs more than anything else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to deal with reconstruction grants.  There have been appeals here even from the Minister's side of the House to have these grants increased.  Still we have the same estimates, the same rate per square yard for plastering and for flooring, the same rate for replacement of windows, <Col N="499" /> doors, gutters and pipes, year in year out, despite the fact that all these materials and work have increased substantially in cost.  I do not think I am unreasonable when I suggest to the Minister that he should seriously consider increasing reconstruction grants.</P>
    <P>Very often, particularly in recent years, we find delays in the payment of grants because of what I would term very minor defects in the work. Say, for instance, an inspector calls at a house and finds a broken windowpane or broken glass in the door or an unpainted door.  He is not prepared to pass that house for a grant.  He leaves that house without making any comment to the applicant.  He reports back to the Department that the work has not been completed and mentions some of the defects that would have to be remedied before the house would qualify for a grant.</P>
    <P>I do not think it fair that this delay should be caused by a very minor defect. The inspector could conscientiously pass that house for a grant instead of imposing delays of from two months to three months while he reports to the Department and while the file passes along the line back to the inspector who ultimately has to go out again to the house and pass it for a grant.  One is inclined to ask if these delays are imposed deliberately because there is not the wherewithal to pay the grants.</P>
    <P>In Roscommon until quite recently, there was no money for supplementary grants.  During the past few weeks, we got an allocation to clear up some of the grants arrears but it is not sufficient to include applicants for supplementary grants.  The same applies in Leitrim where there is a waiting list of 300 to 400 people awaiting approval certificates under section 5 of the Housing Act.  Recently an applicant wrote to the Secretary of the Leitrim County Council stating that his house was very dangerous and asking if he could be given an allocation under section 5 of the Housing Act, adding that he was prepared to carry out the work.  The County secretary passed the file to the engineering staff who recommended <Col N="500" /> to the council that the house was dangerous.  The county secretary then wrote to the applicant as follows:</P>
    <P>From reports received from the county council's technical officers it has been ascertained that the house is in a dangerous condition.  Please arrange for immediate evacuation of the house and arrange to obtain accommodation elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I wonder is that a right thing for a housing authority to do.  Of course the reason for it is that the council have no money to allocate to such people. This man is married with five children. Where was he expected to find accommodation for himself and his family? The Minister and the Department will have to examine their consciences in this respect.  I have cited a particular case but there are many such cases in Leitrim and in other counties.</P>
    <P>A Parliamentary Question was asked today about loans.  A person in my constituency applied to the Leitrim County Council last July for a loan of £1,100.  He had the balance of the money necessary to build a new house. It amounted to about £1,000.  On 27th September last he got a letter from the Secretary of the County Council as follows:</P>
    <P>Your application for an advance of £1,100 has been provisionally approved by the county manager as being in order.  The advance may be paid after 31/3/67 as there is no money available in this year's allocation.</P>
    <P>Is there much point, therefore, in the Minister coming in here and telling us there is ample money available for loans when people who applied last July cannot get a loan and only may get it at the end of eight months?  If we are to make any impression on the housing problem in rural Ireland, we must first make money available. We all admit that a delay of eight months is a long one.</P>
    <P>There is also a problem in relation to group water schemes in Leitrim and Roscommon.  A number of groups have been formed.  They have collected the money and have taken the matter up with the Department but these schemes have gone dead slow.  Here again it is obvious that the delay is due to want <Col N="501" /> of money.  If the Minister is serious about getting on with the work of group water schemes, he must provide much more money.</P>
    <P>I should like now to deal with rates. Before the last general election, the Taoiseach said the present system was unjust and unfair and promised to do something about it.  Reading the speech at the time, one got the impression that the Taoiseach had not been the leader of a Government Party during 20 or 25 years beforehand, that he was about to enter government for the first time and that he would do something to give us a fairer rating system.  However, since the election, we have been able seriously to ask the Taoiseach and the Minister for Local Government what either of them has done in this matter of rates.  Everybody realises that the present system is unjust and unfair and it is not unreasonable to ask the Taoiseach and the Minister for Local Government to try to do something to remedy it.</P>
    <P>This year rates are a greater burden on farmers than ever before.  At this time in a normal year, it has been the practice for a farmer to drive out one beast, let it be a calf, a yearling or a two year old, to pay the first moiety of his rates.  If it was a calf in a normal year, this year he would have to drive out four or five calves to meet the increased rates because of the reduction in the price of cattle; if in a normal year the farmer drove out a two year old beast, this year he would have to drive out two or three to get enough money to pay higher rates.  I ask the Minister seriously where are the farmers to get the money to pay this year's rates demand. The price of everything the farmers sells has been reduced and the price of everything he buys has been increased. That can end in only the one way.</P>
    <P>There is also the problem of rates in towns.  Small business people living in towns get no rebate: they have to pay the full amount of the rates.  In the two counties I represent, the population is dwindling, which means that the small business people have fewer people to whom to sell their goods in a more competitive market.  The recent census figures show that the population of <Col N="502" /> County Roscommon has dropped by 3,087 or 5.2 per cent, and that of County Leitrim has dropped by 2,938 or .88 per cent.  With fewer people in these counties to buy goods, the net profit of the business people is reduced. It is a well-known fact that a number of these people are being squeezed out by big combines such as self-service stores.  Competition is much keener and profits are much smaller.  Small business people are finding it very hard to continue to meet the demands being made upon them through rates and otherwise.</P>
    <P>The Minister made reference in his speech to swimming pools.  There are towns in my constituency such as Boyle, Carrick-on-Shannon and Mohill where the people are most anxious to have swimming pools.  When money becomes available, I hope the Minister will make available to the respective local authorities funds for the erection of swimming pools in these towns.</P>
    <P>County Leitrim has a greater roads problem than any other county.  Barely 50 per cent of our public roads are black-topped.  The reason for that is easy to understand.  A penny in the £ in our county is equivalent to an income of £600 or £700 while in other counties such as Meath and Westmeath, a penny is equivalent to £3,000 or £4,000.  Leitrim has a large number of miles of road to maintain and, seeing that our percentage is so low, I would ask the Minister to make available more grants for road works in that county.</P>
    <P>We also have a problem in regard to accommodation roads.  A number of small farmers living on those roads are anxious to get the county council to take them over and maintain them. The county council is not anxious to take them over until they are put into a reasonable state of repair.  They were usually put into a state of repair by means of grants given by the Board of Works for minor relief schemes or rural improvement schemes.  Minor relief schemes have been abolished and there is a delay of anything up to two-and-a-half years on rural improvement schemes grants.  The Minister should make a special grant <Col N="503" /> towards those roads so that the council can take them over.</P>
    <P>One would think there should be much more money available for road grants this year than last year, due to the fact that the motor tax was increased by 25 per cent, but that 25 per cent has not been passed on to the roads.  The Minister should pass on that 25 per cent to the roads. Apart from that increase, there has also been a substantial increase in the petrol tax.  There is no point in the Minister telling us&mdash;as he does in regard to housing&mdash;that he is giving us the same amount of money this year as last year for roads in County Roscommon and County Leitrim, because we have higher commitments. Wages and materials have increased substantially.  Therefore we are entitled to a much higher grant than last year.</P>
    <P>One often asks oneself whether county engineers throughout the country are competing with one another as to who will have the most modern machinery on the roads.  Up to a few years ago the income of a number of small farmers in Roscommon and Leitrim was supplemented by road works, but that work is no longer available.  All the money is being spent on trucks, bulldozers and other elaborate machinery.  The small farmer is having a rough enough voyage without taking from him the income he derived from this employment.</P>
    <P>During the term of office of the inter-Party Government, we introduced what was known as the LAW scheme, which the present Government abolished when they came back to power.  That scheme served a number of very useful purposes.  It was used for minor drainage and also gave employment to small farmers who needed it.  I would appeal to the Minister to restore the Local Authorities (Works) Act Schemes so that, as well as giving employment to these people, we shall be able to get some rivers cleaned that are very badly in need of cleaning.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the introduction of speed limits in 1963 must have contributed substantially to reducing <Col N="504" /> road accidents.  I could not agree more with the Minister on that.  In my constituency there are a number of small villages with no speed limits.  I know how interested the Minister is in trying to keep down the number of road accidents and I would ask him to have speed limit signs erected at every village in the country in order to protect children living there.</P>
    <P>In regard to planning, one is inclined to think the Planning Act is a bit of a joke.  In a small town in my constituency, a man made application to the planning authority for permission to erect a piggery in the centre of the town.  Permission was refused. The applicant went to the county council office and discussed the matter with the county secretary or county manager who told him that under no circumstances would they be prepared to give him permission to erect a piggery in the town.  The man was quite satisfied not to cause any odour in the town and he erected a piggery on his farmland one mile outside the town.  Some time afterwards his next door neighbour applied to the same planning authority for permission to erect a piggery and again permission was refused.  He informed them that he would appeal to the Minister.  On appeal to the Minister, he succeeded in getting permission.</P>
    <P>If that is the type of planning we are talking about, both the Minister and the Department of Local Government should have their heads examined. It means that since planning was introduced a piggery has been erected in the centre of a town with a population of about 800.  That is a despicable situation.  The local authority did their job but the applicant in question had sufficient political pull to be able to succeed on appeal to the Minister. I do not think it is fair.  If any other such cases come to the Department I would appeal to the officials and to the Minister, in the interests of the community, to reject them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry that my gracious colleague, Deputy Burke, is not in the House because I want to refer to a matter in which he could be said to have as vital an interest <Col N="505" /> as I have.  I have here volume 109 of the Dáil Debates and want to refer to a Parliamentary Question reported at column 299.  The question is under the heading North Dublin Water Supply.  I quote:</P>
      <P>Mr. P.J. Burke asked the Minister for Local Government when the proposed new water scheme for North County Dublin will come into operation; and also, how negotiations between the Dublin County Commissioner and Dublin Corporation have advanced in this urgent matter.</P>
      <P>The reply was made by the incumbent of the day, Deputy MacEntee, as follows:</P>
      <P>Agreement has been reached between the Dublin County Commissioner and the corporation in regard to the terms on which water will be made available for the North County Dublin Regional Scheme. The technical details of the scheme are in course of preparation.</P>
      <P>The date of that question was 3rd December, 1947, a day less than two months short of 19 golden years ago. As we discuss here today the Estimate for the Department of Local Government, there has not yet filtered through the North County Dublin scheme as much as a pint of water for the people of the area.  Everybody knows that the area in question is on the very fringe of the capital and is populated by the most industrious agricultural community in this most industrious, productive, successful and least complaining agricultural community in these islands and by many thousands of workers who have to travel to the city for work or who find employment in places like Balbriggan, Swords or other towns or villages throughout Fingal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is 19 years since that announcement was made in this House by the illustrious predecessor of the Minister, Deputy MacEntee, who is now operating at a much higher level in the sphere of power politics in a distant quarter of the globe but who, at that time, was devoting his great talents to the service of the people of the country in what might be described as a <Col N="506" /> more provincial sense.  Nineteen years after his declaration of the immediacy and urgency of this water and sewerage scheme for North County Dublin, we are still without sight or sign of it.</P>
    <P>I have taken the opportunity on previous occasions, most recently on the occasion of the Adjournment of the Dáil for the Summer Recess, to refer briefly to one or two projects undertaken by other countries of a magnitude that surpasses anything we might envisage and which were brought from conception to completion within a fraction of the time that it has taken to get the North County Dublin scheme, as it were, on the tapes.</P>
    <P>I do not like to be repetitious but I think it is worth mentioning again, because the Minister for Local Government was not in the House when I adverted to it on a previous occasion, that I was present at the Spa Hotel in Lucan on a pleasant and convivial occasion of an official opening. Official functions are peculiarly Irish functions which proliferate throughout the country, especially under the sponsorship of the present Administration.  Official openings have become part and parcel of the daily scene.  If it is not a petrol pump, it is something approximating thereto.  On the occasion to which I refer there was a grand repast which we all enjoyed. The Minister was present.  Impressive speeches were made as to the great benefits that would be bestowed upon the people of North County Dublin by the regional water scheme which, at long last, was then about to become a reality and to be taken from the planning board into the field and into the highways and by-ways of rural North County Dublin, to bring the very simple but absolutelely essential blessings of water and sewerage to the population of that area.</P>
    <P>That function was held at least five years ago.  I am not clear as to the date.  There was a very happy atmosphere, a forward-looking atmosphere. One might almost describe it as a kind of Second Programme atmosphere: everything was to be all right in the sweet bye-and-bye.  To mark the occasion, the people charged with the responsibility of bringing the pipeline <Col N="507" /> across the North County, in a very nice gesture, presented the Minister with a little piece of Georgian silver which, no doubt, reflects the Donegal firelight in the evening and must remind the Minister of the great time we all had.</P>
    <P>But where is the North County Dublin regional water scheme now? What has happened to it?  Supposing I put down a question for next week and ask when will water be provided in the villages of Oldtown, Garristown, The Naul, Ballyboughal, St. Margaret's and Donabate, from which originally hailed that great ornament of this House &mdash; I say it in no sense except a sincere sense&mdash;my gracious colleague, Deputy Burke.  If I were to ask when water will be provided for Donabate, I would be referred without hesitation by the Minister to the fact that water and sewerage services will be provided in these places, when comes the North County Dublin regional water scheme. Children have been born, grown to manhood, emigrated, married, had a family and come back home again since first we were assured by Deputy MacEntee of the urgency and imminence of the North County Dublin scheme.  I have serious doubts that any of us now alive will see the completion of this scheme.</P>
    <P>Of course, it has a certain utilitarian value, if you forgive the expression, at election time for Government spokesmen who come out to help, as if it were necessary to do so, Deputy Burke to get returned at the head of the poll as he usually does.  They give him some data on the North County Dublin scheme.  The people are told that this is the Fianna Fáil policy.  The suggestion is, just as in the case of the Shannon&mdash;remember the by-election&mdash; that if you do not vote for the Fianna Fáil candidate, you will not get the water tomorrow.  The inference is that if you do vote for him, water and sewerage services will be immediately provided the day after the election, before the boxes are opened in fact. That is the value it has, but no other value.</P>

      <P>Except in the rather resigned, sad and melancholic way I refer to my youth, because that is when I heard about it first.  One does not like to discomfit so kindly a colleague as Deputy Burke.  Therefore, I leave it to him.  But he is not a bit above dragging it out of the cupboard when it suits himself.  However, this scheme, which was to open up the north county from the point of view of the provision of fundamental amenities like water and sewerage, seems to be as far away as it was 19 years ago.  A beginning was made.  Pipes were laid somewhere in the Blanchardstown area, but there it stopped.  The people in the rural areas of North County Dublin have been living in hopes that they will see the water scheme arrive and that this in turn will enable them instal the simple amenity of water and sewerage in their homes and enable people who want houses to build houses themselves. One cannot get permission to erect a house in County Dublin unless there is a water supply.</P>
      <P>The county council have been requested time out of number to build houses in groups or singly.  They have been requested by farmers wanting to make sites available to house their workers.  They have been requested by county council vested cottage tenants who are willing to make sites available on their cottage plots so that cottages may be built for the married children who are living on their own floor in terrible conditions of overcrowding. Invariably these people are told the county council cannot build for them, even in these nominee sites, because of the absence of water and sewerage services.  One is told the provision of water and sewerage services is dependent upon the arrival of this fairy tale, this legend, called the North County Dublin water scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While this may at times tickle the fancy of people who do not come into contact with the immediate problem, there is nothing as frustrating for those of us of that denigrated class called professional politicians, of which I am <Col N="509" /> proud to be one, who spend all their time&mdash;not just an afternoon or a morning but every waking hour&mdash;trying to help our people&mdash;there is nothing more frustrating to us than to have to try to explain to a family living in a grossly-overcrowded county council cottage. You often find from ten to 15 people living in three small rooms, often in cottages which were built where houses should never have been constructed.  In some instances cottages were built on land seized from farmers in the 30s for non-payment of rates.</P>
    <P>In many instances these are cottages which were built in the old days of corruption&mdash;and there was corruption &mdash;cottages which were built on bogs, on sea sand, built of inferior material, small, little boxes, cabins, botháns, little better than the Parnell cottages of the 80s.  You would often see a dozen people forced to live in such places in North County Dublin&mdash;not at the far end of Ireland but on the fringe of this great capital city&mdash;and indeed in South County Dublin and out in the west of the county, too.  There is nothing as frustrating for us, and how much more is it for the subtenant family living on the mother-in-law's floor?  There you have the very quintessence of anguish and suffering, where you have two families living close together.  You have the unnatural division of one house between two families&mdash;between the two women, to put it bluntly.  You have the clash of personalities, the continual minute-by-minute clash of nerves on top of nerves.  Any of us who have occasion to meet the people know that this is the really big problem related to overcrowded housing conditions today.</P>
    <P>We have that in abundance in North County Dublin and all over the country as well.  It is nowhere in such proportions as it exists in the county of Dublin because it would seem that there is a mass evacuation of rural Ireland in progress and that everybody leaving rural Ireland wants to get employment and to settle down either in Dublin city or county.  That is a separate matter.  I suppose, but it certainly affects the situation in my constituency and exacerbates an already intolerable housing situation.  I have <Col N="510" /> already described the intolerable overcrowding, the clash between the people living in the house, the psychological difficulties deriving from it and the unhygienic nature of it.</P>
    <P>In spite of the fact that the purchasing tenant of such a cottage is willing to make part of his garden available to Dublin County Council for the building of a cottage in order that the family living with him may be housed, the county council will say that they are in favour of it in principle but that there must be water and sewerage services. The innocent citizen who is not familiar with the intricacies of planning, and so on, immediately assumes that he can have a septic tank, as was done by other people in other years, and carry on in that fashion until at some time or another a piped water supply will be available in the area. Do you think that the county council or the Minister will agree?  Not on your life.  There will be no sanction for the building of a cottage unless water and sewerage services are made available for such a cottage.</P>
    <P>I have several instances of such sites being turned down by the Department. I have instances of families who had hoped to be housed in this manner.  I have instances of young people getting married and living with their in-laws and beginning families on the general assumption that they would be housed in this manner and that a cottage would be built for them on a site provided by their father or mother, as the case might be.  Such people have been forced, in desperation, to clear out of the country and to go to England.</P>
    <P>As recently as last night, I was talking to people in North County Dublin on that very subject.  One man will tell you that he has a well-paid job and is living in the neighbourhood of Swords but that he has no prospects of getting a house.  His father-in-law offered a site to the county council but he was told it could not be built upon because of lack of services. What is his alternative?  He points out that he can get a house in England and that a friend of his went to England a few short years ago and now has a council house or a council flat.  The man will remind me that he <Col N="511" /> has a trade, the same as the man who emigrated, and he asks what incentive he has to stay here.  That is the kind of reaction one is getting and how is one to blame them for going?  The Department of Local Government have been in a deep stupor for several years in so far as the North County Dublin water scheme is concerned and I would say that that stupor and somenolence are shared to a great extent by the local authority in County Dublin.</P>
    <P>This bottleneck of housing did not arise through any set of natural circumstances. In a well-planned society, there should never be the situation we now have of up to eight families looking for every house that is built. This Government have talked enough about plans and about the First and Second Programmes and all this balderdash and nonsense which means nothing, as I have said here many times, and which has been shown to mean nothing.  That is especially true of the farmers and the recent experiences in regard to the Free Trade Agreement: the empty boastings and all the sound and fury, signifying nothing.  Emigration goes on, the cost of living goes up, and the people find it harder and harder to live.  Businesses are going out of operation and a general air of depression is setting in.</P>
    <P>In a well-ordered society, there should never be a housing shortage: there should never be a bottleneck. That situation was presented to the Minister in 1957, when, after an election which was unique for its vilification and its downright lying propaganda, the Fianna Fáil Minister who came into power at the time found a situation in Dublin where there were more houses than people looking for them.  I know that, at the first opportunity, the Parliamentary Secretary will say that that was because everybody had emigrated but such was not the case.  To some extent, there was possibly an element of that in it but the main reason was that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We had a Labour man in the Custom House for three years out of the 19 years I am talking about &mdash; 19 years since the regional water supply scheme was first mentioned. I shall not give a rehash of the history of the country: I am sure the Chair would not wish me to do so and I am at all times anxious to how to the Chair's wishes.  However, let me refer to this.  I was here in 1948 and, in 1948, there had not been a cottage built in County Dublin for 12 years.  The war was blamed, of course: the shortage of cement, and so on.  In 1948, the estimated need was 30,000 houses in Dublin city&mdash;not 10,000.  That was the need that was stated by the then Director of Housing who later became City Manager and an eminent public servant who has now gone from service. The man who set a great example was Mr. O'Mahony.  After a close examination of the situation in Dublin city, the need was estimated at 30,000 houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We were lucky to have in the Custom House at that time a Labour man who has often been referred to here in glowing terms, a modest man but, as we all know, a man dedicated to the solution of the many problems that beset working people in Ireland. He set his hand primarily to solving the housing problem.  It will be remembered that when he died he died on a public platform; he died in the front line, as it were, just as surely as any soldier in battle.  He died on a platform in Fermoy in Cork and, at the <Col N="513" /> very moment of his death, he was talking about housing.  He had what might be described as a fanatical zeal to bring the age-old housing problem to an end.  In Dublin, he certainly achieved that, because, from 1948 until the disastrous advent of the Minister for Local Government under Fianna Fáil in 1957, something like 25,000 dwellings were built in Dublin city.  That was a record never before achieved.</P>

The situation was as I have painted it and Deputy Tim Murphy was the main reason why that situation existed because he brought, as I say, this tremendous effort to the job. If one has not got that kind of energy and zeal, if the Minister is there in the Custom House simply to kill time, that may be all right for him but it is not all right for the people.  In the past ten years, there has been plenty of evidence that inhabitants of the Ministerial chair in the Custom House, while they did not lack many things, certainly lacked the idealistic drive and vision essential to solving the housing problem.  There were things they did not lack.</P>

While the Parliamentary Secretary makes notes of what I am saying in relation to the number of houses built, will he also make a note of the North County Dublin regional water scheme and ask his Minister, when he comes to reply, to tell us when will my constituents in St. Margaret's, in Rolestown, in Ballyboughal, in Oldtown, Garristown, The Naul, Lusk, Donabate and Lough-shinny, who want to avail of water and sewerage in existing houses or in new houses, find themselves in the position of having this water and sewerage scheme reach them?  We have had 19 years of promises.  The proof is in that book.  That was the only one I could find in a hurry.  It was 19 years ago that my esteemed colleague, Deputy P. J. Burke, was assured by the Minister that the North County Dublin scheme was on its way and there need be no more worry.</P>

      <P>We all need protection. I want to talk now about Ballymun. The houses in Ballymun, of course, began to arrive 12 months after we were told they would arrive. They were 12 months late.  I read somewhere that Deputy Moore had stated that members of every party were praising the Ballymun scheme, including members of the Labour Party.  Here is one member of the Labour Party who is not praising the Ballymun scheme.  It would be impossible, of course, to allocate 200 houses in Ballymun without some of my constituents being provided with houses there.  One tenant went to put up a coathanger; he told me that when he went to screw the hanger to the wall, the hanger, screwdriver and screw went through.  In a very short time it may well be that the maintenance of Ballymun will be yet another problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was a little alarmed, when I dropped into the Ballymun lounge in the Gresham, to discover that we will have blocks of flats 15 storeys high. That worries me.  I know that any condition would be better than the condition in which many people are today, but it worries me that we should have these very high blocks of flats so close to Dublin Airport.  Last week, I put down a question to the Minister for Transport and Power.  Unfortunately I could not be here to hear his reply.  However, I have since read the answer and, showing typical evidence, the kind of evidence that he alone can show, of having his finger on the pulse of the Irish people, he assured me that he was satisfied there was no danger to aircraft from the presence of these multi-storeyed blocks.  I am not so concerned <Col N="516" /> about that aspect of it as I am about the possible danger to the people who live in the flats.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister in his own interests, and in the interests of the people who are going to live in these flats, when eventually they become ready for allocation, to consult with Aer Lingus in order to satisfy himself on behalf of everybody concerned that the aircraft approach routes to Dublin Airport will be so set as to avoid passing over the Ballymun scheme.  This should not be a difficult arrangement to make but it is as well to talk about it and to think about it now.  With air traffic happily increasing to the extent that it is increasing in this country, and at Dublin Airport, precautions are indicated and this is one simple one which I suggest to the Minister.</P>
    <P>Similarly, when I say I am not at all happy about the Ballymun scheme &mdash;I am not a member of the local authority and of course the houses were built by the National Building Agency&mdash;it surprises me that so few houses were in fact planned for and that the emphasis has been preponderantly on the provision of flats. This is the kind of thing with which I would disagree because it seems to me that if you are going to build houses, the suburban areas are the logical places in which to build them, but flats are more or less an urban feature.  The building of multi-storey flats has indeed become a feature of post-war building throughout Europe and many of us have had the opportunity of observing this.  There is something to my mind which is not in accord with the concept of good planning in having multi-storey blocks of flats standing up out of the green countryside in what is still a semi-rural area, Ballymun.</P>
    <P>I come now to a very important matter in which the Minister has a very considerable function, that is, the question of the rents of Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council houses.  Again, last week I tabled a question to the Minister asking him that if proposals were brought before him from the Dublin City Manager for rent increases, the Minister should <Col N="517" /> not sanction such proposals if for no other reason than that rent increases upon tenants of corporation houses would, and must, inevitably, have an inflationary effect.  Recently I circulated to members of this House a document setting out the ordinary day-to-day costs of living of a Dublin family occupying a corporation dwelling, paying a differential rent and earning an average wage in the city.  I detailed the various amounts which would have to be met out of the family budget each week.  I cannot call to mind the various details I outlined but I demonstrated to all reasonable people that the average worker in this city, earning an average week's wages, living in an average corporation house, and with an average-sized family, is living in debt.  Without indulging himself to the slightest degree, he is living in debt.  This, I think, is true of a very large section of the people to whom I refer.  Perhaps it is not very easily discernible and its impact is very often not such that it makes for hardship, but nonetheless it is there and it is the kind of debt that may easily emerge from the undergrowth and deal the person concerned an economic deathblow when it is least expected.</P>
    <P>All hire purchase is a form of debt and a form of moneylending at inflated rates of interest, and this comes into it, and therefore any proposal to increase the differential rents of Dublin Corporation or Dublin County Council houses is going to add to the problem of the kind of family to which I refer, the average Dublin workingclass family in a corporation or county council house and subject to the differential rents schemes.  I know the device that has been used to justify proposed increases in the maximum differentials, that there are families with up to £40 and £50 a week going into the houses. This is the kind of argument we get to justify a proposed substantial increase in rent.  When I say &ldquo;substantial&rdquo; what I mean is this: At the moment the maximum differential rent in, say, Ballyfermot is 40s 9d&mdash;say 41/-.  If the proposals of the City Manager were to be implemented, then <Col N="518" /> in no case does it appear to me will the increase be less than an average of 15/-a week.  In a handful of exceptional cases, where there are a large number of small children, there will be fractional reductions, and in a handful of exceptional cases&mdash;the cases referred to, to bolster up the argument for increased rent, that there is £40 or £50 a week going into some houses&mdash;there will be increases to the proposed maximum of £4 10s a week.  Remember that these proposed increases are on a background of purely rented houses, that the people paying the increased rents will not have any rights of ownership whatsoever.  They are purely tenants at will of the corporation.</P>
    <P>An interesting thing about the tenancy of Dublin Corporation houses &mdash;I do not know if this applies anywhere else in the country&mdash;is that the tenants of the corporation are tenants at will of the corporation.  The Corporation of Dublin may bring a tenant into court and evict him or her from the house without giving any reason whatsoever, without having to advance any reason such as the non-payment of rent, and the court must, under the law, give a decree for possession against such a tenant.  Of course, this is never implemented and there may be good reasons of public interest why that proviso should be there.  You might have tenants against whom offences might be brought and proved.  I mention that merely to show the kind of rightless, if that is the correct word, tenancy which is accorded in Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council houses.  They have no rights of purchase whatsoever.</P>
    <P>There is a handful of families with very high incomes who are made the excuse for increasing the rents of everybody in the schemes.  This proposal of the Minister will certainly be resisted by me and by the people concerned with every legal means in our power.  If there are cases of people who earn extraordinary high gross family amounts in terms of wages and salaries, it is necessary to look at such cases in more detail and with more understanding than has apparently been brought to bear by the Minister <Col N="519" /> in his consideration of the case.</P>
    <P>Take the average family.  If the family income is £40 or £50 per week, that must mean that the head of the household, the father, is earning a week's wages.  It must also mean that several of the children are earning a week's wages and that they are adults earning an adult's weeks wages.  Those children are not ciphers.  They are ordinary people who have plans to get married, perhaps to buy houses.  I do not know how they could do so in the present market.  That is beyond my imagination.</P>
    <P>You are speaking rot when you say that such family incomes go into corporation houses.  The total family may be earning such a gross figure but it is unrealistic to suggest that all the wages or salaries of all the members of the family are pooled together on the table as perhaps was done long ago.  In fact, such was necessary then because the few shillings had to be pooled and divided out and there was nothing much left when the necessaries of life had been paid for.</P>
    <P>The facts of modern life are such that the incomes of young adult people are their own responsibility. They are saving money to get married. In fact, however much they might wish to do so, it cannot be thought that they hand up their entire wages for redistribution. They make arrangements for living their own lives, for getting married, and so on.  Everybody knows how expensive it is for an adult girl, who is perhaps engaged, or may hope to become engaged, to live in the ordinary way and to be as good as anybody else, to go to entertainments and so on, to take part in the social life and to escape from the undesirable state of spinsterhood.</P>
    <P>We must, when we think in terms of those alleged high family incomes, take those facts into account.  That is why I say to the Minister, if proposals are put to him as apparently they are in the process of being put to him, and apparently he is encouraging it throughout the country, for very substantial increases in house rents, he should make his decision in no superficial <Col N="520" /> way.  He should go very deeply into all the social connotations of any such proposals.  The prime argument I make is that if you advance those rents to the average Dublin workingclass family, you will increase the cost of living, increase the urge for more wage demands and thereby create still further inflation which will devalue money and add to the already impossible economic confusion there is abroad as a result of the malfeasance of this Government.</P>
    <P>Words fail me to express fully my feelings on this question of rents.  I want to be most emphatic in saying that this is no light matter.  It sometimes seems to me, as I have said before, that the Department of Local Government in the Custom House have still got an oriental point of view from the time the State was first founded.  I do not like to say that there is prejudice against Dublin in the Custom House but sometimes I suspect there is.  That is because all the people who have control there&mdash; all worthy men, let me say, but even the most worthy of us have our prejudices, dislikes and irrational ideas at times&mdash;who have their hand on the helm in the Custom House, for very many years have been dominated by their consideration of the interests of the rural areas, possibly because most of them sprang, if that is the word, from the rural areas.  I do not blame them for springing from some of the rural areas with all the alacrity possible.  Whatever it is, they have not a proper appreciation of the Dublin problem.  It is unfair to the former constituents of the Minister and of the Parliamentary Secretary that this is so, because Dublin received them all with open arms.  They provided for them and still have to provide for them. Dublin receives the surplus of all the counties.  They provide jobs for them and in the heel of the hunt, they are abused by them.</P>
    <P>This is the situation.  There is a prejudice against the interests of Dublin city.  It may very well be one of the causes deep in the Minister's mind for his attitude to the question of rents. There is no local authority in the <Col N="521" /> country which has anything approaching the problem with regard to housing or rents which the capital city has, in terms of volume and diversity.  No local authority has applied the differential rent scheme from as early a date as have Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council.  Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council have developed substantial departments which deal with this renting system.</P>
    <P>It is very easy for people who are not in full contact with the workings of the differential system and with the problems which arise therefrom to say: &ldquo;We must increase all these rents because there are families there who are getting away with murder in that they are not paying sufficient rent.  It is not good enough; the ratepayers are subsidising them.&rdquo;  What is always forgotten is that corporation tenants are paying rates, too.  Corporation and county council tenants are ratepayers, too.  It would be interesting to find out, in fact, how much they contribute in terms of rates to the city revenue as against other sectors of the population who complain most loudly against them.</P>
    <P>On this question of rates, I had thought there was abroad in this country some years ago, and indeed mentioned by Fianna Fáil people, a rumour that our present rating system, our system of levying rates, would be re-examined, with a view to easing the burden of those who are suffering under it.  Let me, when saying this, say that I am fully conscious of the fact that there are people moaning and groaning about rates who if there were any revision, if justice were applied, would find themselves paying much more than they are in fact paying.  They do not live in Dublin or in the suburbs of Dublin.  The people who suffer most under our present rating system fall within that section of our population represented by young couples, who save up at the cost of considerable deprivation and hardship, who have been saving up very large sums which they must now find to make a deposit on a house, and who go through and have gone through many years of sacrificing the ordinary luxuries of life to meet outgoings on houses they bought <Col N="522" /> under Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act loans or loans from building societies.</P>
    <P>This section of the people, and mind you, they are very numerous and have grown in numbers since the war&mdash;in fact it can be said they are a post-war phenomenon because before the war such people did not exist to a great extent and certainly not to the great extent to which they exist now&mdash;are to be found in the suburbs of Dublin. They make the best citizens.  They are the people more than any farmers or anybody else in Ireland who suffer most because of our rating system. They become liable to pay maximum rates after ten years of occupation, at a time when families become most expensive. At the moment of time when a family is most expensive in terms of payment for education, such people become liable for full rates.  The remission of rates, as everybody knows, is one-tenth per year up to ten years, after which the full amount falls to be paid.  This is particularly a time when expenses bear most heavily upon them.</P>
    <P>I had thought something was going to be done about the rating system. My view is that of all the legacies which the hated Saxon left us, the system of rating valuation must surely appear as one of the most unjust.  Yet, it has not been tampered with or reviewed and there are people paying rates on valuations made over 100 years ago.  I wonder what sort of valuations would be made in respect of such land now?  The people living in Walkinstown in purchased houses or in any part of suburbia north or south of the city&mdash;Palmerstown, for instance &mdash;are not paying rates on valuations made 100 or 50 years ago.  They are paying rates on valuations made since the war.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I was under the impression that there might be a direct link between the Department of Local <Col N="523" /> Government and the Commissioners of Valuation but I will content myself for the nonce with asking the Parliamentary Secretary to think about this because if he does not, the next Government will have to do so.  I think it behoves the present Administration to leave the road as clear as they can for those coming after them.</P>
      <P>The question of itinerants is a thorny one and one avoided by many. I suppose if I had any political sense, which I have not, I would avoid it too. However, I wish to say a word about it.  The itinerant problem has been crystallised in Ballyfermot, in Cherry Orchard, over the years.  There has been a great deal of publicity focussed upon Cherry Orchard encampment and the plight of the people there.  We have had philanthropists from other countries coming here and adopting aristocratic Irish names in the pursuit of justice for the downtrodden unfortunate tinkers.  I remember on one occasion some of our home-made philosophers going up there, stepping out of their limousines and making what can only be described as Robert Emmet speeches about the injustices being inflicted upon this meek and humble community, getting back into their limousines and driving to other parts of the suburbs where the sound of the itinerant is never heard and where there is no danger whatsoever that you will wake up in the morning to see a caravan outside your bedroom window and an imperious knock on the door and a demand for help.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had all sorts of meddling with the problem of itinerancy.  I notice again the Custom House attitude to Dublin; we are all concerned about it.  None of us politicians and members of county councils ever lose an opportunity of saying how we cling we love the tinkers and how we cling to the ideal of freedom for them and how entitled they are to be treated the same as everybody else.  But what I know is this; we would rather they were treated the same as anybody else somewhere else, as far away as possible from where we are living, from our county.  The result, of course, is that Dublin county is the reception <Col N="524" /> spot for the itinerants, or, as we know them, the tinkers.  There is nothing wrong with that description and I am sure they would hardly object to it.  Up to recently if you called them itinerants, you would be quite likely to get your answer.</P>
    <P>However, the answer to this problem does not lie at all in what has been suggested, that they should be concentrated in encampments.  That is impracticable and socially undesirable.  I was very impressed by a proposal put forward by the Clondalkin Muintir na Tíre Guild which showed that they had been thinking about this thing and, mind you, there were no tinkers in Clondalkin at the time.  I do not know whether there are any there now. They had been thinking about this problem: what is to be done about these people?  How best are they to be absorbed into the community?  How can it be done without friction and with the least possible difficulty?  They came up with the idea which, to my mind, is a perfectly sound one and the best one yet, that is, that each parish should agree to sponsor two itinerant families.</P>
    <P>Each parish in Ireland should face up to that.  It is not asking a whole lot.  It is asking, of course, that instead of pushing the problem away somewhere else out of sight, we would say, as the Clondalkin people said: &ldquo;We are willing to do it; we are willing to agree to sponsor two families; we are willing to have accommodation made available for them, to transfer them into houses and we are willing to help in any way we can&rdquo;.  But, as far as I can gather, the Minister's mind is bent upon concentrating the tinkers together in enactments.  This is something which it is difficult to get people to accept.  Suppose there are farmers around there; Suppose there are are people living in ordinary houses. Is it not a fact that they are subject to a great deal of persecution of one kind or another from the tinkers because of their whole history, because of their customs and because of the way they live?</P>
    <P>While saying this, let me say also that I have never in the course of many years' weekly visits to Ballyfermot&mdash;where <Col N="525" /> these tinkers concentrate&mdash;heard the ordinary working people of Dublin say one word against them, although they invade the streets, beg and so on.  I have never heard the ordinary people, who are nearest to them, complain because, possible, that is the nature of the people.</P>
    <P>I am talking about the social problem, how to eliminate this idea of the travelling people at all.  How can they be brought into communities in a friendly and hospitable way and in a way which will have lasting beneficial effects?  In my view the answer has been put forward by the Clondalkin Guild of Muintir na Tíre&mdash;that every parish should adopt two families, look after them, see that the children are sent to school and do everything possible to bring them into the comity of Irish life.  Nothing else will work, in my view, because, if the Minister insists upon pushing the policy of large-scale encampments, it will be many years before what one could only describe as being what one could only describe as ghettoes, and we do not want ghettoes in Ireland.  We have read and heard too much of the people who suffered in other lands, in reservations in America and in ghettoes in Europe.</P>
    <P>We do not want to separate people one from another; neither do we want to be unfair to established communities. There are different patterns of life as between the tinkers and an established community.  There is a gulf there which must be bridged and bridged gradually. It will not be done overnight but it can be done in the manner put forward by Clondalkin Muintir na Tíre who came together voluntarily, discussed this and thought it out for themselves.  It is very laudable, should be promoted and should be agreed by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the scandalous maladministration of Dublin County Council in the simple matter of answering letters.  I want the Minister to take a special note of this.  One of the first acts performed by the first Minister for Local Government of the inter-Party regime was to instruct his civil servants&mdash;and if I do not make a mistake, county managers&mdash;that when replying to public representatives, whether Senators, TDs or members of <Col N="526" /> local authorities, they write a letter of such a nature as covered the points upon which the public representatives had written, to the utmost ability of the Department or of the county council concerned, that the letter should be courteous and of such a nature that the public representatives could send it to the constituent who had appealed to him in the first instance.</P>
    <P>I have been persecuted, and I am sure others too&mdash;members of Dublin County Council&mdash;have been persecuted but I doubt that they will say so.  I am not a member of the county council but I have been persecuted with this type of postcard.  I wrote a letter about the necessity for a sewer extension at The Green, Swords.  What did I get? A printed acknowledgement, filled in more often than not with a frail biro on its way out.  These are just a few examples.  I wrote to the council about the necessity for repairs at a pedestrian crossing at Upper Main Street, Swords and got another scanty reply&mdash;different colours perhaps but the same thing.  If one were to send these along to the constituents who complained in the first instance, they would feel insulted.</P>
    <P>They say: &ldquo;I have raised this matter time out of number with the former Dublin County Manager and with the present one&rdquo;.  The answer is: &ldquo;Oh, that is only an acknowledgement pending the answer; it is only a receipt for your letter&rdquo;.  It seems to be impossible for them to type and sign a little letter saying: &ldquo;We have your letter in reference to the case of Mr. Patrick Murphy in which you request sewerage services&rdquo;... or whatever it is.  That seems to be too much of a strain on the vast bureaucracy being built up at Nos. 11 and 6 Parnell Square.  I feel that the least that is owed to struggling public representatives is the civility of a letter which could be sent to his constituents.  Last year I had the experience of writing to Dublin County Council on an urgent matter and of getting one of these in reply.  I got the reply seven months later.</P>
    <P>This is not unique.  It is commonplace, and I am making this public complaint here and now about the manner in which Dublin County Council and the Manager of Dublin <Col N="527" /> County Council are replying to me.  I have sent back these things time out of number to the Secretary.  I have asked them to send me a decent reply but to no avail.  This is happening, and it has been going on for years.  I have fears of an injustice being done to the people who have asked me on many occasions to make representations on their behalf, and on whose behalf I have made representations, but to whom I have yet been unable to prove that I have made these representations by the production of a simple letter from the Manager.  This is something of which practically all members of the county council are aware.</P>
    <P>Some of them may perhaps be treated better than others&mdash;I do not know&mdash;but some are not.  I certainly am not and I will not stand for it. I will not stand for this treatment from any public official.  We are sent to this House charged with the responsibility of looking after the interests of our people, but we are hamstrung in this way.  Others may take it but I will not.  If necessary, I will bring this matter up time and time again until it is remedied, and if the ordinary canons of courtesy do not operate automatically, they will be made to operate.</P>
    <P>I understand that road safety was dealt with to some extent by the Minister, and that there have been references in the debate to the need for speed limits on a much wider scale than exists at present.  That is so.  I should like to know from the Minister why there is this delay.  There have been many requests for speed limits in County Dublin.  My constituency of County Dublin is perhaps most in need of speed limits.  We get a tremendous volume of traffic from all parts of the country.  We have motorists from every part of Ireland using our roads which we must maintain at our own expense without making any charge upon motorists from the rest of Ireland.</P>
    <P>I should like to press upon the Minister the need for the establishment of speed limits on a far wider scale. In particular, I refer to the need for <Col N="528" /> a speed limit at The Green at Commons East, at the approach road from Feltrim Hill to Swords.  The residents there were so concerned that they put up their own speed limit, a &ldquo;Go slow&rdquo; sign, but they were compelled to take it down because there was a suggestion that in the case of an accident or anything of that nature the residents might be deemed to be liable because of their action. So great was the demand for a speed limit there that they felt they had to do that to protect themselves and their families.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister and most other people here have gone through the town of Swords on various occasions. To cross the main street of Swords at any hour, even during midwinter, is a hazardous adventure, and for those of us who are getting a bit slow in our reflexes, it is more than hazardous.  The proposal I put before the Minister by way of question some time ago&mdash;and I think to the county council as well&mdash;that there should be traffic lights in Swords, certainly at the junction of the Main Street and the Malahide Road, should be sympathetically examined.  At any rate, something should be done there in the summer time because it is quite impossible to cross that road during the good months.  As everyone knows, it is the main north road.  It is an unfortunate fact that one seldom picks up a paper after a week-end without reading of some accident in the Swords neighbourhood, particularly at Lissenhall Street which has been deadly and where many accidents have occurred for years.</P>
    <P>Road safety is a vital matter for County Dublin but speed limits are not the answer to all the hazards. There is also the question of careless driving.  A person can drive carelessly at less than 30 miles an hour as well as at 60 miles an hour.  I have seen people driving carelessly and I have wondered how they are let out on the roads.  The attention of the Garda might well be directed to careless driving.  By careless driving even at a slow rate, I mean shifting from one traffic lane to another without warning, <Col N="529" /> cutting in, cars and other vehicular traffic travelling in the outside lane at a rate which enrages the traffic behind which wants to go faster on the open road.  All those things can be described as careless driving and they should be looked at by the Minister. The regulations in respect of careless driving as well as dangerous driving should be tightened up.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested to me that in the case of persons who have to go to distant parts of the country, people who live in Dublin but have to travel on business, and who may be apprehended by the Garda and be deemed to have broken the speed limit, there may be a danger of an injustice being done.  At the moment such persons are summoned to appear at a district court.  They have to travel from Dublin and they lose time which they would otherwise devote to their business. They may have to travel to a remote rural area, perhaps 150 or 200 miles away and spend the day there.  Usually there is a fine.  Then they have to travel back or stay overnight.  It has been suggested to me that a more effective way to deal with such cases would be to apply an &ldquo;on the spot&rdquo; fine, such as applies in the city in relation to parking.  That seems to be a reasonable enough suggestion and I commend it to the Minister.</P>
    <P>I understand that there is concern in certain parts of the country, notably in County Waterford, regarding the fact that although county council officials have had their wage increase sanctioned by the Minister, with retrospective effect over quite lengthy periods, in the case of the road workers the retrospective sanction applies only to 1st June; in other words, that preferential, advantageous and beneficial treatment was given to the officials as against the manual road workers.  This would seem to me to be totally wrong.  I do not know why such a policy should be operated unless it is a natural predisposition that the Custom House may have against manual workers.  It may be that they regard them as an inferior form of life and as people who are able to manage on much less than is necessary for the higher forms of life wearing <Col N="530" /> white shirts and collars.  That does not tally with the facts.  It is unjust that this should be done.  If there is to be retrospection in respect of wage increases, if anything it should be more freely available and more generously available to the lower-paid workers, the road workers, than to officials.</P>
    <P>I want to conclude by saying that I have had many appeals from people who have applied for loans under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts to Dublin County Council and who have been told that there is no prospect in the foreseeable future of loans being made available to them.  Yesterday, I met one chap who had contracted with a builder.  He was very lucky, in fact, to get a builder to accept his application. He has paid in a certain amount of money, part of the deposit, to the builder.  The deposit runs into several hundred pounds.  He tells me most builders will not now accept any assurance in respect of Dublin County Council loans because they say there is no certainty as to when such loans will be paid, only the certainty that it will be many a long day.</P>
    <P>This reluctance to advance money is evident in regard to the building societies also.  There have been loose statements by Ministers and others that the credit squeeze is relaxed.  I do not see it: can anybody see it, or any sign of relaxation of the credit squeeze? People seeking money from Dublin County Council do not see it.  To my mind, that is a particular instance that is digging the grave of this Government more surely than anything else.</P>
    <P>This is a case of a person who has been told by the county council that he is qualified for a loan but has no hope of getting it until perhaps next January.  Deputy Burke, who I am sure will follow, may be able to mention when the last loan was paid by Dublin County Council.  This shows the utter failure of this Government in the matter of housing.  It is all right to say that there is a credit squeeze and the money is not there but it is the business of the Government to see that the money is there.  When the Government were taking office, they assumed the responsibility of making this money available: otherwise what is government <Col N="531" /> about?  Is it just a game we play here, a sort of chess game, moving to and fro?  Government is the raising of money.  I do not want to be unduly harsh on the members of this Government; in any case it would be a waste of my time as I am sure their skins are impenetrable, but see the result of their efforts to raise money in England. That is a reflection of the status of this Government internationally.  It was &ldquo;a holy show&rdquo;, to put it colloquially, we made of ourselves by looking for money there at all.  We went around the world begging for money here, there and everywhere.</P>
    <P>It may be said that this is a world condition.  It was not said in 1957; it was stuck on the foreheads of the inter-Party Government as their responsibility and as they had to accept it&mdash;as they did, and suffered for it&mdash; this Government will have to accept it also.  I am not making what is known in the so-called programmes as a projection, the new word for a prophecy or a guess.  To formulate a projection is to make a guess.  I am not given to that but I shall make a bet that the next time this Government go to the country, they can say &ldquo;day-day&rdquo; to office.  They will never see it again.</P>

      <P>I do not want in any way to impinge on the dignity of the House by making it into a betting parlour or anything of that nature.  We shall have a private talk about that.  I ask in the name of God &mdash; if the Minister is at all responsive, he should surely be responsive to that appeal &mdash; that people such as the young man I mentioned trying to get a loan out of Dublin County Council, qualified under every heading and who has saved up money and has a builder willing to <Col N="532" /> give him the house if he can get the loan in terms of cash, should not be put aside whatever else has to be put aside in the interests of economy.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that the Government are being put to the pin of their collar, as the saying is, through their own maladministration and their own fault.  Let us not blink it: there is nobody else to blame; they are the Government and have been there long enough.  They should have foreseen this situation instead of producing these papers, these idle exercises in planning.  They should have got down to facts years ago.  Will the Minister make these loans available, loosen up loans to Dublin County Council and Dublin Corporation? Otherwise, there is only one alternative. As this young man said to me: &ldquo;What alternative have I but to clear out and go to England with the rest of them, take the mailboat&rdquo;.  It appears that no man has the right to set bounds to the onward march of the Irish nation to the mailboat.</P>

      <P>There are some items to which I wish to refer briefly, items which come under the Minister's Department and which affect people in my constituency.  The first is the manner in which the roads in and around Galway city are being laid and maintained by the local authority. This may not seem of sufficient importance to be aired in the Dáil but where there is life, or possible loss of life, involved, I feel duty-bound to refer to the scandalous state of some of the main crossroads in that city.  This has come about only quite recently, due to the manipulations of our engineers in the local county council.  The people of Galway are at a loss for a name to describe in a fitting manner what the highly qualified people have done to what were once roads where traffic could flow freely and safely.  My own concoction of a name for it is the &ldquo;maze craze&rdquo; in Galway.  Other people have called these &ldquo;suicide crossroads&rdquo;. I am sorry to have to refer to them but I brought them to the notice of the Minister for Justice last week by way of Parliamentary Question and the Ceann Comhairle stopped me because <Col N="533" /> I was out of order.  I went about making a long statement on the matter and it was the wrong occasion.  I wish now to refer to the junction leading from Renmore Road in Galway into Renmore Park, to Moneenageesha Cross and to the Cemetery Cross.  These three corners have been the cause of many accidents during the past six months.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>By introducing this Bill, Deputy Clinton and I are striving to fill a need which was left unattended to, no doubt inadvertently, by the Planning Bill which we passed not so long ago.  In the course of the lengthy debate on that Bill, many aspects of housebuilding and construction and the planning of estates were dealt with and a number of us who have constituents living in new estates surrounding the city&mdash; mainly in Dundrum, Churchtown and Walkinstown on the south side and in Santry, Blanchardstown and Palmerstown on the other side, as well as many others in the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown constituency which is contiguous to ours&mdash;felt very concerned because, though it had been thought the Planning Bill could be made effective in respect of estates which had been completed prior to its passing, in fact as it turned out the Planning Act, at least in the opinion of the Law Agent of Dublin County Council, a very able man and a meticulous lawyer, did not give to local authorities the right to require planners and building developers in the estates I have mentioned to put the estates in a condition fit to enable them to be taken over by the local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What this means&mdash;I may be sounding a bit complicated about what is really a very simple thing&mdash;may be simply explained by giving an example. The manner of building houses under <Col N="534" /> the Small Dwellings Acts has followed a pattern in the Dublin suburban areas.  A housing developer acquires a section of land; he develops it by installing water and sewerage services and goes on to build on it himself or has a builder or a number of builders erect houses on it.  The houses are sold by the builder to people, most of whom would have availed of the Small Dwellings Acts to get loans and grants from Dublin County Council and from the Department of Local Government or loans from the commercial building societies.</P>
    <P>In many such cases, when all the houses in an estate were built and tenanted, it was found that a number of things remained still to be done.  For instance, footpaths were often left unfinished, open spaces were left in an unsatisfactory condition, in some instances being no better than refuse dumps.  In general, it was found that many of the estates had not been brought to the condition required by the county council and which had been set out in the plans originally submitted by the developers to the county council.  In turn, the county council have taken the stand that they could not provide the ordinary maintenance services such as roads and the collection of refuse bins until the builder or the developer had got the estates to the required condition; in other words, to a point at which they could be taken over by the local authorities.</P>
    <P>It was thought by many of us&mdash; indeed the Minister went on record giving an assurance to the House&mdash; that the Planning Act provided powers for Dublin County Council to compel builders and developers who had not completed such estates in accordance with their plans to do so. We thought that the Act also provided penalties for those who declined to do so.  The view of Dublin County Council's Law Agent is that the Act has no retrospective effect, that it could operate in respect of estates which were begun subsequent to the passage of the Bill but not in respect of estates which had lain there, especially some which had lain there for years before the Bill was passed, that the county council had not in this <Col N="535" /> matter the power to act with retrospective effect.</P>
    <P>That is the simple problem with which we are faced.  Members of the Dublin County constituency come up against this problem very often.  Quite a number of the estates around the perimeter of the city have active residents' associations and we have attended meetings of many of them. Almost invariably this problem is brought to light at these meetings but there is the difficulty of having anything done about it in the light of the county council Law Agent's interpretation. Deputy Clinton and I and, I am sure, Deputy P.J. Burke, although not perhaps in a position to append his name to a private Bill of this kind because of his membership of the Government Party&mdash;we understand that&mdash;felt it desirable that we should introduce this Private Members' Bill to enable a discussion on the true legal position in respect of which members of the local authority have been advised, and to put beyond yea or nea the right of the local authority to act against developers or builders who have left estates unfinished, even if such estates were left in that condition prior to the passage of the most recent Town Planning Act.</P>
    <P>That is the simple purpose of this amending Bill.  I do not know what the views of the Minister's departmental legal advisers are.  I recall that the Minister expressed the view that the powers to do this were already there, but there is doubt about that, and doubt expressed by legal men.  Where there is such doubt, the obvious thing to do is to remove the doubt.  It may very well be that the Minister's view is correct, that the power is there, but how is one to know, if one proceeds in court, that the court may not take the opposite view?  Courts are a maverick kind of institution and very often take the most unexpected view of what might appear to us to be the most obvious solution to a problem.  It does appear to us that the most effective procedure would be to have this Bill accepted by the Minister, or, alternatively, if the Minister would adopt <Col N="536" /> the Bill as his own, it would suit us just as well.  All we are seeking is a solution to this very sore problem.</P>
    <P>Hardly a week goes by that the Deputies for Dublin County&mdash;and, I am sure, those Deputies who operate on the fringe of the city&mdash;do not receive representations from residents' associations on this very problem, the fact that there are heaps of mud around the estate, unfinished paths, unfinished fences, with the open spaces left in a completely unusable condition, very often left open even for tinkers to camp on them or be misused in one way or another.  I am sure the Minister understands what the Bill is about, and I urge it upon him most sincerely and strongly in the interests of all the residents in the suburban areas concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The decision to bring this matter before the House by way of Private Members' Bill was made only when it became clear that the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act of 1963 was ineffective and failed completely to provide the legal basis for enforcement in connection with the taking in charge of unfinished estates.  Such estates in County Dublin are considerable in number.  Because of the failure to take these estates in charge, the effective services that a large number of people should be getting have been denied to them for a very considerable period, as long as 20 years in some cases.  We have at least one instance of an estate that is 20 years built and the people there, who have been for many years on full rates, are still denied the normal services to which they would otherwise be entitled.  As the House will appreciate, this leads to considerable discontent and agitation by the people concerned.  It leads also to a certain disinterest in the community in which they live and a feeling that they have been let down badly by the local authorities and by the public representatives generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is almost impossible for any public representative to explain to ordinary people that there are very real difficulties in the way of taking over the estate and giving them the services to <Col N="537" /> which they should be normally entitled. They just feel&mdash;and this is normal, too&mdash;that they are being deprived of these services deliberately by the local authority in order to save money.  As we know, if the estate is not in charge, the most limited services are all that these people can get.  They get a dustbin collection, because they must get that under the Health Act, but the roads are not swept, the grass margins are not properly kept, and the open spaces in most of these estates that I know are just like a jungle.  I often wonder how it is they are not caught under the Noxious Weeds Act by another Department.  There seems to be little enforcement of that Act in the unfinished estates and in the open spaces in County Dublin, and these open spaces are an eyesore all the time.</P>
    <P>In common with other public representatives, I have had this problem on my plate for quite a number of years and, indeed, for a number of years before the legislation of 1963 was enacted.  During the passage of that legislation through this House, I took a particular interest in the possibility of having this legislation applied retrospectively to these unfinished estates where developers did not live up to ordinary, reasonable responsibilities and allow people to get the amenities to which they are entitled as ratepayers. We all know that when these people went into the estates, there was considerable exemption from rates for seven years.  Now they start to pay rates straight away, and, of course, the estates to which I refer are all on rates and most of them on full rates.</P>
    <P>The great difficulty that seems to arise about the application of this section 35 is that it cannot be applied retrospectively in cases where the permissions granted were not tailored to the 1963 legislation.  I am aware the practice has been, during the years from 1934 to 1963, that when a developer came along with a plan and specification, he got permission on the plan and specification, but there were no expressed conditions in regard to the carrying out or the completion of that development.  The conditions were implied but not expressed and because <Col N="538" /> of that, the 1963 legislation is now ineffective and cannot be applied retrospectively because, apparently, the existence of conditions cannot be proved.  In cases where the conditions were exactly spelled out and specified, section 35 would be effective in retrospect, especially if taken in conjunction with subsection (2) of section 92 but there were no such cases.</P>
    <P>It might be no harm to refresh our memories by reading section 92, subsection (2):</P>
    <P>A general or special permission granted under the Act of 1934 shall be treated for the purposes of this Act, including in particular sections 30, 31 and 35, as a permission granted under section 26 of this Act and a record of such permission shall be included in the register.</P>
    <P>It is all right to say that a permission under the 1963 Act can be regarded as if it were a permission under the 1934 Act, but it is generally recognised that under the 1934 Act, there was no real power of enforcement. The local authorities had interim control and permissions were granted subsequent to the production of plans and specifications and a builder or developer was expected to carry out the development according to these specifications, but it would be unreasonable to expect the officers or the law agent of any local authority to anticipate the legislation enacted in 1963 and, apparently, it would have been necessary to anticipate that legislation and to tailor the permissions accordingly, if sections 35 and 92 of the 1963 Act were to be applicable and effective now.</P>
    <P>I want to impress upon the Minister that this Private Members' Bill was not introduced lightly.  It concerns every public representative in County Dublin. There are similar difficulties experienced in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown and, as Deputy Dunne has said, on the fringe areas of the city.  Deputy Dunne said that his name and mine had been appended to this Bill and that but for a misplaced loyalty, Deputy Burke's name would also be appended to it. I say that Deputy Burke is in full sympathy with the amendment proposed <Col N="539" /> in this Bill because I have listened to him trying to explain to people, as I have been trying to explain to them, why various estates had not been taken in charge and why, having been in existence for from ten to 20 years, they were not getting services.</P>
    <P>Everybody wants this change.  We are simply asking the Minister if the type of amendment which we propose does not satisfy him, to find a way out of the difficulty.  We do not mind who does it or how it is done, as long as it is done.</P>
    <P>I had another look at this Bill today. Whereas the amendment proposed to section 35 of the Principal Act may not fill the bill, that is:</P>
    <P>(10)  The provisions of this section shall apply in respect of works of whatsoever kind (which shall include the acquisition and development of open spaces) whether commenced before or after the passing of this Act,</P>
    <P>could I recommend that the Minister might consider something along the following lines to meet the problem which I have tried to spell out, perhaps not very clearly:</P>
    <P>For the avoidance of doubt, where before the enactment of the Act of 1963 permission for a development was given consequent on submission of plans and specification therefor there shall be deemed to be annexed to such permission a condition that the development shall be carried out and completed in accordance with such plans and specification?</P>
    <P>I have gone through the Principal Act in some detail and feel that if we had this sort of coverage in a subsection that is all we would need to clear the 31 outstanding cases that I am aware of in County Dublin.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the estates where we are in difficulty because I wanted to impress on the Minister that this is no small problem.  I know that at Question Time and other occasions the Minister has expressed the view that the 1963 Planning and Development Act was fully effective and gave complete cover in this type of difficulty.  As I have said, <Col N="540" /> it has been given as his opinion by our legal adviser in Dublin County Council that that is not so, for the reasons, more or less, which I have tried to outline and which I hope the Minister will try to understand.</P>
    <P>I know that the Minister was questioned on this aspect at the time the legislation was going through the House and assured us on more than one occasion that the legislation could be fully and effectively applied retrospectively and represented the end of our difficulties.  Unfortunately, we expected that to be the case and honestly believed it to be the case and, as a result, we visited the various areas where residents were in serious difficulty and were protesting and told them that it was our opinion that when the legislation which was going through the House was enacted, they would be delivered from their troubles.  As time went on, we found that that was not the case and that the same difficulty and the same problems were arising because developers, for their own good reasons, did not want to hand over estates.  In many cases they do not want to hand them over because they have done either a bad job or a middling job, and certainly have not done a job that is to the satisfaction or the specifications of the engineers and planners in the areas concerned and also because it involves them in extra expense in bringing the various services up to reasonable standards.</P>
    <P>In addition, in many of the areas to which I refer it was a condition of planning permission that a reasonable area would be set aside as an open space which we all considered at the time would be a public open space for the full and unrestricted enjoyment of the people in the area.  Some smart legal man in Dublin has discovered that, in fact, this is not a public open space but a private open space and Dublin County Council are confronted now with the position where we are obliged to purchase what we believed would be the property of the council free of charge on conclusion of development.  We have to move in now and bargain with these people and try to buy at a price.  Even doing that, <Col N="541" /> we are still confronted with the fact that the developers simply will not finish, will not do any better job, and have sold all the houses in the area. They are no longer in any way induced to continue the job.  They do not feel obliged to do so.</P>
    <P>When the unfortunate people in these estates were buying their homes, they were shown nicely ornamented plans on which were depicted green open spaces and imaginary trees.  They got the artist's impression.  They were deceived by many of these developers. They were shown on paper all the amenities to which they would become heir, if and when they bought a house from a particular builder or developer. Most of these amenities have, in fact, never materialised.  Indeed, what appeared to them to be an open space for the enjoyment of the people is now a jungle for dumping refuse and for rat infestation&mdash;certainly not a place where their children could go out and play as they expected.</P>
    <P>This is not a small problem.  I think I will be backed up in this by every public representative in the area.  It is a problem of considerable dimensions and I hope the Minister will give us the power to solve it.  There are 31 such estates in County Dublin at present.  These are all cases where planning permission was granted simply on plans and specifications produced. Conditions were implied and not expressed.  These are the places where the developers and builders are in a position to dig in their heels, thumb their noses at the county council and decide they will finish these estates when it suits them.  It just does not seem to suit them.  There is no legal pressure we can put on them to finish these estates.  That is the opinion of the legal adviser.  The only pressure we can bring is the fact that these people in a number of cases will be involved in further development in the county somewhere.  There is always the feeling that their future applications might not be treated with all the favour they might normally expect if they were good developers and did the job in a reasonable way.</P>
    <P>For the records of the House, it is <Col N="542" /> no harm that we should list these estates in trouble where we want the powers to put the matter right: Annaville, Dundrum; Linden Lee, Stillorgan; Orchardstown Park, Butterfield; Goatstown Avenue; St. Mary's Park, Drive and Crescent&mdash;it is 20 years since St. Mary's Park got permission&mdash;Wynberg Park, Blackrock; Woodbrook Drive, Butterfield; Woodlands Drive; Churchtown Close; O'Connor Estate, Rathfarnham Avenue; Dromartin Estate; Clonkeen Road; Johnstown Estate, Cabinteely; Manor Estate, Woodley Park, Kilmacud; Landy Estate, Templeogue; Quality Homes, Butterfield; Beechfield Estate, Castleknock; Brookfield Park Estate, Strandbrook; Corbawn Estate, Shankill: Howards Field Estate, Malahide; Beechmount Drive, Bird Ave; Wainsfort Park; Greentrees Manor Estate; Hollywood, Goatstown; Cherry Garth, Mount Merrion; Granite Field; Lambert Estate and Lambert Estate Extension; Orchardstown Estate and Grange Park.</P>
    <P>I am listing these to let the Minister see that this is no small problem.  This refers to County Dublin.  I am aware there is a number of similar estates in Dún Laoghaire and Rathdown.  I have no notion of the number of people involved in these estates but I know they are people on full rates entitled to a number of services they are not getting.  The roads are not swept.  It is not possible for these people to get a bus service into the estate because CIE consider they would be trespassers if they moved into what is described as a private estate.  This whole question of public and private must be decided if people are to be allowed live reasonably and not go through all this again.</P>
    <P>Our only anxiety is to find a way.  I hope the Minister will not take it that he is in any way tied to the exact form of the amendment we propose. Perhaps the second solution.  I have mentioned might meet the difficulty better.  I am not a legal person.  I know it is difficult to tie down the legal people.  I am saying that with one of these legal gentlemen close to my elbow.  I hope he has something to say on this.  I trust the Minister will find <Col N="543" /> a way out of the difficulties, having heard those difficulties spelled out as well as I can spell them out.  Sections 35 and 92, though they gave the impression of having retrospective effect, cannot be applied retrospectively because the permissions were not in accordance with legislation enacted 30 years later.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one of the most controversial problems for public men in County Dublin.  The Minister discussed it with Deputy Clinton and myself and other members of the county council.  He did everything possible for us.  As a result of our representations, he introduced section 35, and for that I am deeply grateful.  This matter is completely above politics. Members of all Parties have been invited to attend meetings concerning these estates over the years.  We were abused and told we were only bluffing. When section 35 was introduced, we told those people we had a cure for all their ills.  This is one platform on which we do not try to score off one another because this is a problem concerning every one of us.  The Minister met a joint deputation to discuss the problem.  I do not know why we have it in County Dublin.  I suppose the explanation is simply that there was more private enterprise development in County Dublin than in any other constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I often went to the builder and to the developer and appealed to them to meet us.  I went to Dublin County Council and on a few occasions we went jointly to the builders.  I want to pay a compliment to the decent builders and decent developers who have done their job without any pressure but we have a hard core who have succeeded in avoiding doing what they should do.  I have in mind St. Mary's Park which has been developed for about 20 years.  The estate went into liquidation.  The ground rent was sold but, having taken over the liability, the new owners will not do the job. They bought the ground rent but they will do nothing about roads, paths and the open spaces which are rat warrens. We had to send out inspectors to try <Col N="544" /> to poison the rats which were actually getting into those houses by the back door.  That situation is due to the fact that the original developer did not do his job.  They are not concerned with the big problem which we have to face. Things became so bad in that estate that we wanted to do the job ourselves but the trouble is that if we create a precedent in County Dublin by doing this work, then every other developer there will ask us to do the same thing for them.</P>
    <P>As I have already said, section 35 of the 1963 Act is an excellent section. I was delighted to hear Deputy Clinton say he was not anxious to force this, provided the Minister and his officials would have another look at the section to see how to surmount the problem. Our advice by our legal department in Dublin County Council is that while it is an excellent section, it has no retrospective effect.  I have often opposed retrospective legislation in this House as it is slightly undemocratic but sometimes, with greater enlightenment, one has to change one's outlook. We want to catch these people through some kind of retrospective legislation. Our legal adviser, Mr. Matt Purcell, is one of our most conscientious lawyers.  The Minister, Deputy Clinton, Deputy S. Dunne and I thought that section 35 was a cure for all ills but our legal adviser has told us that while it is an excellent section and while we shall never again have the same difficulties in County Dublin as a result of the section, nevertheless it is very desirable that we should have retrospective power here.</P>
    <P>Recently, I was elected chairman of the Dublin Health Authority.  People write to me asking if we cannot do anything about the rats.  The reason for all the trouble is neglect by the developer.  I was asked to put my name to this but I refused and I am now explaining my position.  One can be embarrassed occasionally as a public representative, but in fairness I must say that Deputy S. Dunne and Deputy Clinton were very gentlemanly about it.  I discussed this with the Minister and I know I am pushing an open door. If the Minister were representing County Dublin, he would realise the <Col N="545" /> problem facing us.  It is strange how ironic and how sarcastic people can be but I do not blame them because if any of us had to live in the same conditions as these people in St. Mary's Park, then we should feel the very same towards persons who, in our view, were not doing their job.  We even had the advice of senior counsel on section 35 of the 1963 Act.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with the wording of the amendment by my two colleagues but I was delighted when Deputy Clinton said that we really want the Minister to take action to deal with the situation.  I appeal to him to do so.  It is certainly a great pleasure to know that, by reason of section 35, we shall never have the same trouble with estates again.</P>
    <P>I should like to say to our very good developers in the city and county of Dublin that we appreciate the good job they have done and that it is only this hard core that constitutes the difficulty.  If we set about the job ourselves, we are immediately opening the floodgates for every other estate and for every other small developer.  That is something we must not do.  We have been forced in the case of St. Mary's, but we have been told by the local authority, and rightly so, that we should not do these things.  I have tried to make our position clear and I make an appeal now to Deputy Dunne and Deputy Clinton.  If the Minister will give an assurance that he will have another look at this, together with his officials, that will, I think, meet our position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the principle enshrined in this amending Bill.  The Minister has been told what the problem is as it affects a great many residents, particularly in the County Dublin area, which includes the borough of Dún Laoghaire.  To a certain extent, these problems also affect parts of city constituencies which have been developed as a result of the extension of the city boundary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem is primarily, but not exclusively, confined to newly developed areas in which there has been a good deal of housing development. <Col N="546" /> It is a problem with which Deputies who represent constituencies unaffected by such development may not be familiar and may even have some difficulty in understanding or appreciating.  As Deputy Clinton said, the problem here is to find a way in which to ensure that legislation can be made effective.  None of us is wedded to the particular terms of the amending Bill but I am sure there will be general support for whatever type of amendment may be necessary to achieve the desired result.  This is in no sense a Party political matter since the problem is one which affects people of different Party political persuasions.</P>
    <P>It must be emphasised, and clearly understood both by the Minister and his officials, that the problems created for residents in these new estates are acute and pressing.  Those who reside in the areas and public representatives who have had representations made to them, in many cases made repeatedly over very long periods, understand and appreciate the difficulties that exist. Indeed, in relation to certain parts of Dún Laoghaire and Rathdown, repeated representations have been made over the past 20 years.  The same is probably true of other parts of County Dublin.  This goes back to the post-war expansion in housing development.</P>
    <P>In most of these newly-developed estates the problems are identical: one is delay in taking over the roads, due in some cases to the fact that the developers have failed to complete certain works, possibly minor in character, in order to comply with the requirements of the county council specifications.  Another is failure to complete works of a more serious character.  In other cases lights have not been provided, though that is probably not a major problem.  The fact that roads are not taken over means that CIE refuse to provide bus services into these estates because they have no legal right to run buses on roads that are not designated as public roads.  Another problem is the fact that playgrounds and parks are not provided or, if space is left for ultimate developments, steps have not been taken to complete the necessary works.  All these problems occur sometimes  <Col N="547" /> in fringe areas in which development has taken place and sometimes in entirely new estates which have assumed a character of their own.  It is correct to say that the residents of these estates invariably show a most commendable public spirit in organising themselves into voluntary committees and residents' associations for the sole purpose of ensuring that amenities and services are provided. As the Minister and the House will appreciate, the majority of the residents are either newly-married or persons with young families.</P>
    <P>In a certain number of these newly-developed estates, there is the problem of inadequate schooling facilities. Whilst that is not strictly a matter for the Department of Local Government, lack of a definite decision in respect of playing fields, parks and general layout in certain cases has impinged on the development of schooling facilities because sites have not been provided, or a decision has not been taken or plans which have been submitted cannot be implemented because of delay in getting general approval.  As was mentioned here, in the last analysis, there may be a doubt about the effective authority to enforce compliance with plans.</P>
    <P>I am naturally more familiar with the problems relating to my own constituency. The problem in Dún Laoghaire is not by any means as acute, with one or two exceptions, as it is in the Rathdown portion of the constituency, but there are certain parts of Dún Laoghaire Borough in which residents have been affected by these problems.  It is true to say that in every part of the Rathdown portion of the constituency, from Mount Merrion and Stillorgan out to Foxrock, Cabinteely, Deansgrange, Kilmacud, Gledswood and Clonskeagh, estates have been developed and what exasperates the residents more than anything else is the fact that, with the exception of road cleaning arrangements and facilities under the scavenging section of either the county council or the corporation, no service has been or is being provided, although in all cases the householder <Col N="548" /> or ratepayer concerned is liable for rates in respect of the house.  In many cases a number of these ratepayers have been paying full rates for a considerable number of years.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned, those who have not had the experience of residing in one of these estates, or attending a meeting of a residents' association or some other group, or of having been approached by a resident or a number of residents in regard to the problem, cannot adequately appreciate the great difficulties that have been caused.  In certain areas, and this applies particularly in parts of Kilmacud and Stillorgan, and even into Blackrock, there is the added problem for a number of residents of flooding.  Here again, the problem, to a considerable extent, has been aggravated by a lack of adequate preliminary preparation before some of the building was allowed, or roads constructed.  Houses have been built and roads constructed and no adequate provision made to take surplus water or to take off water that wells up in these areas because of their proximity to the Dublin Mountains and to the very heavy and rapid outfall from that area.</P>
    <P>Here again, of course, the problem is a seasonal one but it is nonetheless acute and unless one is familiar with how these streams and rivers can well into torrents at very short notice, compared with their normal pattern of a trickle, then one cannot appreciate the problem created.  Therefore I should like to reinforce what has been said by other speakers and emphasise to the Minister and to the Department that any reasonable proposal to amend the 1963 Act in order to make it effective would be acceptable.  Many people expected that once the 1963 Act was passed, a great many of these problems, which had created so many difficulties for so many people over a great number of years, would be, if not solved, at least tackled so that they could see the end of the road.  However, they have been disappointed to find that the particular provisions in the legislation do not confer or may not confer adequate legal powers to deal with this matter.  Therefore, any <Col N="549" /> reasonable proposal which would ensure that the legislation would be made effective would be welcomed by the residents concerned.</P>
    <P>I should also like to point out to the Minister that another problem for many of these areas is the length of time it takes to deal with planning applications and appeals.  In certain cases&mdash;admittedly, delay was greater prior to the 1963 Act but it still exists &mdash;applications in regard to certain work may be submitted and the residents of the estate may only find out, when the application is already in and in some cases decided upon, that a decision had been taken or action had been taken and that in regard to the steps which they wish to take to have their problem considered on, say, a proposed development, an alteration to include parks and playgrounds, perhaps, the time has elapsed or the notice has expired. I should be glad if the Minister would consider that aspect of the problem. I only want to reinforce what has been said from all sides of the House in favour of some form of amending legislation to enable uncompleted estates to be dealt with.</P>
    <P>There are very numerous estates throughout the Dublin area, both in Dún Laeoghaire-Rathdown area and in certain city constituencies as well.  I think it true to say that to a very considerable extent in some of the new estates the residents outnumber the old residents in the particular area.  When development was gradual, it was always possible to provide for a limited extension of services, or an extension of the existing roads, to meet the people's needs but with the rapid development of a great number of these estates, there is much to be desired and because of failure to complete the work, the people are unable to get services of quite an ordinary kind, such as post-boxes, or lights, or nameplates and so on.  In addition, rat infestation and dumps of one sort or another have caused serious problems and in some cases have created dangers to health.  Therefore I would like to urge the Minister to bring in amending legislation as soon as possible, or, if possible, to have a suitable, amendment considered at the later stages of <Col N="550" /> this Bill, to enable work on these estates to be completed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make a few comments on this matter.  I think it has been agreed that this Bill was introduced in good faith and I should like to support Deputy Burke in accepting that proposition.  Section 35 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act covers those estates built after the operative date of the 1963 Act, October, 1964, and as speakers have said, one of the great problems&mdash;certainly in the constituency I represent&mdash;is dealing with these questions from residents' associations. Residents'associations are entitled to go into estates and within a reasonable time are entitled to expect that the estates will be taken in charge by the local authority.  In my constituency there are a number of estates which, after 15 to 20 years, have still not been taken in charge.  I am not satisfied that this amendment, which, as I said, has been put down in good faith, will solve the problem. However, it has achieved this: it has brought the problem out into the open. I think it has done that much good. I would support an amendment to the 1963 Act which would clear up once and for all this whole question of the taking over of estates.  As has been said, the problems range from lack of facilities for the provision of telephones, the lack of locations for schools, to rat infestation and dumps. All those matters arise where estates have not been taken over by local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not blaming the local authorities. Their functions are well settled by statute.  I would support, however, any legislation which would bind the developer or the builder to hand over the estate completed within a certain time.  A time limit should be placed on a builder with regard to the handing over of the estate to the local authority. One of our greatest occupations, as has been mentioned, is going around weekly from resident association to resident association.  Invariably the problem is the condition of the estate one aspect or another of it, such as the continuity of the roads&mdash;a new estate road coming on to an old road <Col N="551" /> and the division or joining portion not completed for ages.</P>
    <P>Those are some of the problems with regard to resident associations.  As most Deputies know, some of those resident associations have very real problems to deal with.  I have always welcomed co-operation between residents, no matter what political Party they represent.  They do a first-class job.</P>
    <P>There are many estates, as the last speaker has said, in the Rathdown part of the constituency which affect us.  Rathdown is the newer section of the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown constituency. There are many new estates which have been built there in the past few years.  Mount Merrion has been mentioned and also Kilmacud, Stillorgan, Gledswood, Cabinteely, Foxrock, Glenageary, Deansgrange and Clonskeagh and in each of those estates there are defects of one type or another. I would appeal to the Minister once and for all-I do not suggest that he should accept this specific amendment because it might add to the confusion which at present exists&mdash;to accept an amendment, or possibly try to interpret the section for us to let us know exactly how effective it is.</P>
    <P>A thought occurred to me in relation to the legality of the section.  Would ACRA, which represents residents' associations, not bring a test case under the Act to have it interpreted by the courts?  As Deputy Burke has mentioned, section 35 was accepted by all Parties.  I suggest, in order to get a definitive interpretation of the section, that it be brought by way of test case to the courts.  This would solve our greatest problem in the Dublin County area and the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown area.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to reiterate that this Bill was introduced, I am quite satisfied, in a non-political manner and this is the way it should be dealt with.  It should be dealt with in a mature and civilised manner.  I should like to express my congratulations to speakers of all Parties who have spoken on it.  They know that one of the greatest problems affecting <Col N="552" /> urban Deputies is the whole question of the taking in charge of estates by local authorities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryPDockrell" hpid="Mr. H.P. Dockrell Mr. H.P. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H.P. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say a few words in support of this Bill.  I also am not satisfied that the Bill is the best Bill and that it sets out all the matters as clearly as it should but all the speakers tonight have impressed on the Minister the need, at least, for amendment of section 35 of the 1963 Act.</P>
      <P>Deputy Clinton has given a list of the unfinished estates in County Dublin and Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown. I agree with him that those estates are ones which are not apparently covered by section 35.  I think it is the intention &mdash;certainly it would be my intention &mdash;that this Bill would rectify the position regarding those estates.  This would enable the local authorities to clear up the open spaces, the unfinished footpaths and the other matters referred to by various speakers.</P>
      <P>I was surprised today to receive a notice from a tenants' association.  I happened to read the secretary's report, which was enclosed with it.  It referred to rat infestation.  That, as other speakers have said, is one of the reasons why there was a necessity to bring in this Bill to amend the position. I, in company with Deputy Andrews and the other Deputies for the area, have attended many residents' association meetings.  I want to say that anything the Minister can do, which would enable us to clear up those estates, would be very much appreciated.  I want to reiterate that there is a great necessity for this from the public health point of view and also because the roads, footpaths and open spaces, which are on those various estates and that cannot be dealt with under existing legislation, will be dealt with then.  I do not mind whether it is done under this Bill or whether it is done by the Minister taking over the Bill and amending it; but whatever is done, I want to ask the Minister to deal with this as quickly as possible so that the county council and Dún Laoghaire Corporation can deal with this very pressing problem.</P>

      <P>The intention and the spirit that moves the people supporting this amendment I do not doubt in the slightest.  If the situation were as they believe it to be, I would support them, too.  I want to see these estates taken over.  In the 1963 Act, with the unanimous agreement of this House, we set down provisions which we were satisfied were capable of meeting the deficiencies that already existed in the law at that time.</P>
      <P>Section 35, as I am advised, and I have been advised well, I think, and I certainly have been advised often, does cover all the cases that arise before the Act as well as catering for all cases that might arise after it. In so far as the amendment of section 35 is concerned, whether by this particular wording or any other wording, in my estimation, the amendment cannot add to what I believe is already there, that is, that there is retrospection in so far as this matter goes.  What may be confusing is that the terms of planning permissions granted under the 1934 Act, through loosely drafted Orders, were lacking in clarity, not sufficiently specific, and it is as a result of this&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the point.  It is as a result of this that we now feel there is a deficiency in the law, but are we prepared, because of&mdash;I shall not say the inefficiency of the people who drafted this in those days&mdash;the insufficiency of what they drafted to advocate, through this or any other type of amendment of our present laws, retrospectively the annexing of liabilities and responsibilities that may cost in some cases not much money but in many cases could conceivably cost a great deal of money and imposing on these developers or other people years after they had finished the development a burden for which they made no provision financially in the overall economics of their development? I believe the House would not wish to do this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that even if they do wish to do it, purely as a personal opinion, I think it would not be moral, legal or <Col N="554" /> possibly constitutional that it should be done.  I may be wrong in this view.  I do not believe this House will wish to pass legislation which would have the effect of, in an extreme case, bringing about a situation that might bankrupt or begger some people today, who did their developing according to the outline, or specification, or order of the planning permission they got ten or 20 years ago.  They are now to be obliged by retrospective law to carry out works costing them money which they never knew they had to do and are now to be asked to do.</P>
    <P>With regard to these cases in Dublin and elsewhere, the trouble arises out of an insufficient order, an insufficiently detailed specification, as it were, in the original planning permission, whether this happened either wittingly or unwittingly or through lack of action on the part of the local planning authority. We would not be right in saying now that because of their mistakes, the developer, his heirs, or successors must now pay an unknown sum to carry out these additional desirable works that should have been specified 20 years ago.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>In all these cases, it is a known sum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Known or unknown, and I give this as a personal view, I do not believe the House should be asked to do this.  I do not believe the House will be prepared to do this because it is the omission of the local planning authority that has so left the order and the planning permission under which the developer in the past may have built and built fully.  If we now find that that permission was not sufficiently detailed, if it omitted the things we now know to be desirable, I do not believe it would be right to pass legislation to amend the law to compel these people, if they can now be found, to do the works at any cost to them merely because there was an omission on the part of the local planning authority in the preparation of the order granting the original permission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is not to say that I have no sympathy whatsoever with the people who are affected by this lack of planning <Col N="555" /> permission as a result of which section 35, even though it applies in retrospect, may not bring about any improvements.  The fact is that it does not apply expect to works specified in the original planning permission.</P>
    <P>There are cases where works have not been carried out that were specified in the planning permissions many years ago; there are today people, who are traceable in one form or another, who can be held to be responsible, who did not carry out in accordance with the planning permission the works that should have been done.  These people have not been held under the law which I believe is contained in the 1963 Act; enforcement orders have not been served on them as is provided in the Act and recourse to the law courts has not been attempted.  The law courts as we understand them are the interpreters of the laws we pass.  The views of no one man, or no number of people outside or in this House, surely can be advanced by their casting doubts on what we have done here.  The courts are the people who interpret this law. It is not being put to the courts and I am asking the people immediately concerned and those who are interested, and who have spoken here, why has the law as we put it through this House and as we believe it to be effective, not been put into effect.  If it is defective, and I do not believe it is, the courts are in a position to determine whether this is so or not.  If they determine that the law is deficient, I can assure those on all sides, who feel that by showing it to be deficient they have lost something intended originally in the Bill, that I will come to the House and amend it accordingly.</P>
    <P>I think it wrong, though well-intentioned, that we should be told that doubts have been cast on the efficiency or efficacy of the terms of this section, or any other section or any legislation that we have passed in this House, by a legal adviser outside, no matter how eminent he may be.  There is one way to find out.  Take the obvious typical case of the cases that exist, serve the enforcement notice and let the law take its course.  If nothing happens as a result of that, if the developer or his <Col N="556" /> representatives fail to carry out the works as per the enforcement authority, then the local authority may go in and do this themselves and charge it against the people whom they have indicated and identified as responsible.</P>
    <P>I believe it is only fair that we should not just change the law in this House because somebody says, from whatever part of the country, that it does not do what the Dáil intended it to do.  Let us find out, and if it is wrong, I will be willing to come to this House and seek an amendment.</P>
    <P>We have cases where no one can be found&mdash;where they are dead, where they are bankrupt, where they have disappeared&mdash;and there is no tangible evidence as to whom one follows.  In cases such as these, I cannot see that any amendment of law or any legislation in fact will get over this problem. There is nobody to follow and even if there is in some cases, he has nothing and therefore you can do nothing about it by legislation.  In this case, since it is a service to the public we are now concerned with, it obviously falls to be borne on the public purse.  This work must be done for the people which they deserve as a service for the rates and taxes they are paying like any other citizen.  But we must divide this into a number of different realms and we cannot deal with it merely on the basis that we amend section 35 and everything will be all right.  We cannot deal with it without going beyond the bounds of reason in regard to imposing conditions never intended by the developer, when he was first doing his job, through no fault of his own.  Since then, and now, we want him to do it by retrospective law.  This, I think, would be wrong.</P>

      <P>Before I reported progress, I was referring to the dangerous condition of some of the crossroads at the entrances to the city of Galway.  I explained that I felt in duty bound to raise this matter here before a fatal accident occurred at one of these crossroads.  I mentioned Moneenageesha Cross and New Cemetery crossroads in Galway.  Traffic engineers in Galway have built a new road leading from the Headford Road to New Cemetery Cross.  This road, I understand, is not yet a road approved by the Minister.  I understand also that speed limits do not apply to this road and certainly they are not being enforced there at the moment.  Cars can travel at any speed on this road across what used to be the main road, the Galway-Tuam Road at the top of the New Cemetery cross and on down into Moneenageesha. There are five roads coming together <Col N="558" /> at this point and there are four islands recently erected there by the traffic engineers of Galway County Council. I call it a maze and I say again that we in Galway are suffering from a maze craze undertaken by these engineers which is causing confusion to motorists, cyclists and even pedestrians at these corners.  Several people in the area have approached members of Galway Corporation, members of Galway County Council, every local engineer and person in high authority in the city and they have all failed to bring about any kind of improvement at both of these corners.</P>
      <P>I have here a letter from a gentleman living in Renmore, Galway.  I shall read part of the letter to give an idea of the situation which exists:</P>
      <P>People living in this area have tried in vain to have speed limits and proper signposting of this dangeropus crossroads introduced but have been unable to contact any authority which will accept the responsibility.</P>
      <P>That is the position existing there.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister to send down special engineers to Galway to solve this problem immediately before we have anything like an unfortunate fatal accident at these crosswords.  I do not like to criticise Galway County Council engineers because I feel we have a first-class set of engineers there and great work is being done by the county council but, in the matter of making these crossroads safe, they seem to act very slowly.  The Minister accepts a certain amount of responsibility in promoting a road safety campaign. It is completely contradictory of what he is trying to do to allow these engineers to cause such confusion, through the erection of mazes at our crossroads in Galway city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the past few years, more than one person has been killed at a bad bend at Grattan Road in Salthill. There was a bad accident there some years ago and there was a public outcry at the time to take an elbow off the corner and make it safe.  The man who owns the land to be taken over there came to me over 12 months ago and asked when this might be taken <Col N="559" /> over because he had not grown potatoes on it for two years before that, thinking that the council would take the land from him.  I can safely say to that man, that unless the Minister acts, he can grow potatoes there for the next five years or until the next fatal accident takes place.</P>
    <P>We have a very serious situation in Galway city regarding dangerous crossroads. One which I have mentioned to the Minister on several occasions is Madden's Corner where an accident occurred only last Sunday night.  I had intended to mention these few points about our dangerous road conditions here last week and I did not get the opportunity.  Last Sunday night, since then, I was passing by there in the evening and saw two beautiful new cars in bits.  Thanks be to God.  I do not think anybody was seriously injured but there was a tremendous amount of material damage to both of those cars and we fail to see why something is not being done to make them safer.</P>
    <P>To refer again to New Cemetery Crossroads, how anybody could negotiate a corner with four islands on it and five roads leading into it is beyond me.  I could possibly make a suggestion from my experience abroad: it would seem quite simple to have a roundabout at this corner or, if not, traffic lights.  I appealed, through a three-part question last week, to the Minister for Justice to get the Garda authorities in Galway to have consultations with the local authority to try to have this problem solved and get something done about it as soon as possible.  I know, from the Minister's answer, we have the goodwill of the Garda in Galway in this matter.  I know from past experience that that is as far as it will go, unless some higher authority steps in.  I feel I have said enough about this and I sincerely hope the Minister will take special not of it and have something done very soon because not a week goes by but some unfortunate tourist or even local person has to explain how he got into an accident at that corner.  I doubt if the county engineer himself could negotiate it, without hitting something.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="560" /> A further problem we have in Galway city is sewerage.  This is a matter which has been left lying for over 30 years, I am assured.  Unfortunately, it falls upon the present generation to solve the problem.  The problem is not diminishing in any way but has grown tremendously over the past few years, and we are now left with the situation where our main sewerage in Galway is not capable of carrying the load which it was built to carry.  This is affecting us in two ways.  It is causing unhealthy conditions and, in addition to that, nobody can get permission to erect a new house in Galway city at the moment because our county medical officer, a responsible man, has decided that he cannot allow the building of any more houses which would mean the connecting up of new pipes to the present sewerage, which is inadequate and incapable of carrying its present load.  I blame the local authority for not having acted in this matter before now.  I must mention this here because these things can be let go from year to year and at the moment it is causing a housing problem, where people with the land, with the money to build, cannot build on the sites they have, because they will not get planning permission.  The county medical officer says that he cannot be responsible for the addition of any more points to the sewerage system.</P>
    <P>On a previous occasion the Minister was good enough to step in and help in the situation, provided certain things were done in the meantime.  At that time they had stopped building and he allowed it to go forward on the understanding that certain small jobs would be done.  Those small jobs were not done and the county medical officer has been forced to stop building again in certain areas in Galway city.  We could do with the employment.  We have people who are anxious to build, and men who are anxious to get work on buildings sites, but buildings is stopped because of a lack of sewerage.  As I said, that is a very dangerous situation for a city like Galway which is so dependent on its tourist trade.  We do not like to advertise that our sewerage is inadequate but certainly if no action is taken we will have to mention <Col N="561" /> it, mention it very often, and keep on mentioning it until some action is taken.  Even if a start were made, we would be satisfied.</P>
    <P>The Planning and Development Act, 1963, has been the cause of many headaches to elected representatives. Certainly I am among those who have had to suffer from the possible maladministration of this Act.  It is very essential in this country, as in every country, that we should be able to control development and have some central authority which will have a say over the future layout of building. This is the situation in a city like Galway.  If you wish to build a house and go out to the Spiddal Road 11 miles outside the city, you cannot build on the left-hand side.  If you want to build a house on the right-hand side, you must buy two acres of land and freeze it, and only then will you get permission to build one house.  If you go to the local authority and ask where you can build a house, they will tell you they are keen to give planning permission in the Knocknacarra area but then they tell you there are no public services there and you cannot get permission to build there.</P>
    <P>If you go over to the other side of the city, you are told that vast areas of land are reserved for the industrial estate which we are still awaiting.  So many different sites have been mentioned over the past 12 months that no one knows yet where this industrial estate will be.  Difficulties have been put in the way of many small farmers. They have been stopped from building houses on their own land on the understanding that their land was to be acquired for the industrial estate, although in actual fact the industrial estate may never be on their land.  If you go in a circle from the Salthill side to the Oranmore side, you will find it very difficult to get planning permission because of the lack of public services, sewerage and water.</P>
    <P>We get a little frustrated with this Planning and Development Act, even though the Minister has been very kind to anyone who as to appeal.  In most cases he has allowed the appeal on certain conditions which I think <Col N="562" /> is a very reasonable manner of dealing with them.  We find it very difficult to understand why we should have to wait between 12 and 18 months for a decision on an appeal to the Minister. We have been told that he is inundated with appeals and cannot get around them too quickly, but this is an emergency situation.  It is affecting employment, the building industry, and the housing situation in my city. It is a matter of the utmost importance. If they are short of engineers in the Minister's Department who are capable of inspecting the sites, I can tell them that several engineers in my city have been let go from their employment and forced to emigrate through a lack of building in that area.  The Minister would be well employed in taking on these men and giving them that job.  There is no shortage of engineers in the country. We could then get our building programme moving in Galway.</P>
    <P>We are damned with this Planning Act.  I do not know whom to blame. Possibly the local authorities are too cautious and will not assume too much responsibility because the Act is new.  If there is any doubt they pass it on to the Minister.  This is causing delays of from 12 to 18 months and I find it very hard to understand why such inconvenience should be caused to a person who is keen to go ahead and build his house.</P>
    <P>I referred last week in a question to the Minister to the lack of public toilets in Connemara.  This is very serious.  Some people may think this is a parish pump matter to raise here, but it is more serious than that, because we are very dependent on our tourist trade and its development.  We are glad to see so many tourists coming to the Galway region and staying there in hotels.  We are also glad to see tourists coming on bus tours.  That is the difficulty.  There are no facilities in Leenane and Clifden and other towns and the bus conductors are placed in an embarrassing position. The Minister for Transport and Power is charged with responsibility for tourism and he has said that the lack of public conveniences is a serious <Col N="563" /> matter which is affecting our tourist trade.  The Minister for Local Government has also a responsibility in this matter.  Each item which affects the general economic development of the country is a matter in which he should take an interest, and if he sees that the local authorities are slow to act, he should bring to their notice the serious situation caused by the lack of such facilities as I have mentioned and urge them to rectify the situation. Couriers on CIE buses have said that it would be a great blessing to them if public conveniences were provided in the small towns in Connemara.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to swimming pools.  He knows that swimming pools have a special place in my heart.  Last year I was a bit disappointed that he did not accede to my request and meet a deputation from the Irish Amateur Swimming Association to discuss his plans for swimming pools in Ireland.  They are a very responsible body, representing the four provinces. They meet fairly often in Dublin to promote swimming and lifesaving. The Minister brought out his plan which is known as the &ldquo;Blaney Pool&rdquo;.  This body which is responsible for 90 per cent of the competent swimmers in the country wanted to meet the Minister to discuss the question of swimming pools.  Unfortunately, he did not think that would serve any useful purpose.  I want to ask him now to consider that decision and to meet a group representative of the Irish Amateur Swimming Association before they hold their annual general meeting within the next month or so.</P>
    <P>It is all very well to say: &ldquo;Provide cheap swimming facilities and the children will be taught how to swim and everyone will be happy&rdquo; and to come up with a plan costing £16,000. I have swum in this pool: the children of Longford enjoy it and I am sure their parents are very happy that they have facilities in the town for their children to be taught how to swim. But you cannot compare Longford with Dublin or Cork or Galway.  The Minister himself has told us in Galway that we can expect the population to be 52,000 in Galway by 1980.  If <Col N="564" /> that is so, we are certainly not going to build a pool now that will accommodate the population we expect to have in the near future.</P>
    <P>There are many technical points on which I do not want to speak concerning the pool in Longford which is certainly a great asset to that town but I put it to the Minister: does he not think that bigger pools are necessary in Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway?  If he does not, let him meet responsible representatives of the Irish Amateur Swimming Association and if he can prove his point&mdash;fair enough: we will accept it.  It would be a nice gesture even at this late stage if he would agree to meet them.  The main point they are anxious to discuss is the provision of bigger pools in the four centres I have mentioned.  Any town of 5,000 or 10,000 population that does not build a &ldquo;Blaney Pool&rdquo; or cannot afford it is not worth its salt.  The Minister has shown them how.  If they cannot raise £16,000 they can throw their hat at it.</P>
    <P>Shortly after coming to this House, I mentioned to the Minister here the necessity to extend the postal vote. It was discussed at various stages and eventually a Fine Gael Private Members' Bill was brought in and I was very pleased to hear the Minister say that he accepted the idea that extension was necessary and that he would look into the matter and would probably set up a group of people to make recommendations on it.  I am sorry he did not mention it in his speech but I should like him to refer to any progress there has been on these lines when replying.  Several types of people were mentioned by different Deputies but it is up to the Minister to say how many he will be able to include.  Certainly, commercial travellers should be seriously considered and the postal vote extended to them.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the fire services.  At present I understand there is no central training establishment where firemen can be completely trained but we have chief fire officers who are usually qualified engineers and there is a move now to appoint in each fire brigade a fire prevention officer.  But from people who know I <Col N="565" /> understand that due to lack of suitably trained men, it has been found necessary to appoint engineers to these posts and that some of the men who are appointed, although qualified Bachelors of Engineering have had no previous experience in fire prevention and as they progress in this work they tend to leave the service for greater pay.  I suggest that a course should be established which would be suitable for technicians or boys who can get the group certificate in the technical schools and that there should be a central training establishment where they could be trained in fire prevention and go on from there to become second officers and station officers. Through that system we could build up a fine fire prevention system.</P>
    <P>Many young engineers leaving the university have approached me about the use of aerial surveys by the Department. These young men feel that they are qualified to do the work carried out by aerial surveys which are expensive if speedy and that potential employment is being denied to them through the use of consultative aerial survey firms.  I should like to ask the Minister whether he feels at present when our building programme is not expanding at the rate we would like to achieve and where the engineers, especially the younger onces, are forced to emigrate, that some of the jobs that are being done by aerial survey could be done by young engineers and that they should not be denied this opportunity of employment at home.  I do not think we are in such a great hurry for those surveys.</P>
    <P>I should like to direct the attention of the Minister to a problem in the Aran Islands and that is the question of the Aran Islands lifeboat and the shipway there which was provided very many years ago by the former Royal Lifeboat Society.  The slipway was built for a smaller boat and when the new lifeboat there is being used they have to get half the village to push it up the slip.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that to be <Col N="566" /> the case but unfortunately nobody wants to accept responsibility for improving it.  I ask the Minister to instruct the local authority to investigate the matter fully and carry out the necessary repairs as the people in Aran are confused since nobody will accept responsibility for these repairs.  Perhaps the Minister would kindly assist in that small matter so that the village would be allowed to go about its daily work instead of being called to assist in bringing up the lifeboat whenever it is needed.</P>

      <P>I am glad that the circulation of the answers to the questions put to the Minister for Local Government today has obviated the necessity of raising the subject matter of these questions on the Adjournment. The Minister knows I do not agree with him on whether or not these answers, which I feel are simple answers, should have been given orally in the House rather than circulated in the Official Report by permission of the Chair.  However, since the answers are now in my hands, they can be dealt with at this stage.  It is a pity the Minister should put Dáil Éireann in the position of existing on the basis of coincidence, the coincidence that the Estimate for Local Government should be under discussion and that his answers can be discussed thereon.  I should like to make my contribution to this debate now and include therein a discussion of the answers given to these questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position in regard to housing and local government can hardly be viewed as a one-year operation, and I believe one must take into account the period from 1957 onwards.  The manner of curing the credit squeeze situation at that time&mdash;it was the job of the present Administration after the defeat of the second inter-Party Government&mdash;was to stop housing and necessary expenditure on main arterial roads.  The results of that can be seen by the Parliamentary Secretary if he looks at the White Paper he was scrutinising earliers today.  He will find that his Party from 1957 onwards each year built fewer than half as many houses as were built in <Col N="567" /> the worst year of that credit squeeze. It was only when things looked a bit better two and a half or three years ago that the impetus on our housing operations and on expenditure on main arterial roads was resumed by the Fianna Fáil Government.  The fact that another credit squeeze coincided with their pressing the accelerator is something we must be very sad about.</P>
    <P>The Minister can be described as extremely suave when he produced an estimate which seemed to run on welloiled wheels.  Deputies who are not members of local authorities might well believe from the figures presented that everything in the garden is rosy, that the Government are doing a good job, that those who are critical of them in this respect are being dishonest.  I propose now, by example in relation to my area, to show that this is not so, that, in fact, the remedies used in 1959, 1960, 1961 and 1962 by the Government to cure the consequences of the previous credit squeeze caused by world recession are now being used again and that if one takes into account the fall in the value of money, the slowing up of housing and the cutting of expenditure on main arterial roads is the weapon and the tool being used.</P>
    <P>Let us examine first of all the expenditure on main arterial roads.  On today's Order Paper are Questions Nos. 14 and 15 in my name dealing with roads.  I asked for the figure of the allocations made to local authorities for all roads during the period 1966-67 and for the amount paid up to this date.  In Question No. 15 I asked for similar information in relation to Louth County Council.  This is early October and much of the expenditure on main arterial road-building, whether by contract or direct labour, most of the tarring and surfacing, would have been done in the months past.</P>
    <P>The information I received was that the allocation to road authorities for the entire year was £9.273 million and that paid out to date is the sum of £1,606,139.  In relation to Louth there was allocated the sum of £108,156.  To date, with six months of the financial year gone&mdash;the six months of spring <Col N="568" /> and summer during which the greater part of the expenditure would have been made&mdash;Louth County Council have received out of that allocation from the Department of Local Government only £13,911.  Ordinary Deputies, without the sources of Departmental information, unless they embarked months ago on a series of Parliamentary questions, would find it impossible to get the information covering the whole country but each Deputy can relate these figures to his own area and if he does so he cannot be accused of arbitarily picking the areas where the money was not spent.</P>
    <P>Surely if I can relate this information to County Louth, other Deputies can relate it to the areas with which they are intimately concerned.  The position in Louth has been that during a number of years major work has been done on the main road passing through Louth, through Drogheda and Dundalk to the Border.  The Monasterboice stretch cost £100,000 and last year the Greenmount stretch was done costing somewhat less than £100,000. Previously we dealt with the Carrickarnon stretch going through the Border. Now, north of Drogheda, we have had to spend £2,000 patching, with county council workers engaged permanently during a period of six or seven years. This stretch of road was to have been done but it is not to be done this year. Whether the county council sat down on the job or, conveniently, the Department were not furnished with plans quickly enough, or whether the Government have indicated there is no hope of getting money for this work I do not know.  The fact is that a £100,000 job on a main road in Louth is not being done this year.  An extra grant was made in respect of the road leading to Greenore Port.  That work is being carried out, albeit delayed.</P>
    <P>At this stage one must face the fact that it looks unlikely the £108,000 voted for Louth County Council will be spent in this financial year.  That means of course that in relation to the money being voted, the Government are forgetting about the fall in the value of money.  They attempt to get out the side door by replying that <Col N="569" /> it is a question of having plans approved, of engineers agreeing.  Whatever the cause of the delays, whether they be coincidental or deliberate, we must face the fact that real expenditure has been cut to nought and that the result will be there will be far more unemployment and far more worry in the future.</P>
    <P>Today also I asked Questions Nos. 9 to 12 in relation to allocations made and amounts paid out for housing to all local authorities.  Again, we must remember that the summer period has passed and that the greater part of the building for the year has been done. The reply I got was that £18,312,600 was voted and that to date, with the winter on us, only £8,025,529 has been expended.  That is a better proportion than in the case of roads.  However, I should like to give an example of the allocations in relation to housing.  I shall take account of the Louth area in respect of which it is my business as a public representative to be intimately concerned, including the affairs of the three local authorities&mdash;the county council and the Drogheda and Dundalk urban authorities.  The allocation for Drogheda local authority housing for this year was £170,000 but if the contractor building the houses at Ballsgrove finishes the houses before 31st March next, he will be entitled to £240,000.  In other words, the allocation was inadequate and the builder is faced with a deficit in the payments made to him or he is dependent on the Minister making an extra allocation.  As an alternative, he could make sure that the houses would be delayed well into the next financial year.</P>
    <P>The allocation for Dundalk was £160,000 and the builder there, who happens to be the builder concerned in Drogheda, will be left, if he finishes before 31st March next, with a deficit of £60,000.  If he has an eye in his head and a brain in it as well, it is his business to knock off workers, to slow down the building and see that the houses, so badly needed by families with four and five children, will not be completed until well into the next financial year or possibly until the end of it.</P>
    <P>Let us consider in detail the position <Col N="570" /> in Louth County Council area.  Under the 1965 agreement scheme for rural cottages&mdash;we call it an agreement scheme because in the rural areas we never had to resort to compulsory acquisition&mdash;a scheme was carried out at Cockle Hill near Dundalk for a small number of houses.  That was an existing commitment for £18,000 and the allocation in respect of new work was £40,000, a total of £58,000.  That left us in the position that the agreement scheme for 1965 that was not built in 1965 could be built in 1966, but the 40 sites we had in 1966 for building could not be built, nor could a scheme at Dunleer or a scheme at Ardee be undertaken.  There was considerable public outcry and local grief because of this situation.  The Minister in his extra allocations saw fit to give £35,000 for local authority housing in Louth County Council area on the undertaking that Louth County Council would begin the Dunleer and the Ardee schemes.  That leaves us with our 40 cottage sites waiting to be dealt with well into the next financial year.</P>
    <P>Let us consider the position in relation to that financial year.  The total cost of the Dunleer and the Ardee schemes is approximately&mdash;I use the word &ldquo;approximately&rdquo; because our contractor has indicated he is not going on and there may be some slight increase because we may have to give it to the second best man&mdash;£117,480, being £83,979 for Dunleer and £33,501 for Ardee.  With an allocation of £58,000 this year we find that a balance of £82,480 enters into the next financial year after March 31st, 1967. The following has been indicated to local authorities in the Department circular dated 27th March, 1966, and I quote from page 1 of the circular:</P>
    <P>... and may assume that the capital allocation for payments in 1967-68 will be of the same general order as in 1966-67.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaugeBrennan" hpid="Mr. P. Brennan Mr. P. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that was for house purchase loans and supplementary grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not say so, but if the Parliamentary Secretary <Col N="571" /> wishes to indicate that to me, I shall certainly take the point.  However, the fact I am trying to press home is that in our county of Louth, in Drogheda town, we have a situation where a contractor must slow up his work and allow £70,000 worth of the work to go into the next financial year. We have a situation where in respect of two schemes&mdash;I am delighted to say started even by this contrivance&mdash;a figure of £82,480 impinges immediately on the next financial year, and in the Dundalk urban area, a figure of £60,000 goes into the next financial year.  If that is not delay, if that is not deliberately impeding the work of the local authority, I do not know what it is.</P>
      <P>The Minister has glibly explained the situation.  However, if every Deputy who belongs to a local authority keeps his files and his circulars and relates his cash allocation and cash forwarded to his local authority to the forecasts and undertakings given for the financial year he will find that in every case there has been a slowing down and that a great amount of work has been pushed back into the next financial year.  These are facts that cannot be refuted.  These are facts that have come from the Department's circulars to the Louth County Council, Drogheda Corporation and Dundalk Urban District Council.  This is a pattern that can be indicated by any Deputy who keeps his files and does his homework.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like now to deal with our position in Louth County Council area in regard to sewerage and water schemes.  The allocation this year was £10,000.  We decided some years ago the best thing to do was to engage consultant engineers to prepare a general plan for the county indicating the most economic and efficient manner of producing regional water schemes and indicating where there should be group water schemes for the county. There were four of these men because we felt we would get our information quicker, if we had more than one. They finished their work and produced their bills.  The consultants' fees amounted to £20,000.  Our allocation for sewerage in Louth County Council <Col N="572" /> this year is £10,000, so the best we can do is to pay the consultant engineer's fees and nothing else.</P>
    <P>I have many letters on this subject. I signed a letter tonight while I was waiting here in relation to a contractor of a group water scheme who is on the point of being sued because there is no money available.  A county councillor in Louth has been sued in respect of a group water scheme.  There was a meeting and all his neighbours came and put up the amount of money necessary.  They must now await the payment of the grant.</P>
    <P>I challenge the Minister to refute one fact in my speech.  The Minister, of course, is extremely glib in answering questions.  The matter of supplementary grants is dealt with in Question No. 53 which I asked on 27th September, 1966, when I inquired what could be done about supplementary housing and reconstruction grants where there was a delay for as long as 18 months.  The Minister indicated that Louth County Council had been remiss, that they had not sought the money for three or four months. During supplementaries, he said this may have been because of the bank strike.</P>
    <P>At Question Time today, he again produced this bank strike.  I do not know what effect the bank strike had on officials of the local councils and of the Department.  I know that in other cases during the bank strike, business had to carry on.  The money went from the supermarket to the factory and the factory paid out the money to the workers; the money went back into the public houses and the supermarkets.  This whole circulation went on during the bank strike and no doubt Louth County Council and other local authorities had to do the same sort of thing.  They had to pay their employees by cheque and the local pub held the cheque for three or four months, or else they had to seek cash.</P>
    <P>I am not interested in that situation but I do want to say that, notwithstanding the answer to this question which indicates that Louth County <Col N="573" /> Council were very remiss, I am ready to stand in Dáil Éireann now and say that in relation to supplementary grants for reconstruction and new houses the delay in the Louth County Council area has been as long as 18 months and that I know of individual water grants in connection with which the delay has been from 18 months to two years.  In one case where a man was owed £61, this grant of £61 was left on the long finger for as long as two years because they knew the man would not die for want of it.  These are irrefutable facts.</P>

      <P>What I am saying to the Parliamentary Secretary, with respect to you, Sir, is that because the grant of £61 was a small grant, the local authority felt the fellow would not be in a bad way if it was not paid, and they left it on the long finger and were paying out the larger grants.  I am saying, and I refuse to be contradicted by the Parliamentary Secretary, that the delay in the payment of reconstruction grants and supplementary grants for new houses in the ordinary case where the full amount of money was payable was as long as 18 months.  Let the Parliamentary Secretary take a note of it and get his Minister to reply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared immediately, of course, to concede to the Minister and to the Government that there was a complete fall down of bridging finance.  I am prepared to concede that the normal procedure was, with the Louth County Council or any other local authority, that they went to one of the commercial banks and said, &ldquo;There is our allocation until March 31st next&rdquo; and on that basis were given temporary overdraft accommodation which carried them over until the money came from the Department. I immediately concede that if that stops, as it must stop, there must be some delay but I am not convinced that this delay was not deliberate.  I am not convinced that the question as to whether or not that bridging finance would be granted was not a question to be discussed between the Central Bank and the Taoiseach or whether or not the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach had a word in it because it seems to me that this bridging finance was something that in ordinary commercial banking could have been carried on, in part at least, but that the policy was strictly laid down and the situation was that it was completely and absolutely cut down and removed. I say that the deliberate intention in this regard was to stop housing and I do not think that this was the policy of the commercial banks.  I think this was the policy of the Government just as it was the policy of the Government in 1958, 1959 and 1960.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take the present situation of the man starting to build his own house. The strict policy in relation to this bridging finance is that if an application for short term finance for a man building his own house until his local authority loan and grant are forthcoming, is made to the head office of a commercial bank it will be immediately refused.  No matter what security there is, it will be refused.  This, in my view, is the result of deliberate intervention by the Government.  There have been cases where local bank managers, having the discretion to give up to £400, have given people trying to build their own houses £400 as bridging, to carry them through, but the man who wants to build his own house today in <Col N="575" /> my local authority area at least must be prepared to wait 12 months before he gets the first half of his loan.  No matter how quickly he builds his house, it will be perhaps another six months or nine months before he gets the other half.  When he comes for a supplementary grant to the Louth County Council or any other local authority he may find that he has an even longer wait.</P>
    <P>Builders' providers cannot provide any more extended credit and the situation is, and I believe the deliberate intention is, that nobody can start to build his own house because this bridging finance has been removed and this delay has been instituted.  The ordinary man wishing to get married and to build a house who has not money in the order of £1,500 and £2,000 to carry him through will find that this deliberate delay is in operation.</P>
    <P>No matter what the Minister for Local Government may indicate in relation to his efforts and in relation to the amount of money voted in his Department for housing, there is one thing that he has not done: he has not moved the upper limit to which the subsidy refers.  At present you can get a 66? per cent subsidy from the Department of Local Government for the building of a local authority house under certain circumstances up to a maximum limit of £1,650.  When the limit was raised from £1,450 to £1,650 a local authority house could have been built for about £2,000.  So that the effect was that the tenant going into the house bore only about £350 of 100 per cent in repayment of principal and interest.  A similar house today costs in the order of £2,800 to £3,000. That means that whereas a few years ago the Government were bearing a 66? subsidy on approximately 85 per cent of the cost of the house, they are now bearing a two-thirds subsidy on 50 per cent of the cost of the house. That is the reason for all the trouble about rents.</P>
    <P>In my view, this, again, is something that is restrictive, that is a question of policy.  If you are in government you <Col N="576" /> have to decide your priorities.  Is housing a priority?  I believe that but for the present credit squeeze which cannot be, as it was before, related to world conditions, but can be related to a squandermania on the part of the Government and the deliberate institution of inflation by the Government, the Government would have desired to have housing as one of their priorities but that when the situation arose that something had to be cut down and there had to be a bloodletting of the economy, which seemed at that stage to be suffering from anaemia, the obvious place for the bloodletting was the building industry and the slowing down of the building of main arterial roads and that, in fact, this is exactly what the Government did.</P>
    <P>I should like now to discuss the question of the Road Traffic Act which is on the way and which was discussed by the Minister in his introductory statement.  Something that has not been said about this is that we must accept the fact that the flow of traffic must be improved and that in most cases we cannot afford, and can never afford, to remove the whole sides of streets of houses to produce motorways that would <i>ipso facto</i> improve the flow of traffic.  We have all seen on the roads three or four large lorries and trailers which, without being affiliated to the same company, get into convoy and, on a busy road, 20 or 30 private cars behind them.  To pass out is impossible. A straight of half a mile or a mile is required in order to pass the convoy.  There will have to be legislation. The Minister discussed this in his introductory statement.  So, it is in order for us to discuss it now.</P>
    <P>There must be legislation whereby this sort of thing cannot happen and whereby slow drivers will not be in a position, without breaking the law, to impede the ordinary flow of traffic on the roads.  You have to face up to an average speed now of 50 to 60 miles an hour for the ordinary car and of 30 to 40 miles an hour for the heavy lorry.  If there is somebody outside this range, he must conform to normal traffic regulations so that those in the average speed range will not be impeded or have their progress rendered more dangerous because of his being <Col N="577" /> an &ldquo;odd-bod&rdquo;.  We have to see to it that these convoys of lorries are broken up and driven individually so as to make the greatest ease for private cars passing out.  Frustration and impatience make for bad driving.  There is danger in passing out a long line of traffic.  There is no reason why these lorries and trailers should get themselves into a convoy.</P>
    <P>At the moment there is no real examination of vehicles for road-worthiness. When somebody is charged with careless or dangerous driving, the garda either goes out the following morning or makes an on-the-spot examination for road-worthiness.  We have all had the experience of seeing on the roads vehicles we knew were dangerous, just staggering along, liable to cause an accident at any moment. This must be faced up to and regulations must be there.  There must be an acceptance of the fact that even if the improvement of our arterial roads had not been slowed down by the Government, even if there had been no credit squeeze and no &ldquo;stop-go&rdquo; economy, we have no hope of bringing our roads to the standard the increasing jam of traffic shows to be necessary. Better driving, better maintenance of vehicles, better supervision of the road-worthiness of vehicles and more sensible regulations must be the order of the day.  Whatever happens, our roads will be overcrowded, because of the type of roads they are, for the next two decades.</P>
    <P>The other day I was caught for parking in the wrong place in Dublin.  It is the first time it happened to me, although I parked in the wrong place more than once.  I am sure many others here could say the same thing.  I found the whole business of on-the-spot fines, a fellow giving you a ticket, saying: &ldquo;There is the white mark; you are on this side of it&rdquo; most improper.  I hate making a personal attack on anybody and I do not want this to be regarded as a personal attack.  I regard this on-the-spot system as something that could only have emanated from the brains of the Minister for Local Government, the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Justice, to whom I used to refer here as &ldquo;slick chicks&rdquo; but who <Col N="578" /> are, like myself, becoming too long in the tooth to be referred to as such anymore.  It is a bad business.  It may be irritating to have to get a solicitor to represent you in court. It is not in keeping with our Irish character or concept of justice.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The level of grants for private housing has not been changed for many years, with the exception of the small farmer's grant.  For the expenditure there is on the small farmer's grant and the grant for the person passed for rehousing in the rural areas, I feel the State and the local authorities have been spared a great amount of eventual expense.  The figures might indicate that a lot is being spent, but many houses are being built that could not otherwise be built.  People in rural areas find that if they get the bare <Col N="579" /> minimum for a five-roomed bungalow with water and sewerage, they can build the house for something under £2,500.  This £900 total grant was a good step forward: it was long overdue. Far longer overdue is an increase in the amount of grant to those who cannot avail of the small farmer's grant.</P>
    <P>A grant of £600 in an urban area is very inadequate.  A house costs now a minimum of £2,800 to £3,000.  We must face the fact that these increases are necessary.  It is just like the increase that has not come in the upper level to which the 66? per cent subsidy applies for local authority houses.  We have to face up to the greater expense of building houses and give proportionately larger grants.  All this talk about changes in legislation and about all the different things you want to do fall to the ground if you do not increase the housing grants provided by the Government.</P>
    <P>The Minister has swallowed the anchor and is foursquare for what he calls the &ldquo;rationalisation&rdquo; of rents.  If you look up the Oxford dictionary, you find &ldquo;rationalisation&rdquo; means a certain thing.  If I were at the receiving end, I would be extremely suspicious of being rationalised.  I would not like to be rationalised: it might mean being eliminated.  In business, people who are employed, and indeed employers, find that being rationalised often means you are on the bread line. The rationalisation of rents impinges on something that has been in the thinking of our politicians over the last number of years, that is, that a man's home was his castle.  It was felt that when he paid his rent, with the normal increases that might come from an increase in rates, he might be left to enjoy it.  Over the past few years tenant purchase schemes have been completely discontinued because of the advent of the new Housing Act. I do not know whether this was as the result of a circular from the Minister to the managers or not.  I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary in his own constituency knows that tenant purchase schemes have been suspended for the past few years.</P>

      <P>I mean two years or two and a half years.  These people have not had the opportunity to buy out their houses but many of them have spent a large sum of money on them.  I know many local authority houses which are far more comfortable and luxurious than when the tenants were given the houses.  Take that highly expensive item today, floor covering, and take a local authority house.  If you cover it with expensive carpeting in the living room and upstairs in the bedrooms, then that is a colossal expense.  Carpeting is not something that you can take up and bring off and get the same value elsewhere. The same applies to a new mantelpiece, and so on.  These factors must be taken into account.  If a man goes into a local authority house and has paid the rent for five or ten years, then he should not be told, just because little Maggie has grown up and gone to work in the local factory, that the rent must be rationalised.  I know what the Minister is after, that is, the extremely low rents charged for houses that are perhaps 20 or 25 years old.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;You could always ask&rdquo; is right, but when we believe that the funds have been requested, it seems to me that something is extremely wrong.  This question of rationalisation of rents means that the Minister is after the 20 or 25 year old houses where there is a very small rent.  I suggest that these houses do not, in large part, give the sort of accommodation a new house gives today.  Many of them had no bathrooms when the tenants went into them.  In many instances, baths and hot water systems have been installed by the tenants, even though they could not get a purchase scheme.  That meant expenditure by the tenant.  He is now to be asked to pay an increased rent for a 20 or 25 years' old house where the amount of painting or repairs done by the local authority was the minimum and where, if he desired to keep his house at the sort of standard he would wish, it was necessary for him, as well as paying the low rent, to spend quite a lot of money.  This work has been done by people who waited too long for the local authority to paint or repair their <Col N="583" /> houses, or who just wanted a higher standard and were prepared to pay for it.  They will now be asked to pay twice or three times the rent during a period when they have a few sons or daughters working&mdash;sons or daughters who might be saving up to get married or who might be on the point of moving out.  It is at such a time that this high rent is now being sought.</P>
      <P>If the Minister has swallowed the anchor in relation to the rationalisation of rents, I want to swallow the anchor on the other side: in other words, we should not retrospectively touch rents.  A man's home is his castle.  He should be given the opportunity, when he has been there a decade or more, of living there, so long as he pays the rent.</P>
      <P>I come now to the matter of the sale of a vested cottage and also the sale of a portion of the garden of a vested cottage.  I have clarified with the Minister, and I am glad to have done so, that it is a decision of the local authority in each individual case, based on section 4 of the City and County Management Act, 1955, that we shall decide, if we disagree with the manager, whether it is one-third the amount of redemption money still outstanding that we shall demand or all, in the event of the sale of a cottage. That is helpful.  In Louth, all was being asked for, without the option of the council in this matter at all.  We were not informed of the position.  I am glad I clarified that with the Minister when the Bill came back from the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was too late to do anything about it but I want to raise now a question in relation to a cottage garden.  Most local authorities were wrong when, ten or 15 years ago, they gave half an acre.  A man who is out working all day has not the energy to look after half an acre of land in his spare time. Very often, these gardens were ill-kept. The quarter acre we now give is a far better size of plot but, in many cases, there was the suggestion that we would build another cottage at the other end of the garden.  A vested cottage owner might be in a position to sell his interest in half his garden. <Col N="584" /> I know that in one case a sum of £183 was asked of that vested cottage owner before he would be given permission to sell it.  The Minister was good enough to clarify the position to me that, if it was a member of his family, no money would be asked for.  In fact, in the particular case, it was his daughter who was married and who desired to get a cottage built on the other half of his garden.  This is an anomaly that must be corrected.  The present situation is quite wrong.  If a man has a garden and wants to sell it back to the county council, there should be no question of the county council bidding him £100 or asking it back for nothing.  In Louth we have a set price per acre so this man would have been at a loss by giving away his garden.  This is an anomaly that should be corrected.</P>
    <P>I have shown what the position is in regard to housing and roads in my constituency.  The fact is the Government are trying to cure the present credit squeeze as they cured an earlier one by the simple expedient of cutting down expenditure on housing and roads.  If they had their priorities right, we would not have the edifices we see in Dublin, built at some extraordinary cost, and families housed in Griffith Barracks at the same time.  There are flats built in Ballsbridge to accommodate people with earnings in the order of tens of thousands per year.</P>

      <P>In this particular instance, the husband eventually went to Dublin and did not build on the plot.  I clarified the position with the Minister when the Bill came back from the Seanad.</P>
      <P>I have given the figures in relation to Louth.  The figure is particularly miserable where sewerage is concerned, remembering that £30,000 is owed to consultant engineers and the allocation is £10,000.  If a contractor finishes his contract in Drogheda before 31st March, 1967, he will be short £70,000.  The same situation will exist in Dundalk.  We have in Louth a scheme that will cost well over £100,000 and we have been given £35,000 to start it; £82,480 will fall in the next financial year.  Our 1966 scheme for cottages has not been implemented at all.  Our 1965 scheme is being carried out this year.  These are the facts.  I refuse to allow anybody to say they are not.  The Government are saving on housing and roads. That is their method of curing the credit squeeze.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>This Estimate attracts a good deal of attention because it affects every Deputy representing every constituency in the country.  One must compliment the Minister on the subtlety of his approach.  He gave the impression in his introductory statement that everything in the garden is lovely and that, in the year 1965-66 we were faced with some trivial difficulties, and, in the year 1966-67, we will go ahead and do wonders in the matter of providing houses.  The Minister, like many other Ministers, has a conveniently short memory.  He forgets what happened in the past two years.  At column 50 of volume 224 of the Official Report, the Minister says:</P>
      <P>The total number of houses completed by housing authorities and grant-aided private enterprise in 1965-66 was slightly over 11,000 which is about twice the number provided four years ago and about 1,000 above the provisional Second Programme target figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="586" /> Is the Minister aware that in the year 1951-52 in Dublin alone 2,500 houses were erected by local authorities? Almost 3,000 were completed by speculative builders.  That was some 15 years ago.  In Dublin alone we had over 5,000 dwellings completed, over half the total given by the Minister when introducing this Estimate.  From a casual reading of the Minister's speech, one might think we were advancing. If the rate of progress in 1965-66 is less than that of 15 years ago, I do not think that is anything to boast about.</P>
    <P>Again, at column 50, the Minister said that, even though we were providing a record sum for housing and other services, there was just not enough to ensure that commitments in respect of all the works coming forward would be met.</P>
    <P>He said:</P>
    <P>This meant that in the latter half of last year and the early part of the present year we had to hold back sanction to certain tenders in respect of which expenditure arising in the current year could not be met from the original allocation.</P>
    <P>That is a beautiful statement from the Minister.  Compare that statement with the repeated assurances given in this House towards the end of last year that there would be no hold-up in money and no hold-up in sanction and work could go ahead.  Simultaneously with giving those assurances, the Minister was aware of the situation. In the second last month of last year, the Minister was compelled, through force of circumstances, to admit delay in sanction, delay affecting the housing programme not only in the city of Dublin but in other parts of the country as well, and he was compelled to admit that that delay was due to shortage of money.  At that time the Minister was most apologetic and most reasonable when he was talking to the representatives of local authorities who met him.  He was most disarming in explaining his difficulties and in pointing out that it was not really his fault but that the terror of all Ministers, the Minister for Finance, was preventing him from carrying on on the lines on which he was anxious to go.  The Minister <Col N="587" /> in his statement on this Estimate made two very serious statements and, certainly from the point of view of those in need of houses in the city and country, two very damaging statements, as far as his ministry and the Government are concerned.</P>
    <P>It may be that some people think that the problem of housing has been thrashed out too often in this House and perhaps in some quarters it is felt that Deputies should not repeatedly raise the question of providing dwellings, that they are hammering this point too much.  However, the Deputies who raised this matter in this and other debates are not considering houses and flats from the point of view of numbers on a chart but from their experience, either as Deputies or representatives of a local authority, of the hardship and suffering which thousands of their fellow-citizens are undergoing because they do not have adequate homes of their own.  It was mentioned earlier that in 1948 the estimated requirement in Dublin city was 30,000 dwellings and the plan was to provide over 3,000 dwellings per year over ten years to deal with these needs. The plan started fairly well and got going until in 1951-52 it reached a total output of 2,500 local authority dwellings, plus the dwellings provided by private enterprise.  Unfortunately, in 1952 we were inflicted with another Fianna Fáil Minister for Local Government, Deputy Smith, who proceeded to stop the graph from rising further.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaugeBrennan" hpid="Mr. P. Brennan Mr. P. Brennan">

    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not correct.  In 1951-52, those dwellings had been contracted for and were in course of construction. They were finished in that year.  The decision to build them was already in operation and the graph was rising.  When Deputy Smith came in as Minister, he put a little spoke in that <Col N="588" /> wheel.  There was a slow drop until, in 1963 and 1964, we had an all-time low in housing in Dublin under a Fianna Fáil Minister and under the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaugeBrennan" hpid="Mr. P. Brennan Mr. P. Brennan">

    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1963-64.  Look at the figures.  As I was saying, Deputies are approaching this matter not from the point of view of who built so many boxes or did not build them, but from the point of view of how many dwellings were provided and how many dwellings are needed.  One has only to go into the streets of this capital city and into some of the dwellings which are owned and administered by the local authority to realise there is still a desperate housing situation.  The Parliamentary Secretary may agree with me that in 1964 the Minister accepted that there was a need for 15,000 dwellings. At that stage he was explaining with some diffidence&mdash;the diffidence of which only the Minister is capable&mdash;his problems in relation to finance.  A little earlier he had been talking about local authorities not being active enough and saying that the 15,000 dwellings in his view should be provided over a period of five years.  Since that time the target, so far as he is concerned, has changed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Dublin city, there are on the waiting list approved by the city medical officer almost 5,000 applications. That, however, is only in relation to families who have gone through the net.  There are many thousands of families who have not gone through the net and have not yet been approved for housing.  Last year, or the year before, it was accepted by the Minister that there were around 10,000 live applications on the list and that there was a need to plan for 15,000 dwellings. That need still exists.  In addition, there are some 500 or more families of five living in one room.  The Parliamentary Secretary is a man who is fairly familiar with his constituents and with the conditions in which they live but does he realise the problem of a father and mother with three children having to live in one room?  It is not just one bedroom with a separate <Col N="589" /> living-room and a separate toilet and bathroom, but just one room in which there is the entire living accommodation, where the family eat and cook and sleep.  Yet there has been no sense of urgency about this problem evinced by the Government.  If there had been, schemes would not have been held up last year for months.  The holding up of those schemes last year will throw much further into the future the provision of necessary dwellings.</P>
    <P>Will the Parliamentary Secretary come with me and visit some of the areas in which those people are living? Will he come to Corporation Place, Keogh Square, Marshalsea Barracks or will he venture into Benburb Street to see where families are living?  Will he then go back to the Minister and say to him: &ldquo;Those are Irish men and women; those are Irish children.&rdquo; Whatever about our hotels in Ballsbridge, whatever about our modern flats for which they are charging a rent of £20 and £30 a week, whatever about our gimmicks here and there, let us determine once and for all to wipe those type of dwellings off the face of the earth and provide decent accommodation for our people.</P>
    <P>Will the Parliamentary Secretary come with me to some of our housing estates where there are subtenants with families of grown-up children, boys and girls 17, 18 and 19 years old, young men and women who normally would be looking forward to getting married and having a home of their own but who are still compelled to live there with a married son and his wife and maybe one or two children or a married sister and her husband and one or two children living in a single room in one of those local authority dwellings which were designed only for a single family?  They were designed, mark you, at no time with any great regard for family living.  Let us face it, the local authority dwellings that are there for many years were built on a basis of almost putting people into the smallest space in which they could live and in which the family could exist.</P>
    <P>Will the Parliamentary Secretary come with me to some of those houses and meet some of those people in my <Col N="590" /> constituency or in Deputy Cluskey's constituency?  There may be some of the same type of houses in the Parliamentary Secretary's constituency.  Will he come with me to those houses and then go back to the Minister and say to him: &ldquo;This is a No. 1 priority?&rdquo; Those are not some of the much vaunted unit type buildings in the Ballymun scheme which we are concerned with.  Those are Irish men and women and those are Irish children.</P>
    <P>Surely it is time in the year 1966, the Dáil having had control over affairs for a great number of years, that at least this particular problem should have been dealt with to a greater extent than it has been.  I will repeat to the Minister, now that he has come into the House, that the position today is a reflection on the Minister for Local Government, on this Government, and, in fact, on the whole House.</P>
    <P>We have in Dublin a system called the newly-weds scheme to try to provide some dwellings for lads and girls newly married.  This was introduced many years ago and for the first few years the position was, because of certain circumstances, that newly-weds included almost families with two and three children.  During the 1963 housing emergency this was suspended.  It was restarted this year and there were 3,000 applicants, people who put forward their names to go into a drum, not to draw a prize in the Sweep, not to win a prize at Bingo but to get the privilege of having a house for which they were going to pay rent, the privilege of living in a house in their own city.  Out of the names of 3,000 applicants which went into that drum 200 were drawn and it will be some time before that number can be offered accommodation.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier that we appear at this point of time not to be making a great deal of progress.  This can be borne out by even the latest figures for local authority housing in the city of Dublin.  At the end of September, the latest time for which information is available, there were 509 houses under construction and 500 flats, that is excluding the Ballymun scheme which I will deal with presently.</P>
    <P>The Government have been in office <Col N="591" /> since 1957.  There were 4,000 dwellings under construction in 1951, that is four times as many as 15 years ago.  Deputy Seán Dunne said that the Government were in some state of somnolence.  It appears to me that there must have been a few sleeping beauties knocking around this House for a number of years.  Those figures are for the city of Dublin alone.  The Minister can query Deputies from every part of the country who are in other local authorities regarding what the situation is.</P>
    <P>In regard to loans there has been some increase in the amount of money to be allocated.  We must remember this.  The value of that money has been going down steadily and £5 million in 1951 provided three times as many dwellings as it would provide today.  Therefore, when we are talking about housing, particularly in terms of money, we must relate it to the depreciation in the value of money. At that particular time local authority houses cost around £1,200, may be a little bit more.  The average house today costs £2,700.  Therefore, in terms of real money and expenditure £9 million today represents £4 million in 1951.</P>
    <P>I am not speaking about this Government versus the inter-Party Government nor am I employing that kind of argument because that has been paraded around the House, back and forth, until Deputies have got sick and tired of it.  I am speaking about the fact that this Government, who have been responsible for those matters over a long number of years, have failed to take steps to deal with this situation.  As I said the number of local authority houses under construction in the city of Dublin at the end of September was 509 and there were also 500 flats.  The estimate on the 14th September showed that of those houses and flats under construction during the month of October 52 houses and 82 flats would be handed over, in November 35 houses and 62 flats and in December 23 houses and 62 flats.  Of course, there may be a delay, just as it was stated earlier that there was a delay in the handing over <Col N="592" /> of houses in Ballymun.  Those things happen because there may be circumstances which cause the delay but if the Estimate given on that particular date proves to be accurate, it means that the number of dwellings under construction at the end of this year will have dropped to 689.</P>
    <P>It is true that there are some provisions for site development to come forward some time next year.  But, anyone who knows anything about the subject knows that in the handing over of houses, if you expect to get 1,000 houses handed over in a year, you must have about 2,500 houses under construction.  That is the way it works. In 1964, mind you, there were 1,900 dwellings actually under construction. We reached that point&mdash;1,900.  In 1966, there are 1,000, just 1,000, and at the end of this year in Dublin alone, there will be less than 700.  The responsibilities for this situation must be borne and accepted by the Department of Local Government and the Minister. There are delays in sanctions, decisions on applications for compulsory purchase orders, and so on.</P>
    <P>Of course, we have Ballymun.  I am sure the Minister will forgive me if I recall to his mind his repeated assurances that Ballymun and the production of dwellings there were to be supplemental to the efforts of the local authority; they were to be in addition. There was going to be a little bit of jam on the bread, to make it easier for all those people clamouring for dwellings to get them at an early date. I have expressed the view on more than one occasion as to whether, in fact, the word should have been not &ldquo;supplemental&rdquo; but &ldquo;substitution&rdquo;. We find from a report of the Ballymun position that to date there are 112 handed over.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the Minister was chivvied on many occasions in this House as to why houses were not handed over on the dates originally announced by him or on subsequent dates.  I think, in fairness to the Minister on this matter of housing, we should try to get a balanced and a reasonable view.  To be fair to him on that particular point, the winter of last year as far as that area was concerned <Col N="593" /> was very bad.  I saw the conditions in which the men were endeavouring to build houses and lay the foundations of flats out there.  Quite clearly, the master on that occasion would have been master of any Minister or of any Government&mdash;the weather.  The mud was up to 18 inches deep.</P>
    <P>I am quite prepared to agree as regards that particular aspect of the matter, that we may have been a bit unfair in holding the Minister to his earlier assurance.  We find there are 112 being handed over.  I understand the Minister has said that it is estimated that a total of 452 houses and 311 flats will be handed over by the end of this year.  That means all the houses in the scheme.  Mind you, one of the aspects in the provision of dwellings is that you need to have a lot of houses under construction if you are to move fast.  We know they are moving fast with the flats in Ballymun but that is the only scheme with that particular type of construction that is under way.</P>
    <P>While I am on Ballymun might, I refer to some of the Minister's comments in the course of this debate.  The Minister says in volume 224 page 60:</P>
    <P>I have inspected in every detail the present stage of site operations and contract management.  It is an exhilarating exercise for anyone to do so, not merely because of the physical expression by volume of our hopes for housing in Dublin but also because of the character of the housing and its attractive environmental setting.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister considers that the houses were a particularly great attraction, but I do wish, in relation to those houses in Ballymun, aside from the comments made here today, to refer to the danger of the houses falling if anybody tries to hammer a nail into the wall.  In justice, I must say every tenant is given detailed information because of the construction of the houses&mdash;you cannot hammer nails into the walls <i>ad lib</i> if you want to hang pictures or coats. If they follow the instructions given to them, they should avoid going in next door.  One of the matters I had occasion to comment on, and I am sure <Col N="594" /> the Minister is aware of it, is the design of the houses so far as the housewife is concerned.</P>
    <P>There are three types of houses.  One type has a kitchen.  I happen to be a married man, as most other Deputies are, and my wife is familiar with, and works in, the kitchen.  There is no woman small enough to swing a cat in it, and this is 1966.  The kitchen is approximately eight feet by five feet, with a door at opposite corners and a sink opposite the door she goes in, and a place for a cooker on the other side.  If the housewife is in the kitchen during the weather we get here and if there is any door open, she is in a draught and might even get pneumonia.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The gas might go out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is an electric stove in those houses.</P>
      <P>It is true that these plans were passed by the corporation of which I have the honour to be a member.  They were not designed by any local authority architect, to my knowledge.  They were designed by architects attached to the consortium and were approved by architects of the National Building Agency and architects of the Department of Local Government.  Might I suggest that in relation to any other such schemes as this, the Minister might, as he is expert in setting up bodies of consultants, planning consultants, housing consultants and advisory bodies of all kinds, take the trouble to get a few intelligent house-wives and consult them about the type of kitchen a woman should work in.  That is one type.  Complaints were made, but little was done about them.</P>
      <P>In the second type, the kitchen opens off the livingroom and there is no exterior door to the kitchen.  If anybody calls to the back door or the front door, the housewife has to leave the kitchen, go out through the livingroom, backwards and forwards.  That was not very attractive, to my mind.  Of course I am a mere man, but when I described it to my wife she was horrified to think that this type of plan should be passed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come now to the third type and this is the interesting one.  It is quite <Col N="595" /> reasonable from this point of view: there is a reasonable approach to the kitchen and other rooms.  The kitchen is of reasonable size, but it costs a little more and, because of protests to the local authority, this type of house was dropped from the scheme.  It appears only in area A; it does not appear in area B or C.  The aspect of this which appeals to me as being worthy of examination is this: if a private builder submitted plans which provided a kitchen of this type, or provided a kitchen with no outside entry, whether there would not be somebody in the Department of Local Government or some achitect in the local authority who would say: &ldquo;Look, this would not appear to be reasonable for housing a family.&rdquo;  The second aspect of this is that it was known to all concerned that this was the largest accommodation being provided on the Ballymun site and would normally be used to cater for large families.  The question of whether or not the houses will stand up must be left for the future to decide.</P>
    <P>Evidently, from the experience there and from the experience of costings there, the Minister has been afforded the opportunity to introduce into this question of housing another most unwelcome proposal.  The Minister complains that he was being misrepresented in regard to the question of the rents.  It would be unfair and foolish to endeavour to misrepresent a Minister who has much more attraction from the point of view of the public press than an ordinary Deputy, but there is no doubt whatsoever that the Minister indicated, by word and by circular, that he was concerned that the rents of local authority houses should be fixed on a realistic basis.  Deputy Donegan used the term &ldquo;rational rents&rdquo;.  The term used by the Minister was &ldquo;realistic basis&rdquo; and the reference made by the Minister was that the first consideration should be that the rents be fixed, initially, on the full economic rent, that they should equate with the maximum rent in differential rent schemes and that the maximum of any differential rent scheme for new houses should equate with the full economic <Col N="596" /> rent.  Not only that but, in relation to existing dwellings, the local authorities &mdash;and for this purpose let me spell it out, the city and county managers; they are the gentlemen who fix the rents&mdash;should also fix the maximum differential rents at full economic rent.</P>
    <P>Let us take that a little further&mdash; not even the full economic rent at the time the houses were built, plus the cost of rates or maintenance, but a maximum differential rent which would be related to the cost of providing a similar type of house today.  As I have said, the Minister felt that he had been misrepresented&mdash;but the Dublin City Manager introduced and applied, in respect of the Ballymun houses and all new houses built from that time, rents based on that principle.  He did not do so at the request of the Housing Committee of Dublin Corporation and I hope he did not do so at the request of any elected member of the corporation. I know he got certain support from some members who sit in the same benches as himself.  But the City Manager of Dublin, when he introduced the rents for the Ballymun houses, with a maximum of £4 11s. Od., plus whatever rate adjustment would take place, did so following a circular from the Department of Local Government.</P>
    <P>There are three forms of rents. There is another maximum of somewhere around £3 15s and the City Manager of Dublin has submitted to the Housing Committee, of which I have the honour to be a member, although I was not present at the last meeting, more proposals for increases in rents, what he calls &ldquo;rationalising rents&rdquo;, or ensuring that the 40,000 tenants in Dublin pay a realistic rent. I do not really think the Minister was anxious to see rents increased.  I pay him that tribute but he had a request made to him that the Government should review and bring up the rate of subsidy on corporation dwellings, having regard to the increase in the cost of providing such dwellings over the years.  The maximum subsidy given for a house was £1,650, fixed some years ago when the price of houses was less than £2,000 and the maximum subsidy for flats was £2,000 when you <Col N="597" /> could provide flats for £2,000 or £2,400 on an average; for a four-roomed house, the figure was £2,700 and for a five-roomed flat, £3,000.  I do not know how these costs came about but these are the costs given by the corporation.</P>
    <P>The Minister was asked to look at increases in the subsidy and, although he feels annoyed that somebody should misrepresent him, he did not come back with any suggestions about this and we gather he will not do so, unless and until he is satisfied the local authorities have introduced realistic rents. There are many ways of saying something. You do not have to use the very same terms.  When you want a manager to increase rents, you do not have to say: &ldquo;Increase rents.&rdquo;  You can tell the manager: &ldquo;I am not going to listen to any representations for additional help from the central government for your authority unless you look at these things in a realistic way&rdquo;, and managers&mdash;I have known many managers and I have a high regard for some of them&mdash;under our system of local government always act as a sounding board for the Department of Local Government.</P>
    <P>In this matter of fixing rents managers have the authority, and even section 4 of the 1955 Act would not save the local representatives in this regard, because if you try to use section 4 to stop the manager from fixing rents, he can refer to a circular from the Department of Local Government and say: &ldquo;I am acting only in accordance with the advice tendered to me; I have to refer the matter to the Department&rdquo;, and you are back where you started.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to waste my breath in repeating the appeals I made when the Housing Bill was going through this House in regard to the level of subsidy.  Deputies from these benches appealed often enough to have this matter examined and I do not propose at this stage to waste the time of the House in pointing out the other aspects of housing about which the Minister is evidently not prepared to do anything. I am referring to people who are trying to purchase their own dwellings by getting an increase in the grant <Col N="598" /> which would take into account the increase in the purchase price of the house.</P>
    <P>When a house could be purchased in Dublin city for £2,000, the grant was £285 and the local authority gave 50 per cent above that.  Houses for the ordinary working people are now in the neighbourhood of £3,100 to £3,400. Minor civil servants, local authority officials, postal officials, fire brigade officials and craftsmen, who are finding it increasingly difficult to scrape together the deposit, have to pay prices in that range for a house.  The Government, through the Minister for Local Government, repeatedly express their desire that people should exercise their own initiative and save their money to invest in a house so that they will have a stake in the country and will have accommodation for their families. The Government have permitted the local authorities to increase the amount of their grants, but have they given an extra red cent to the people for whom they express such concern?  Prices have gone up by 50 or 60 per cent, but the grant from the State to people who are anxious to secure their dwellings remains the same.  When the Minister is replying, will he give an indication that if the money is available to him&mdash; and we are all aware that he is not fully master in his own house in this regard&mdash;he will think of these people. I saw in one of our daily papers last week that people were queueing up to put their names down for a house.</P>
    <P>On more than one occasion, the Minister has said that people who are prepared to enter into the responsibility of providing themselves with their own homes relieve the local authority of providing them with dwellings.  They are not getting credit for this in any real way.  It is no good to say to a young man who is about to get married and who has managed either to save or to borrow the deposit: &ldquo;You are a nice chap and we are very happy to see you buying your own house.  You should be admired and supported in every way.  The local authority are providing you with a site and making a grant.  We do not think we should give you a bigger grant than was given to a person buying his house ten or 15 years ago <Col N="599" /> when he had to pay only two-thirds of the price today.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will extend my invitation to him to the Minister to have a look at something of which we in Dublin are by no means proud.  We should have special regard to the position of our old people.  This regard stems, of course, from the natural feeling that our old people should have the security of a roof over their heads and reasonable accommodation. I agree with the Minister that the problems of the elderly cannot be readily solved.  They may not even be solved by providing modern dwellings, or by providing single rooms such as have been provided by the corporation, with kitchenette, toilet, bathroom, etc. Even when you provide up-to-date accommodation, the problem is that the accommodation may be in areas removed from where they have been living.  Numbers of old people are not anxious to be housed in old people's communities.  There are certain voluntary organisations which are doing good work in this regard.</P>
    <P>I have expressed the view that there is one aspect of this matter that might well be examined by the Minister and I am sorry to say that my own local authority have never given it any attention.  The architects think there are problems that cannot be solved.  It may be some small contribution to this evergrowing problem because the average age of our population is increasing all the time.  The percentage of old people in our population is growing and the suggestion I have made previously, and am making in this debate, is that the Minister should have examined the possibility of providing not just a dower house in rural areas but something like a dower room, an additional room in local authority dwellings.  I know of a few cases of people who built their own dwellings and after some time either the father or mother of the young married couple died and the widow or widower had nowhere to go except to seek accommodation in an old peoples home or community.  They did not want to be separated from their families and I know of cases where these people got a loan of money <Col N="600" /> to improve their houses by putting on an additional room which the old person could consider completely his or her own and cut off from the main dwelling.  That meant that contact with the family was not broken.  I agree with the Minister that not only contact with neighbours but frequently contact with their own families must be preserved in the case of the majority of people growing old.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the difficulty having regard to the size of the ordinary local authority dwelling.  In Ballymun, which is an example of progressive thinking, out of 3,000 dwellings there are 450 dwellings of five rooms.  There are some special dwellings for old people but the flats are two-or threeroomed dwellings or at maximum four-roomed dwellings.  In the later schemes carried out by Dublin Corporation about 25 per cent are five-roomed dwellings.  Educating local authority officers both at local and every other level on the need for adequate accommodation has been a very slow process. One might well say that some of the problems we are facing today in this city in other respects may well stem from the fact that there are thousands of growing boys and girls who, even though they are in local dwellings with the essentials so far as heat, hot water, bathroom and bedroom space is concerned provided, they have little space in which to live as part of the family. Because of the size of the dwellings they must spend an increasing proportion of their time as they grow up outside the dwelling.  As a matter of fact, I think tribute should be paid by this House to boys and girls throughout the country attending technical and other schools for the progress they are making in view of the restricted opportunities available to them.</P>
    <P>The Minister is satisfied, according to his Report, that we are moving forward.  Previously we had occasion to complain of the difficulty in making progress at local authority level because of the shortage of technical staff, engineers and architects.  So far as I know there is no great change in that regard and while administrative officials may put on paper great plans <Col N="601" /> and proposals as to how many dwellings will be produced and how many houses and flats you will have, unless there are adequate and competent technical staffs at local level, efforts to do the job will come to nought or will certainly be greatly restricted.  We can get city managers, assistant and deputy city managers but I see no great evidence of an increase in the number of competent engineers and architects.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps that is the problem.  I do not know if the situation has changed in the past three weeks. I went on a short holiday and it may have changed but before I went, Dublin city which with its 600,000 people is supposed to have a housing programme, did not have a city architect. We have not had one for a long time. From the technical point of view I do not know who is going to ensure at local level that the housing programme will have any bite in it if you do not have somebody in charge.</P>
      <P>In the course of the debate, swimming pools were mentioned.  Another Deputy referred to the &ldquo;Blaney pool&rdquo;. With all due respect, I do not think the Minister would like having that inadequate structure called after him. I know that it is inferior in every way as regards size and equipment to pools that have been provided by the Marian College, with a subscription from Dublin Corporation, and for the pupils of St. Fintan's in Sutton.  There are thousands of children in Ballyfermot who have no facility.  Ballyfermot has a population equal to Waterford but there are probably ten times more children in Ballyfermot than in Waterford. Is it suggested that to provide facilities for those children to be taught to swim in the case of a population like that, a pool such as has been provided in Longford would be sufficient ? I think Longford should have got a bigger one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The corporation has sought sanction for five or six reasonably-sized swimming pools, not just of international standard. because it is the number of young bodies that will be in the pools <Col N="602" /> that matters if they are sanctioned. Butlin's Holiday Camp has a pool and national swimming championships were held there.  Surely in this city sanction should at least be forthcoming from the Department for a number of reasonably-sized pools ?  Many of my fellow-citizens think Dublin is a far nicer city than Belfast. When I go to Belfast I forget about swimming.  It is a smaller city than Dublin and yet it has five swimming pools.  There is not a comparable city in Britain which has not got a number of them.  Perhaps the Minister thinks the Irish people do not wish to learn how to swim.</P>
    <P>The Ceann Comhairle, I know, approves of the issue of certificates to people who have risked their lives to save their fellow-citizens from drowning. During the past 15 years, Dublin Corporation each year have issued a number of these certificates to people who have saved drowning persons.  The same thing occurs throughout the country in cities and towns.  People who have entered the water to save others from drowning have been issued with certificates of merit.  I tell the Minister that in the Dublin County Council chambers, I have been ashamed watching these certificates being issued to young men and women, to elderly people when, in a city of this size, in 50 years no new swimming pool facilities have been provided.</P>
    <P>When a body seeks departmental sanction for the provision of a swimming pool, the reply they get is: &ldquo;We will give you sanction for a cheaper one.&rdquo;  I do not see on what basis we can pride ourselves.  We may pride ourselves on our determination to provide homes for those in need, provide care for the aged but how can we pride ourselves on the efforts we are making to ensure that no Irish boy or girl would be in danger of drowning through lack of training facilities ?  We know people will still drown&mdash;people will get cramps and people's hearts will give out&mdash;but the basic need is that boys and girls should be provided with facilities to learn how to swim and take care of themselves <Col N="603" /> in the water in an emergency. Apart from that, the exercise is regarded as being one of the healthiest for growing children.</P>
    <P>I do not think, and my belief is shared by members of the Minister's Party, that in areas like Ballyfermot, Old Cabra, Finglas, a pool costing £16,000 is adequate.  In the area in which I live, the Christian Brothers in Marino take 60 children in a class to Tara Street to teach them how to swim.  They can hardly get accommodation there.  However, it is there but nothing is being done to provide new facilities.</P>
    <P>May I take this opportunity to refer to a matter involved in a Bill before the House&mdash;the local elections?  The last local elections took place in 1960. The last extension of the Dublin borough boundary was about ten years earlier and several anomalies have developed in the meantime.  In this capital city there are local representatives responsible to as many as 50,000 electors.  In Dáil elections each Deputy is supposed to represent about 11,000 electors.  It gets a bit out of line from time to time and there is redistribution.  But in local elections a completely anomalous stuation has arisen.  I speak with some knowledge of the problems of local representatives who do not get allowances or expenses.</P>
    <P>Take the Dublin No. 1 area, for instance.  It comprises 11 municipal wards and the electors, for local authority election purposes, number 50,000.  The Dublin No. 2 area has 30,000 electors.  This means that a councillor elected for the No. 1 area has to try to serve on a voluntary basis 50,000 people.  He has to deal with housing, roads, parks, swimming pools, laneways and so forth.  Of course, the population of that area is much more than 50,000 because there are children and others not on the electors' lists.  In the area we have evidence of a very desirable development. There are from ten to 15 residents' associations and the local councillor is supposed to be in contact with them.  A Deputy may have <Col N="604" /> responsibilities but he need not maintain the same closeness of contact as the councillor because so many of the problems of these residents are at local authority level.</P>
    <P>The Dublin No. 2 area is much smaller but the same anomaly has developed throughout the entire city. If local councillors are to have a fair and reasonable opportunity of serving their constituents and keeping in contact with them, the areas should be examined and, if necessary, the boundaries revised.  That should be done before any local elections are held, whenever the Minister determines that will be.  I understand he is a bit coy about giving a date.</P>
    <P>In many of these local authorities&mdash; I do not know whether the same applies to the city of Cork and other cities&mdash; the majority of the members are not Deputies.  Some of them come from different Parties and others have no Party.  Basically they are representing to the best of their ability, the interests of the citizens who elected them, but they should not be expected to do almost the impossible, to represent an area where even to keep in touch with the constituents at all means a very heavy expenditure.  Apart from that, there is the inequality of representation : an alderman and four councillors representing about 160,000 people; another alderman and four councillors representing a third of that number. I would ask the Minister to look at that situation.  Of course, the growth which has taken place is due to the efforts of local authorities, private concerns and individuals over the years.</P>
    <P>On the question of roads, traffic, and so on, we appear to be too slow altogether in doing something about main roads and, where we do something, it is done inadequately.  The capital city has not got a single dual carriageway which would either come into the city or come to the outskirts and circle round.  There is the gateway to the North, and one has only to go to the boundaries of my constituency in North East Dublin to see they are still finding about with the development of that road, and even when the by-pass is completed, the road will not carry traffic adequately and reasonably safely.  There appears to be no provision <Col N="605" /> for a dual carriageway running right out of the city.  The same applies going west.  In going south, one must almost go out to the borders of Kildare before one approaches a reasonable road.  Look at the main road to Cork, the approach from and to the city. The arrangements are deplorable.</P>
    <P>Surely it must be realised that any major road built today for fast traffic needs to be a dual carriageway.  Where there is a dual carriageway, I hope the procedure at Loughlinstown of having a break in the dual carriageway opposite a tavern will not be permitted at any other place.  There is a break in the dual carriageway directly opposite &ldquo;The Silver Tassie&rdquo;.  Somebody going out to Bray feels thirsty and decides to turn off at &ldquo;The Silver Tassie&rdquo;.  There is no other country in the world that would permit such a state of affairs.</P>

      <P>I know the Minister is concerned about the number of accidents, the number of deaths and injuries.  Everyone in this House is concerned about this growing problem. There appears to be no single cause on which one can put a finger and say: &ldquo;That is the major cause.&rdquo;  There is the question of drink.  There is the question of downright carelessness even on the part of people who do not drink. There is the question of lighting.  There is also the question of the tarmacadam and asphalt surfaces on the roads which do not make a contribution to safe driving in the cities and outside the cities.  Tarmacadam gives a smooth surface. Last Sunday was a beautiful day and tarmacadam was pleasant to drive on.  However, it started to rain on Monday and on Monday evening with the reflection of the lamps on the wet, black roads, those roads became a positive danger.  The lights on the black tarmacadam create shadows and reflections and possibly do contribute to the possibility of accidents, apart from the normal increase in accidents arising from driving on wet roads.  I do not think there is adequate lighting on the roads.  The Minister might use his undoubted authority in directing that, not only on major roads but also on <Col N="606" /> other roads, there is adequate lighting.</P>
      <P>While some progress has been made &mdash;and it would be unfair to attempt to deny that progress has been made &mdash;in the field of housing, nevertheless, the progress, to my mind, has been insufficient.  I should like to refer to an aspect of housing to which the Minister has referred, that is, the question of the cost of providing dwellings. At column 51, volume 224 of the Dáil Debates, the Minister said:</P>
      <P>Far too many schemes have, in recent years, had to be entirely replanned because proposals were formulated on an over-optimistic basis in relation to available resources, and there has been a continuing tendency to submit proposals for houses types which are too large or too elaborate to be economic for local authority housing.  I am satisfied that while it will not be easy to secure any real progress in cost reduction, it should be possible to build local authority dwellings to the required standard at lower costs than are being achieved at present.</P>
      <P>Might I say that I should like the Minister to elaborate that statement when replying to the debate?</P>
      <P>We are still backward from the point of view of the type of dwelling we are providing.  We are still providing local authority houses that, on average, have not sufficient rooms.  It is not good enough to have 20 per cent or 25 per cent of the houses consisting of five rooms.  I say this because I do not think the Department of Local Government would approve, except in special circumstances, of any proposal for the erection of a house to qualify for a grant unless it had five rooms. Yet, 75 per cent of the dwellings provided by the main local authority consist of four rooms or less.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, there is no doubt that we have been neglectful over the years of the standard of construction of local authority dwellings.  The Minister has told us that there is something like £9.9 million earmarked for local authority dwellings in the current year. Has an inspector from the Department of Local Government ever inspected any of the local authority dwellings <Col N="607" /> while they are under construction?  I do not think it sufficient to say that the local authority, through their architects, of whom there is a great shortage, or their engineers or surveyors, have a responsibility for examining and passing the work being carried out by the builders.  This House is voting public money to help to build these houses or flats and, surely, the Department have a responsibility to secure, not only that there are specifications submitted to the local authority and the Department, but that there is somebody there to see that the work is carried out?  We are quite well aware, and it is clear from the Minister's speech, that his officers do examine the plans and specifications of houses and flats submitted for approval and sanction and in many cases they are sent back.  It is fair to say that in recent years there has not been very much of that, but it used to be a fairly good gimmick, in order to avoid expenditure under the heading, to send the plans back, to have another plan submitted and to send it back, thus causing delay. I want to know have any of the inspectors ever travelled around any of these housing schemes while the houses were in course of construction? Surely the Minister and the House are concerned to see whether or not the money is being spent properly and, where State money is involved by way of subsidy, whether, in fact, the dwellings are satisfactory?</P>
    <P>There have been many complaints over the years about some of the schemes.  Possibly the Minister is not greatly concerned as to whether maintenance costs arise subsequently or not.  As an individual or in a general way he may be concerned.  He has referred to his concern in his introductory statement.  But maintenance costs when they arise fall to be borne either by the local authority, in which <Col N="608" /> case they come on the rates, or, to a certain extent, by the tenants.  The majority of tenants of local authorities over the years have been expending increased amounts on maintaining their dwellings in a habitable condition.  If one visits a housing estate that has been standing for any number of years, one notices the high percentage of dwellings on which the tenants have expended money on maintainance.  In some cases the tenants carry out work that properly should be carried out by the authority.  One sees the high percentage of dwellings on which tenants have spent money in repair, decoration and painting.  There is no doubt that a portion of that expenditure may arise from unsatisfactory construction.</P>
    <P>I am well aware that the problem of unsatisfactory builders is not confined to those buildings for local authorities. People buying houses frequently have to make complaint about the standard and condition of their dwellings.  In that case, as long as they are within reach of the builder, they may have some hope of redress but in the case of the local authority housing, if the work is not carried out properly, when the maintenance period is over, any additional maintenance or repairs will fall on the tenant or on the ratepayers who subscribe to the local authority.  Even though the subsidy made by the central Government to local authorities needs some review in the conditions of 1966 and, in my opinion should be increased substantially, nevertheless, I wonder why over the years the Department have not taken a closer interest in what has been happening.  It may be the case that Departmental inspectors do examine some of these dwellings.</P>
    <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>
