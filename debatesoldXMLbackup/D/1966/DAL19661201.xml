    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Just to wind up what I began to say last night, I wish to repeat that while all of us are awaiting the outcome of the Minister's statement offering free education to everybody who needed it, and while we are thankful for the effort which appears to have been made towards some improvement, the Labour Party are dissatisfied that a more detailed programme has not been prepared.  We look on this document, which could have been far more detailed, simply as a statement of intention to do something and unfortunately our experience has been that unless we get down in black and white what is to be done, the position does not seem to improve very much.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not wish to decry the efforts the Minister appears to be making to have free education provided for certain classes but I think it is a misnomer to describe it as free education without a means test.  In fact, there are several means tests woven through the structure of the scheme, all of which will cause a certain amount of annoyance and criticism if the scheme is ever put into operation.  The thing that worries me most, and should also worry the Minister, is the big number of children who leave school without getting secondary education.  What provision has the Minister made or does he propose to make to ensure there will be <Col N="2007" /> school places for such children in future?  Because he is a man in touch with the people, he must be aware of the situation that secondary schools are completely booked out, and even where such schools are not completely booked out, I do not think there will be a warm welcome for children who will be adding to the overcrowding of classes.</P>
    <P>Secondly, what does the Minister propose to do about university education? We know extra accommodation is being provided but this will not ensure that even a fraction of those who would like to have university education can in present circumstances be accommodated.  The Minister must know that if extra facilities are not made available immediately&mdash;I believe they must be made available&mdash;the universities will not be able to take these people.  I do not think it is fair that students who fail at the end of their first year should be shot down the way they are.  I believe the reason for it is to reduce the number of pupils because of the lack of accommodation.</P>
    <P>I know young men and young women who leave the secondary schools, where they have been under strict supervision in regard to lessons and everything else, and who go into the university where it is a matter for themselves whether they study or not. Very many of them do not get time to acclimatise themselves to the new situation until they are out on their ears.  That is wrong and something should be done to allow them to do two years before this happens because in the second year they begin to work.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the Minister might try to do something about the appalling situation that for many courses in the universities books are prescribed which have been out of print for very many years.  It is deplorable to see university students going around from book barrow to book barrow trying to buy, at very exorbitant prices, the books prescribed for the different courses. This system should be changed.  Either books which are available should be prescribed or the books which are prescribed should be made available. <Col N="2008" /> There is nothing wrong with that suggestion at all.</P>
    <P>The third thing which I would like to speak about is something which the universities may dislike very much but the Minister must do something about it.  It is a deplorable thing when students go to the university and go into a lecture in the morning, and sometimes they have to undertake a very long journey in order to be on time, they find no lecturer there.  I know of some students who had to leave on a train one hour earlier than was necessary because of the fact that the lecture was timed for such an hour that the bus which should take them from the train would not get them in in time for the lecture.  The lecture was timed to start at 9 o'clock and they could not arrive until 9.15.  In spite of the fact that a lecture is timed to start at 9 o'clock, you very often find that the lecturer does not turn up at all.  There are always exceptions. Some people always turn up on time but there are others who do not.  It is wrong that a university lecturer should so let down his or her class.</P>
    <P>People have gone to great trouble to get into the university, first of all, and then they have gone to great trouble to be on time, only to find that the lecturer is not there.  If a lecturer finds that for some reason or other he will not be able to keep his appointment on a particular morning, he should inform the students the night before.  Some notice should be given so that the students will be informed and will not have to sit for three-quarters of an hour, or even longer, awaiting a lecturer who has not turned up.  If this were an isolated case, one could accept it, but some lecturers think it is all right to do this once a month or even oftener.  This is entirely wrong and something should be done about it.</P>
    <P>Finally, let me say that as far as improvement in education is concerned, we believe that if this country is ever to get anywhere, the pupils leaving school must be educated.  The radio this morning described this as the Minister's plan for new education, giving the impression there was some <Col N="2009" /> kind of legislation being enacted which would give such facilities.  All this is the Minister's idea of what he thinks should be done and what his Department thinks should be done.  I shall be very interested to see how it works out.  I mentioned last night&mdash;I do not know whether the Minister was here&mdash; the proposal about bus services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not repeat it so, but I honestly believe we must make a more genuine effort to try to give something to the children.  I do not believe that in the present atmosphere the Minister's proposals will be taken too seriously by many people.  Do not forget we are now on the eve of two important by-elections.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;will the Minister explain to me why it was not possible to fill in all the details which are missing from the proposed scheme?  The Minister must admit that in relation to far too many matters in this scheme we find that the matter will get further consideration.  Before September, there must have been a certain amount of talk about it.  I believe this scheme has been dumped here in the hope that within the next 12 months, it may be possible to round it off.  When our Party put forward a policy on education, it took months and months to prepare.  Eventually, it was printed and published.  I just do not like the idea of something like this being put out with all these built-in loopholes.  I believe the Minister might be sincere in his requirements but I honestly believe the intention is to promise much and to give little.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister in his Estimate deals mainly with the three branches of our educational system which are his responsibility. In general, I propose to comment on the activities of his Department under those heads.  It was alleged here last night by Deputy Tully that very little had been done in regard to the programme of replacing unsuitable national schools and improving existing schools.  It appears that Deputy Tully did not even read, not to say comprehend, the statement made by the Minister in that regard.  The Minister stated that in so far as the replacement of national schools was concerned, 1965-66 was a record year, that 130 new schools were built in that year and 121 schools were either improved or extended.  Both these figures constitute records.  They have never been achieved before and that they were achieved in a year in which there were financial difficulties is indeed a greater tribute than ever to the work that has been done.  It represented a 60 per cent increase on the average for the previous decade but that was not even referred to once by Deputy Tully who <Col N="2011" /> bemoaned the lack of progress, as he said, in the building programme of the Department.</P>
    <P>I should also like to congratulate the Minister on the improvement that has been made in the teacher/pupil ratio. That improvement was begun by one of his predecessors and not alone has it been maintained by the present Minister but the ratio has been improved to the advantage of both pupil and teacher.  I remember when I was teaching in Dublin some years ago around the month of May or June, children came to the school to be enrolled and I often had in my class&mdash;it was an infants class&mdash;up to 70, 80 or 90 children. This is no exaggeration.  That was at the end of June before the enrolment period commenced on 1st July.  That cannot and does not happen now.  Successive Ministers for Education have lowered the figure for the recruitment of additional teachers and this year the figure has been reduced from 140 to 130 to enable a sixth assistant to be appointed.  From an educational point of view, that is a significant improvement. Teachers will no longer be saddled with large classes to which they cannot give proper attention, nor will they have to try to control these large classes to the exclusion of their teaching.</P>
    <P>Another development which has been mentioned by the Minister and on which he must also be congratulated is in regard to the steps taken by his predecessor and continued by him to get rid of the untrained teacher. There are many lady assistants, junior assistant mistresses as they are called, who have given excellent service to the nation.  To become a junior assistant mistress, one had first of all to attain a fairly high standard in the leaving certificate and had to be eligible for a call to training, although due to the stiff competition, one might not have been successful in securing that call.  Up to 1958, or 1956, junior assistant mistresses were recruited and the Minister has now arranged to have suitable junior assistant mistresses who are anxious to do so admitted to crash courses held during the summer, and attendance at which, subject to other <Col N="2012" /> conditions, will qualify them for recognition as fully trained teachers.  It is a big advance and it is one that has been welcomed by the teaching profession, not to mention the junior assistant mistresses who are vitally concerned in the matter.</P>
    <P>There is, however, one plea I should like to make to the Minister.  An age limit has been fixed&mdash;I think it is 56 years&mdash;and junior assistant mistresses who have attained that age will not be eligible to be called to these crash courses.  It is a hardship that many of these teachers who are more than 56 cannot be called and consequently will suffer a salary loss. Would it not be possible for the Minister in the case of teachers who have at least five years to go before reaching 65, who have good teaching records, who are recommended by the inspectors, and who are qualified otherwise, to have a <i>de facto</i> recognition given to them and enable them to be placed on an appropriate point on the salary scale?  The Minister is a humane man and I feel sure he would not like to see these older teachers, with excellent records, deprived of an adequate salary scale and later of a pension appropriate to their years of service.</P>
    <P>The statement made by the Minister in relation to secondary schools was very encouraging.  That there should be practically 100,000 pupils enrolled in our secondary schools is a remarkable achievement.  When a forecast of that nature was made here a few years ago, that there would be in this year nearly 100,000 pupils attending secondary schools, it was laughed out of the Dáil.</P>
    <P>The Minister has also quite rightly mentioned the fact that there was nearly a 300 per cent increase in the number of qualified secondary teachers in our schools last year compared with the year 1950-51.  Taken in conjunction, the remarkably high enrolment of pupils and the great increase in the number of teachers are a very encouraging development, and it must be heartening to the Minister to realise that this growth rate has been <Col N="2013" /> achieved over the years.  It must also be heartening to him to realise that it will be an important matter for consideration in relation to the new scheme with which I shall deal later.</P>
    <P>I also want to refer to the fact that in relation to the provision of new secondary schools and new places for pupils, a capital project in the region of £13½ million is being embarked on and that nearly 150 applications have been received from secondary school authorities who propose to provide many new places for pupils and to avail of the very generous scheme of loan repayments introduced by the Department's staff.  A 60 per cent contribution to these loan charges is not to be laughed at and it also shows a very favourable trend.</P>
    <P>The next matter in the Minister's Estimate is vocational education which is going through a very great transitional period, the most important factor being the introduction of the common intermediate certificate.  Heretofore, children attended vocational schools in the realisation that the only certificate&mdash;and it was an important one&mdash;they could gain was the group certificate.  Possession of it enabled candidates for nursing and other professions to have a certificate.  It was not generally regarded as a very important certificate&mdash;why, I do not know.  In its own way, it was important and it was something that the pupils could be proud of, but, for some reason, it was not regarded as on a par with possession of, shall we say, the intermediate certificate from the secondary branch.</P>
    <P>While I understand that the group certificate is to continue, the introduction of a common intermediate certificate, common to the secondary and vocational schools, is a welcome step and one in the right direction because children who have an academic bent can proceed to the purely academic subjects and get their certificate for those subjects, but a boy or girl with a flair for subjects like drawing or engineering or metalwork, rural science, domestic economy or any other science catered for in those schools can get their certificate in these subjects and it will be of equal value and merit <Col N="2014" /> with the certificate secured by the child attending a secondary school and following subjects such as the ordinary academic subjects.</P>
    <P>In that connection, I should like to quote from a book &ldquo;Education for Tomorrow&rdquo; by John Vaizey.  It is pertinent and relevant to the common intermeniate certificate.  On page 16 of the book he says:</P>
    <P>Yet, in principle and in law every child now has the right to an education suited to his age, abilities and aptitude and a great deal of the effort of the educational psychologists is concerned in placing children in schools or in classes which appear suited to their talents.</P>
    <P>In that connection the common intermediate certificate makes it possible to place children in schools and in courses suited to their talents and natural aptitudes and it is not inferior in any way to the intermediate certificate secured by the pupil of a secondary school where ordinary academic subjects are taught.  That is a significant breakthrough.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that we appear to be making no great progress towards the provision of regional technical schools. I hope that these will become a reality very shortly because there is a very big demand for them.  The technical colleges that we know are in Dublin: they are difficult to get into and it would be a great boon, for country children especially, to gain places in technical schools equal, in status, shall we say, to Bolton Street and Kevin Street, in their own localities.  I urge the Minister to go ahead with his scheme to provide these colleges and make them available as soon as possible. I understand we are getting one in Galway and naturally there will be one in Limerick.  I hope that within the next year or two something constructive will be done to make a start on these schools and provide the places so badly needed.</P>
    <P>I regard the comprehensive schools as pilot schemes in so far as they will integrate the secondary and vocational school in areas where neither type is <Col N="2015" /> in existence now.  I should like to know if the Minister is getting the full co-operation he desires from the secondary school authorities to whom he has appealed for courses designed to give children with the aptitudes I have mentioned previously suitable instruction. I am aware that he has approached many of these schools, some of them run by the Orders, some run by private individuals.  I hope they have agreed to co-operate with him in extending the curriculum and in providing the courses and the subjects he would like to see being taught in these schools.</P>
    <P>I now come to the Minister's newly-announced programme for free education. On October 21st last, there was a television programme in which the three major Parties were represented. The Minister for Education, and two other Deputies represented the Fianna Fáil Party; Deputy Mrs. Desmond represented the Labour Party and Deputy Lindsay and Senator Garret FitzGerald represented Fine Gael.  That is a little over one month ago.  On that occasion it appeared to me that neither Deputy Lindsay nor Senator Garret FitzGerald could explain to the public what the Fine Gael policy in relation to post-primary education was.  That is a personal view but it is one, I think, that is shared by all the viewers of that programme &ldquo;The Politicians&rdquo;.  If Senator FitzGerald and Deputy Lindsay knew what the Fine Gael scheme was, they were very good in concealing that fact from the public or in announcing two different schemes; they were successful, too, in contradicting each other.  Deputy Mrs. Desmond gave a very good account of herself, I must say, and of the policy of her Party which was published some time ago under the title &ldquo;Challenge&rdquo;.  It was significant that the Fine Gael people could not state what their policy was.</P>
    <P>Now on the eve of a by-election campaign, Fine Gael come out with their new policy.  Apart from the merits of the policy, which I will not discuss at this stage, the extraordinary feature of the Fine Gael policy is, first, that it is not to cost anything.  They are to <Col N="2016" /> depend on the buoyancy of the revenue. That is a very nice way of saying that the Fianna Fáil Government, whom they have been accusing for the past two years of being bankrupt, useless, extravagant and what have you, are now going to provide the money out of this buoyant&mdash;non-existent, according to them&mdash;revenue.  It is indeed a tribute to Fianna Fáil, which I am sure was not intended, that we have floating around in this country £3 million or £4 million which, due to the good management of the economy under Fianna Fáil, can be utilised to the benefit of the education of our people.  It comes as great news to me that this can be done.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education has clearly said that the implementation of his scheme will involve extra taxation on the people.  It is not free in the sense that he can get the money from this buoyancy in revenue, because the Minister for Education is a realist, and this is no time to try to fool or delude people into believing that these spare millions are knocking around somewhere. I know that Santa Claus comes once a year, that his traditional visit is paid on Christmas Eve, but, apparently, Santa Claus is coming this year earlier than usual, on or about 7th December, and that he has a gift for the electors of South Kerry and Waterford, a big Christmas stocking loaded with free education for all the children for which their parents have to pay.  I do not know what chimney he is going to come down, but I do not think the people will accept this gift stocking which they know will cost them something and which they know is not realistic.</P>
    <P>It has been very amusing to watch the antics of Fine Gael over the past few years in relation to education generally.  I sat in here on numerous occasions, and I must confess I always do, if I have the opportunity, to listen to Deputy Dillon.  He is a very good orator and while he might display exuberance of language occasionally and use flowery phrases, there is often-times a note of commonsense in what he says.  Time and again since I came into this House, on the Estimate for <Col N="2017" /> the Department of Education, I have heard him advocate the abolition of small, one-teacher and two-teacher schools and the creation in a locality of a big school with four, five or six teachers to which the children from remote areas could be brought by transport and catered for in a class under the control of a teacher.  He waxed very eloquent on this subject and I agreed with what he said.</P>
    <P>When this proposal was mentioned by the Minister's successor, however, there was a natural reaction in the country.  People like to keep their schools.  They regard it as a status symbol to have a school in the locality. There were scenes of different kinds, at high level and low level, in which there were protests against this innovation. Immediately Fine Gael took fright, and we then had the spectacle of Deputy Lindsay and Deputy Jones backpedalling as fast as they possibly could so as not to cause offence either to the clergy or to lose votes locally.  In their recent scheme they are full steam ahead again, brakes off, and they are in favour of the large school.  How can anybody be impressed by antics of that sort?  We went ahead full steam under Deputy Dillon and we backpedalled under Deputy Jones and Deputy Lindsay because votes might be concerned or because certain clerics might take a poor view of it.  Now that the air has been cleared and public reaction has died down, they are full steam ahead again.  The tandem is working as best it can to get the scheme as part of the Fine Gael plan.  They do not even blush about doing it, whereas, if Fianna Fáil did a right-about turn like that, we would never hear the end of it from the benches over there.</P>
    <P>They say they have a scheme.  They had not got one on October 21st.  On the eve of the two by-elections, we are getting instant education at no cost, with a very neat class distinction.  We were accused last night by Deputy James Tully of introducing a means test&mdash;how he arrives at that I cannot say&mdash;segregating the poorer children and identifying them by label.  But in the Fine Gael scheme we are to have places reserved in the big colleges, the Jesuits in Clongowes, in Castleknock, <Col N="2018" /> in Gormanston and so on.  All these are to get very favourable treatment under the new Fine Gael education schemes.  I am sure that will appeal to the majority of our people.  They have a scheme which they produced recently, by a singular coincidence, and about their scheme the old Irish proverb can be used: &ldquo;Muna bhfuil agat ach pocán gabhair bíodh sé i lár an aonaigh agat&rdquo;.  If you only have a puck goat, have him in the middle of the fair and let everyone admire him. They have him in the middle of the hustings and they are calling on the electorate to admire this little pocán gabhair, born only a few days ago and not even thought of on October 21st.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education has announced a scheme.  Whatever Deputy James Tully might say about what he called the gaps and the things unsaid, the Minister has given a clear and unequivocal statement of his intentions. I quote from his document:</P>
    <P>My policy in regard to post-primary education in general has as its objective the providing of comprehensive facilities in as many centres as is reasonably practicable so that as far as possible our children will have a genuine option in the matter of choosing the type of education which best suits their aptitudes and talents.</P>
    <P>He is providing grants up to £25 for children in secondary schools and providing free transport for the children to those schools.  He has given an undertaking that, if a child has the ability, the talent and the desire to advance, that child will not be denied the highest position in the State if he is prepared to go ahead.  I know big sacrifices are called upon from parents. I taught in schools and I have some knowledge of the matter.  The parents of a poor family when they have a brilliant child, the eldest child especially, may want him to help the family by taking up a job, be it ever so small. They have to make a sacrifice if they want that child to go ahead and get the necessary education, when he or she could otherwise be working and bringing in a few pounds to the family. We have all had that experience of <Col N="2019" /> seeing those young people, either classmates of our own or students of our own, very brilliant and very talented, having to stay away from school to become a breadwinner, when, if they had the opportunity and their parents could afford it, they could become the &ldquo;Village Hampden.&rdquo;  If the Minister's scheme is allowed to go through, it will be possible for such children to make progress and to be assisted right along the line until they reach the profession or calling to which their talents and aptitude are suited.</P>
    <P>The provisions for free post-primary education have been outlined by the Minister.  They are soundly based and will be availed of by at least 75 per cent of the population.  The figures the Minister quoted in relation to fees in secondary schools are realistic, because they have been provided by the authorities in question.  There is one thing on which I should like to compliment the Minister, that is, the generous assistance he proposes to give to children of the minority faith.  That is the right position.  We in this part of the country should show that we lean over backwards to ensure that the pupils of the minority religion are afforded equal&mdash;if not better&mdash;opportunity with those of the majority faith.  There are very few of them and they are scattered all over the country.  They have to get special assistance.  That the Minister recognises this problem is a credit to him and something on which he must be congratulated. He should make no apology for it, and I know he will not.</P>
    <P>There is one big gap in the Minister's post-primary scheme.  He has stopped short at what he proposes to do in relation to university education, apart from a general reference to it.  That is not the fault of the Minister.  We have had sitting here for the past six years a Commission on Higher Education.  It is about time they brought out their report.  We are fed up listening to replies to Dáil Questions that it will be out soon, that it will be out next month and so on.  If they are not able to bring out their report soon, the Commission should be abolished.  As far as I know, they are now on their seventh year. <Col N="2020" /> Many of the conclusions they will reach and the recommendations they will make will have been invalidated by the passage of years and will not be relevant to present conditions at all. I understand&mdash;I do not know how true it is&mdash;that the Minister was told either directly or indirectly that if he referred to proposals for university education in any form, the Commission would resign.  I say to the Minister: Let them resign and be damned to them.  We are tired waiting for them.  If we have to await for these gentlemen to arrive at decisions and to make recommendations in regard to a task that was entrusted to them six years ago, then all I can say is that we are thoroughly fed up with their performance.  I do not care whom I offend when I say that.  Maybe Deputy T. O'Donnell is a member of that Commission for all I know.  Is he?</P>

      <P>It is the most extraordinary thing I have ever heard of that they should be sitting for six years.  By the time the recommendations come, they will be out of date and we shall have to appoint another commission, if such a thing will be done, to bring them up to date.  The thing is absolutely fantastic.  I would prefer to see a commission of civil servants, inspectors and other such people appointed to deal with this problem.  At least we could expect a decision and recommendations within a reasonable time.  They remind me of a time and material job.  They must <Col N="2021" /> be getting paid&mdash;well, I do not know what they are being paid.</P>
      <P>There are a few matters to which I should like to refer which have been worrying me for quite a while.  One of them is the type of Reader we have in national schools.  I understand that in the Irish first class Reader in the national schools 200 or so new words are introduced for the pupil.  He has to increase his vocabulary by 200 words.  In second class, a further 200 words are added.  In third class, a further 200 and in fourth class, a further 200.  By the time the child has completed the fourth class Reader, he should have mastered between 800 and 900 new Irish words.  That is absolutely ridiculous.  It offends every educational tenet in regard to the acquisition of a new language.  That a child, having completed the fourth class in a national school, should be supposed to acquire up to 900 new words is an unnecessary burden and does not conform with ordinary educational practice.  I would ask the Minister to have a look at that.  These figures were given to me by a teacher who takes a great interest in this matter and who went to the trouble of counting these words.</P>
      <P>In English, for example, according to English Public Library Statistics, a child between seven and 13 years should acquire between 400 and 600 new words.  That is in relation to English, which is the home language of these children, as this is an English report.  But here in Ireland where children are acquiring the Irish language, they are asked to have 900 words by the time they have completed the fourth class Reader.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are told, too, that there is a very close connection between illiteracy and juvenile delinquency.  We have a scheme here, limited to £30 per school, for the provision of library books. These books are not suited to the juvenile classes.  These classes have to improve their vocabularly by reading suitable books.  If they do not do that when they are young, if they do not get a love of reading and a desire for books, they will become, when they grow older, uninterested in books, not <Col N="2022" /> inclined to read.  They will have no facility in reading which is an acquired facility.  As a consequence, if they read the racing column of a newspaper, that is as far as they go after school, if they leave school at an early age.</P>
    <P>It has been proved statistically that people of that kind who do not acquire a taste for reading and are virtually illiterate, if they do not read frequently and often, become juvenile delinquents. It is a matter that should concern all of us.  The Department should see to it that reading material suitable for junior and, indeed, senior classes is provided in national schools.  I understand that in England they spend up to £500 in stocking libraries.  Here, we are limited to £30 per annum.  The books provided by that £30 are mostly reference books which young people will not read.  The people who might read them are those in the sixth and seventh classes.  We have no books suitable for junior classes in our libraries&mdash;or suitable for senior classes.</P>
    <P>I understand that the reading material in English, which teachers have to provide out of their own pockets mostly, is limited to what they call the Ladybird Selection graded books, graded in difficulty, and so on, but costly because they are very well illustrated, very well bound and imported.  It might be to the advantage of some Irish publisher to provide similar books for our children, suitably graded and catering for the tastes of youngsters.  In the Irish school, they have their reading book&mdash;the book they read in class&mdash;and, outside that, they have nothing suitable, except, as I mentioned, this Ladybird Selection and the horror comics and their likes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>To my mind, the most extraordinary statement in the Minister's speech is one on which the previous speaker commented in concluding his speech.  It is that the Minister finds himself in the difficulty of not being able to study the problem of university education or to formulate any new proposals because the Commission on Higher Education have not yet issued their findings, he now states, despite all the assurances that were given in 1956.  The Commission on Higher Education are now about to reach another birthday; we are now going into 1967.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a representative of a constituency which has a very great interest in the findings and the outcome of this Commission, I want to protest in the most vigorous way possible against the dilly-dallying and the manner in which this <Col N="2024" /> Commission have tackled the job they have been given to do.  One finds it difficult&mdash;and I am not speaking in a political sense on this at all&mdash;to say what the reasons are for the delay and why an examination, not, mark you, of the entire educational structure in this country and not an examination of the whole field of education, but of one particular aspect of education should take six years and why there is still no likelihood of the report being issued.</P>
    <P>The Minister is not able to say anything apart from the fact that he has been informed that the Commission will issue their report in February, 1967.  We were told during 1965 by the previous Minister for Education that the report would be issued in 1965. We have been told on a number of occasions this year that the Commission would issue their report in the current year.  Last spring when a large number of students from my constituency came to Dublin and were received by the Minister for Education&mdash;and they also visited the secretary of the Commission on Higher Education&mdash;they were given an assurance that this report would be available before the end of the present year.</P>
    <P>I am sure there is no need for me to tell the Minister what the reaction will be in the constituency I represent. I do not want to be too parochial in my attitude to this particular question because the extension and the reorganisation of the whole field of university education is a matter of extreme urgency.  It is a matter which will have a vital bearing on the future development of this nation.  I now ask the Minister, who is my constituency colleague, to take what is the only course open to him.  He should inform the Commission on Higher Education immediately that they should burn and destroy whatever report they have been concocting during the past six years. If the OECD study group can issue their report after a period of 12 to 18 months, then there is no reason or excuse for the Commission on Higher Education spending six or seven years examining this matter and they still have not come up with a report.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2025" /> The Minister said his information was that he could hope to have the report in February.  As I said at the outset, I have a particular interest in the report of the Commission on Higher Education.  The Minister also has this particular interest because we both represent an area in which it has been estimated there is one-sixth of the total secondary school-going population. This House and the country are well aware of the efforts we have been making over a number of years with a view to obtaining university facilities for this large number of secondary school-going students in my area.  We know that an agitation and a campaign for a university in Limerick has been carried on for a long time.  I want to assure the House, and I want everybody to know, and I am sure the Minister will agree with me, that we in Limerick are quite serious in our demand for a university.  I can well imagine the reaction there will be in our city, and in the surrounding area, to the announcement that the Commission on Higher Education have not yet issued their findings and the report will not be available, as the Minister said he expected, in February.</P>
    <P>Before the Minister came into the House, I was referring to the failure of the Commission on Higher Education to issue their report.  I made a suggestion that the Minister should disband the Commission because I believe they have no intention of issuing a report.  I also believe that the findings when issued will have very little bearing on current problems because the number of pupils attending secondary schools has increased considerably in the six years during which the Commission have been sitting and the demand for accommodation in universities has increased. In fact, the present accommodation is severely taxed.</P>
    <P>Having looked into this whole question of higher education, I see no reason at all why the Minister should wait for this body of individuals to report.  I do not know what the dickens they have been doing.  Nobody in my constituency knows what they have been doing.  I do not think the Minister should wait, and I certainly hope he will not wait, for the publication <Col N="2026" /> of the report of the Commission on Higher Education before he formulates proposals for extending the facilities in university education.  The accommodation at existing universities is being severely taxed.  There is no reason why he should wait to tackle this problem of university education.  There is no reason why he should wait for the issue of the report to take steps to provide facilities for university education for the large number of secondary school-going pupils in Limerick and its surrounding areas who have been crying out for university facilities in recent years.  I protest strongly, and I have no confidence in the Commission on Higher Education.  Nobody in the constituency I have the honour to represent has any confidence in this Commission.</P>
    <P>As I am on this subject of higher education, I might as well finish what I have to say about it.  There has been undoubtedly in the past six or eight years a tremendous increase in the demand for university education.  The numbers seeking admission to the universities and to the various faculties has increased to an enormous extent. In view of the limited resources of this country and in view of the difficulties which have to be surmounted in extending the opportunity for university education to as many of our secondary school students as possible, there are certain steps which might be considered and which may temporarily, at any rate, help to alleviate the situation. I have in mind in particular the idea of extern courses.</P>
    <P>I happen to be familiar with the extern courses provided by the University of London.  I had the opportunity at one stage of doing a course from London University.  London University, by means of these extern courses, enables students in any part of the world to study in their own time and in their own homes, without having to attend lectures.  A student may reach the highest level of academic achievement by this means.  Most faculties are open: certainly one can take a degree in Arts, Commerce, Science, Agriculture and many other fields through the extern courses provided by London University. I can never understand why our <Col N="2027" /> National University could not provide extern courses.  I do not mean extension courses; there is a distinction between university extension courses and extern courses.  I cannot see any reason why our National University could not provide facilities which would enable students who could not afford to attend wholetime courses in existing universities to study for degrees either by means of private study, correspondence courses or by a system of tutorial guidance.</P>
    <P>In most of the large centres of population in Britain, and in some of the not so large centres of population, there are colleges, some of them called polytechnics, which provide a wide variety of courses.  It is possible for a student to attend courses which are provided by those regional colleges and they can proceed to a degree of London University.  It would be a relatively simple matter for our National University to provide this type of facility.</P>
    <P>There are evening courses leading to the B.A. and B. Comm. degrees at UCD.  These courses were re-organised in 1952.  Prior to that, a student had to attend, if he was proceeding to a degree at night, the same number of lectures at night as a student who was doing the same degree course had to attend in the daytime.  In 1952, UCD re-organised this course and it provided a course leading to the B.A. and B. Comm. degree to qualify for which a student had only to attend one lecture for one hour each week in his subject. It would be a very simple matter to extend this type of course so that students, no matter what part of Ireland they are in, could through their own efforts, perhaps with guidance from a local tutor or by means of a correspondence course, study for a degree of their own National University rather than have to study for degrees of London University.  I do not say that in any malicious manner but I know the problem that confronts students.  Many of those who have attempted to study for degrees of London University found the going too hard.  I know a number of other students who have succesfully obtained their degrees.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2028" /> I would say to the Minister: &ldquo;Forget about the Commission on Higher Education and explore ways and means, in so far as the area which both of us have the honour to represent is concerned, to take steps to provide reasonable facilities for university education for one-sixth of the total secondary school-going population who are in the area which comprises Limerick city and a 30-mile radius&rdquo;.  I sincerely hope that steps will be taken so that the students in those areas who are now in their leaving certificate class can look forward to entering and beginning their studies for a university degree in October, 1967.  I certainly hope that the Minister will not be compelled to resign.  I hope he will take the steps that are necessary and forget about the Commission.  So much for university education.</P>
    <P>It is, I suppose, a welcome trend to see such emphasis laid on education.  It is a pity, I think, that education should be completely in the hands of politicians and civil servants.  Planning for education and the organisation of our educational resources should be in the hands of the people directly concerned with education and our educators should have a far greater say in the formulation and implementation of educational policy.</P>
    <P>The aspect of education which has sprung into the forefront of our consideration at the moment is post-primary education.  This is a very complex problem.  I spoke earlier of the difficulty in providing university education for all who wish to avail of it.  Equally so, the provision of adequate facilities for post-primary education to enable pupils to study the courses of their choice is a problem fraught with many difficulties.  A considerable proportion of our children leave school after completing their primary education.  It is alarming to discover, according to the statistics furnished in the report on &ldquo;Investment in Education&rdquo;, that some 8,000 pupils leave our primary schools each year without having obtained the primary certificate.</P>
    <P>The Minister dealt in detail with his <Col N="2029" /> proposals for the provision of free post-primary education.  As I said, this is a problem of very great magnitude. Apart from the fact that so many of our young boys and girls leave school at the age of 14, there is also the fact that 8,000 per annum leave without having taken the primary certificate.  The Minister refers to this problem and, in the report on &ldquo;Investment in Education,&rdquo; it is pointed out that, in 1963, approximately 11,000 pupils left full-time education before reaching the junior certificate level; 4,000 left secondary schools before completing the intermediate course; and 7,000 left the vocational schools without doing the group certificate.  The Minister pointed out the gravity of this situation: pupils are leaving post-primary education at a time when they should be commencing their training as craftsmen, technicians and so on.</P>
    <P>The Minister acknowledges that there is tremendous need for gearing up our educational system in order to provide an adequate number of craftsmen and technicians.  The Minister cited a number of obstacles, as he called them, in the way of students, particularly students in the lower income group, proceeding to post-primary education.  He referred to the inability of parents to pay school fees, their inability to meet the cost of school books and requisites.  A third reason put forward is the need for an additional breadwinner in the family and, fourthly, the absence of motivation in the family environment, plus the cost of transport in rural areas.</P>
    <P>The Minister proposes to overcome the first two obstacles by means of an annual grant per pupil to those schools which, at the moment, charge fees in excess of £30, and he suggests a flat rate of £25 per pupil.  The Minister says this will cover 75 per cent of the secondary pupils.  A number of Deputies on this side of the House have adverted to the system proposed by the Minister.  Like previous speakers, I feel this will introduce class distinction in a very big way into our secondary education system. This is something which should be avoided at all costs and I suggest the <Col N="2030" /> Minister might, perhaps, have another look at this question and see if some other method could be devised to prevent this type of class distinction growing in our secondary school system. He might even consider the suggestion put forward in that excellent document produced by the Fine Gael Party in which a different approach to this problem has been put forward.</P>

      <P>I acknowledge the fact that this is a difficult problem. Would the Minister agree with me there?  It is a difficult problem.  I agree with the argument the Minister has put up there regarding environment.  In other words, the Minister is trying to say that the pupils&mdash;we will say from a certain level&mdash;would not be happy in one of these top schools.  That is commonsense; I appreciate that fact myself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate Deputy O'Donnell's constructive approach to this and I am trying to do the same. The difficulty then is how will these top schools, as he calls them&mdash;I have a different name but his is a more reasonable one&mdash;decide how the third of the free places will come up?  Will they be looking for top brains again, and saying: &ldquo;You will do an entrance examination before you get in&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. T. O'Donnell Mr. T. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not too sure on this but I shall give an opinion on it.  I understand that in Great Britain, in recent years, there has been a tendency to encourage the public schools to accept a certain proportion of scholarship holders every year.  In other words, it is levelling out and it has worked very satisfactorily there, from what I have read about it.  Harrow, Eton and all these other public schools each year take in a certain percentage of students whose parents normally could not afford to pay for them and they seem to have been integrated into the actual public school system quite well.  The environmental obstacles do not seem to be as great as was expected.  Again, I am relying fully on memory but it seems to be working out quite satisfactorily. Maybe this could be done by means of an entrance examination&mdash; the admission of the third.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not happy about this question of the free schools and the paying schools.  The Minister should not allow himself to be rigidly committed to this idea.  Perhaps there may be a <i>via media,</i> or a better way.  Perhaps the Minister has spent months studying <Col N="2033" /> this problem and he may have conclusively decided there is no other way of doing it&mdash;I do not know&mdash;but I am saying I am not happy about this situation of free schools and paying schools, class distinction and so on.</P>
    <P>On this question of obstacles in the way of secondary education to students from the lower income families the Minister lists, on page 22 of his speech:</P>
    <P>Their inability to meet the cost of school books and requisites.</P>
    <P>The Minister has agreed to solve that problem by providing free books.  The only problem is the question of the headmaster having to make the decision as to what pupils are entitled to free books.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>But who is more conversant with the family circumstances of the child than the headmaster of the school?  Surely an official of my Department would not know the family background?  There is the headmaster of the school who knows the family, meets them every day, knows their circumstances and, then, when I say 25 per cent of the books will be given free to pupils in certain very poor areas, it could be as much as 100 per cent.  There could be other areas in the country where free books would not be necessary, because the students might be of fairly well off parents.  I think it is a good thing to give the discretionary power.</P>

      <P>A system has to be devised, then, to determine who is most entitled, who is the most needy and who needs the assistance in the matter of providing books.  I do know that in one religious Order which has played a tremendous role in providing secondary education for many of our population&mdash;who could not otherwise avail of it, through financial reasons&mdash; have a system and do help in the matter of the provision of books.  But, again, it is possibly a loose system and is not comprehensive enough.  The books are a very big problem.

      <P>The question of providing free education for those who cannot afford it, and the question of providing free books for those who <Col N="2035" /> cannot afford to buy them, are basically two things upon which there will have to be general agreement.  The need for an additional breadwinner is very often a serious and a big obstacle, particularly in the case of the working man who has a large family of perhaps six or eight children.  By the time the eldest child finishes his primary education, the financial strain on the family can be very great.  I hope the Minister will devise some means to help these people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is that this is a very special problem.  The tragedy is that the father can be unemployed or in receipt of disability payments.  He may have a child of 14 years who has just left school.  The father is in receipt of the dole, or a social welfare payment, or a medical payment, and it is essential that the child, even though he may be brilliant, goes into a factory to bring in £6 or £7 a week.  We are asking this very poor type of person to make a tremendous sacrifice and to put his clever or brilliant child forward for further education.  That is one of the great problems.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am confining myself to the Minister's speech, and I am trying to be as relevant as possible. One of the great tragedies is&mdash; and we have all had experience of this &mdash;when a pupil in a national school who shows promise of brilliance, has aptitude, talent and application, and would by any standard make the grade if he had the opportunity, has to leave school at the age of 14 years.  That is a great tragedy of our educational system.  I would support and welcome anything which would overcome that problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The absence of motivation from the family environment is a very important factor, and is perhaps of greater <Col N="2037" /> importance than it might appear to be. I understand that certain surveys have been carried out to determine the attitudes of parents towards post-primary education.  I understand that a survey has been carried out in Limerick by some members of the Faculty of Sociology in UCC.  I had hoped to get a copy of that report but it may not be printed yet.  This question of motivation is very important. It is very difficult to assess it without examining the situation scientifically by means of surveys.  Therefore, I cannot give any conclusive views on it, except to say that I am aware that motivation from the family environment is a serious matter.</P>
    <P>The cost of transport in the rural areas is the next point.  Transport is tied up very closely with the Minister's proposal to provide free post-primary education for 75 per cent of our pupils. Last night Deputy Tully went into the question of transport in very great detail.  All Deputies have experienced the problems which he outlined as having encountered in his experience. The timing of buses, the diverting of buses off fixed routes on to other routes to pick up children&mdash;we have come across all those problems and they will require a lot of working out.</P>
    <P>The provision of post-primary education facilities up to the age of 15 years for all who wish to avail of them will create problems other than the actual payment of tuition fees and payments for books.  There is the problem of providing adequate accommodation to cater for the increased number of pupils who will be going to the secondary and vocational schools.  I have seen some figures in a table in the report on &ldquo;Investment in Education&rdquo;, in Appendix IV, page 242.  On the question of the availability of accommodation in secondary schools, the age of the schools and so forth and the actual capacity of the schools are given and from the figures given, it would seem to me that existing accommodation in secondary schools is availed of to the extent of 80 per cent or more. Many of the buildings and classrooms are very old and it seems there will be a very big problem in providing <Col N="2038" /> adequate accommodation in our secondary schools for the increasing numbers who will be availing of secondary education.</P>
    <P>There is coupled with this the question of the training of adequate teaching staffs for secondary schools.  There is no scarcity of teachers for certain subjects&mdash;in fact, we have been exporting a number of arts graduates every year&mdash;but in the subjects of mathematics and science, there is a shortage of suitably qualified secondary teachers. I believe part of the problem is that graduates in mathematics and science can obtain much more remunerative employment in industry and that many of them tend to go into industry or fields other than teaching.  Some system will have to be devised to attract the best qualified people to teach in the most important fields of mathematics and science.</P>
    <P>On the other section of post-primary education, vocational schools, I am very pleased to note that the present system of appointing vocational and technical teachers will be done away with and that a special board will be set up.  I welcome this because the system of appointment up to now has been open to too many abuses.  It has been humiliating, and in many cases degrading, for newly qualified teachers to have to go out and canvass support from members of committees.  The abolition of that system was long overdue.</P>
    <P>Another difficulty to which I should like to draw the Minister's attention is the qualification known as the Ceard Teastas Gaeilge which every teacher in a vocational school must have before he can become a full-time, established vocational teacher.  Irrespective of the subjects he has to teach, he must have the Ceard Teastas Gaeilge.  I happen to have had a little experience of teaching in the vocational service and I can tell the Minister that this qualification, this condition of employment known as the Ceard Teastas Gaeilge, has prevented a number of suitably qualified people from coming into the vocational teaching service.  I consider it completely ridiculous.  In a school in which I was teaching I came across a teacher who <Col N="2039" /> taught English and no other subject right through the school and who, before he became established, had to do the examination qualifying him for the Ceard Teastas Gaeilge to show he was able to teach English through the medium of Irish.</P>
    <P>Again in the vocational schools there is a shortage of teachers of certain subjects and this is another problem that must be tackled by the Minister.  I think I have covered most of the points in the Minister's speech in which I was interested.  In previous Estimates, provision was made for two subventions which were not mentioned in the Minister's speech on this occasion.  The Minister will put me right if I am wrong but I think that previously there was a subvention to the Catholic Workers' College to enable the authorities there to provide the excellent courses in adult education which they have been fostering.  There was a subvention to Muintir na Tíre, some of which has been devoted to the new rural leadership and adult education courses which the Minister opened in Foynes a couple of weeks ago.  Can I take it that these subventions are still available?</P>

      <P>I am particularly interested in the field of adult education and have referred to it here on previous occasions.  Certainly the Catholic Workers' College has done tremendous pioneering work in the field of adult education.  In this context I wish to pay a tribute to the trade unions and the employers whose co-operation has been responsible for the success of the courses.  Another experiment in this field of adult education was pioneered some years ago by Dr. Alfred O'Rahilly, who was then President of UCC.  He organised extension courses from UCC and in my constituency these classes have been providing&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>What is the difference the Minister has seen?  If a student goes two nights a week for two years to study social science, it is bound to have an effect on him.  The effect I have seen is that such students are very outspoken.  They tend to be very critical at meetings and seem to be able to put their finger on certain things which politicians might like to see covered up.  To us, of course, they can be a bit of a nuisance.  Perhaps that is what the Minister means.  We politicians would have things a lot easier if there were fewer of these people about.  I know the Minister is not serious in this.  I think these courses are very good.  For instance, there is the rural science course.</P>

I shall suggest to him as I did to his colleagues that a good deal more could be done in this field of extension education.  Certain courses are provided by UCD but when one compares the very little amount of <Col N="2041" /> work and the very small contributions which our universities are making to adult education in this country with the tremendous contributions that are being made by the universities in Britain, in co-operation with the workers, educational associations, our universities might be prodded into a little more activity in this field of adult education.</P>

      <P>Molaim an tAire, freisin, as an chóras nua atá aige i leith na Gaeilge. Bhí mé i gcónaí den tuairim go raibh an iomarca gramadaí á mhúineadh ins na scoileanna agus nár chabhraigh sin leis an phríomh-aidhm a bhí againn, sé sin, an Ghaeilge a chur á labhairt arís i measc phobal na tíre seo.  Tá an modh múinte nua seo bunaithe ar chóras a chuir an tAthair Colmán Ó hUallacháin ar fáil.  Is modh nadúrtha é agus do réir an méid atá cloiste agam mar gheall air chuireann na páistí suim mhór ann agus baineann siad taithneamh as.  Má táimíd chun an Ghaeilge a athbheóchan, caithfidh deighilt a dhéanamh in aigne an pháiste idir na gná ábar scoile agus an Ghaeilge. Caithfidh an rang Gaeilge a bheith ar an rang is taithneamhaí agus sin mar atá sé fé an chóras nua seo.  Cloisim go mbíonn na páistí óga ag foghlaim drámaí beaga ar an dóigh nua seo sa scoil ag gabháil do na drámaí céanna nuair a bhíonn siad ag súgradh sa bhaile um thráthnóna.</P>

      <Col N="2042" /> Bhí mé fein sa Teanglann i Rinn Mhic Ghormáin agus labhras leis an Athair Colmán Ó hUallacháin agus chonnaic mé na rudaí go léir a bhí ar siúl ansin.  Tá a fhios againn go léir gurab é an tAthair Ó hUallacháin a chuir amach <i>Buntús Gaeilge</i> agus ba mhaith liom mo chomhgháirdeachas a dhéanamh leis mar gheall air sin.</P>
    <P>I should like, first of all, to deal with the training of teachers.  The Minister says that up to 1958 there were untrained teachers being inducted into our schools system.  This has now ceased.  He also points out that for the first time European countries have stopped taking untrained teachers into their schools.  He has also made provision for teachers up to 56 years of age who have been trained to take a couple of courses per year.  This is very good.  It is a tragedy for the children and it is a tragedy for the parents that they should have been exposed, up to 1958, to untrained teachers.</P>
    <P>I taught in England for a year as a teacher in the secondary modern school system and I saw the tragedy of exposing those children to non-trained teachers.  It still continues over there.  I consider that the secondary modern system in England is a total waste of money.  Speaking of free education, I should like the State to take a deeper interest&mdash;I am sure the Minister will &mdash;in the running of the schools.  The thing has gone completely out of hand in England, as I saw as a teacher.</P>
    <P>As far as the Irish language is concerned, my position is very clear.  We are all in agreement, as I said, as a result of an tAthair Ó hUallacháin's <i>Buntús Gaeilge</i>, and the very great research which went into it, that this should be the system which should come into being in our schools.  I believe it is being implemented.  My own experience of school some ten years ago was that, first of all, we had the cló Rómhánach.  We were brought away from the cló Gaelach as it were. This complicated matters.  On top of that, we had too much emphasis on grammar, too much emphasis on reading. Those are the barriers to a proper policy of ensuring the continuation of the Irish language.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2043" /> As I say, there has been too much emphasis on grammar and too little emphasis on oral Irish.  Again, we have to realise that it is about time we concentrated on the oral aspects of our language.  Deputy Mrs. Desmond spoke as a mother and I agree with her observations in relation to young children of four years of age.  I agree without qualification, with what she said on the matter.  She speaks from experience.</P>
    <P>The problem ten years ago&mdash;it is the same today&mdash;is that we have two different type sets in relation to the printing of the Irish language.  We have the Roman, the cló Romhánach typescript, moving away from the Gaelic script, the cló Gaelach.  If you go to an Irish library and pick a book from the shelves, you find it is written in the cló Gaelach.  The next book you select is written in the cló Romhánach. This adds to the confusion.  I hope the Minister will be able to bring some uniformity into the printing of the written word in Irish.  Perhaps the Minister will tell us why the move was from the cló Gaelach to the cló Romhánach. It confuses me and I am sure it confuses young children.</P>

      <P>The Constitution, to me, lays down that the Irish language should be our first language and the English language should be our second language.  I see no reason why this should not continue.  We should move towards a bilingual society.  Nobody will deprive me, as an Irishman, of the pleasure of reading the works of Yeats, O'Casey, Joyce or my great hero, Brendan Behan.  They wrote in English and nobody will deprive me of the right to read their works in the <Col N="2044" /> language they were written in.  Most of the great literature of this country was written at the beginning of this century by people such as Wilde.  If we are looking towards a bilingual society, we must not be deprived of the writings of those people.  Of course, if we are moving into the Common Market&mdash;I assume we will without the help of the Labour Party&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Is féidir liom go deimhin.  French was mentioned in the Minister's report.  He says that in 1960-61 37,041 students were taught French and that in 1965-66 60,956 students were taught French.  This is a move in the right direction.  We want to think in terms of Irish, English and the continental languages, particularly French.  In Ireland, we are, in the nature of things, Francophile. This is why we should concentrate on more continental languages, as well as on Irish and English.  In the constituency I represent, we have Irish classes.  Those classes are conducted in a very civilised manner.  Both Irish and English are spoken in them.  If a person cannot complete a sentence in Irish, he continues it in English.  This, to me, is a non-brutal approach to the Irish language.  They supply English words where Irish words are wanting and as a result people are encouraged to speak Irish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are all in favour of free education and our Proclamation calls for equal opportunities for all our children. We have not yet arrived at that stage but we are arriving at it, and the Minister's document is a beginning. The report on &ldquo;Investment in Education&rdquo; stated that in 1963, 11,000 children left full-time education before reaching junior certificate level. It added that 4,000 more left before the intermediate certificate and 7,000 left vocational schools without doing <Col N="2045" /> their group certificate.  In 1963, 22,000 children left school without qualification of any kind at all.  Over the past 20 or 30 years, we have been listening to talk about crimes against humanity but this is a crime by this State against those 22,000 children.  I am glad to see that the new Minister is trying, as it were, to rectify the situation. Twenty-two thousand human beings is a lot to have on one's conscience. We must think in terms of the loss to the country and the economy of these 22,000 human beings.  We owe these people a debt.</P>
    <P>In regard to post-primary education, the Minister says that 61,000 day pupils in secondary schools will have free education available to them. &ldquo;Available&rdquo; is the word and it is underlined in the Minister's speech, because you cannot force people in to school.  It is available to these people and they must make use of it.  I am very glad to see that the fees for the comprehensive schools have been abolished.  The Minister mentioned denominations other than Catholic and I do not think we have anything to shout about in that regard.  We should aim at having totally free schooling for all sections of the community, of all denominations.  This is one thing we did learn and we have a lot to be proud of in that respect, and the Minister's Department has a lot to be proud of.</P>
    <P>The Minister states that all the available schemes for the lower income groups may still not get all the children into school.  This is so.  I know that there is a lot of money involved in this plan but there will have to be more money available and this clearly indicates that the Minister is going to make money available for those who cannot avail of free education, free books and the other facilities available due to family circumstances.  I would suggest that one of the answers would be to give a small allowance to the parents in addition to free education, free transport and free schoolbooks. The children of these lower income groups are entitled to education at all costs.  I hope that the Minister will give this matter his urgent consideration.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2046" /> In regard to post-secondary education, and university students, I have already publicly stated that there should be a scheme for those university students who cannot afford the fees. The people I am talking about are in the lower income groups As the Minister stated in Waterford recently, and I had the pleasure of listening to him, many of the students in the universities are not fit to have got past the front gate.  I agree with that.  There should be a scheme available whereby the State would give loans to students on qualification.  Only those with the highest academic records from secondary education would have the scheme available to them.  It would, of course, affect mainly the poorer sections who cannot afford to go to the university.  To their undying credit, the Students Representative Council have initiated a scheme of this nature.  It is a beginning and the Minister should look to it as a pilot scheme for giving grants to poorer students.  There is an obligation on the State to provide this free education at university level and the thinking that has gone into the Minister's document clearly indicates that he is aware of the situation and that in time he will rectify it.</P>
    <P>In a number of European countries, and in one Middle East country of which I have experience, Egypt, this State-loan scheme is in operation.  For the Minister's information, there is in the Egyptian scheme a stipulation that on qualification there is an obligation on the student to remain in the State for five years, so that as well as repaying the money, he is repaying five years of his academic life to the State.  The only problem here would be that it might be unconstitutional to restrict the right of a student to go to England or Northern Ireland.  The social science students about whom Deputy T. O'Donnell spoke mainly leave the country for want of being inducted into either the Department of Social Welfare or the Department of Education, and this is a bad thing.  There is not sufficient emphasis placed on this particular point.</P>
    <P>The Minister, as Minister for <Col N="2047" /> Health, was always aware of the problem of providing schools for the mentally-handicapped.  Enough could not be done for these schools.  The report on &ldquo;Investment in Education&rdquo;, in the annexes and appendices, states at page 35 that in 1963, 41 special schools were available to these children.  The total enrolment at that time was 2,691 children.  In December, 1965, the number of schools catering for the deaf, blind and partially sighted, orthopaedic, cerebral palsy, the mentally-retarded, and so on, increased to 52, with a consequent increase in enrolment.  The many organisations catering for these people cannot be helped sufficiently or given enough credit for what they are doing. I would ask the Minister to continue in the direction in which he is going in regard to the schools for the mentally-handicapped. This is one section of our community to which we have a great obligation.  The new social thinking and the commentaries given by such people as Michael Viney of the <i>Irish Times</i>, have really focused attention on the question of the mentally-retarded. As I say, we have an obligation to these people and with the Minister we have, we will fulfil it.</P>
    <P>On page 10 of the Minister's speech, he deals with reformatories and industrial schools.  He is dealing with these schools in a rather cursory manner.  He says there is a decrease of £23,050 in the allocation for these schools.  The report of the Commission of Inquiry into the Reformatory and Industrial School System was published in 1936 and a pamphlet was issued later by <i>Tuairim</i> which points out that many of the recommendations of that Commission were not implemented.  I was impressed on reading the recommendations of the Commission.  They are as valid now as they were in 1936 and I ask the Minister to look into them. Incidentally, this is mentioned in the annexes and appendices to &ldquo;Investment in Education&rdquo; at page 29, for the Minister's information.</P>
    <P>One has an obligation to one's own constituency and one of the many <Col N="2048" /> problems that arise in my area concerns children leaving the school at lunch time and other times.  Only recently I had a letter from the principal of the Hall School in Monkstown stating that a child was very seriously injured while running out on to the Monkstown Road.  The Minister should get together with the Minister for Local Government to ensure that wardens are placed outside every children's school in the country.  Alternatively, the various Departments should get together to ensure that there are controlled pedestrian crossings outside these schools.  It is too dangerous to allow these children, who, naturally, are full of the joy of life, to cross the road unprotected.  They must be protected against themselves, if necessary, and I ask the Minister to give this matter special attention.</P>
    <P>Much has been done in the replacement of old schools.  I have made many representations and I have received great co-operation from various Departments in relation to Booterstown national school.  The history of that school goes back to the middle of the last century.  It was put together in bits and pieces from time to time up to 1964 when a new schoolmaster came there.  It is interesting to note the development that followed. As a result of his teaching methods, the school roll has increased from 40 pupils about three years ago to over 200 pupils this year.  This was a school set up for 20 or perhaps 40 children over 100 years ago.  It is now catering for over 200 children. I ask the Minister to ensure that the Booterstown national school building project is put into his Estimate for next year.  We must have a new school in Booterstown.  The present situation has been brought about by this teacher for whom I have the greatest admiration and children are coming from all over the constituency to him. At present he has to turn them away, which is a tragedy.  If we had facilities there, they could be accepted in the school.</P>
    <P>I agree with the speakers who have said that this Estimate is a historic document.  No matter what is said it <Col N="2049" /> is the beginning.  Let me say about it and the Fine Gael and Labour documents, that it opens, as President Johnson is wont to say, a consensus. It is a beginning.  We are achieving something by criticising their documents and by their criticising our document.  This is important.  We shall arrive at some sort of comprehensive agreement on education generally.  It was observed that education should be taken out of politics.  I find that difficult to understand but education, let us say, should be made as a-political as possible.</P>
    <P>To come back to the Irish language, I should like to pay special tribute to two programmes which I consider are the finest television programmes in the Irish language, &ldquo;Labhair Gaeilge Linn&rdquo; and &ldquo;Amuigh faoin Spéir&rdquo;.  They do much for the language and their creators and commentators are to be complimented.</P>

This document is the beginning of free education for all those children who cannot afford it and I think we shall have achieved much of the ideals of the men of 1916 and that period when we do give equality to all our children.</P>
      <P>Finally, I should like to congratulate the Minister on his appointment as Minister for Education.  As Minister for Health, he gave much hope. There has been a good deal of criticism of his Department, to which I do not subscribe.  In my capacity as a public representative, I have to date received every co-operation from the Department.  When I stop getting that co-operation, I shall be critical.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom cúpla focal a rá ar an Meastachán seo, Meastacháin in a bhfuil go leor airgid. I regret to note the absence of reference to career guidance in the Minister's report.  This is a very important aspect of education and one we cannot overstress.  The importance of avoiding putting square pegs in round holes is obvious and in sending out our children <Col N="2050" /> into the world, we must fit them as best we can for what is before them.  The Minister may, however, approach this from other angles.</P>
      <P>We must face a challenge in the Common Market.  Are we gearing ourselves for this by first introducing the decimal system in our schools?  Are we thinking in terms of continental languages? These are very important aspects of education today and we should be on our toes in regard to them.  I was glad to hear and note the Minister's reply when questioned by other Members about the allocations to the different universities.  For the record, I should like to repeat these: UCD, £187,990, practically £188,000; Cork, £246,000; Trinity College, £311,000; and the cinderella of them all, Galway, £56,620.  The Minister says that certain proposals were not put to him by the powers-that-be in Galway but I must remind the Minister that proposals were made in the past and nothing was done.  I am glad that the Minister said that this is the cause of what may be described as the poor allocation.</P>
      <P>Reference has been made to the condition of our schools.  Great headway has been made but there is a lot of leeway to be made up in parts of the country.  There are certain schools that can only be described as insanitary hovels.  I wonder if our county medical officer were to make a report on them, how they would measure up to what has been said about the achievements in this regard.  Many children have happy memories of schooldays, but some of the schools I have seen children go into will not provide happy memories for them.  The fireplace is up behind the teacher.  The teacher did not put it there but it is there.  They can see the fire but they will not feel it, even though they come into school wet and cold after long journeys along the road.  They do not all come in motor cars or buses.  A lot remains to be done in this regard.  I am chary about this question of the provision of free schoolbooks. There is a touch of free beef about it.</P>

If the Minister does not hold his head a little more, many parents will start to worry about who is guiding the destiny of their children.  There may be a lot to be said for this proposal.  I said I was chary about it.  I did not condemn it outright by any means.  How will it be approached?  Will there be a certain stigma attached to it?  I know something has to be done in that regard.  The cost of schoolbooks is a big impost on the pay packet of the man with a big family, but are we to have class distinction arising from the Minister's proposal?</P>
      <P>I would not like to let the occasion pass without paying tribute to the great work of the religious Orders, especially in my own town, in providing educational facilities.  We are blessed in having these people who are dedicated to the teaching of our children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last Fianna Fáil Deputy who spoke started off by saying we must put the Irish language first.  He spoke a few words in Irish to colour the picture, but before he went very far, he wanted bilingualism and before he finished, he wanted all the languages in the world spoken.  He wanted the best of all worlds.  I find myself in agreement with him up to a point. One thing we must all face up to&mdash;and I say this with full knowledge of what I am talking about, coming from the Gaeltacht&mdash;that the Irish language policy is a dismal failure.  Why?  First, the greatest exports we have are Irish speakers.  When I say &ldquo;Irish speakers&rdquo;, <Col N="2052" /> I do not mean those who acquired Irish for the purpose of making something out of it, the people who have flogged the language for one purpose only, who have no greater love for it than one dog has for another.  The Government approach to this question is wrong.  You may be able to lead an Irishman but you will not drive him, and that is the attitude that has been adopted in regard to Irish.  I have great respect for the fáinne, but I have never seen a fáinne wearer or a fáinne nua wearer&mdash;I am glad to see the Minister is sporting one, and I hope he will improve&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That is no harm at all.  It might do the Minister good.  I am speaking for the people who got the Irish language from the cradle.  I see some of this thing day in and day out, and the suitcase brigade can tell you the story.  Bhí beirt fhear ag caint i nGaillimh cúpla mí ó shoin agus chualas an scéal seo.  Bhí duine acu ag dul ar ais go Sasana agus d'fhiafraigh an fear eile dhe, cathain a bheadh a dheartháir ag teacht ar ais mar ba mhaith leis dul go Sasana in éineacht leis.</P>
      <P>To the Members of this House that may mean nothing, but I know what it means.  Here was a young man from the Gaeltacht who by virtue of the fact that he got nothing else but Irish from the cradle, could not go beyond Westland Row station.  He was asking this friend when his brother would be back so as to guide him and so that he could join the suitcase brigade in England.  That is happening after every holiday season.  They go away in groups.  They are soured against the national language because they cannot face up to the challenge put before them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is our greatest export.  That is <Col N="2053" /> why our national language is going down the drain.  Those are the real speakers of Irish who did not just acquire it for a job.  I am not saying there are not some sincere speakers of Irish.  There are, of course, but it is this other group who have done so much harm to the language and soured people against it.  I have said this before and I want to repeat it: we have young men from the Gaeltacht&mdash;all the brains of the country are not centred in Dublin&mdash;who passed all their examinations with colours flying through the medium of the national language, and I know of several cases where they were turned down for the Garda Síochána because they had not enough English.</P>
    <P>Too far east is west.  No wonder the people of the Gaeltacht are crying out to learn the English language. They realise what it means to them. When children from the rest of the country go to the Gaeltacht to learn Irish, the opportunity is taken by the children of the Gaeltacht to learn English from them because they realise what they are up against when they have to emigrate.  If we want to create a love for the Irish language, compulsion is out.  Let it not be said there is no compulsion.  In my own town people are compelled to send their children to learn through the medium of Irish.  There is no English taught in any of the schools.</P>
    <P>In that connection I would like to stress the importance of parental rights.  We boast to the world of our Constitution.  Article 40 of that Constitution states in the first paragraph:</P>
    <P>All citizens shall, as human persons, be held equal before the law.</P>
    <P>This shall not be held to mean that the State shall not in its enactments have due regard to differences of capacity, physical and moral, and of social function.</P>
    <P>Now I turn to Article 42, paragraph 3, which states:</P>
    <P>The State shall not oblige parents in violation of their conscience and lawful preference to send their children to schools established by the State, or to any particular type <Col N="2054" /> of school designated by the State.</P>
    <P>The State shall, however, as guardian of the common good, require in view of actual conditions that the children receive a certain minimum education, moral, intellectual, and social.</P>
    <P>In my town they have not a choice. Parents are supposed to have rights. No wonder we have new organisations rising up, call them LFM or anything else you like.  When children come home from school and have to do their homework through the medium of Irish, parents who may not have had the opportunity of learning Irish cannot help them.  However, a clique who have had such an advantage are going to push their children at the expense of those less fortunate.  That is where the sourness is being created.</P>
    <P>We have the Gaeltacht being set up like an Indian reservation.  Inspectors are running around watching them to see are they talking English.  If they talk English, they get a rap in regard to grants and what-have-you.  These are the things that are souring the people against the Irish language.  Gan teanga gan tír: I heard that said long ago.  I want to relate now a story I told in this House before.  It happened in the Irish Centre in Camden Square, London.  I went in and asked were there many from Galway there. I was shown a young man sitting alone at a table, apart from all the others.  I went over to him.  He had not one word of English.  He was glad to hear somebody speak a few words to him.  It is a sad day that the priest has to go over to England to hear confessions in Irish, so great is the export of the Irish language.</P>
    <P>We pay lip service to the language here and begin our speeches with a few words of Irish.  I do not hear much of the Irish language spoken here; yet this is the testing-ground so far as the language is concerned.  People are beginning to get their backs up at the kind of approach being made.  I have stressed the importance of trying to win people to the language instead of driving them away.  I feel it is about time we had a new look at our approach to the language.  Take it out <Col N="2055" /> of the hands of those who are making a good thing out of it.  Forbid the teaching of Irish, and we will learn it then.  We learned it when the British were here for pure spite.  If we continue on the lines we are going at present, not only will we have the LFM but a dozen other organisations. The whole approach is wrong.</P>
    <P>If you want to save the Irish language, save the Irish speakers, make it worth their while to speak the real Irish in the Gaeltacht areas in Galway, Kerry, Mayo and so on.  Then you will have the national language respected and spoken.  But, as it is, the people are being soured.  I am glad that one of the points in the Fine Gael educational programme is that children will be taught through Irish only if the parents wish.  It is ridiculous to be trying to teach Latin through Irish. When the children come home to do their homework, the parents cannot help them.  Unless we have the co-operation of parents, all the lip service we pay to the language here is no good and all the money spent on certain elements will be money down the drain.</P>

      <P>Deputy Andrews spoke about the lack of facilities for backward children, not necessarily children who are mentally retarded but children who find it somewhat difficult to keep up with the average child in a class.  This presents a very real problem to parents which the Government have made no serious attempt to solve.  A situation exists in Dublin city where we have anything from 40 to 50 and even 60 children under the care of one teacher.  I do not say &ldquo;under the care&rdquo; loosely.  I believe a teacher asked to impart knowledge to 60 children finds it absolutely impossible to do so. At best, he or she can only be described as a baby-sitter.  It is not possible for a teacher to carry 40, 50 or 60 children with him, children who have not all the same mental equipment. Some are brighter than others; some are quite slow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have failed to cater for these children who, with proper instruction, could benefit from education just as <Col N="2056" /> much as the bright child.  I know the Minister is personally concerned about this problem.  We had opened in Ballymun recently a school for backward children.  The Minister performed the opening ceremony and during the course of his visit, was sufficiently concerned to make a personal contribution to the school.  This is an indication that the Minister is concerned as an individual.  But that is not enough. Generous though it may have been, the Minister's personal contribution will not go very far towards solving the great problem confronting the parents of backward children.</P>
    <P>The last speaker quoted from the Constitution and said that all the children of the nation are entitled to equal opportunity.  These children find that through no fault of their own, under the present system, it is impossible for them to digest the standard rate that must be maintained by teachers under the existing regulations. A teacher with a very large class just has not got the time to devote to children under his care who may be somewhat slow and particularly slow in certain subjects.  He is given a certain amount of work to achieve during the school year.  He must go along at the pace at which the average child can keep up with.  There is no allowance for the children who may be somewhat slow in learning.  This is something the Minister could very usefully look into.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been open to certain amount of attack by Opposition speakers, including members of my own Party, regarding his announcement at some function&mdash;I think it was a journalists' function in Dún Laoghaire&mdash;of this new plan to provide what he described as free education. I believe the Minister was sincere. I believe he was concerned enough to put himself out on a limb.</P>
    <P>Whatever else may be said about the Minister, I think it should be acknowledged that he knows how to deal with his colleagues in the Government.  It is my opinion that this announcement was made by the Minister in the full realisation that, once he had made it, his colleagues would find it very difficult <Col N="2057" /> not to implement it.  The Minister is entitled to credit as being somewhat unique in his progressiveness amongst his colleagues.  If this is the only way to advance with the Government, we welcome it.  If it is necessary for the Minister for Education to put the Government on the spot in order to advance somewhat, I am prepared to give him full credit for his courage in doing so.  However, there is a considerable amount more to be done.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister was not discouraged by whatever repercussions there may have been on his last venture. I hope he will not be discouraged to the extent that he will not introduce some more progressive ideas into the field of education.  God knows, it is not very difficult to find out what these progressive ideas are.  We, in the Labour Party, produced a document in 1925 on education and we produced a further document in 1963.  If the Minister is prepared to take another chance with his colleagues, I would recommend him to look up these documents where he will find clearly marked out for him the path on which he can further put his colleagues in the Government on the spot and make some other little advancement in the field of education.</P>
    <P>I represent a Dublin constituency.  I was born and reared in Dublin but I have some knowledge of the conditions that prevail in many rural schools&mdash; the very dilapidated buildings; the lack of proper toilet facilities; in many cases, the lack of water; the lack of proper heating; the general unsuitability of these schools for children. We have seen, over the past few years, a tremendous reaction by the parents of children attending these schools to the conditions that prevail.  We have seen parents refusing to send their children to school.  We have had instances that were described in the press as strikes by school children against these conditions.</P>
    <P>I do not think that any responsible parent&mdash;and, out of a whole school one must assume that the majority if not all of the parents are responsible &mdash;lightly keeps his child away from school.  The conditions must be absolutely appalling.  The representations to <Col N="2058" /> the Minister's Department to try to have these defects remedied must have been long and persistent because only as a last resort will parents deny their children the right of education.  It is wrong that, after nearly 50 years of native government, we find ourselves in the situation that people will keep their children at home sooner than expose them to the conditions that prevail in schools where they are presented with the choice that if they want their children educated the price they must pay is to endanger their health. That is the choice that has been presented to very many parents in this country and it is one which, to all appearances, will continue to present itself to some parents for a considerable time to come.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to speak much longer on this Estimate but I should like to make just one further comment on the Irish language.  I am not by any means a fluent Irish speaker.  I have a very nodding acquaintance with the language.  There are many reasons for this.  There are parents who are not Irish speakers, playmates who are not Irish speakers, and there are various other reasons; but I do believe the Irish language is something that is dear to the hearts of all Irish people.</P>

      <P>The vast majority of the people, even if they do not speak the language, have a regard and a love for it.  Under the present system of teaching the Irish language, this natural love is being killed, to my mind. As a result of the methods which have been pursued over the years, and which undoubtedly have proved to a very great extent a failure, parents have become antagonistic to the language. One of the most important contributory factors is the attitude of many of our people to the language and the attitude of the parent to the child. When a child finds it difficult to learn the Irish language, in many cases that child receives nothing but sympathy when he returns home in the evening. The same sympathy is not extended to a child who does not learn, or finds it difficult to learn, catechism, arithmetic or English.  For some reason, <Col N="2059" /> immediately the child returns home from school and starts complaining about the difficulty he finds in learning the Irish language, in very many cases the reaction of the parent is: &ldquo;Ah, sure it is only a cod anyway.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>If a child hears this from a parent, it has a tremendous effect on his attitude to the language.  A child should get the same reaction from the parent regarding the Irish language as the normal parent's reaction is towards any other subject being taught, which is: &ldquo;Everybody else has to do it; you are no different, so get down and learn it.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This would be a normal parent's attitude towards catechism, arithmetic, and so on; but, for some reason there is this antagonism towards the Irish language on the part of many people. This may be so because when people who are now parents were going to school there was, in many cases, no assistance to be got at home because their parents had no opportunity to learn the language.  It is reasonable to say that it would be very difficult to find a parent of young children today who has not got at least some knowledge of the language and who is unable to assist a child to some extent.  I would say to parents that they should continue with the attitude of sympathising with the child. If they dismiss the language as an unnecessary, cumbersome subject that the child should not take too seriously, all they are achieving is making it far more difficult for the child at school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a different approach, no matter what you think privately&mdash;and let us face it, we are not always so truthful with our children; we have different opinions on many things that we do not come out with in a forthright way to our children&mdash;we should sympathise with children in their difficulty with the language.  If we were to encourage them and try to instil in them a pride in their national language, an appreciation of the great heritage the language is, and the vast field of culture and literature that can be opened to them by becoming fluent in the language, we would find after a very <Col N="2060" /> short space of time that the child's attitude, as in many other cases, could be shaped and developed towards a love of the language.</P>
    <P>Whatever the teacher may do at school or whatever the official policy towards the language may be, there is no greater influence over a child's reaction towards anything than the influence of the parents at home.  I would appeal to parents, not only in the interests of the language but in the best interests of their children, to adopt this attitude towards the teaching of the Irish language in our schools.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, I should like to compliment the Minister on his very realistic approach towards the implementation of his policy statement on free tuition in post-primary education. I agree with a previous speaker who has said that this is a major breakthrough, but I also agree with him when he says this is only the first step.  The Minister could have gone further but I think it would probably have been dangerous for him to do so. He has gone carefully and realistically into this whole question and I think he has done quite a remarkable job.  It is easy to criticise him and to ask for more particulars on matters of detail but a scheme such as this is one which will have to develop as it goes on and we all will have to learn by experience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am particularly grateful to the Minister for his appreciation of the special position of the Protestant community because up to now it has not been officially accepted that there is a very particular problem here.  This is due to the fact that Protestant children are not living in large communities with their fellows but are very often living in isolated homesteads all over the country.  Consequently, it is absolutely necessary to send them to boarding school where facilities for teaching, as well as other facilities are much more effective.  The Minister has gone a long way towards meeting this special problem by guaranteeing the additional <Col N="2061" /> grant of £25.  I feel that the initial grant of £25 and the supplementary grant of £25 is a step in the right direction.  I do not believe for a moment that these amounts will be sufficient.  It may seem ungracious to say this but it is better to say what is in my mind.  He is going in the right direction, and I only hope I am wrong, but I imagine that as time goes on and in the very early future, these grants will also have to be reconsidered and increased.</P>
    <P>There are many matters on which we would like to comment but I shall try to restrict myself to two major questions.  The first is the question of the whole examination system.  I have been doing a considerable amount of reading on this whole question.  In particular, I have been reading of the experiences of schools in England where the examination system is under very critical review at present.  I have seen particulars of one school which had the option of sending its pupils for examination by either of two regional examination boards.  I gather that in many cases in England secondary school examinations are carried out in this way by regional rather than national boards.  In this case, which was quoted in the newspapers, the school decided to send the answer papers first to one examination board, to get the answer papers back, having been marked, and send the same answer papers to another examination board.  The result of this experiment was that there was revealed a wide discrepancy between the markings of the two examination boards who were working on the same examination paper and on the same answer papers in each case.  So great was this discrepancy that in one case one examination board placed one pupil in first place with an honours certificate, while the other examination board, working on identical answer papers, placed the same boy last and stated that he had failed the examination.</P>
    <P>That may be an extreme case but I personally feel that I cannot have absolute confidence in a national examination system.  I know that the Department and the members of the teaching profession who are engaged <Col N="2062" /> as examiners do everything conceivably possible to achieve some standard of uniformity in marking but it just is not possible.  Human nature being what it is, I do not accept that an examiner can accurately and fairly assess the result correct to one per cent.  It may be slightly easier in a mathematical subject where the answer is either right or wrong, but there are many subjects in which there is no clear-cut answer or for which there should be no clear-cut answer, but our present examination system seems to be geared to ensure that children, when asked a certain question, will all produce an acceptable pre-ordained answer.  That, to my mind, is the absolute negation of education.  What we should be trying to do is educating our children to think, not just to reproduce set answers to set questions. In view of the system as we have inherited it and as we have maintained it, it is quite impossible to expect teachers not to try to forecast what the examination questions will be and not to try to instil into their pupils what they believe will be the acceptable answer.</P>
    <P>Another system which has been tried out in England is that of regional examination boards working in conjunction with the teaching staff of the various schools.  A class is put in for an examination by a regional examination board.  The results are, first of all, notified to the school and the grading of the pupil is set out in that way.  This grading by the examination board is then compared with a grading prepared before the examination by the teaching staff of the school and where there is a discrepancy between the grading of the teaching staff and the grading of the examination board, the grading of the teaching staff prevails.</P>
    <P>Yesterday Deputy Mrs. Desmond commented with some approval on the issuing of some certificate instead of the primary certificate.  She said that it was possibly too much to ask the teachers to shoulder this responsibility. I do not agree with her there, though I do agree that it is a very serious responsibility.  I do not believe that anyone can judge the <Col N="2063" /> ability of a pupil better than the teacher who has been working with him or her for a complete school year. It is only a teacher who really knows whether the child has been listening, whether the child has been imbibing the instruction and, above all, whether the child is allowing his or her mind to develop and become the basis of a full personality.  I feel, therefore, that the only thing we can keep as an objective before us is the complete abolition of the examination system as we see it, up to and including the leaving certificate.</P>
    <P>I am not the slightest bit impressed by the leaving certificate as a qualification for employment.  I have people coming to me looking for employment and some of them will say: &ldquo;I have the leaving certificate with so many honours&rdquo;.  Some come and say they either did not get as far as leaving certificate, or tried it but did not get it.  I do not feel in the slightest degree more inclined to accept an applicant with the leaving certificate than an applicant without it.  As an employer, I want to see what sort of boy or girl this applicant is and I will not give priority to a person who has got one more honour or one more pass in a leaving certificate examination.  I would much prefer to trust my own judgment as to whether that boy or girl will be able to absorb fresh instruction in business methods and so on and become a useful member of the staff. I do not think we have anything to lose and I think we have everything to gain by removing these examinations altogether.</P>
    <P>It can, I know, be argued that an examination is a sort of threat which can be held over a class during the year to force them to keep working. I am not greatly impressed by that idea at all.  There should be, I think, continuous tests right through the school year; to pin one's faith on the results of answering eight, ten, or 12 questions in a matter of two hours on a certain date at a certain time is, to my mind, absolutely unfair.  Anything may happen.  A child may fall sick and be unable to take the examination, in <Col N="2064" /> which case a complete year's work is wasted.</P>
    <P>I plead with the Minister to give very serious consideration to the award of intermediate and leaving certificates by the school authorities alone.  People may argue that the school authorities would tend to give too many.  I do not think they would.  I think that would be to regard the teaching profession as being basically irresponsible and I do not believe that for a moment.  Every school would be anxious to keep up its own standard.  The main purpose of completing four years' work for the intermediate certificate and two years' work for the leaving certificate is not to produce certain answers to certain questions on a certain day but to exercise the mind of the child over as wide a syllabus as possible so that the child will then, having completed the syllabus, be able to go on and qualify further in adult life.</P>
    <P>If we were not bound down to this examination system, we would, as other speakers have suggested, be able to increase the number of subjects taught as a matter of routine.  When it is an absolute necessity that the maximum number of children should secure a pass in a certificate examination there is a temptation to reduce the number of subjects and any additional subjects not strictly necessary for the certificate examination are regarded as an intrusion and a waste of time.  That is not right.  We should be spending more time on subjects like civics, art and as many modern languages as possible. By diversifying our efforts too much under the present examination system we make life completely impossible.  I hope the Minister will keep his eyes wide open to the developments in England, where some very interesting experiments are being made.  In particular, he should keep his eye on the possibility of laying far more stress on the final recommendation of a pupil's own teachers rather than on the result of a spot check by an outside examiner.</P>
    <P>The other main point I wish to touch on is the problem of the restoration of the language.  Here we must <Col N="2065" /> try to get down to reality.  First of all, we must accept that there is a problem. We would not be spending so much time discussing and thinking up new methods if a problem did not exist.  If the majority of the people seriously wished to restore the Irish language, there would be no problem. The trouble is the majority do not wish to put themselves out in any way in order to restore the language, though they are prepared to pay lipservice. There has been an advertisement in the public press over the past few days asking people to join in the revival movement.  The main headline is: &ldquo;In a recent survey 76 per cent of those interviewed would like to see Irish commonly spoken throughout the country.&rdquo;  That sort of remark is apposite in relation to Deputy Cluskey, who said that, in his view&mdash; I believe he is sincere in this&mdash;even people who have no knowledge of the language have a deep love for it and pride in it.  The tragedy, to my mind, is that Deputy Cluskey and others believe that, because everybody is prepared to pay lipservice, but no more. That is particularly noticeable in the city area.  People are, however, very nervous about speaking out because they have a quite&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not want to get involved at this stage and I hope Deputy Dillon will not distract me because there is a very real fear. There is an unreasonable fear in the minds of many that, if they do not pay lipservice to the language, they will be penalised in some way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>Sometimes this is a reasonable fear; more often than not, it is unreasonable.  It is due, I think, to a fear in people's minds of being nonconformist.  I do not use that in any ecclesiastical sense.  It is a fear of being out of step, they feel they will be regarded as anti-national and a bit second-rate.  Everybody, therefore, says that he is in favour of the language, <Col N="2066" /> by all means.  This survey was probably right that 76 per cent did say they would like to see Irish commonly spoken throughout the country, but that was not the question that should have been asked.</P>
      <P>A referendum would lead to complete confusion because the referendum would depend on how the question was phrased.  If the question were: &ldquo;Are you in favour of the Irish language?&rdquo;, I believe the answer would probably be, as to 80 per cent, &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.  If the questions were: (a) Are you an Irish speaker; (b) if so, do you speak Irish; (c) if not, are you prepared to spend a regular period of time learning it; (d) having learned it, are you prepared commonly to use it in your daily life, the result might be very interesting. Now those questions would be far too complicated to put to a referendum, but I know perfectly well it is the final two questions which would make the real crunch.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Cluskey says, people will say they have a nodding acquaintance with the language if one asks them do they know it.  If one asks them are they in favour of it, they will say &ldquo;Certainly&rdquo;.  If one asks them are they prepared to learn it, the answer invariably is: &ldquo;I am very busy at the moment and I just cannot find the time, but I feel more people should learn it.&rdquo;  Everybody feels that everybody else should learn it and speak it, but I defy anyone to get a favourable result in a referendum in which the question is: &ldquo;Are you prepared to learn the language and use it constantly?&rdquo; No question of secrecy of the ballot: &ldquo;Are you prepared to come out and sign something in the open to show that you will learn it and use it?&rdquo;</P>

This is the basic <Col N="2067" /> hypocrisy of the whole position which is bedevilling the whole question.  This is something we have got to say out and say out frankly.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>Irish must cease to be a mere qualification.  That is another thing which has damned it right from the outset.  I know of a young lad who went to school here; he got a very good honours leaving certificate in Irish; he then qualified as a doctor; he went abroad and acquired additional training and experience in another country. He wanted to come home and eventually he did get a very good professional job back here under the Local Appointments Commission.  He was selected on merit.  He took up the job and was then told: &ldquo;Of course, you must have an oral Irish test.&rdquo;  It was about ten years since he had got his honours leaving certificate in Irish and he failed the oral Irish test for this job, which he badly wanted and for which he was badly needed.  He went to his prospective superior and asked: &ldquo;What am I going to do now?&rdquo; His superior said: &ldquo;Do not worry, you will get a re-exam.&rdquo; He replied &ldquo;When will I do that?&rdquo; and the superior said: &ldquo;I am waiting for my re-exam for the last 25 years and I have not had it yet.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Now, whom are we fooling with that sort of regulation?  It is absolutely essential that you be able to pass an oral Irish test in order to take up a medical appointment but, if you fail it, we will go through the motions of saying: &ldquo;You will have a re-exam but you need not bother your head about it.&rdquo;  Is it necessary or desirable that the passing of an oral Irish test should always be essential?  If it is, let us stick to it.  I do not believe it is, but let us be honest about it, if, in our hearts we believe it is not necessary, even though some may think it desirable.</P>

The very fact that people have been told&mdash;unless you pass Irish; unless you can qualify to a certain extent, you will be penalised gets people's backs up and they will say: &ldquo;I am damned if I will learn it on that basis.&rdquo;  I did not learn Irish at school simply because&mdash;this dates me a bit&mdash;it was not a compulsory subject at that time.  I was just outside the age limit.</P>
      <P>With the best will in the world, I dare not learn it now because people would ask &ldquo;What is he up to; is he trying for a job; is he trying to be a Minister, or is he trying for some Civil Service job?&rdquo; Nobody would ever give me credit for wanting to learn the language for the language's sake, because it has been reduced to a mere qualification for a Civil Service job.</P>

      <P>No, because there is a time and place for doing these things. Also, I want to make it perfectly clear, I am not going to say this as a way of getting votes, though I do know that if I did say this at a time of a general election, I would get a lot more votes in my constituency than I got last time. But that is not the way I want to act; I do not want to play politics; I do not want to play vote catching.  I have been waiting for the time I could see the <Col N="2069" /> tactical moment of public opinion becoming more honest with itself, people beginning to think these things out.  It would be very easy to write me off as a dead loss.  People would say: &ldquo;Look, that fellow has not got any Irish; he is frightened to try to learn it, therefore, he is bound to be against it.&rdquo;  Nowadays, when public opinion is beginning to waken up, I can say that and, I hope, with some effect.  It was not because I was afraid to say it before but because I thought it might have looked like vote catching and would have had the opposite effect to what I wanted.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been this stress&mdash;and I think a very correct stress&mdash;on the use of oral Irish, rather than written in the schools.  I wish I had the benefit of a full report on a recent speech&mdash;I think it was two days ago&mdash;by Reverend Brother Ó Súilleabháin, Professor of Education at St. Patrick's College, Maynooth.  The very brief report we got in the papers and on Telefís Éireann gave me reason to believe that was a rather important speech by a man who could hardly be written off as being anti-Irish and, as Professor of Education at St. Patrick's College, he is obviously a man who is an expert in his own line.  He was very keen on this question of teaching oral Irish only and he was also pleading for a reduction in the time to be spent on the language.  I gather he recommended not more than 30 minutes per day and&mdash;almost more important than anything else&mdash;an appreciation and an acceptance of the fact that we are living in a multi-cultural society and not a unicultural one.  That means you <Col N="2070" /> have not to deal with people of different backgrounds; it is not a question of just dealing with Protestants as against Catholics.</P>

      <P>Unless people are prepared to discuss something, they might as well throw it in the ashcan. This has been a constant movement, and now it is worse than that.  I am afraid it is a movement of panic by people who feel that the ground is being cut from under their feet.  It is a small minority&mdash;and let us be perfectly clear that it is a minority&mdash;who are trying to enforce their views on the rest of the community.  All of us who believe in free speech and free discussion have a tremendous responsibility to bear.</P>
      <P>In conclusion on that matter, I want to say that unless and until the majority of our people actually want to speak Irish themselves, and to use it in their daily lives, we are bashing our heads against the wall, and that is a profitless undertaking.  Even as a school subject, as it is for most of our people at the moment, it will be dropped as readily as Latin or something else, as soon as it becomes of no immediate necessity or value.  We have already wrecked the language by our stupid lipservice to it, and by our basic hypocrisy.  We chant our love for our culture, but most people who chant about our sacred culture have no conception of what they are talking about, none whatsoever, but they still keep at it because they believe that in that way they show they are Irish.  I question that with every fibre of my being.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a multi-cultural society.  We have a great tradition of reasoned discussion in our comparatively young democratic system, and we must never let it perish.  I believe it is desirable <Col N="2072" /> that our children should at least have an opportunity of learning the language, but it should be a matter of opportunity.  It should be a pass subject in the intermediate and leaving certificates.  Let it be an honours subject for those who have the gift&mdash;and there are those who have a gift and a love for the language and wish to study it up to the top.  Let them study it as a written subject, and as an honours subject, and let them be the guardians of the language for posterity. The average person who scrapes a pass in Irish in the intermediate and leaving certificates, is the greatest enemy of the language that could be produced, because he will say: &ldquo;Thank heavens, I just managed to get it.  Now it goes in the ashcan once and forever.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is &ldquo;mise, le meas&rdquo; after that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>We should get rid of the examination system and make it a school certificate subject.  A certificate could be issued by the schools to the pupils.  The schools could easily issue a certificate in respect of the pupil, saying that he had reached a reasonable standard in spoken Irish.  That should be quite sufficient.  If a child has the enthusiasm to go further, by all means let him go further.  If he has not got that enthusiasm, there should be no more beating over the head, or dangling of carrots of extra grants or an extra five per cent.  That will not help.  We have to face this.  Above all, let us face the fact that at the moment a majority of the people do not wish to restore the language by any act of their own.  Unless and until they are prepared to say: &ldquo;I am going to do this or that to restore the language&rdquo;, they would be much wiser to keep their mouths shut.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This new attitude on the Estimate for the Department of Education is a healthy one.  The Minister deserves to be congratulated.  I am delighted he is in this Department.  He is an exciting personality and a courageous personality. In some ways it is his unpredictability that makes things more hopeful.  In our educational policy we <Col N="2073" /> have been too predictable up to now. It is time we had more adventuring. We are going to have it now, and more power to the Minister.  I wish him the very best of good luck.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have heard many tributes being paid to Ministers in my day, but perhaps the most dramatic one is that he should be complimented on his unpredictability.  I am sure Deputy Booth will share my interest as to whether his predicted resignation&mdash;is it at the end of this year or next year; I cannot remember&mdash;will in fact take place.  He said that if his policy was not implemented by a certain date, he would resign.</P>
      <P>I was speaking recently to a body of university students and they praised this valiant man who had set his career upon the vindication of his beliefs.  I said to the young students that I shared their admiration of this valiance, but as to its validity I would be convinced when the time came.  Yesterday when Deputy O'Higgins was discussing the Minister's opening statement, I spoke to the Minister across the floor of the House about his inability to meet this charge being due to the Minister for Finance, and he nodded his assent.  I wonder is this the occasion when he will declare his intention to redeem his undertaking to resign.  I said to the students the other night that I had heard men make these declarations before, but that very few of them stuck to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Booth has complimented the Minister on his unpredictability.  I wonder will he depart from the uniform pattern in this matter and prove ultimately that he meant what he said? I doubt it.  Perhaps Deputy Booth was more farseeing when he spoke of the Minister as being ambitious as well as unpredictable.  I will agree with Deputy Booth about the ambition.  The unpredictability I will believe in when I behold it.  I am sorry the Minister was not in the House when his colleague, Deputy Booth, was talking, because I think he would have learned from Deputy Booth when he spoke of the grim and, to my mind, horrible fact that his Party are sponsoring a policy which is killing the Irish language.  The most dramatic observation which <Col N="2074" /> Deputy Booth unconsciously made was that all classes and creeds in this country went to make up our common pattern of society, because these words throw my mind back to the time when I first started to learn Irish.  It was a characteristic of the Gaelic League at that time, when this country was riven with passionate dissension on political issues, that that element of our society combined in the Gaelic League for the benefit of the language.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>When progress was reported, I was asking the Minister for Education whether he realised that the policy pursued by the Fianna Fáil Party in regard to the revival of the Irish language was, in fact, killing the language.  I was asking him whether he realised the significance of Deputy Booth's contribution when he spoke of our society consisting of a wide variety of groups, ethnic, religious and social.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an astonishing comparison between the situation of the language <Col N="2094" /> today and the language position 40 years ago.  I am old enough to remember the time when we had very deep and passionate political divisions in which the cause of union with Great Britain was strongly and energetically sustained by a large minority in this country.  We had southern Irish unionists and the Orangemen.  There were Nationalists, and at that time my father was their leader, having succeeded the late Mr. Redmond.  They constituted the great bulk of our people.  There were supporters of Sinn Féin, and supporters of the Irish Republican Brotherhood and between them there existed very frequently a very bitter division which almost precluded social contact.</P>
    <P>That was not peculiar at that time to Ireland because in England itself, and in Scotland very shortly before that, political dissension had created a depth of feeling which had separated people even in their social contact.  But in Great Britain, that is, England, Scotland and Wales, those divisions festered and reached their climax in the mutual detestation of men like Gladstone and Disraeli and their followers. There, families were divided to the point of parting socially.</P>
    <P>But in the corresponding situation obtaining in our own country there emerged the Gaelic League concerned to save the language.  I am old enough to remember meetings of the Gaelic League where there were representatives of the extreme unionist persuasion, nationalists, Sinn Féiners and members of the IRB and in the atmosphere of their mutual solicitude for the language and its revival all the passionate dissension that separated them was sublimated and they could meet in that common cause.  It was of incalculable value to the nation to which we all belong that we had that common cause.</P>
    <P>Deputy Booth posed a question: do the majority of our people want to revive the language?  He said it was his conviction that they did not.  I believe that in saying that Deputy Booth was profoundly wrong.  I believe the vast majority of our people do want to revive the language.  When you examine fundamentally such a vital <Col N="2095" /> question as this you must ask yourself all the questions that arise.  I want to see the Irish language revived as a spoken language and passed on to our children and our children's children as a living, spoken, dynamic language but I might well ask myself the question: If I do want that and if I believe the majority of the Irish people want it, why do they want it?  I am obliged to concede at once, if I am challenged as to whether I want it for utilitarian reasons, that in my considered judgment there are no utilitarian reasons to justify the revival of the Irish language. If we are resolved to regulate our lives hereafter exclusively in terms of pounds, shillings and pence then it were better to let the language die and leave to our successors a dead language as is Latin, classical Greek or Aramaic, a study for scholars and etymologists.</P>
    <P>I do not think any civilised people, and we are civilised people, can suffer their whole lives to be regulated by the pure utilitarianism of pounds, shillings and pence.  If you ask me why I love music I cannot counter the proposition that music has no utilitarian value.  If you ask me why I treasure poetry I cannot point to any utilitarian purpose of poetry.  But our lives would be very bleak if we were to determine, on the grounds that the value of these things could not be measured in pounds, shillings and pence, that we had a duty to let them disappear, a duty to regard all musicians and all poets as a worthless burden on the society to which we belong.</P>
    <P>I want to see the language live as I want to see music and poetry live but there is a special, additional consideration in regard to the language.  No matter what we do in Ireland music and poetry will not die in the world. If we were obscurantist enough to decree their death in Ireland there would be other societies in the world with a greater vision than ours and they would keep them alive but there is nobody in the world who would keep the Irish language alive except the Irish people.  On us exclusively depends whether a living language is to die or survive.  I want it to survive because I believe it is an infinitely <Col N="2096" /> valuable treasure not only for us but for the world.  It is a great catastrophe for the world when a living language dies.</P>
    <P>I was speaking to a man the other day who knew Estonian very well. One of the things he told me was that Estonian was spoken when he went to work there.  I think that language is now dead because it has fallen under the control of a utilitarian, marxist, materialistic dispensation which maintains that preservation of national characteristics is a hindrance rather than a help.  The world is poorer if that language is dead.  We have reached the stage at which it is immensely important, if the death of the Irish language is not to be rapidly consummated, that we try to find common ground.</P>
    <P>I want to say most deliberately that the people who went to the Mansion House as an organised, bloody-minded mob to prevent law-abiding citizens of this State advancing their views are the greatest enemies the Irish language has.  The denial of the right of others to advance views with which one is not in sympathy is intolerable.  If those views be what I am told they are&mdash; and I am not fully informed as to the views of the LFM&mdash;if their view is that they believe Irish ought to be allowed to die, then I am against them.  I think they are wrong but I want them to be heard.  I want their arguments advanced so that I can argue against them, and I have no doubt that against such arguments I and those who think with me will prevail in the hearts and minds of our people.  However, if any mob goes in to claim they have the right to forbid these views to be expressed, then the bulk of our people will say: &ldquo;The cause which needs a mob to defend it must be rotten and undeserving of support&rdquo;.  I repudiate with contempt and loathing the help of any mob to force Irish down the throats of the Irish people.  I am convinced that no mob can do it and if they continue to attempt it, the Irish people will destroy them.  The terrible danger is that in rightly destroying and trampling on a bloody-minded mob of that kind they may be misled into trampling on the Irish language as well.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2097" /> I do not want to be rude to Deputy Booth, though I cannot help admitting that every time he gets up to speak in this House I am made to think of the Pharisee who went up to the temple to pray.  There is something nauseating in Deputy Booth's getting up to tell us that in the secret recesses of his heart he has always cherished the sentiments he indicated today, while at the times of general elections he thinks it wise not to express them, not because he is afraid of his constituents but because he is afraid his leaders might turf him out.  Without the Fianna Fáil vote he could not be elected and, therefore, he thinks it wise to keep his trap shut when he is on the hustings.  When he is safely ensconced here and he thinks there is no immediate prospect of a general election he feels himself free to speak.</P>
    <P>Far different has been our attitude in that regard because we felt that the people should be consulted and were entitled to have this issue put before them.  I can well remember putting the issue clearly before the people at the time of the general election of 1961, not at some remote parish church meeting but in O'Connell Street, outside the General Post Office, addressing many thousands of the citizens of Dublin and others who had come there to attend the final rally of the Fine Gael organisation.  I remember then being denounced by Fianna Fáil for bringing the question of Irish into the arena of a general election.  I thought then, and I think now, that it is the Irish people who have the right to have this issue placed before them.  It is the Irish people who must decide what the ultimate fate of the Irish language is going to be.  As I have said, if there is one thing which is absolutely certain it is that the Irish language cannot be revived as a spoken language unless the majority of our people want to see it so revived.</P>
    <P>Deputy Booth, in dealing with this question, reminded me of a cat walking along the top of a wall covered with glass.  Manifestly the substance of what he said was: &ldquo;You are trying to ram it down the throats of the people but you will not succeed because the people will take damn good care not <Col N="2098" /> to let you.&rdquo;  Then he went on to say there were lots of people who said they loved Irish but it was always the other fellow who ought to learn it.  They could not learn it themselves.</P>
    <P>That is all cod.  I was brought up in a household that loved Irish.  My father did not speak a word of it.  My mother learned it because she loved the language.  Because they believed in the language and loved it they saw that all of us learned the language, but they did not force us to learn the language. No one of us was ever compelled to learn Irish but we felt in our home that not to know the language was to be inferior.  For that reason we learned Irish not so much in the classroom as at Ballingeary, Cloghaneely and Tourmakeady where we went by our own wish on our holiday and learned it because we had been taught to love it.</P>
    <P>What has happened in the intervening years?  In the last 40 years a generation of men and women have grown up in this country who have had Irish forced upon them, who have had it held over their heads like a bludgeon, that if they did not qualify in it they would not be allowed to earn a living in their own country.  They are rearing a generation of children who are learning through their parents to hate and despise it.</P>
    <P>When I went to the Irish college in Cloghaneely, when I went to the Irish college in Ballingeary, there was not a single boy or girl, or man or woman who was there for any other reason than the love of the language.  When I gave up going to Irish colleges, 90 per cent of the students who were there were qualifying to get a job.  They were looking for the Árd Teastas, the Mean Teastas or some other teastas, and if you asked them why they were there, they would say: &ldquo;We cannot get a school if we do not get the teastas.&rdquo;&ldquo;We cannot get a job in the ESB if we do not have the leaving certificate and we cannot get that without Irish.&rdquo;&ldquo;We cannot be called to training as a nurse if we do not get the leaving certificate and we cannot get the leaving certificate if we do not know Irish.&rdquo;  I felt that to be with them was to be in a sort of jail.  All <Col N="2099" /> the joy was gone out of it.  It was now a scramble to get in six weeks enough Irish to secure whatever was the appropriate teastas.  It is the children of those parents who are turning their backs on the Irish language at present.</P>
    <P>That change has come about in my lifetime almost entirely as a result of the language policy of the Fianna Fáil Party.  I do not want to suggest that they did it in malice.  I believe there are members of the Fianna Fáil Party who are as passionately fond of the language as I am, but I do charge them with some of the mob mentality. I do charge them with feeling that it was in their power to force the language on the people, whether they wanted it or not.  That is the fundamental mistake they made.  I remember 25 years ago advocating in this House: drop all compulsion.  I remember leaving this House one night to go over and speak in York Street, of all places.  I remember some of my old friends in the Press Gallery, all of whom are now gone to their reward&mdash; Paddy Quinn, Mr. Curran, the old &ldquo;Pol. Corrs.&rdquo;&mdash; following me over there, where they thought I was going to be torn to pieces.  I remember addressing the poor women out of the tenement houses in York Street on the desirability of making Irish the educational passport for every child of this country, however poor, whatever home they came from, up all the way to the top.</P>
    <P>I remember saying to them: &ldquo;Let us get rid of compulsory Irish, but let us say to each one of these little children standing in front of us, as Napoleon used to say to the children of France that every child carries a field-marshal's baton in his schoolbag, each one of you here, by burning some little modicum more of midnight oil, can secure for yourselves a scholarship from the primary school.  You can go through the secondary school and, when you have matriculated, you can become a doctor, a lawyer, an engineer or anything else you like.  So long as you maintain in each academic year an honours standard in Irish, the cost of your education will be met by the <Col N="2100" /> State.  That is because the State wants to revive Irish.  We want to make Irish the hallmark of higher education in this country.  At the same time, up to the limit of our resources, we want to open the doors of Irish education to every child in this country, no matter what home he comes from.  Let us forget wealth and the existing background and let this be available to every child, whether he is the son of a millionaire or the son of the poorest labourer or unemployed family in the country.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Picture where we would stand today if 30 years ago we had done that, if we had been in a position to say now: &ldquo;Anyone who does not want Irish, let him forget it.  But it is a hallmark of higher education in this country that a man speaks and writes Irish fluently, that it is his second language.&rdquo;  I often call in memory the situation in Russia before the 1914 war.  Society was largely divided in Russia then, not on a class basis but on the basis of those who spoke Russian and French and those who spoke only Russian.  We would have today an intellectual <i>élite</i> in this country whose common hallmark was that they were Irish speakers and were educated in the Irish language&mdash;not through the Irish language but in Irish.  They would be engineers, doctors, scientists, philosophers.  They could belong to any profession they liked.  They would look back with pride on the fact it was Irish opened all this vista to them.  They would tell their children: &ldquo;You would not be where you are now and I could not be providing the living I am providing for you but for the fact that Irish gave me the chance to get the education that enables me today to earn the living to give you the advantages that became available to me through the language.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Instead of that, we have insolent mobs storming a public meeting, clamouring that we dare not let the voice of opposition to the language be heard.  If we allowed them to speak, the whole structure would come tumbling down around our ears.  How low has the language sunk in the esteem of our people when it depends on such champions?  How low has the language <Col N="2101" /> sunk when we see it as an instrument now in which the Minister for Education finds himself in the ridiculous straitjacket that he is afraid to say in Dáil Éireann what he honestly believes. He dare not say it, because his own Government are divided into two sections, one of which thinks it is politically inexpedient to permit the Minister to speak his mind and the other, to which he belongs, in which probably he wants to go further than I would be prepared to go with him in the abolition of Irish in the educational programme.</P>
    <P>Now I am bound to tell the House that I have the feeling we are very near the end of the road.  It is pretty generally agreed amongst us that we are now going to make education universally available.  I do not know what inducement we have left to draw young people to the language.  We are living in a very utilitarian and materialistic age, which is not peculiar to Ireland, but there are great, powerful elements in the Fianna Fáil Party at present who think it right and prudent to sell anything saleable for cash.  They think anybody opposed to that is wrong and obscurantist and not &ldquo;with it&rdquo;.  I will still make the effort and I will still hope that the effort might succeed, but I think the task is ten times greater now than it was 20 years ago.  It is vitally important, even at this eleventh hour, to take the steps that may be necessary to carry conviction finally to the mind of our people that we do not want to force the language down their throats.  It is urgently necessary to carry conviction to the minds of the young people that Irish is no longer a bludgeon held over their heads.</P>
    <P>I admit the Government have in fact moved some of the way along the road in that direction by prescribing that, where a child fails to get the leaving certificate in Irish, he will be given a second chance.  But surely the time has come to face the plain, inescapable fact that it is an intolerable imposition on the children of this country to say to them that if the tiny minority who are not linguistically gifted fail to master the Irish language, they are to be denied the right to earn their living in their own country?  Surely the time <Col N="2102" /> has come to say that if there is in this country a child rarely gifted in mathematics, in science, in engineering, for example, he is not to be denied the right of access to a university to develop the gifts he has got because he cannot pass an examination in Irish? Surely there is nothing inconsistent in adopting that change and in saying, at the same time, that in every primary school in Ireland, Irish will be taught as any other school subject is taught and in proportion to the time available for it in relation to the other essential subjects a child in the modern world must have?</P>
    <P>We are living today in a world in which, for an untrained or uneducated man or woman, there will be no more chance of getting a living in ten years' time that there would be for a stray dog.  That is a terrible thought to which few people are prepared to open their mind.  We had a brisk interchange here during Question Time on the subject of unemployment.  I think it was the Taoiseach who reminded the House of the number of unemployed in this country in 1956.  He held up the figure to us as a rebuke.  He did not go on to think of the 300,000 of our people who have been sent abroad since he took office in 1957 and that, of those 300,000 persons, nearly 250,000 must have gone to unskilled employment.</P>
    <P>The fact we have got to face is that, in the decade that lies ahead, that same number of 250,000 will not find employment even if the Fianna Fáil solution for unemployment were to be found again, namely, to ship them out of the country into the anonymity of the unskilled labour market in Great Britain.  There will not be any unskilled labour market in ten years' time into which to ship them.  Automation is in its elementary stages today in Great Britain.  It is more advanced on the Continent and it has reached a pretty high degree of development in the United States.  If the element of automation that obtains in American industry today obtained in Great Britain tomorrow, then the scope for unskilled employment in Great Britain would virtually be exhausted.  Therefore, our Party, have rightly put forward <Col N="2103" /> a very comprehensive policy proposal for education.</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister at this moment, while these present policies exist, if he seriously proposes to go on claiming that a boy or girl who cannot pass an examination in Irish is to be denied access to university education.  I do not think he believes that himself.  I do not believe he believes that the boy or girl who cannot pass in Irish should be excluded from a technological institute such as Kevin Street or the other institutes.  I do not believe the Minister believes that, if a boy is qualified in every respect to serve in the Civil Service, in the ESB or in any of the semi-State bodies in his own country, he will be told he must go abroad to earn his bread because he cannot pass an examination in Irish.  I do not believe any rational Deputy believes these things to be right.  The tragedy of the hypocritical pretence that such an arrangement is just and should continue is that it is making Irish hated and cursed by thousands of children, without whose love and enthusiasm the language has no hope of surviving.</P>
    <P>There are many matters in respect of which I have acted the role of Cassandra in this House and, in respect of many of them, the prophecy I have made has been indignantly repudiated by the members of the Fianna Fáil Party.  However, great damage would ensue.  Then, after much of the damage had become irremediable, they would come to realise the truth of what I had suggested to them and scramble to put right what was wrong.  I want to tell the House now that the ultimate existence of Irish as a living language will be settled within the next five years.  Unless there is a complete revolution in the thought and feeling of our people, unless there is a sense of deliverance from compulsion and a corresponding inter-party movement representing all elements of our life such as the Gaelic League about 50 years ago, Irish will die&mdash;not in my time but probably in the lifetime of the Minister.</P>
    <P>Do not forget that when I went to <Col N="2104" /> Gortahork first in 1919 and 1920, you would not hear a word of English spoken as far east as Falcarragh.  You would have to travel ten miles west of Gortahork to be able to find that now. When I first went to Ballingeary in County Cork, I never heard a word of English spoken there.  Does anybody who knows Ballingeary today imagine that the same is true?  When I first knew Tourmakeady in County Mayo, 95 per cent of the people there used Irish as their vernacular: do you think five per cent do today?  That is the awful test.</P>
    <P>The pool which supplies what we hope is the running river of the Irish language is drying up and if it does dry up, the language will certainly die. I remember that near Ballingeary, one passed through Gougane Barra.  The local fable was that the stream running down into the lake there was the source of the Lee and that the Lee got its name from this phrase: The stream was seen to roll like a silver ribbon down the mountainside until it reached the lake and seemed to move no more whereupon someone said: &ldquo;Tá sé in a luí.&rdquo;  But the Lee will continue to flow through the city of Cork from the little mountain lake in which that stream finds its source.  If the lake dried up the Lee would cease to flow and the city of Cork would proceed to perish. The source of the language is dying out in the Gaeltacht and in the next ten years you will have &ldquo;Gaeilge nua&rdquo; or &ldquo;Gaeilge státsheirbhíse&rdquo; or anything you like, but I think the Irish language will be dead.</P>
    <P>Before I depart from this topic I should like to say one last word.  I want to speak Irish.  By &ldquo;Irish&rdquo; I mean the language which was spoken by our people down through the centuries, the language spoken in various idioms and spoken in various accents. I want to speak it in such a way that those who hear me speak will say&mdash;&ldquo;He learned it in Donegal&rdquo;, just as somebody who hears me speak now will say&mdash;&ldquo;He was born in Dublin and he lived in the West of Ireland&rdquo; or who hears the Minister speak and says &ldquo;He is a Limerick man&rdquo;.  I do not want to have thrust upon me any &ldquo;Gaeilge nua&rdquo;.  I do not want to have <Col N="2105" /> thrust upon me, on my children and my children's children, a language that nobody ever spoke, a language that has been invented, a language without character, parenthood, origin or source, and I urge upon the Minister that such a bastard language cannot survive.</P>
    <P>The Irish I learned was a living language.  It is still a living language. I learned Irish in Donegal 40 years ago.  Nobody said &ldquo;Níl&rdquo;; everybody said &ldquo;Chanil&rdquo;.  I got into the habit of saying it and the people of the West would look at me twice when I said it.  That has changed because it is a living language.  No Irish person in Donegal in the old days would say &ldquo;níl mé&rdquo;.  But, the old people still say &ldquo;Chanil&rdquo;, when they use the language for emphasis.  There is the living language but it is subject to the law of change.  We hear Irish being spoken on the radio and television. Better modes of communication bring people into contact with other parts of the country and they learn that nobody else used that form &ldquo;Chanil&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I could give other examples of a living language changing to adapt itself as a living language should, but I know of no place in the world where we have a Government trying to substitute for a living language, a language that nobody speaks or ever has spoken until it was invented in the Department of Education and in the remote recesses of Leinster House where nobody caters for&mdash;I forget the name they call it; tá focal ann ach níl fhios agam cé'n t-ainm atá air anois&mdash;&ldquo;Gaeilge nua&rdquo; nó rud eile mar sin.  Mr. Chairman, what a relief it is to me to find you have only resumed the Chair after I have completed my references to your observations.  I should like to repeat them but with respect to your temporary dignity, I shall refrain.</P>
    <P>Everyone has his own feeling about the language, but the Minister has announced that he is going to abolish scholarships altogether.  I am not sure that he is right in that.  I am not sure that scholarships are perhaps our last hope for making Irish something precious here.  There is something infinitely attractive in being able to say to every <Col N="2106" /> child that he can earn his way to secondary school and ultimately that he can become a senior graduate in a university, through maintaining a standard of Irish scholarships.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that he might bear that in mind.  Over and above the broad sweep of general education for all, we might abolish compulsion and say that Irish shall be taught to every child in every primary school in Ireland but that thereafter it will be the means of relieving the burden left by the Minister for Education on the parents by letting those children who choose to make it their handrail on the stair of education to the highest rung so that they may aspire to whatever faculty their natural gifts lead them.</P>
    <P>There is a further matter relative to education to which I should like to make reference.  I am not trying to pursue the matter of the shortage of teachers.  My Party dealt widely and comprehensively with the need for a revolutionary development in the whole scheme of the education of our people.  I should like to deal with current problems.  I make no secret of the fact that I have advocated repeatedly in this House the substitution of parochial schools for one teacher schools.  I know some of my colleagues in my Party have dissented from that.  I advocated that when I was Leader of the Fine Gael Party and I still do.  I know when the Minister for Education and his predecessor sponsored that plan he came under heavy criticism and gross insult in public, but from a source from which I would expect nothing else, and he faced it with dignity and courage.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise that there is one mistake which the present Minister is in danger of making.  It is one I exhort him not to fall into.  He will not complete this job of streamlining the educational accommodation in rural Ireland in a week, in a year, or in ten years or 20 years.  It will take a long time.  I implore him not to be going down to individual parishes under the dictation of the Minister for Finance and trying to force on a reluctant <Col N="2107" /> people and, in some cases, on a reluctant manager, centralisation.  There is a great deal of inherent conservatism in our people.  It is sometimes an exasperating quality but it is often a very lovable one.  There is, in many cases, a sentimental attachment to the school and a pride that the school is in the neighbourhood.  Country people very often have an extraordinary horror of allowing little children to go unattended four or five miles from home and of the thought of their coming home four or five miles.  It is a novel idea to them.</P>
    <P>I would suggest to the Minister to make it known in any parish where the manager and the people wanted this new idea of a central parochial school with the many attendant amenities that his resources would make it possible for him to provide if there was one school in the parish instead of three, four, five, six or seven scattered small schools, that he provide free transport and see that the children were brought safety into school and home from school, and that he would propose a remedy for the problem of the infant classes who finish early whereas the other children do not come out until 3 p.m. or 4 p.m. Parents ask: &ldquo;How are the babies to get home?&rdquo; Explain to the parents: &ldquo;We will have a room for them with toys and amusements and we will keep them occupied while they are waiting for the older children to come out for the bus.&rdquo;  He would get applications from more parishes than he could hope to meet in the next ten years.</P>
    <P>I believe that almost all the parents and managers would, by that time, have become converted to the concept, and the flow of applications would snowball in on top of him and instead of forcing it on people, he would be obliged to say: &ldquo;Now you will have to take your place in the queue.&rdquo;  I have had to draw the attention of the Minister to several cases in Monaghan in which he wanted to force the people. I pointed out that the people did not want it and in some cases he said that the manager did.  It is not an uncommon situation, both in Protestant and Catholic schools, that the manager wants it but the people do not.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2108" /> The Minister will see that in our educational policy we propose that there should be parent-teacher associations so that the views of managers and parents could be co-ordinated. Such an organisation does not exist in rural Ireland at the present time. It is overdue.  The Minister is likely to be gravely misled.  The manager says: &ldquo;I want this.  Do not ask the people; I know the way the people think.&rdquo;  The people come to me, their Deputy, and say: &ldquo;We do not think the manager is right at all.&rdquo;  I have had occasion to say to them: &ldquo;Do you know the manager has been up and told the Minister you want it.&rdquo;  And I have been told: &ldquo;We asked the manager to call a meeting and he would not call it.&rdquo;  In another case, I was told that the people called a meeting; and they called the manager to it, and the manager went to it and said to them: &ldquo;There is no use sending a letter to the Minister because I saw him and he told me he wanted no letter from ye.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now I would be delighted to tell them if I could in conscience, do so&mdash; I think Deputy Colley was Minister at the time&mdash;&ldquo;That is the kind of man Colley is&rdquo;, but I could not in conscience say that, and I said: &ldquo;Tell the manager from me that I do not believe the Minister ever said any such thing, and if the manager will not send the letter from you to the Minister, send the letter to me and I will send it to the Minister.&rdquo;  I must say Deputy Colley said to me that before a decision was taken in that particular case, he would send down a senior and responsible inspector of his Department to call a meeting of the parents and discuss the matter with them.  I have not yet heard what the sequel is.</P>
    <P>I found a parish in Monaghan where the manager and the people wanted centralisation.  I must give credit where it is due.  I rang the Department and I said: &ldquo;Here is the ideal thing; here the manager and people want it.  Come here and do it and when you do it in this parish&mdash;it is nearly in the middle of the country&mdash;I will guarantee you will be smothered with applications when they see how it works here, but for heaven's sake, take the pressure off <Col N="2109" /> the other parishes which are dividing into warring factions and where not infrequently it is creating ill-will between parish priests and people or rector and people.&rdquo;  In Monaghan particularly, this is true, as it is in Cavan and parts of Donegal.  If you have a situation in which that kind of grievance exists, a lot of the ordinary Protestant people of Monaghan are inclined to say: &ldquo;If we were not Protestants, we would not be treated this way,&rdquo; though I know in some such cases the manager is saying one thing and the people are saying another.</P>
    <P>I want to impress on the Minister with special emphasis that he should try to get it done voluntarily and that there will be more voluntary applications than he can deal with, and even though it may involve administrative inconvenience and may mean maintaining two-teacher schools for the present where it would be better to centralise, the whole thing is that it is far better to do it that way.  He will have plenty of applicants to smooth the way before him.  The other thing I want to say is this: Look most suspiciously at any application coming from an area where there is a Protestant school, unless there is an express wish from the people, the parents of the children, because the people are conservative.  I do not think it is unjust to say that they are shy and they are slow to come forward to make themselves heard but they silently feel a sense of deep grievance and a feeling that they are being discriminated against which I am satisfied is utterly groundless but it ought to be borne in mind in cases of that kind.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister has spoken of the role of parent-teacher organisations throughout rural Ireland.  I hope this will be developed and that we will have a more stringent demand from the Minister that in representation regarding parochial education, he wants to know not only the view of the school manager but of the parents of the children and would like to get agreed recommendations from them.</P>
    <P>I want to mention another thing. <Col N="2110" /> When I heard the Government were to make grants available for the improvement of secondary schools, I thought it was a forward-looking step and I was delighted.  I wonder do Deputies know what the situation really is?  It has proved to be largely an illusory fraud or a fraudulent illusion, whichever way you like to put it, because the form the grant has taken is that a school comes forward with a plan involving a capital outlay of £100,000 to put up new buildings; it is sanctioned; they put it out to tender and they accept a tender for £100,000.  They then apply to the Minister for the £60,000 promised. What are they told?  &ldquo;Oh, we will not give you a penny.&rdquo;  They then come to me.  I go to the Minister and I am told: &ldquo;Not a penny.  They must borrow it.  They must go to the bank. Our grant takes the shape of undertaking responsibility for the annual service of 60 per cent of the debt.  If they borrow £100,000 they must service £40,000 and we will service £60,000 over 20 or 30 years, or whatever the period of the loan is.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>School authorities were jubilant and ready to go, full of praise of this forward-looking plan.  I need hardly say I reminded them that I advocated the plan at the Fine Gael Árd Fheis in 1963, and, as usual, those fellows picked it up.  I am glad they did and, if I can help in any way, I ask them to let me know.  They know I first advocated it and they come to me and tell me the whole project is held up; they were told they would have to borrow the £100,000 and the Government would guarantee to service 60 per cent of that £100,000.  They are responsible for finding 40 per cent. They believe they can get that by way of bazaars, pledges and so on and so forth.  However, when they go to the bank, the bank manager laughs at them.  He will not advance one sixpence. The banks have no money because the Government have borrowed it all from them.</P>
    <P>I found the whole thing astonishing and I asked if they had told the bank <Col N="2111" /> manager the Government were guaranteeing 60 per cent.  The bank manager laughed.  He said the Government owed the banks £60 million and they had nothing to lend.  I advised that they should go to their superior in Dublin and he would go to the bank and get the money without the slightest difficulty.  The superior said: &ldquo;Oh, no; the day before yesterday I tried to borrow from the bank and the bank manager ran me out like a dog.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Does the Minister not appreciate that this is very fraudulent?  Nothing can be done and nothing will be done until the credit freeze, for which the Government are primarily responsible, comes to an end.  If one promises an educational authority 60 per cent of the cost of improving a school and that school so informs the parents, is it not a shocking thing then to inform them that they will not get a penny? The Government have borrowed all the banks have to lend and it is no use going to the banks.  Surely something ought to be done to remedy that situation? The only thing the Government can do is to tell them to go ahead with the school and the Government will meet the bills year by year, as the building proceeds, up to the limit of 60 per cent, taking the risk that, when 60 per cent of the work is done, the banks will be in a position, or somebody will be in a position, to lend them the balance, which they will have to repay in accordance with the usual terms.  I need not elaborate further on that.  The Minister probably understands the problem and will let us know what he is in a position to do, without further amplification on my part.</P>
    <P>There are two other things I want to mention.  Both are contentious.  One is the whole question of examinations. I do not know what has gone wrong, but something has gone wrong.  Are other Deputies conscious of the number of their neighbour's children who are entering hospitals with gastric ulcers?  When I sat for Matriculation I cannot remember lads of 17, 18 and 19 going into hospital with gastric ulcers.  It was a very rare condition. How frequent has it become?  Did any <Col N="2112" /> Deputies read recently the World Health Organisation publication on suicide?  The suicide rate amongst students is statistically significantly higher than it is amongst almost any other category of persons.</P>
    <P>Now, I am all in favour of some test but, unless we are all dotty, we are not going to drive our children into a sickness which may pursue them all through their lives.  The odd thing is that it is my distinct recollection that 40 years ago students worked harder than they do today.  They devoted more time to study, but, whatever the reason was, there did not seem to be the same <i>angst</i> amongst the young people, an <i>angst</i> which is, as I see it, a source of potential lifetime illness, psychiatric or physical.  Whether or not that is due to the examination system I am not quite clear.  I think it probably is, and I think one of the reasons is a new departure in a good many professional examinations; these used to be genuine qualifying examinations; today, they are highly competitive. They are not nominally competitive but they are, in fact, competitive.  One sees in certain professional examinations that 50 per cent of the students have failed in their finals.</P>
    <P>I have a kind of uneasy feeling that a standard is being consciously set designed to limit entrance into that particular profession and the pressure on the students is building up all the time.  The total number of vacancies in the profession at which they are aiming is being silently and tacitly restricted.  All examinations now are becoming competitive instead of qualifying. I sympathise with Deputy Booth when he says it would be desirable to have all examinations abolished, if that were possible, but I have never yet heard of a practical proposal for the selection and segregation of aspirants to higher education except by way of examination.</P>
    <P>If there is a practical way in which you could personally interview every student and get an approximately satisfactory verdict from the board of examiners as to what a boy is fit to do, I think it would be much preferable to the system of examination, which, <Col N="2113" /> as Deputy Booth pointed out, may depend upon whether a child is nervous on that day, whether he has got a tummy upset, or any exceptional circumstance obtains, whether the board interviewing him could make due allowance for that and, if he were unduly nervous, calm him down and encourage him, or, if he got sick, tell him to come back in a hour's time or come back tomorrow.  But is it practical? Can you do it, especially if you are going to have, as we hope to have, higher education for all?  If it is, I think it would be better, because God knows, I remember an interview once conducted in University College by two of the most distinguished Gaeilgeoirí in the world, great scholars, and I was obliged to say to my old friend, Dr. Douglas Hyde, in Irish: &ldquo;Tell that other fellow to shut up; I will talk to him no more&rdquo;, which I must say Dr. Douglas Hyde did, and I got the examination.  I do not need to say who the other examiner was; he was a very great scholar but a very disagreeable man.  But that is an exceptional case and, in any case, even though there was one examiner who was no help to the student, there was also present an examiner who understood and who saw that the student needed what I think, in retrospect, was manifestly a fair deal, when I passed.  But is it practical? If it is, I am in favour of it; if it is not, then I think the whole question of examination ought to be re-examined with a view to lowering this element of tension which seems to have entered in.</P>
    <P>I am not saying&mdash;and I do not want the House to think I am saying&mdash;there is being thrust upon students an undue volume of work in preparation for examinations, because I think they are doing less work.  I think we worked harder&mdash;longer hours, did more home work&mdash;than students do now, but there was absent from our challenge to examination some element which creates that tension for students today which did not seem to exist in my time.  Whether this is all due to examinations, or whether it is part of the general atmosphere of tension that builds up in the utilitarian world in which we live, I am not quite clear <Col N="2114" /> but I think there is something going wrong.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever the reason, it must be in the common interest of all to try to find not only the reason but the solution.  I often remember when I was at school&mdash;I was at school with the Benedictines&mdash;we never followed the curriculum of the Department at all and yet we all got the matriculation without any difficulty. Now, I believe, all secondary schools follow curricula laid down by the Department of Education.  I do not know what the Minister's experience was, in the intervening period since I was at school, but in the Benedictines, we operated entirely outside the Department's control and administration but we all got our examination, and most of us did extremely well in whatever profession we entered.  However, I shall not go into detail on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last thing I want to say is this&mdash; and this is not going to please anybody on any side of the House&mdash;but it is a most acute problem.  We are all in favour of education and I agree it has become indispensable if our people are to survive as a sovereign people, but <Col N="2115" /> where the heck the money will come from is a nightmare to me.  I think the cost burden of education will rise, certainly by 50 per cent, if not nearer to 100 per cent, over the next ten years.  Where it will come from, I do not know.  We have already embarked upon a scale of expenditure in this country which, bearing in mind the population of 2,225,000 people, with very limited natural resources and a very disadvantageous geographical position from the point of view of international trading, will mean that the taxation resources will reach their limit sooner or later.  Our annual Budget now amounts to something like £250 million.  That represents approximately £100 per head of the population and compares fairly unfavourably from the point of view of the weight of the burden that much wealthier nations than we carry; nations carrying vast responsibilities in regard to arms and foreign war, and services of that kind, which we never carried at all.</P>
    <P>I think it right to mention this matter at this stage because the time has come for Oireachtas Éireann to make up their minds on this fact: we have got to get our priorities very clearly established.  Now I consider that first of all, we ought to ensure there are no hungry or destitute people in the country.  Whatever that costs today, we must do it, and I think we are on a fair way to doing it; I would not say we have done it.  I do not think anybody in this country needs to be hungry; except in so far as a person is lonely, nobody needs to be destitute, if he can be brought in contact with the available social services and the charitable institutions with us, which, please God, will always be with us and which do a job no bureaucracy could ever undertake as well.</P>
    <P>The next priority I give to education because, without that education, we run the dangers of which I spoke before of living in a world of technocracy and automation, without training, which would be an intolerable thing for any proud people&mdash;or for any people, proud or humble.</P>
    <P>Third I would give to housing, and although it is of a capital nature, the <Col N="2116" /> annual service of the debt has to be met.  Fourth, I would give to health. I deliberately put health after housing because without housing you cannot have health.  We have to think of these things now, because the money has to be raised.  I know there are some of my colleagues who say: &ldquo;We will raise it.  Do not worry about that.&rdquo; There is a great danger, and now is the time to deal with it.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the question of the kind of society we want to live in. A free enterprise society can carry a certain burden of taxation, but push the burden beyond the limit and free enterprise breaks down.  Then you must move over to State socialism or State capitalism in which the Government become responsible for all, and at the end there is universal servitude.  Ultimately, if you have state socialism or State capitalism everyone must be the servant of the Government.  What people perennially forget, especially the social theorists who say: &ldquo;Why should we not all be the servants of the Government?&rdquo;, is that there &ldquo;aint&rdquo; no such thing as a Government as an abstraction.</P>
    <P>In practice it means the county manager, or the Principal Officer of the Department of Education, or the Principal Officer of the Department of Industry and Commerce, or the appropriate Principal Officer of the Department of Agriculture.  It does not mean an omniscient, benevolent, popularly elected representative body of men deliberating the case of each individual citizen who comes in contact with the universal employer which is the State. It means we all become servants of a bureaucracy.  No matter how well it is chosen we cannot hope that more than 70 per cent will be first class.  If we are very lucky we will have 70 per cent first class, 20 per cent average, and ten per cent duds.  The more absolute duds they are, the more arrogant they become, the more drunk they become with power which should never be invested in them.  The ordinary people have no appeal from them because they are the State.</P>
    <P>I do not want to live in that kind of society.  I want a society which is <Col N="2117" /> free.  I know that a free society has its excrescences as well.  I know we have the odd ostentatious rich person who is vulgar and disagreeable, but that is the price we have to pay for freedom.  If he gets too ostentatious and intolerable and irresponsible we can control him.</P>

      <P>The Minister opened this debate by saying he proposes refrom, and I am saying that in a free society those who achieve reform become an inspiration and an object of admiration to those who witness it.  I want a free society based on free enterprise, but we can kill that society if in our zeal for freedom we pile on to excess the burden of taxation.  That danger is becoming proximate, and it is one with which the Minister ought to deal when he is concluding this debate. I can see the Chairman's anxiety that we might go on to consider the entire revenue position of the State.  We must not burden Revenue to excess with new burdens.  We must look at the dimensions of the burden that society is already carrying or, with the best intentions, we may wreck that society on the survival of which our reforms are dependent.  That is the word of warning on which I had intended to conclude, but the arrival of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Tá brón orm nach bhfuil níos mó Gaeilge agam.  First of all, the Minister is to be congratulated on the indication of fresh thinking in educational matters which this Estimate presents.  More of our people are conscious today of the need for higher education and more people may accordingly be despondent at our lack of progress to date.  The strike of parents in some parts of the country because of insanitary conditions in a school has been pointed to.  On the other hand, we read in the Minister's statement that 1965-66 has been a record year for school building: 130 new schools were built and more than 130 major improvements were carried out. This does not give us the right to become complacent but surely we must <Col N="2120" /> agree that important progress has been made.  Of course, if we are to achieve our targets in education certain of our people must be prepared to make sacrifices but there is no longer any need for despondency.</P>
      <P>Even without the Minister's new scheme, there is widespread evidence of the anxiety of parents to give their children post-primary education.  This can be seen in the increased number of children attending secondary schools. Parents are to be complimented on their desire to provide higher education for their children and the Minister is to be complimented by both the House and the parents for his efforts to make free education available to all. Of course, this is only the start.  We have much further to go and I agree with Deputy Dillon that it will cost a lot of money.</P>
      <P>One of the most important fields of education is vocational training.  In view of coming events in Europe, technological education will be much more important than heretofore and a lot of leeway remains to be made up.  There have been important achievements in Dublin where we have provided one new technological college, giving us two, one at Bolton Street and one at Kevin Street.  The Minister is anxious to provide more regional colleges and I put it to him in this respect that we should have a closer tie between the universities and these colleges.  I can see no reason why a boy who goes to one of these colleges and qualifies as an architect cannot be given an architect's status until he writes a thesis for some outside body.  We must bring the universities into this scheme of technological education.  Apart from everything else, it would cut out a lot of unnecessary duplication.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the system by which teachers were recruited to the vocational service and he said, that the present system of appointment was being got rid of.  Now and then we hear attacks on vocational education committees in this respect.  It was said here today that it is demeaning to a teacher to have to canvass members of a committee&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Members of vocational education committees are giving their services free in the interests of a better educational system.  Deputy Larkin's Party is represented on the committee as well as members of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael and I admit that all do good work.  However, I am glad the present system of appointment of teachers is to disappear.  There is one more comment I wish to make on the position of vocational education in Dublin.  It is that the drop out figures in respect of boy and girl students is far too great.  About 7,000 dropped out in 1963 without attaining even a group certificate.  This is a terribly serious leakage because it <Col N="2122" /> means that since the passing of the Apprenticeship Act many of the people who dropped out may never acquire a training.  We will need every boy and girl who is trained in a vocational school in order to play our part in meeting the challenge which the future poses for us.  It has often been said that we cannot provide enough pupil space in the city for those who want to go to vocational schools.  That is quite true but by the end of the year because of numbers who drop out the position has changed.  That is most unsatisfactory.  I urge the Minister not alone to provide regional technological colleges but extra regional schools, particularly in the newer parts of Dublin where there are huge concentrations of population.</P>
      <P>Another point I should like to raise is the lack of treatment for backward children.  This is a very crucial point with parents who have got children who have not got a normal IQ.  If they send them to primary schools they are in the same classroom with children who have normal intelligence. They are thus unable to get the specialised training which they should get.  There are a number of schools for severely handicapped children which are run by religious orders and voluntary organisations but I am afraid we are not doing enough in this field. We are too poor a country to afford a loss of any child in our society.</P>
      <P>We have got to be prepared in this field to dig deep into our pockets in order to provide services for those children who are perhaps not normal mentally.  They may stay at home and receive no education and thus be given no chance in life.  We should not be content with this.  Great credit is due to the religious orders and the voluntary societies who are doing so much in this regard.  The State contribute grants to the schools but we should not be satisfied with just subsidising voluntary effort.  We should make a greater effort to ensure that every child in the State, not because of ability, but sometimes because of lack of ability, will be given the most careful tuition possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2123" /> Another aspect of education is the reformatories.  When children in Dublin get into trouble they are sent to places such as Letterfrack.  This means that the parents can very seldom see those children.  Usually they cannot see them until they have completed their sentence.  It is most unfair because those children have broken the law in some way, sometimes it is only for a minor offence, that they are sent to places such as Letterfrack.  I am criticising the location, not the school. I know from my own experience that there are many parents whose children have been sent to Letterfrack and because they are not so well off they will often tell you they have not seen their children since they went there.  They cannot afford the cost of the transport to Galway.</P>
    <P>The Minister is providing transport for rural areas in order that children should be educated.  We all know that parental control is one of the most important aspects of education.  The Minister should study this problem. If those children must be sent to Galway or the midlands they should, where conditions necessitate it, be given some help so that the parents can visit them at least once a month. It will be said that I am encouraging delinquent parents but that is not the case.  There are many good parents whose children have got into trouble. It is unfair to punish children so much. Probably one of the greatest punishments you can inflict on a child is to ensure that it should not see its parents for some months.  It may be nice for many of us living in the city that those children are in Letterfrack and that we cannot see them.  I put it seriously to the Minister that he might well study this matter of the location of the schools to which those children are sent and devise some system whereby the parents can visit them fairly frequently.</P>
    <P>The Minister's plan for free post-primary education is, as I said, commendable but we will have to examine it in great detail in order to ensure that it is really effective.  A college I know of in this city has ten per cent of its pupils already enjoying free <Col N="2124" /> education by way of scholarships.  The fees of that school are fairly reasonable but they are just beyond the supplementary grant mentioned by the Minister.  This particular college is like many other colleges throughout the country in that they are carrying out tremendous building projects.  They are now in great debt to the bank because of the fact that they have built extensions to their schools.  Had that not been so they could have carried on in the old buildings and have their pupils working in overcrowded conditions. They did not desire to do so and they built extensions.  Some of them put in new science blocks and they are now actually in the red.  I feel the Minister's supplementary grant will not overcome their difficulties.</P>
    <P>This is a very harsh blow to those schools.  I would ask the Minister to examine the maximum supplementary grant and do something about those schools which can show they have built extensions and are in debt because of this building work.  You could say to them that for the next ten years you would see how they got on and meanwhile you would give them an extra supplementary grant.  This would not apply to all schools.  It would certainly not apply to the snob schools, as they have been called, rightly or wrongly.</P>
    <P>The whole success of the Minister's scheme could depend on the part that those particular schools will play and if the supplementary grant cannot be paid to those schools we may be doing a lot more harm than good.  It would be a great pity if anything were allowed to hamper the Minister's scheme.  I think somebody said that educational schemes should not be political.  We all have education at heart no matter what Party we belong to and everybody wants to see a success made of this scheme and see our educational standards improved.  If the Minister will look at the point I raised perhaps it would be the point which would ensure the difference between the full success or partial success of the whole scheme.  I do not wish to say any more but, again, I should like to congratulate the Minister on <Col N="2125" /> his dedication to the cause of education and his strength of character which has ensured that we have at least made a start for a really good educational system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I should like to clarify a point just in case Deputy Moore is under any misunderstanding. My interjection was in relation to members of his Party who went around canvassing and looking for support for the nomination for posts which were available under vocational educational authorities.  I agree that the system of canvassing in relation to employment for vocational educational posts is not a good system.  It is degrading.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is degrading that people with qualifications may have to depend on chasing around looking for support from members of such authorities.  The fact that this system exists does not mean that I want to cast any reflection on the ability or desire of members serving voluntarily on the boards of education authorities to do their best and advance the interests of vocational education.</P>
      <P>We are here dealing, one might say, with an Estimate in retrospect, because as a result of the changes in Standing Orders last autumn, we are talking about matters which have already been decided on and many of which should have been put into operation already. We are not dealing with a White Paper on education, although one would have expected that following the publication of the report on &ldquo;Investment in Education&rdquo; last year, the Minister by now would have submitted a White Paper setting out the intentions so that the House could give it the required examination.  We are not doing this but dealing rather with the record of the Department, the financial expenditure involved in the Department and the expenditure which will arise following certain proposed changes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently I had occasion to ask the Minister a question about the system involved in planning and constructing schools in developing <Col N="2126" /> areas.  The Minister gave a somewhat exhaustive but disappointing reply.  The general tone of the reply showed that the system in operation in areas which developed rapidly, in regard to decisions affecting the number and size of schools, the number of classrooms and so on, and the steps taken to construct schools at the same time as private or local authority building was progressing in the area, appears to be much the same as it was five or ten years ago.</P>
    <P>The Minister is a man who is not averse from taking a chance.  Certainly he has taken chances on occasion when he made certain prophecies, and surely it would be in the interests of the children and the parents that where you have an area in which the planned development envisages the construction of some thousands of dwellings, to take a chance and provide a school there, even though for some years you might have a few empty classrooms in it? It would be much better to have empty classrooms for a short period than to have children forced to travel long distances across the city to reach school, or because of a family's economic or social conditions, having them brought before the school attendance officer for non-attendance at school and advancing the excuse that the nearest school was too far away for them.  This applies particularly in cases where children of fairly tender age have to travel by bus.</P>
    <P>The fact is that in Dublin city the situation has continued for many years that although the Department of Education knew, or should have known from the Department of Local Government, what the planning requirements and intentions were, even if it were only a rough estimate, they waited on nearly every occasion until the children were almost housed in the area before they made any real attempt to provide a school in the neighbourhood.  Nowadays they can erect temporary classrooms, which does help the situation more rapidly, but even at present there are countless cases of families having moved into new or developing areas in which there are no schools.  This is a clear example of bad planning and I trust that the Minister will look into <Col N="2127" /> the matter much more closely.  As I said, it is far better to have a few empty classrooms for a period than to place children in the position of not being able to attend school for any length of time from six months up to two years because there is no school there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>What we wish to discuss here is the fact that many persons who are entitled to receive old age, blind or widows' pension increase of 5/- a week, by virtue of the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1966 are being refused this increase by the Department of Social Welfare.  Earlier this year the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Lynch, announced that pensioners were to receive an increase of 5/- a week.  That was on 9th March, 1966.  In the sixth edition of the <i>Evening Press</i> issued in Dublin that evening, the banner headline was carried &ldquo;Pension increase of 5/-&rdquo;.  The meaning and the propaganda of such statements are pretty clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We raise this matter because all round the country thousands of people who are in dire need are being excluded from the increase provision by virtue of the interpretation of social welfare officers.  To illustrate this, when the Minister was introducing the matter last June, he remarked that it was estimated that some 21,000 old age pensioners or blind pensioners, of a total of 112,000 such pensioners would benefit from the increase of 5/- and that some 6,500 widows, out of a total of 22,000 widows, would similarly benefit.  Although the forward announcement of the increase was made in March, 1966, the actual implementation did not take place until November, 1966.  On 23rd November, <Col N="2128" /> some months later, we find that in answer to a question on this matter, the Minister informed the House of the number of people who were in fact benefiting under the new arrangement. He said the figure was 10,090 pensioners our of a total of 111,868 at that period.  We have a difference then of almost exactly 100,000 between the promise of the Minister earlier in the year and the effective number participating in November of the same year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>It is Dáil Reports, volume 225 for the question regarding the actual numbers, and volume 223 for the Minister's announcement.  The position is so bad that one must be absolutely destitute in order to get this 5/- increase and the definition of destitution is left, as far as we can ascertain to the arbitrary decision of the Department of Social Welfare.  In fact, it is arguable if the possession of a suit of clothes at the moment would not exclude one from the benefit of the extra amount.  I recall a case presented to the House some time ago where the Minister defended in the House the action of one of his official who ruled that a woman who had a cottage in which she lived alone and a garden which she was unable to till and could get no use out of, had an income of £3 per week, so that the woman was excluded from the benefit of the provision.</P>
      <P>Small farmers, agricultural labourers, town workers and people living with their relatives are all in categories which can, in fact, be excluded from the extra payment.  This is a provision which was used unscrupulously earlier this year in drawing up enthusiasm for a discredited Fianna Fáil administration. Mark you, the brass neck of the Ministers of this Government has them touring areas of Kerry and Waterford just now, telling people about this 5/- increase which none of them is entitled to, or able to get.  In the Killarney area alone, three per cent of all the pensioners benefit by the 5/-pronouncement made earlier this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 5/- increase amounts to 8½d per <Col N="2129" /> day.  This Government earlier stood over, without criticism, and appeared to approve, the payment of £8 10s a day as a pension to the former chairman of CIE in a new job.  This happened at a time when they cannot pay 8½d per day to people in dire need&mdash; the Government who try fraudulently to make the people believe that they are attuned to the principle of social justice as it should exist in the year 1966.</P>
    <P>We want to discover if there has been such a cutting down in the number of pensioners benefiting, from the 21,000 the Minister promised would benefit, to the 10,000 who appear to be benefiting.  We want to know if something similar happened in the case of the number of widows who were supposed to benefit, 6,500.  How many in fact benefited?  I want to find out what scales the Department officials bring forward in their definition of what constitutes absolute destitution, the condition which, it appears, is the only one that enables people at the moment to get this extra 5/-.</P>
    <P>We have heard of the case in rural Ireland of an old man who, as the result of the kindness of a neighbouring farmer, lived in a pretty broken-down house on the farmland.  We find this has been estimated as income to that old man and that therefore he is excluded from the 5/- increase.  Similarly, in this city, in the case of old age pensioners living with a son or daughter, if it can be proved that they have so many meals with their relatives on so many days a week, is it true that they are excluded at present? If this is a country which prides itself on its defence of freedom, we may ask what flimsy or tattered freedom is left to old people at the mercy of the officials of the Department of Social Welfare who make a personal inventory of every little item in their possession&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">

      <P>The Minister supervises the affairs of the Department and I am bringing to the attention of the <Col N="2130" /> Minister what is going on, with or without his knowledge, at present.  I declare this to be a disgraceful situation. That is one of the motives in bringing this matter before the House. If the Government cannot, having introduced this increase, ensure that it is given to those who are truly in need, old age pensioners living on paltry incomes and so on, and if the Government are so hard up that they must operate what is practically a secret police system to inquire into every facet of these people's lives, surely it is time for the Government to come out openly and say what the financial position is and explain that it was so dark and severe that it forced the Government to such limits as to inquire into the personal affairs of people to this extent.  Surely if the Government are driven to this limit to avoid meeting their responsibilities to the needy, we might ask ourselves what kind of system it is that has as its priority the giving of a pension to a man of £8 10s per day, and seeing that as a main priority, and refusing to give 8½d a day to people all around the country who can prove that theirs is a sorry lot.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have already had the position where for the meanest of political Party motives, the announcement was made in March this year, while the implementation was delayed until November; in other words, the pensioners were told to live on Party propaganda until November and when November comes, they are told they do not qualify for this increase.  This cynical, brazen approach to the crying needs of this section of the population must be exposed for what it is, political opportunism of the lowest kind, of a type that we thought had had its day here but seemingly this Government are cynical enough to use this type of propaganda to maintain their grip on power.  The pensions position already cries to heaven for some kind of justice. We look upon ourselves as a country that wishes to be part of a larger European community.  How can we look forward to fraternity with other nations in the modern world when we appear to allow this kind of barbaric treatment to continue of a deserving <Col N="2131" /> section of our population, when we allow the situation to continue that officials of a Department are forced, evidently as a result of the Government's ruling, to comb out the personal income positions of old people in town and country?</P>
    <P>If we as a society wish to leave our old people with what is most desirable at their age, a little independence, surely this kind of hounding to the last item of their personal possessions is calculated to remove whatever little independence they have left?  The provision we make for our old people in the community is bad enough. We submit that this inquiry into the means of old people should cease forthwith.  We call upon the Government to live up to their March promise of the provision of an increase of 5/- a week to old age pensioners. We call upon them to cease this harrying of old people, to put an end to this ridiculous situation of old people being disqualified from the 5/-increase because they have an arrangement with their relations whereby they eat in the relations' house, or because, in a rural area, they may be in possession of three scraggy hens or, in a city area, may get free meals from sons or daughters.  Surely a Government who stand over a situation where these things are itemised in a balance sheet so as to exclude these people from the provisions of this legislation, should bow their head in shame.  This Government have what we call the chrome-Mercedes mentality if they allow this kind of thing to happen.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Leary sounded somewhat surprised at the way the so-called increase of 5/- was being administered by the Fianna Fáil Government.  I am not so surprised, because quite clearly the increase of 5/- as it was announced last March by the Fianna Fáil Government to old age pensioners, widows and blind pensioners, was nothing more than a further confidence trick on the people by Fianna Fáil for the purpose of securing their support in the Presidential election.  This is the type of politics that the Fianna Fáil Government have <Col N="2132" /> engaged in for a long number of years. One would think it would be a hard thing to make an announcement to old age pensioners in the plight which the vast majority of them, if not all, are in, that they could look forward to an increase of 5/- per week, and then to ensure by the way the means test would be applied to the increase, that no more than one-tenth of the people who were entitled to this increase actually got it.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Leary has referred to the situation where because a son or a daughter invited an old age pensioner, a mother or father, to the home at weekends for a meal, the old age pensioner could be disqualified.  If a son or daughter working in England or in the United States or Canada, where they are forced to go to earn a livelihood by the same policy pursued by the Fianna Fáil Government, sends home a £5 note, the recipient can be disqualified from receiving the increase of 5/-, although he may have no other means whatsoever.  By virtue of the fact that a son or daughter sends home a £5 note at Christmas, Fianna Fáil will pounce on that to disqualify him. There is bankruptcy and bankruptcy, but when we reach the stage where we will go to any lengths to deprive old age pensioners of 5/- we have really hit the bottom, and this Government have undoubtedly hit the bottom.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Under this system, even talking about the one-tenth who got the increase, the old age pensioners, the people who <Col N="2133" /> were responsible for building up this State, people who in their younger years helped to found this State, people who were so misled as to put the Government into power, if they want to qualify for the 5/-, must debase themselves publicly as being absolutely and completely without means of support. We think that this type of practice by the Fianna Fáil Government should be exposed and our purpose in raising this matter on the Adjournment was to expose it.</P>

      <P>On 16th March, 1966, the Minister for Social Welfare was questioned by the Chief Whip of the Fine Gael Party as to the number of people who would qualify, and he replied that it was estimated that 21,000 would qualify.  In supplementary questions he was asked what <Col N="2134" /> type of person would qualify and he said only those with no means.  That was elaborated on in a series of supplementary questions.  I quote now from column 1839, vol. 221 of the Official Report of 16th March last:</P>
      <P>Mr. L'Estrange: If he has a shilling a week, he is disqualified.</P>
      <P>Mr. Boland: A person who has a right of residence and maintenance is in a different position from a person who has not.</P>
      <P>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick <i>(Cavan):</i> I would like the Minister to clear this up now.  Will a right of residence alone, as distinct from a right of residence, support and maintenance, disqualify a person in relation to this increase?</P>
      <P>Mr. Boland: Any means will disqualify.</P>
      <P>Surely nobody was being misled when it was made perfectly clear as far back as March last that only people with no means would qualify?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The lead-up to all this is very simple.  I have been a member of an old age pensions committee for 14 years. I know also what benevolent societies do for certain groups of old age pensioners. The case is frequently made that there are different categories in receipt of old age pension and that those with no means are in a special category of their own and could not possibly be expected to enjoy the same standard as those who have some means.  In 1965 the Minister brought in what I might describe as the split level allowance, in which he granted 5/- to those with means of £26 and 10/- to those with means up to that figure.  That was hailed as a fair and equitable thing to do with the amount of money he had at his disposal.  He followed that up in the same way in 1966 by taking what money was available to him and giving it to the most necessitous section of old age pensioners. He made it clear it was going to those who had no means.  It is easy to blame officials.  The Minister must take absolute responsibility for his Department. The only record the Department have to go on is the original <Col N="2135" /> record as to whether the person has means or not.  Taking those records, they have given out in the first instance to all recorded in the original assessment as having no means the extra 5/-.</P>
