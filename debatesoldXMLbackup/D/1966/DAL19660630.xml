      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill, as foreshadowed by the Financial Resolution passed by Dáil Éireann on 29th June, is to introduce, with effect from 1st October, 1966, a wholesale tax at the rate of five per cent on sales of goods other than food, medicines, clothing and fuel.  The tax will not apply to commodities which are exempt from the turnover tax; and drink, tobacco and hydrocarbon oils, which are subject to heavy duties, will likewise be exempt.  The Bill will authorise me to make orders declaring other commodities to be exempt where such exemptions seem desirable.  The new tax is selective inasmuch as certain commodities will be omitted from its scope and for this reason it will operate at the wholesale level where distinctions can be made which are not practicable at the retail level.</P>
      <P>Section 1 of the Bill contains definitions necessary for interpretation purposes. Section 2 is the charging section and, subject to the further provisions of the Bill, it imposes the wholesale tax, with effect from 1st October, 1966, on moneys received after that date in respect of goods sold in the course of business, including goods sold before 1st October.  A corresponding tax is imposed on imports by section 11.</P>
      <P>Section 3 specifies the persons who are liable to pay wholesale tax.  They are:</P>
      <P>(i)  persons, other than manufacturers, whose wholesale sales of taxable goods exceed £500 a month;</P>
      <P>(ii)  manufacturers whose sales of taxable goods exceed £150 a month; and</P>
      <P>(iii)  retailers who purchase taxable goods in the quantities in which they are normally purchased by wholesale merchants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1627" /> The section also provides that a manufacturer of exempt goods may be treated as an accountable person if he uses taxable goods in substantial quantities as materials for his business. The purpose of this provision is not to make such a person liable to pay tax but to enable him to be registered and thereby become entitled to obtain his materials at tax-free prices.</P>
    <P>Subsection (5) of section 3 deals with exemptions from the wholesale tax.  I do not think I need add to what is stated in the explanatory memorandum except to say that, since the exemptions are stated in very broad terms, I have thought it desirable to provide a procedure for specifying them more particularly, should the necessity arise.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides for the registration of accountable persons and sections 5 and 6 enable them to purchase taxable goods free of tax, subject to their paying tax in respect of any such supplies which are not used as materials for manufacture or as stock in trade.</P>
    <P>Section 7 specifies the rate of tax as five per cent of the receipts from taxable sales.  These receipts will include amounts added to recover the tax. Where manufacturers, wholesalers or retailers who are accountable sell goods by retail, the actual receipts may be reduced for tax purposes to the normal wholesale level.</P>
    <P>Section 8 provides that where the parties to a sale are transacting business at artificially low prices, the Revenue Commissioners may estimate the taxable turnover by reference to the price which would obtain if the goods were sold in the open market.</P>
    <P>Section 9 makes specific provision to enable accountable persons to pass on tax by additions to their prices where the prices were fixed by contract before 1st October, 1966.</P>
    <P>Section 10, for administrative convenience, enables the procedures available for the turnover tax to be used for the purposes of the wholesale tax, with such modifications as are necessary. It also enables the Revenue <Col N="1628" /> Commissioners to make regulations concerning some additional procedures required in relation to the wholesale tax.</P>
    <P>Section 11 makes imports liable to a tax corresponding to the wholesale tax on transactions taking place within the State.</P>
    <P>Sections 12 and 13 contain the usual care and management, citation, and construction provisions.  The House has already discussed the principle of this Bill during the debate on Financial Resolution No. 3.  I am sure that many questions of detail will be raised on the Bill but these, I would suggest, can be dealt with more satisfactorily at Committee Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Even though the Minister was only reading a short speech, he ought to have complied with the recommendation of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges that any speech read be supplied to the Opposition benches.  However, it is a short speech so his offence is not as grievous as it might have been in other circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister cannot do his work in time, he cannot blame the Opposition.  The Minister got home before me last night and this morning he was not in Dublin as early because I was behind him as he was driving across Portobello Bridge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy was abroad early.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy was abroad very early, so early that the 9.30 a.m. announcement for next week did not come as much of a shock to me.  In the ordinary course of events, the Finance Bill does not appear right on the heels of the Budget debate. There is normally a considerable time between the issue of the Finance Bill and the conclusion of the general debate on the Budget.  The general debate on this aspect of Government was opened on 14th June and only <Col N="1629" /> ended last night and, consequently, it is not appropriate to have the full debate on this Finance Bill on this Second Stage that might otherwise be desirable.  Matters to be raised on this Finance Bill may be more appropriately debated on the Committee Stage and Fifth Stage.</P>
      <P>However, it is appropriate to remind the House that this Finance Bill is brought in by the Government in pursuance of the promise and the threat made by the Taoiseach on 12th March and reported in the newspapers of 13th March that so far as Fianna Fáil are concerned, increases in taxation will never end.  It is also appropriate to realise that this Finance Bill is their method of raising the taxation for the current year proposed by the Fianna Fáil Government&mdash;part of that taxation anyway.  In his telecast on the Budget last March, the Minister for Finance referred to the fact that we as a nation were spending too much of our increased earnings without putting aside enough for investment.</P>
      <P>That may be true.  I think it is true but who is responsible?  The person responsible for the fact that there is not sufficient margin of saving to put away for investment is the Minister for Finance himself.  The overspending by the Fianna Fáil Government has had the result that we are now faced with bills for expenditure and taxation and that is one of the prime causes of our economic difficulties at the present time.  We were in the unenviable position last year that we were one of the four countries alone in the world in which the purchasing power of the workers fell.  It is largely because of the chain of events started by the excessive over-expenditure in relation to our economic position by Fianna Fáil that this has occurred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the discussion on the General Resolution, I referred to the increase that has taken place in taxation for expenditure over the past four years, which rose from £131 million in 1963-64 to £186 million this year.  That would be serious enough if it were only the increase in indirect taxation. What is much more serious is that the Minister proposes to take this year <Col N="1630" /> approximately 56 to 57 per cent of the increase in the wealth of the community by way of taxation.  On the Government's estimate of the increase in the gross national product, something like 56 per cent, or roughly three-fifths, is to be taken by the Government for governmental expenditure.  How can there be any incentive to increase production when three-fifths of that increase is to be taken out of the pockets of the people?  That is one of the things that will be achieved by this Bill.</P>
    <P>I was amazed that the Minister did not see fit in his speech introducing this Finance Bill to give us some indication as to why a wholesale tax of this sort was chosen as the vehicle to collect the taxation which is to be superimposed on the existing turnover tax.  Before the Minister introduced this Budget and this tax on 14th June, he must have examined the other taxes available to him and must have come to his conclusion that this was a suitable type of tax.  In the time since then available to me, I have endeavoured to find any single country in the world which has this type of wholesale tax superimposed on an existing retail turnover tax.  I do not pretend for a second that I have the facilities to make my inquiries exhaustive but the Minister has those facilities.  He is able through our embassies abroad to ascertain the position in respect of taxes in any country in the world and it is at least significant that he has not thought it worth his while to suggest this morning that this particular type of tax is in operation elsewhere, side by side with, and superimposed upon, a retail tax.</P>
    <P>In the discussion on the turnover tax in 1963, that tax which was the forerunner and the torchlight of all the inflation that has followed since, that tax which triggered off, as the Fianna Fáil Government of that time were told it would trigger off, a round of inflation from which the country has never recovered, Senator Dr. Ryan, the then Fianna Fáil Minister for Finance, made cogent and pungent arguments against the imposition of a wholesale tax.  One would have thought that at least his Fianna Fáil successor <Col N="1631" /> in Government would have had the courtesy to his predecessor to explain why circumstances had changed and why arguments then advocated by the Minister were no longer operative.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons the then Fianna Fáil Minister for Finance gave, at column 84 of the Official Report of Volume 202, for having a retail tax was: &ldquo;The impact would inevitably be increased by the trade &lsquo;mark-up&rsquo;, to the disadvantage of the consumer and without any direct gain to the Revenue&rdquo;.  In fact, if one reads the Budget statement of 23rd April, 1963 and the discussion that took place in this House on the Committee Stage of the Finance Bill on 10th July, 1963, and subsequent days, one can find through the whole of that debate and discussion substantial arguments advanced by the Minister's predecessor in office against this type of wholesale tax.  It was on those arguments the then Fianna Fáil Minister relied for his choice of a retail tax of 2½ per cent.</P>
    <P>It is not for me to make any detailed comment on the manner in which Fianna Fáil have turned their backs on those arguments, but it is pertinent to note that while the turnover retail tax, and it was part of the reason why that tax was, and is, so bitterly unpopular, was flat in its operation and made no differentiation as between the luxury of a fur coat at one end of the scale and the bread purchased to keep the family alive on the other, this tax exempts certain articles of use which might perhaps be described as necessary.  But in so exempting them, it does not travel the rest of the way, as it should, and differentiate between luxury goods, on the one hand, and on the other, goods that are necessary, though not perhaps as necessary as food.  The meaning of section 3 is not crystal clear but, so far as I can see, the position is that materials for housebuilding, which are at present subject to turnover retail tax, as I would call it by way of contradistinction, of 2½ per cent, will now be subject, in addition, to wholesale tax at five per cent.</P>
    <P>There are materials, without question, <Col N="1632" /> which go into the building of houses which are at present subject to the 2½ per cent tax.  Those things will now have five per cent added by virtue of the provisions of section 3, that is, 1/- in the £.  The effect of this will be that in relation to many of the materials that go into housebuilding, the Government will now get a rakeoff of 7½ per cent at the same time as they are purporting by means of grants to ease the lot of those who want to build a home for themselves and their families.</P>
    <P>There might be some sense in that if, at the same time, the housing grants generally were increased.  We all know that housing grants are less on the basis of the real value of money now than they were 15 years ago.  Therefore, far from the increased Government taxation on housebuilding that will arise being offset, the reverse is the position.</P>
    <P>This is not a selective tax except in so far as certain categories are exempt. The provisions of section 3 do not even carry out what the Minister indicated in his second Budget speech.  He indicated in his second Budget speech that the Bill would provide that any goods liable to the existing retail tax, with the exception of those set out in subparagraph (iii), would be liable to tax.  That is not so because the Minister, while not imposing the tax on exempted activities under subparagraph (i), has provided that he can exempt articles from this tax without exempting them from the retail tax. That has been done by the manner in which subparagraph (ii) has been drafted.</P>
    <P>As I said when speaking on the General Resolution, it was not in accordance with his speech.  It is desirable that more care be taken by the Minister either to explain what he intended or to make what he is putting into operation follow the intention.  We will have a better chance and a better opportunity of discussing that particular aspect of it on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>When we were discussing the retail turnover tax in 1963, Sweden was given as the great example which we were going to follow and there were <Col N="1633" /> during that debate many occasions on which the then Fianna Fáil Minister for Finance objected violently because the Opposition were not satisfied to follow the Swedish pattern.  Again, there is a complete <i>volte face</i> by Fianna Fáil in that respect.  The Swedish Government have abandoned their retail turnover tax and have substituted instead a value-added tax to phase out the retail tax because they say themselves the impact of that tax on the essential industries and exports of the community will not be anything like as serious.</P>
    <P>Here, there is no attempt to phase out the retail tax.  On the contrary, the position here is that we have a new tax superimposed on the other and superimposed in a way that will mean to a large extent that there will be tax on tax on tax.  I mention the double superimposition quite deliberately. You will have here a tax collected at wholesale level and, of course, that tax will be passed on in the price of the goods to the retailer, plus, of course, the mark-up for the wholesaler being out of his money during the period from the time he has paid the tax until the time he is paid by the retailer.  That is natural.</P>
    <P>Let us assume, for example, that there is an article that will be sold wholesale at £100.  A five per cent tax will be added.  That £100 will be sold at £105, plus mark-up, and then, on top of that, the retailer will have to provide, when he is selling, a mark-up, not merely for his own profit, not merely for his wholesaler's profit, but for the wholesaler's wholesale tax in addition.  Perhaps, in consequence of that, the article in question&mdash;depending of course on the line&mdash;would be sold, not for £100, but for £125 or £130, perhaps even more.  The amount does not matter for the purpose of this argument.</P>
    <P>Then the retailer will have to add on to this price another mark-up of 2½ per cent, 2½ per cent which has to be added, not merely on the wholesale price but on the wholesale tax that has already been imposed, and we will find, I believe, in relation to these two taxes and the manner in which they <Col N="1634" /> have been superimposed, that the revenue part of it and the mark-up on that revenue part of it will mean an addition of perhaps as much as 15 to 20 per cent on the items that are caught in this way and that have to bear 7½ per cent duty between the two and, in consequence, will have the mark-up on them.</P>
    <P>The value-added tax avoids that position, avoids that duplication.  I agree that it is, perhaps, more difficult in certain respects to administer.  The excuse given by the then Fianna Fáil Minister for Finance, Dr. Ryan, as to why we would not have a value-added tax in 1963 was that we had not sufficient experience here in Ireland of any turnover tax to start out on that line. We have had three years of most unfortunate experience of it, most unfortunate in the inflation that was generated by it.</P>
    <P>I do not quite understand, either, how section 11 will operate in relation to imports.  There is no exemption from section 11 in the same way as there is an exemption in sub-paragraph (iii) of paragraph (b) of subsection (5) of section 3.  If the Minister is serious in saying that food, drink, tobacco, medicines, clothing, fuel, hydrocarbon oils are not to be subject to this tax when they are brought in by way of imports, he should have put that reservation and exception in section 11 in the same way as he puts it in section 3.  As it is, it has been left discretionary for the Minister to do it or not as he wishes, or to widen it or to narrow it, exactly at his discretion, by the provision of subsection (2) of section 11.  It is extremely bad drafting and extremely bad taxation law to have in one case the exceptions and exemptions properly set out in a class and not to have them in the other. That is, of course, unless the Minister for Finance intends that imports of that sort will be caught.  I do not think that under the provisions of the Free Trade Area Agreement with Britain, he would be entitled so to do but, again, that is one of the things about which we should like to hear something from the Minister.</P>
    <P>Above all, I should like to hear <Col N="1635" /> from the Minister where in the world do we have a wholesale tax and a retail tax running side by side, one superimposed on the other?  I ask that question not out of curiosity, but because I should like to see, as others would like to see, where it exists, whether it works there, because it does not seem to us that it is possible to work the two together in that way without getting into very serious difficulties in respect of what is generally accepted as the worst possible canon of taxation, raising a tax on a tax.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this tax, as the House and the country are aware, is mainly to provide extra revenue for the Exchequer in order to cover some of the increased charges on it since the introduction of the Budget in March.  These charges include the £1 a week pay claims which were generally made and which, according to the pattern being worked out, will have to be applied more or less to the Civil Service.  Secondly, there is the increase in the cost of subsidisation of farm products which was made, following the bad winter and particularly late spring of this year.</P>
      <P>The turnover tax is based on retail sales as such and therefore, with very few exceptions, was made to be of general application.  The wholesale tax is of an entirely different nature.  It could not be applied across the board as a selective purchase tax at the retail end: it would have been an impossible burden to ask retailers to account for goods sold by them&mdash;particularly retailers in mixed businesses&mdash; which would be exempt and which would not be exempt under the Bill. It was therefore necessary, in order to introduce a selective purchase tax of this nature, to go back to the wholesale level and impose it there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill provides in general for making this tax effective but it gives power to the Minister by order to make exemptions.  That is a matter that must be stressed.  There will be no power in the Minister to order any new commodities to be caught.  There is the general relief of the items I have mentioned, <Col N="1636" /> food, medicines, clothing, fuel, etc., the commodities which are specifically exempted&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It is all right.  It must be remembered also that this tax will have the least possible impact on the cost of living, affecting it only as to about one point.  It will affect only about £100 million worth of the gross sales turnover in the country and therefore in a full year will represent only about £5 million by way of increased income for the Exchequer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>As nearly as possible I shall endeavour to get the figures for the Deputy.  This estimate of £100 million is an indication of the extent to which this tax will apply and the very limited extent to which it will affect the cost of living.  We need only take as an example the list Deputy Seán Dunne roneo-ed in the course of <Col N="1637" /> the debate on Resolution No. 3, the list of commodities and itemised expenditure of the average family living in Ballyfermot.  He instanced a man earning in the region of £12 or £13 per week and itemised how exactly his outlay went on such items as food, rent, clothing, insurance, bus fares and household expenses and of the whole list which amounted to an outlay of about £13 18s 6d&mdash;I forget the exact amount&mdash;only 1s 6d worth would have been subject to this wholesale tax.  That hardly amounts to a penny a week on that particular individual.  These are figures supplied by Deputy Dunne.  I admit he could have been more comprehensive&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am sorry; but I think he had cigarettes.  I cannot say offhand whether there is another country in which the wholesale tax and a retail tax run side by side but there are many countries in which a tax on purchases by the public is much higher than the combined retail and wholesale tax here.  Therefore, I suggest the incidence of taxation of this nature here is comparatively limited and compares favourably with the incidence of taxation in almost every other European country, and indeed non-European countries, if I mention the USA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some matters of detail were raised by Deputy Sweetman in connection with section 3 in particular and section 11 but, as I said in my opening statement, these matters can be better raised on the Committee Stage.  Suggestions were made during the previous debate that it was a mark of bad planning on the part of the Government that we should now seek to introduce new taxes after the first Budget in March.  I intimated to the House the necessity for the new taxes when I introduced these Resolutions almost <Col N="1638" /> three weeks ago.  Last night, when concluding on the Resolutions, I was hoping to develop the point I wanted to make when, unfortunately, the Order of the House caught up with me and I had to sit down.  It was the point that it was, on the contrary, good business to ensure that we would cover our current expenditure in so far as we could by current taxation in order to avoid having to apply capital badly needed for other purposes to filling gaps in our Budget or shortfalls in our income, as compared with expenditure. I suggest that is an example of good financial business and one that we ought to continue to follow.</P>
    <P>I do not like to go into the detail of capital expenditure that was raised here yesterday because it would not be very appropriate to this Bill, even though it was made to be appropriate to the specific Resolution which was a prelude to the introduction of the Bill.  I think everybody will agree that it is important to ensure, in so far as we can, that our taxation income will be sufficient to cover our outgoings on the current side.  There have been suggestions of overspending by the Government. I was reading a leading article in one of our dailies a couple of days ago which made that startling and wild allegation of overspending. It is very easy to make these allegations but it is not so easy to pinpoint where the overspending occurred.  I said in the debate on the Budget that I went through the exercises over and over again, before and after the Estimates were published this year, to ensure that any single item of expenditure that could be avoided would be deleted.  I went through several, and painful, processes with my colleagues individually and in Government to ensure that no item of expenditure which we could do without this year would appear on our Book of Estimates. I do not think that there has been any year in which there was a more rigorous pruning of the expenditure proposals of each Department of State.  Not only was that done, as I said, before the estimates were published, but it continues to be done to ensure in so far as can be achieved, that no Estimate will exceed what is <Col N="1639" /> stated in the Estimates Book to be necessary.</P>
    <P>I have already indicated to the House that there will be a change in the manner in which Estimates will be presented.  As the House is aware, and as any Member of the House who has had experience of government is aware, each Department puts forward, during the summer and especially in the early autumn, their projections of expenditure for their Department in any particular year.  Then the usual series of consultations follow between the Department of Finance and the representatives of each Department to see to what extent the projections can be reduced.  I do not mind admitting that there is a little bit of horse-trading.  As one would expect from human beings, some Departments put forward a little more than they expect to get, like the man who went to the fair with a cow and who was asked how much he got for her.  He said: &ldquo;I did not get as much as I expected but, then, I did not expect I would.&rdquo;  In future, instead of this, if I might so describe it, horse-trading, the Department of Finance will go to the other Departments and say: &ldquo;This is what you spent last year.  This, plus x, perhaps, is reasonable for your spending this year.  If you want any more, you will have to justify it to the hilt.&rdquo;  In other words, we are starting at the other end, making projections forward, and so on.</P>

      <P>Deputy Sweetman mentioned the reasons why the previous Minister for Finance, the then Deputy Dr. Ryan, put forward the turnover tax and said it was not possible to operate it on a selective basis.  No matter what is said against the turnover tax, I think it is not an unfair tax.  It operates right across the community so that the more a person expends, then the more he is liable to be caught for taxation.  It must be realised, too, that it was necessary in this country to broaden the base of tax.  While, at one stage, it appeared that traditional taxes on tobacco and beer might be reaching the law of diminishing returns, increased affluence changed that situation.  Nevertheless, I think it unfair that people who take a drink and like to smoke should continue to carry an undue share of the burden.  The introduction of the turnover tax was an effort to relieve that undue share.  It was also an effort to relieve or reduce as far as possible the incidence of income tax and to broaden the base of tax and therefore to spread the burden more evenly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was necessary, as well, in 1963, to raise a much larger sum than is required now.  In 1963, it was necessary to raise something of the order of £3½ million as against £1½ million this year out of the respective taxes and, as well as that, to provide a stable base for expenditure taxation in future years.  In order to do this with the minimum administrative cost, it was necessary to include all consumer expenditure and to include services in the scope of the tax.  This allowed a very low rate of tax, and nobody can suggest that 2½ <Col N="1641" /> per cent is anything but a low rate of tax, and also eliminated the question of an increase in costs due to traders' mark-up on the tax, or the possibility of a disturbance of existing trade patterns.</P>
    <P>I was a member of the Government at the time and I am aware that many other alternatives were considered, and because of the danger, as Deputy Sweetman mentioned, of the tax upon tax element affecting some kinds of system, it was decided that the fairest system, once we were introducing a turnover tax at the retail level, was this tax of 2½ per sent.  If large sums were required this year, there might have been no other alternative than to have recourse to the broad retail tax again, but fortunately I was able to avoid that.  I want to repeat what I said last night, that notwithstanding the suggestions made by Fine Gael that the turnover tax was the root of all our evils, it is still true that of the 12½ per cent increase in consumer prices over the period, the turnover tax accounted for only three per cent and the balance was made up by a variety of other factors, including wage increases.</P>
    <P>It is wrong to ignore these other factors and to allege that only the turnover tax was responsible.  On the contrary, had we not got the turnover tax and the £15 million or so it helps to bring into the Exchequer, there would inevitably be unemployment because to reduce Government expenditure in many directions would be to create unemployment.  However, it is not desired to raise this comprehensive tax again, unless and until it is essential to do so, if the alternative, a selective tax, will not suffice.</P>

      <P>Obviously what the Taoiseach was referring to was year by year as the costs of governing increase and as the activities of Government expenditure increase, then more taxation will be necessary.

      <P>I do not think anybody could say he will never increase taxation.  It is a desirable objective to try not to increase the levels <Col N="1643" /> of taxation, but it is better that taxation should increase because that would be indicative of a prospering country, of greater affluence and well-being. It would mean that people were earning more and the income tax they would be paying would be higher but nevertheless the net take home pay would be higher.</P>

      <P>One can get into all kinds of arguments about this.  We have the NIEC Report which advised the Government that in so far as increased incomes outran increased productivity it was the duty of the Government to pare off these increased incomes in order to balance.  That is an economic argument which is a good one, otherwise this inflationary trend would go too far.  Do not take me as being a person who is against inflation. I think a modicum of inflation is good for any country.  Deflation is necessary from time to time.</P>

      <P>Perhaps that is the word.  We have been doing some of that in recent months and it has been having the desired effect.

The import levies and the price control measures and the pruning of Government expenditure on the capital and on the revenue sides, and also the purchase restrictions that were imposed, have all begun to have their effects.  We are now moving steadily ahead, although not as fast as we would like, and our balance of payments <Col N="1644" /> is in better shape; our foreign reserves are on the increase again and our balance of trade has improved considerably, as recent figures show.

      <P>At an early stage a press conference should be held with employers and unions in order to outline in greater depth just what this Department will be expected to do.  As we indicated earlier, the Minister will have to dissolve a great deal of criticism in advance.  Several people have their prejudices in relation to this Department.  He did indicate that the changes contemplated in the law relating to trade unions will not make the task any easier and I would recommend that at an early stage the lamb who will take over the Department should meet all these big bad wolves in the world of industrial relations and do his best to explain the importance the Government attach to this Department and in what way exactly he is there to help all sides reach early settlement.  I think the best way to do that would be to have a representative meeting at which he should explain what his object is.</P>

      <P>During the course of his Second Reading speech, the Taoiseach made a reference to agricultural workers.  I assume Deputy Tully's amendment was ruled out of order on Committee Stage.  The Taoiseach indicated that the Agricultural Wages Board would still continue to operate. He must be aware of the dissatisfaction <Col N="1649" /> there is with the type of machinery for fixing the wages, hours and conditions of those employed in the agricultural community.  It certainly would be conceded by me and Deputy Tully that they are a particular group and that in practically all cases you have two or three people dealing with one employer. But the agricultural labourers feel that the Wages Board has always been weighted against them.  It is true that trade unions are represented equally with the employers who are from the farming community.  The chairman is appointed by the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.  It has always appeared that the chairman falls down on the side of the employers rather than the agricultural workers.</P>
      <P>We could go on for a long time discussing the ability of the farming community to pay what would be regarded as good wages.  The Government, particularly the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Finance, will have to devise some ways and means of ensuring that a supply of well-paid labour will be available to the agricultural community.  With the establishment of more industries, there is a great attraction from the land.  I do not think anybody could blame a man with £7 15s or £8 a week for going into a factory.  In many cases we find the farming community hollering for labour and deploring the scarcity of it.  We will always have this scarcity unless the agricultural labourer is in a position where he has not alone good wages but good conditions of employment.</P>
      <P>However, as far as what the Taoiseach said is concerned, I think he indicated he might at some stage use some part of the new Labour Court to deal with this particular type of worker.  As far as I can gather, there will be three or four different types of courts.  If one could be available for agricultural workers and other workers in the rural community, that might meet the case Deputy Tully wanted to make.  As far as the Agricultural Wages Board is concerned, it is absolutely and completely unsatisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether the Taoiseach has been disappointed in this debate <Col N="1650" /> in that it did not descend to a personal attack on the Minister for Transport and Power.  I would like on behalf of the Labour Party to assure the Taoiseach, every member of the Cabinet and others in public life, such as the chairmen of semi-State bodies, that if comments are made from this side of the House, they are not made in any personal sense.  If people accept public responsibility, they must accept public criticism.  Dr. Andrews has been subjected to criticism recently.  I know Dr. Andrews.  I know he is a capable man, but, what is much more important, I know he is big enough to take criticism.  I do not think members of the Fianna Fáil Party should be so sensitive as to think that any criticism of people like Dr. Andrews or the Minister for Transport and Power is made in any personal sense.  As I say, people who accept public responsibility must be prepared to accept public criticism.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce has to take it betimes; the Taoiseach has to take it; but they give it out, too.  I do not think we should be so sensitive as not to be able to give and take in matters of this kind.</P>
    <P>The important element in this case is the individual to be appointed.  He is going to have a very difficult task. Deputy O'Leary described him as a lamb.  I presume he means someone to be sacrificed.  If the Taoiseach gets some person who is able to knit these two groups together, I am sure the objective he wants to attain in the establishment of the Ministry of Labour will be attained.  We trust that this appointment will be made soon so that the new Minister will be able to get on with the various tasks outlined for him by the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>I think the Taoiseach misunderstood me when he was replying to the debate last night.  He quoted me as saying that this was not the best time for the introduction of industrial legislation or trade union legislation.  I think I went on to say in my speech that if the Bills were not discussed in Dáil Éireann until the autumn, I thought that would be a good time because it was desirable to discuss these matters when we had relative peace.  An atmosphere in which tempers are frayed and there is acute <Col N="1651" /> industrial unrest is not the best atmosphere in which to discuss Bills that may be of a controversial kind.  I think I can say as far as the Labour Party are concerned&mdash;and, as far as we know, the trade union movement&mdash;that if the Minister for Labour consults fully with the two sides, there should be no difficulty in getting an improved Industrial Relations Act and an improved Trade Unions Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>On the occasion of the passing of this Bill into law, I urge on Deputies on all sides of this House even jocularly not to be presenting the picture of a Minister for Labour in the process of being torn to pieces by warring factions in society.  I do not believe that this potential war exists. It is a great disservice to the community to which we all belong to give what appears to the country to be official sanction to the proposition that we are living in a kind of jungle in which trade unions are reaching for the jugular vein of every employer in the country and employers' associations are secretly yearning to see the trade union movement obliterated.  That is a gross distortion of the facts.</P>
      <P>We have had a considerable spate of industrial unrest in the recent past.  But it would be a great disservice to the country to represent that as being the responsibility of the trade unions or the employers exclusively.  We know perfectly well we have been passing through a period of extreme economic difficulty.  We have seen a marked increase in the cost of living which we have all deplored in this House, but it is idle to think that in the presence of a steeply rising cost of living you can avoid efforts by unions to try to secure for their members redress for what they believe to be the erosion of the benefits they secured from previous negotiations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, you have employers fighting to keep their businesses solvent, fighting to make profits and faced with the prospect that if the burden of wages and salaries rises beyond certain levels, the only source on which they can draw is their profits. What I am afraid of is that &ldquo;profits&rdquo;<Col N="1652" /> is becoming an almost indecent word. I want to point out that while I fully recognise that the trade unionists and their unions must fight to maintain their own standards and the standards of their members, there can be no wages, there can be no salaries, there can be no business if there are no profits.  It is sheer suicide to persist in the illusion that if we are to maintain in this country the kind of mixed economic system we have&mdash;partly State or semi-State bodies and the bulk of our business committed to private enterprise&mdash;there can be any progress or any enduring employment for our people at home if those who employ them are excluded from the possibility of profits.</P>
    <P>Bearing in mind the difficulties through which we have passed and through which we are passing, and despite the optimistic diagnosis last night of the Minister for Finance of our economic situation, it is right to say to the House, considering the difficult conditions through which we must pass, that we have got to recognise there will be labour unrest, there will be difficulties in arriving at agreed solutions; and while on this occasion I do not particularly desire to lambaste the Government for their share in it, it is necessary to emphasise that a good many of the problems with which we are wrestling are due to the inflationary situation into which the Government have drawn us, and I most urgently press on the members of the FUE and of the Congress of Irish Trade Unions to realise that we are all living in a difficult situation created by the inflation which has been raging in the country, but that we are not all tigers waiting in our respective lairs to spring forth and eat the Minister for Labour the moment he is appointed.</P>
    <P>I know I will shock a number of employers' organisations when I say that though there have been exasperating disputes in this country, considering the difficulties that have obtained, I do not think our record for labour relations is all that bad.  We have had lengthy, protracted and difficult strikes but when we see the labour relations problems that exist in England, our <Col N="1653" /> nearest neighbour, and the occurrences last week there&mdash;attempts to take over unions for political aims&mdash;complex as our labour relations have been in the past couple of years, I do not believe they were born of any fundamental hatred between two sections of our community.</P>
    <P>I want to revert to a theme I mentioned on the Second Stage.  I regret the repeated suggestions in this House, coming, I confess, mainly from the Labour benches, that there are two classes in Ireland and that there ought to be a war continuously proceeding between us.  That is all cod and we all know it is cod.  We know that though Labour Members shake their gory locks at us in here, when we meet outside the door, we are ready to have a cup of coffee together.  When we proceed to examine our antecedents and our domestic foundations, there is no great difference between us.  Neither side has servants.  Our wives are battling away with the household work as well as they can and sometimes they ask us to go out and have dinner somewhere else because they are too busy.</P>

      <P>It is important that we should at first realise and secondly rejoice in the fact that we live in a classless society.  To have achieved it is an example before the world.  There are many countries that cannot make such a claim, even modern democracies like the USA which throw up a plutocrat and a proletarian to constitute a social menace.  We are greatly blessed that we have not got that problem.  It cannot be too often emphasised and we <Col N="1654" /> cannot too often in public and in private thank Providence that such is the case.</P>
      <P>I want to join issue with the Taoiseach. I do not think it is right to snap at every word a Minister utters in the course of speaking at the end of a debate because very often a Minister has to rise at the end of a debate and without protracted preparation or consideration of every syllable, answer a wide variety of questions.  I doubt if the Taoiseach on reflection, when dwelling on the possibility of a strike becoming wholly intractable, with neither side yielding, will sustain the suggestion that we would have to consider legislation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I hope he did not mean to communicate to the House that his or any other Party would contemplate legislation to impose settlements in trade disputes.  The primary reason why I revolt against such a suggestion is that it is inconsistent with the preservation of individual liberty in the State.  But there is a second almost equally cogent reason: it does not work.  Australia tried it under a Labour Government and it never worked.  There are people who will say when a strike goes on and on, with the men picketing and the employers refusing to meet them: &ldquo;Something must be done or the strike will go on for ever&rdquo;.  The answer to that is this: is it expedient for us today to proceed to legislate for the operation of Oireachtas Éireann should an earthquake shake down Leinster House? Anybody who heard that the Government was legislating for such an eventuality, was making preparations for the Dáil to meet in cellars if Leinster House should be destroyed by <Col N="1655" /> an earthquake, would think that the Government had gone mad.  I have never seen a strike that went on for ever.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The person in question became the most intimate friend of the man who was on strike against him. That strike became almost a tourist attraction and the man against whom the strike was called was most concerned that the striker did not catch a cold.  He ensured that he got three meals a day and that strike developed into a kind of friendly relationship between the two of them.  It is my honest belief that in the long run there is no trade dispute that cannot be settled through ordinary deliberation and I know of no case of a strike that went on for ever.  We all regret protracted strikes not only because of the hardships suffered by those on strike but also because of the great injury done to the employer.  You can point to a case like the great strike in America that went on for seven years, the strike in the great Kohler concern, but there was a peculiar background to that whole business which introduced outside factors.  However, even that came to an end.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach has said that he never contemplated legislation to impose a settlement of a trade dispute and I would like him, when he is replying on this stage, to clear that matter up. I want to say that imposed settlements of trade disputes will not work and that they would constitute what would be an intolerable infringement of the rights of the individual upon which we all agree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a terrible danger of our becoming so fascinated with all that is going on in other countries that we shall come to the belief that what other people have is always better than what we have worked out here at home.  I am not sure that is true.  I think we have in our own way evolved in Ireland a way of life and of human relations that is in many respects <Col N="1656" /> entirely superior to anything that obtains abroad.  I was referring last night to the intimate personal relationships that exist over a wide range of Irish employment between the employer and the employed man, out of which has grown a relationship which is not so much that of employer and employee but of a friend working for a friend.  That is a much better approach to labour relations than the approach developing throughout the world, as companies grow bigger and bigger, that a man's labour is a commodity from which it follows that a man is little more than a bolt, a nut or a screw to be disposed of, if he is no longer giving the maximum return for his wages.</P>
    <P>I am growing sick and tired of listening to talk about the gross national product and the affluent state, and I commend to some of my colleagues an article in last Sunday's <i>Observer</i> by Malcolm Muggeridge.  It was a startling comment on the world in which we live.  I remember that ten years ago Malcolm Muggeridge was a great prophet of atheism and of the Utopian future that would be ours when all the superstitions of Christianity were wiped away.  He has changed his mind since then.  In a very noble and striking testimony, he proclaims that as he has watched the growth of the affluent state he has come to the conclusion that the computers and the economists are wrong, that there is something more to life than that, that there is something more than that which really matters and that the affluent society and all the rest of it has failed dismally to produce the only thing that really counts, that is, a chance for ordinary people to live honourably in their own countries.</P>
    <P>I want to suggest that in this matter we have almost reached the goal; we have come closer to it in this country than in any other country I know, that is, we have managed to preserve freedom, have managed to avoid extremes of wealth and poverty and have, in this House, unanimous agreement that the first charge on our resources must be the obligation of the elimination of poverty.  We are all prepared to meet whatever burdens <Col N="1657" /> that involves.  That is not a bad philosophy of life and I do not want to see it surrendered for something else.  I believe it is the foundation of good labour relations.</P>
    <P>I wonder if I am right in this, and it is something I present to the Taoiseach for his special attention.  I suspect that a good deal of the difficult labour problems that arise here arise through the arrival of foreign firms that we are most anxious to welcome, provided they invest money in new forms of industry and turn out manufactured goods for export.  I remember being in Germany two or three years ago with Deputy Corish at the invitation of the Federal German Republic. He will remember several big German industrialists telling us that they had labour relations problems much more complex than ours.  They were bringing in Turks, Greeks, Italians and Spaniards to work in their factories.  They had not only to grapple with the language problem, which they found relatively simple to solve, but they also had to grapple with the problem of cooking for their foreign employees.  They discovered to their amazement that what was served to the directors of a German firm was very often wholly unacceptable to a Turkish labourer who would not eat it and they had to bring in Turkish cooks and Italian cooks and Greek cooks and Spanish cooks in order to cook for people from the other end of the world who simply could not adapt themselves to what was for Germany excellent food.</P>
    <P>I know we have no trouble of that that kind here.  The trouble we do have is that we have our own pattern of society of which I am proud, the classless society, and we are not accustomed in this country to people exchanging conversation on the basis of bosses and men.  You will find perfectly decent, respectable persons working in jobs in this country, who are quite prepared to deal with rational employers on the basis of fair exchange and mutual respect but whose hackles begin to rise if they are treated as anonymous cogs in a machine.</P>
    <P>I think if a Minister for Labour will do any outstanding service for superior labour relations in this country it will <Col N="1658" /> be to say to people, to every foreign firm who come here that one of their first duties before a wheel turns or a product is put on the production line is to get a good personnel manager who belongs to our people and understands them.  Our people are not unreasonable. They are a proud people and they do not want to be treated contemptuously. I rejoice that they will not be treated like this.  I am glad our people are that kind of people but we do ourselves a great disservice if we spread the word abroad that ours are a difficult people to deal with.  There are no better workers in the world than our people in their own country, provided only their employers will treat them not as servants but as friends.</P>
    <P>I think a good Irish personnel officer, a man or woman, understands that. That does not mean workers are not prepared to accept rebukes or remonstrances but it does mean that if there is to be rebuke or remonstrance, it is to be in terms acceptable to an honourable man or woman and in a situation in which they have a right to state their views and give their explanations, a situation in which it is not regarded as insurbordination or impertinence but a right which an employer in this country must gladly and readily concede. Only too many firms in this country have got into trouble for the want of a good personnel officer.</P>
    <P>I conclude by saying to the Taoiseach that I do not believe the Minister for Labour is fated to be a lamb prepared for the slaughter, to be torn to pieces by two warring factions in this country.  I wish him success and I offer as one most important suggestion that he should concentrate on ensuring that those who are giving employment in Ireland, certainly in the initial stages of their enterprise, should fortify themselves with a competent personnel officer who understands the people with whom he has to deal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened this morning to Deputy Dillon's comments about Malcolm Muggeridge.  It is fair to comment that he is not the only old man who has had to change his views of what was right over the years, and not the only old man who has found <Col N="1659" /> that the intelligence which he thought was gone with his youth was something given him by a great Omnipotent Being, of which he merely has a loan and which eventually he will have to pass on.  We have that all over the place.</P>
      <P>I am interested in the comment about a classless society.  God knows we do not want, particularly in the trade union movement, to start or to continue a class war.  It amuses me to hear people like the Taoiseach and Deputy Dillon saying that there is only one class in this country when every day we go out we find people with plenty of money doing everything they can to prove that they are superior beings to those who have not got it.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>They are trying it, and as long as they try it, the blame goes on them for making a class society and not on the people who are working hard on a week's wages.  The question is whether or not in this country we could have ideal relations between the workers and employers and the fact is we do not have this situation which is supposed to exist in America.  I should like to point out that some of these relations have been carried into this country by some of the firms who come in here and who make it a prerequisite when employing labour that they will not become members of a trade union.  I am sure Deputy Dillon, and others in this House, are aware that again and again we find people being dismissed, their only crime being that it has been discovered that they, without telling their employer, became members of a trade union. The employer found out and got rid of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had last year in County Cavan an Irishman who had a firm there and because his members joined not my union but the ITGWU, he closed down his job overnight.  A strike took place which lasted 12 months and he won it. Those poor people, who had been on strike for the best part of 12 months, who will never if they live to be 90 <Col N="1660" /> recover the amount of money they lost, just had to swallow their pride and look for employment elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Before we start talking about a classless society, let us realise that we still have this sort of thing happening in the country again and again.  The fact that it is being continued in this Bill, with which we agree&mdash;we agree that a Minister for Labour should be appointed &mdash; is evidenced by the fact that agricultural workers are excluded from this Bill, but, in fact, what the Taoiseach said when he introduced the Bill proves to me that he does not believe that agricultural workers are entitled to the same type of treatment as any other workers in the State.</P>
    <P>This is the third or fourth time in the life of Fianna Fáil government that this has happened.  We had the Agricultural Workers (Holidays) Bill a few years ago introduced after a previous Bill had been passed in this House dealing with all other workers.  In other words, there are two types of people in the country, ordinary workers and agricultural workers&mdash;the poor relations.  Again, in the NIEC forecast, agriculture is left out for the same extraordinary reason.  The Minister for Agriculture gave an excuse here which was not an excuse at all. It is quite evident that everybody seems to think that if you are engaged in agriculture at any level, you are not the same as other people employed in more respectable jobs.  So much for the classless society.</P>
    <P>I was also interested in the comment made this morning by the Taoiseach, followed by Deputy Dillon, about the desire of both these gentlemen to ensure that in no circumstances was the right of these workers to go on strike and to stay on strike to be interfered with.  All I can say is they must have been taking some kind of drugs or must have had a lapse of memory, because somehow they have forgotten that less than three weeks ago, both the Fianna Fáil Party and Deputy Dillon's Party voted together here to force workers to accept a decision.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach is shaking his head. When this Bill was going through, he pointed that there was no question of <Col N="1661" /> imprisonment.  Perhaps he will tell me how a worker on £13 10s a week will pay a fine of £1,000, or £25 for a start and £5 a day, to go to the lower end of it.  How will any man pay it?  If he does not pay, what will happen?  Will he go to Mountjoy?</P>

      <P>If the union refuse, what happens?  What do you do with them?  You do not take any action.  You say you will not ask them to do anything and just leave it there. No matter what covering up you have on it, this is purely and simply blackmail to try to persuade people that unless they do certain things they will go to jail.  The Taoiseach might as well have written it into the Bill because in the Bill it is.  The Minister for Labour can do a lot of things.  The only thing is that he will be asked to do too much.</P>

      <P>It is settled now but do not let anybody get the impression that it was a Bill of this House which settled it because it was not.  It was settled, as all these things must be settled.  I have 20 years experience as a trade union official and I find that most employers are reasonable.  In 99.9 of the cases, I find I can discuss matters with employers, and agree to differ, can refer the matter to the Labour Court or some other court, have the matter discussed and then reach agreement and there is no strike and no headlines.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>A big trouble is that pretty often other unions as well as my own find the situation where a wage demand has been served, where the settlement is a bit sticky and we take up the evening paper and see banner headlines: &ldquo;Strike threatened in X firm&rdquo;.  We go to meet the employer and he says: &ldquo;We cannot talk to you. You have already threatened strike and we are not going to work on that basis.&rdquo;  You go to the workers with an offer and they say: &ldquo;The national newspapers think we should go on strike.  We will get more.&rdquo;  That is a big thing now.  I wish that the people responsible for publishing headlines like that would realise the damage they are doing to the national economy.  I place the blame where it should be placed, not on the trade unions or their officials but, fair and square, on the shoulders of people who want to make a few shillings by headlining things which are only partly true and we know that the half-truth is the hardest thing to nail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as the whole question of labour relations is concerned, of course, the new Minister, whether he likes it or not, will find all of this dumped into his lap.  He will find that whenever a dispute takes place, if it looks like reaching deadlock, he will be asked at least to bring the two sides together.  This can be done by an outsider.  It has been done before.  Even the Taoiseach&mdash;I give him credit for it&mdash;has on one occasion brought together two sides.  I remember the late Deputy Norton, who <Col N="1663" /> was referred to in not a very complimentary manner here yesterday evening, sitting up all night in order to settle, or attempt to settle, a CIE dispute and successfully bringing the matter to a conclusion.  But I do not think that any sensible person in this country who knows the temper of Irish people will ever try to force people by law to do something which they do not want to do.</P>
    <P>As far as the question of taking legal action is concerned, I am very glad of the assurance of both Parties that there is no intention at any time to enforce a law to make people accept an agreement which they do not want to accept. At the same time, it must be realised that hints, whether broad hints or just veiled threats, do no good and a clear statement of policy, not alone from the Taoiseach, but from the new Minister, is one of the things we must have.</P>
    <P>We have had here discussions from time to time on new industrial relations. It is an awful pity that we have not been able to discuss the proposed new legislation in conjunction with this appointment because, whether we like it or not, if we are to appoint a Minister and then start to ask what powers or responsibilities we must give him, we can find ourselves trying to fit the Bill to the man&mdash;the Minister referred to that yesterday&mdash;rather than trying to set up a system by which things like this can be straightened out.</P>
    <P>I am a trade union official for 20 years and I freely admit that strikes have occurred from time to time because of the fact that the trade unions responsible for handling the strikes did not insist on a majority of the workers voting for that strike.  There is nothing at all wrong with ensuring in any legislation that trade unions should have, not a majority of those present and voting, but a majority of those affected by the strike.  A stupid situation occurred a few years ago where a small number of men were able to hold up this country for quite a considerable period because they were the people who were interested enough in having a strike.  It was even more stupid because of the fact that some of the people who voted knew when they <Col N="1664" /> were voting that they themselves were in excluded jobs and therefore would not be involved in the strike.  If we are going to look at this, we must look at both sides of it.</P>
    <P>There is one aspect of this to which the Taoiseach must give immediate attention, that is, employment in national concerns.  I am sure that as a fairminded man, he must be the first to admit that it is absolutely ridiculous that a Department of State will not alone not make an offer of a wage increase when a demand is served by a union but will even fail to meet the unions concerned for the purpose of discussing it; not alone that, but when, in fact, it has been proved that the correct rate of wages is not being paid for a period of six months, say that they will pay it from a current date and refuse to pay the back money, refuse to meet the unions to discuss the matter and say that no useful purpose will be served by such a meeting and there is no appeal from it.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Taoiseach and the House will agree that those who go on strike in a forest or in many county council jobs or on arterial drainage jobs do not get very much for their pains.  They could be on strike for a long time and nobody would know whether they were on strike or not. There is no point in the Taoiseach or his Ministers talking about fair labour relations when this sort of thing is allowed to go on.  There was a bonus system introduced in Forestry and the Land Commission a few years ago. One of the things written in was that whenever the system covered all forests, there would be a tribunal set up to consider wages.  All the forests were covered about five years ago.  We still have not succeeded in getting this tribunal set up.  Why?  Because the little tin gods at the head of affairs in the Departments concerned feel they should have the right to say whether men live in comfort or starve, and many of them are on a semi-starvation diet.</P>
    <P>If the Taoiseach wants to appear before the country as being the big-hearted Arthur who will give fair play to everybody and will see that the <Col N="1665" /> workers are well looked after in future, it is only fair that he should give the same right of appeal to the workers in State employment as is given to those in semi-State or private employment.</P>
    <P>There are quite a number of matters which have been taken up by way of question in this House, and again as a trade union official, I deplore the necessity to have to raise a matter which is between me and my union and the employer concerned, namely the State, on the floor of the House.  It must be readily admitted that if the answer in every case from the employer is &ldquo;no&rdquo;, there is no other way than to have it raised here.  The Taoiseach explained why it was not possible to include under the State the right to have a case heard before the Labour Court.  Until the last inter-Party Government, local authority employees had not had the right and it was preached from the Government Benches that there would be chaos if that right were given.  But it was given and has resulted in perhaps the smoothest working of any labour relations I know of inside or outside the country.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Taoiseach should seriously consider giving the same right to State employees in that class, because when they go beyond a certain grade, they all have various tribunals to which wage claims can be brought, but the lesser people at the bottom are left behind in every case, with no right of appeal in any circumstances.  There is nothing unreasonable about my request that they should have a right of access to a tribunal to deal with this matter.  The Taoiseach is getting an opportunity of considering this now.  If he does not, I intend to raise it as long as I am in this House on every available occasion because I think it is a national scandal and something that should be aired before the general public.</P>
    <P>It is an extraordinary thing that people who are in responsible positions in some of these classes are, in fact, treated as if they did not matter, as if it did not matter whether they got a decent wage or not.  There is no way of having these matters dealt <Col N="1666" /> with except before an impartial tribunal. The Taoiseach himself, I believe, was surprised to find this position because he said: &ldquo;Why do you not take them to the Labour Court?&rdquo;  I quite understand he felt that they must have that right.  The Taoiseach can, by a stroke of the pen, have that decision taken and possibly he will do so.  The Minister for Health is here and he will know that local authority employees from time to time had to have grievances aired&mdash;mostly before his time&mdash;in the Labour Court.  They usually get fair recommendations which, as far as I know, have always been accepted by both sides.  There is no reason why we should not have the same right for State employees.  I do not want to labour this any further but it should be dealt with.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon spoke about the position in Germany where employers had so much difficulty not so much with food but with the cooking of food and the type of food and told how the managing director's food in Germany might not please a Hungarian.  Some years ago I made a study and was surprised to find that people who are imported mostly from Spain and Italy to Germany were not treated exactly as we would treat them here because apart from the language question, there was one employer who admitted a turnover in his employment&mdash;which was fairly tough&mdash;of about 65 per cent. There was change over every six weeks and the workers just stayed until they got another job.  It was not the food that was worrying them.  I am mainly concerned, not with the cooking of the food because our people will cook the food if they can buy it, but that they should get the food.  I am not happy with the present situation when we have some people working on such desperately low wages, apart from social welfare recipients, that they must find it extremely difficult to get the money they need to buy the food they require in order to do a hard day's work.</P>
    <P>We have bonus incentives all over the place but there is one thing which has not yet been tried.  I firmly believe that if a man is well fed, he is able to <Col N="1667" /> produce far more as a worker than if he is badly fed and promised that if he kills himself, he will get an extra few shillings in his paypacket.  Incentive bonuses are all right but first there must be a decent basic wage and an attempt should be made to have that basic wage sufficient to feed a man and his family.</P>
    <P>An effort is being made to have these debates concluded in a reasonable time and I do not propose to hold the House any longer, except to say again that while we wish the new Minister for Labour well, we hope he will be able at least to give guidance, because I think guidance is important in the matter of labour relations and that he will not be cajoled or threatened into taking out the big stick and wielding it all round. That is one thing which will bring his Ministry into disrespect and will mean that he will be like another Ministry here which is not trusted to do what it is supposed to do.</P>
    <P>Finally, let me say that people have repeatedly referred to the fact that the Labour Party in putting down an amendment, which, in fact, was not taken, to the Bill on a previous stage did so simply for the purpose of having a &ldquo;go&rdquo; at the Minister for Transport and Power.  Let me repeat that our members feel that Deputy Childers is a likeable sort of person but that does not alter the fact that the amount of work which his Department is doing is ridiculously low and, as far as we can see, since the appointment of the Minister for Transport and Power, the only money saved has been saved at the expense of workers' wages.</P>
    <P>I met a man last week who worked 40 years with the GNR and transferred to CIE.  He had what was a responsible job, guard on a train, practically all his life.  He retired on a pension of £1 a week at 65 and when he reached 70, it was reduced to 10/-.  Is it any wonder that he was a little bitter about the type of pensions which he hears are being discussed in this House at present?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been said, rightly.  I believe, that the setting up of this Ministry of Labour will not of itself give us better industrial relations. <Col N="1668" /> The proposal has been generally welcomed because it is felt that it indicates a new concern on the part of the Government for better industrial relations and a new appreciation of the great importance of improving labour relations generally.  Our concern has been brought about by the spate of industrial disputes the country has suffered in recent times.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to something Deputy Tully mentioned, that is, the exclusion of farm workers from the ambit of the Ministry of Labour.  He has a feeling, which I share, that it indicates that all those concerned with farming and agriculture are still being regarded as second-class citizens, as he described them.  There is no reason why we should not have the same treatment for farm workers who are working in the biggest and most important industry as for workers in any other industry, always provided that the farming community employing these workers is put in a position of being able to pay wages comparable with the wages paid in other industries.</P>
      <P>Deputy Tully mentioned that, on the part of the unions, it was all wrong that a decision to strike or stay on strike is arrived at by a majority of the workers present and voting.  I think this has caused extreme hardship and it is certainly something that should be changed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been closely associated with a number of strikes in the past few years.  Invariably, what happens is that, when a strike takes place, it is now so easy to get to England and to obtain employment there that most of the people with family responsibilities have to get out straight away and do, in fact.  Then, I think they are no longer effectively taking part in negotiations to settle the strike and unless they can be present and voting, their opinion just does not arise.  Very often, and I say this in all sincerity, it is the workers who speak loudest and longest, and not always, indeed, the most responsible workers, who get themselves elected as members of the strike committee.  They are not always the people with the greatest family responsibilities.  They, indeed, can be and sometimes are responsible for carrying a strike long <Col N="1669" /> beyond the period it is reasonable to carry it on and the workers with the greatest responsibility are not present to take part.  This, of course, is not taking either one side or the other in these disputes.  We all know that employers have been and will be responsible for disputes.  As Deputy Dillon has said, it is often due to the fact that a public relations officer is not employed by a large industry that these things are allowed to start in a small way and to develop and it is only when the crisis arrives that anything serious is done about it.</P>
    <P>There have been discussions about imposed settlements.  I think everybody recognises that you can lead Irish people but that you cannot drive them and that nobody would attempt to institute a system of labour relations based on imposed settlements.  Serious consideration should be given both by the labour side and by the employer side to arriving at an arrangement and a settlement whereby, if a strike goes on beyond a certain period which is regarded as a reasonable period for all the negotiations to take place between employer and management, the dispute will then be submitted to a tribunal, the personnel of which would be agreed upon by both sides in advance, and the findings of that tribunal would be and must be accepted by both sides. If we had an experiment of that kind for three or five years in order to see how it would work out, I believe a lot of good would come from it and that much of the hardship that has to be endured by the workers by reason of prolonged strikes might perhaps be eliminated almost entirely.</P>
    <P>When a prolonged strike takes place, it is the people who work in the industry who suffer.  Invariably, the people who own the business or the directors do not really suffer or go through this hardship.  I think that fact is recognised by all sides and that everybody is sincerely trying to bring about a situation where we could have more industrial peace and more equitable settlements generally.  I think that is the desire of every public representative in this House.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon has drawn attention to this class war which is indicated <Col N="1670" /> and which certain Labour speakers have emphasised, and I think perhaps over-emphasised.  So long as we keep drawing attention to the fact that there are two classes in society that must continue warring, and that that is the normal and the natural set-up of things, I think it only helps to prolong this attitude to most of the difficulties that arise between employers and workers.  The effort should be to indicate that employers are anxious to be fair and to ensure that the men and women who really run their industry for them are being seriously considered by them.  Until we have that sort of attitude on both sides, and not this feeling that the employer is Public Enemy No. 1, labour relations will be difficult.</P>
    <P>I always regret, when I have anything to do with a strike, even in a very remote way, that the prevalent attitude among the workers in industry is that the boss or the employer is there to do them down.  It is an extremely unfortunate attitude and it is something that the labour movement should be very anxious to eradicate. There will always be the risk of a certain amount of that but the greater the efforts to educate the workers in industry into appreciating that there are reasonable employers, that there are many employers anxious to meet them fairly and equitably, the better for all.</P>
    <P>The new Minister for Labour should not concern himself primarily with better industrial relations and better conditions for the people in employment. I think there should be far more concern for the people who are unable to get employment.  My estimate is that we have approximately 100,000 people for whom there are no jobs. It should, therefore, be one of the principal concerns of the new Minister for Labour to find employment for those people.  I feel, too, that it should be a very important consideration of the members of the trade union movement and of the members of the Labour Party.  It should be a first concern to ensure that those who have no jobs should get jobs rather than to overpush, perhaps, the claims of those who are already in employment.</P>

      <P>I believe that this proposal to establish a Department of Labour can have far-reaching effects on the future of the nation.  The implications of its establishment are, in my opinion, much wider than this debate would seem to indicate.  While I think the idea has been created in most people's minds that the sole function of the new Minister will be to act as a mediator in industrial disputes, it is true, as the Taoiseach said in his opening speech, that, in the beginning, the main concern of the new Minister will be to promote a climate of goodwill in respect of labour matters which will contribute to industrial peace and to national economic progress.  The functions of the new Minister will extend to other fields, as well.  He will be charged with the formulation and implementation of an integrated manpower policy.</P>
      <P>I regret that when the Taoiseach was introducing the Second Stage of this Bill he resorted to heavy political argument and castigated the Opposition Parties for having tabled amendments. The Taoiseach set a very bad example in starting off that way.  One thing about which I am not too happy is that agricultural workers have been excluded from the ambit of this Bill. This follows a line of policy which we have had recently because agriculture was excluded from the NIEC. Agricultural workers should not be looked upon as a separate entity.  As Deputy Tully said, we divide workers into two categories, agricultural workers and other workers.  I do not agree that the Agricultural Wages Board should be left under the control of the Minister for Agriculture.</P>

      <P>I was merely commenting on what other speakers <Col N="1672" /> had said before me.  However, I welcome this proposal to establish a Minister for Labour, particularly as I come from a constituency which has a large labour force and is on the fringe of the Shannon Industrial Estate which has evolved and created many special economic and social problems.  I am convinced that the success of this new Ministry will be determined to a large extent by the economic policy of the Government. Unless there is a drastic re-appraisal of the aims, objectives and methods of the Second Programme for Economic Expansion, the new Minister, unless he possesses a magic wand, will not be able to achieve a lot.  We will have to have a proper approach to economic development and planning before we can have a proper labour policy.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach is a past master at saying nothing. I suppose to be a really successful politician, one ought to be able to stand up on practically every occasion and say nothing.  I must congratulate him in that regard.  In effect, what he said was that he was going to set up a Ministry of Labour, that conditions today were changing, but he did not give us any idea as to what the function of the Minister for Labour was to be, other than, as far as I can make out, that he is to take over some duties of the Minister for Social Welfare. The Taoiseach made a lot of woolly, meandering statements of the type he has been making recently in this House in regard to what should be done and should not be done, but as Head of the Government, he did not tell the House what proposals he has to enable this new Minister to restore harmony in industrial relations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To put it at its mildest, everybody must accept the fact that industrial relations are not happy today.  We have had more stoppages by reason of <Col N="1673" /> labour disputes in the past 12 months than we had in the four or five year period before that.  One must come to the conclusion that the formation of a Ministry of Labour was to give some new fillip to industrial relations.  As I said, the Taoiseach has spoken on the introduction of this Bill and again in his closing speech&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Second Stage.  He will have the opportunity of telling us exactly what this Ministry of Labour means, whether it is just another Fianna Fáil red herring or not.  Of course the Taoiseach covered himself in his opening statement when he attacked both Opposition Parties for daring to oppose anything the Fianna Fáil Party do.  The Opposition are expected to sit mute and agree that everything in the garden is lovely, that economic progress is terrific and that even though our balance of payments has gone haywire, it does not matter.  We are to agree heartily with everything he says but, as I say, what the Taoiseach has said is nothing and he has said nothing in his recent speeches in Dáil Éireann.</P>
      <P>I suggest that the present system of dealing with industrial relations is not the best.  I have a very high regard for civil servants but their training makes them extra cautious and they do not have the same contact with the ordinary public as other individuals have.  That is one of the points in a democracy, in electing parliamentary representatives, that they know what is going on in the minds of the people.  The civil servant works in an office on statistics and economics and tenders advice to the Minister.  The success or failure of a democratic Government lies in whether they are able to assess that advice to the best advantage of the country as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our method of settling industrial disputes is to refer them to the Labour Court.  I think the Taoiseach will go all the way with me on that.  That is the only machinery we have.  Apparently, Ministers do not intervene here.  They do in Northern Ireland and they did it with some success in the bank strike. <Col N="1674" /> For some unknown reason, Ministers in the South do not intervene, although everybody would like to see the bank strike ended.</P>
    <P>I agree that the Labour Court has settled some industrial disputes but it has failed in a great many cases. This Court consists almost entirely of civil servants.  To a certain extent, civil servants are servants of the Government, or they are supposed to be, so it is natural that they may not feel entirely free to negotiate on a free basis at all times without reference to the official line here.  The point I am making is that if the Taoiseach and the Government want happy industrial relations, they will have to create a new Labour Court and go entirely outside the existing court.</P>
    <P>In my opinion, it would pay this country well to set up a body of representatives who understand human nature, who are conversant with daily affairs, to adjudicate on industrial disputes in the future.  If the Government are not prepared to do that, I do not see any end to existing conditions. If the Taoiseach favourably considers this suggestion to set up such a body&mdash;and perhaps when he is replying he will give us the information we have been waiting for&mdash; I suggest he does not appoint a High Court judge or a Supreme Court judge or any member of the judiciary to that body because I do not think they are the sort of people in a position to adjudicate properly on such matters They may be very good in the courts in relation to the facts put before them by learned counsel but what we want in our labour relations is a human approach.</P>
    <P>We are all in this: everyone is affected by a strike.  That was highlighted by the ESB stoppage which threatened to paralyse the industrial life of the country.  I suggest that the Taoiseach take his courage in his hands and tell the country and, in particular, the Dáil, what his plans are.  This is the place in which to give that information and not outside at a dinner party or during a tour of the country.  If the Taoiseach accepts my suggestion and appoints five people, perhaps, to adjudicate in industrial <Col N="1675" /> disputes, people experienced in the industrial sphere, the agricultural sphere, and possessed of a certain humanity, he and his Government will make some contribution towards settling the unhappy industrial situation in which we find ourselves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party have in general welcomed the decision to establish a Ministry of Labour under a Minister for Labour.  Naturally some questions were asked as to why there was any need to appoint an extra Minister.  God knows, there are Ministers who have little enough to do.  If we did away with two or three of them, the country would not notice the difference.  However, what we are concerned with is not merely the appointment of a Minister for Labour but rather industrial relations generally, the matter of training facilities, retraining and other matters referred to by the Taoiseach in his opening speech.</P>
      <P>I was rather concerned by the last speaker's reference to the desirabality of appointing someone to adjudicate.  I should like Fine Gael spokesmen to clarify for me this question of adjudicating in industrial disputes.  The workers do not want arbitration.  They have made that clear time after time. They are quite competent to handle, through their organisations, their own affairs, provided they are given the right encouragement in the right kind of atmosphere, coupled with a proper approach on the part of both the Government and the employers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not so much concerned with the appointment of a Minister for Labour and his functions as I am in regard to the long-term functions in this regard. I should like to know what exactly are the intentions of the Government.  I am not speaking now of the intentions expressed by the Taoiseach because he is capable of expressing many things on different occasions.  What I should like to do is to examine the intentions initially from the point of view of those employed in the Government service, those employed in the Department of Lands, Agriculture and Fisheries, in the Office of Public Works, in the Department of Justice, the Department <Col N="1676" /> of Defence, and so on.  The terms and conditions of these people certainly do not measure up to the highflown sentiments expressed by the Taoiseach when introducing this Bill.  The measure of equity is poor.</P>
    <P>There should be no need for a Minister for Labour to secure reasonable wages and conditions for these workers. I challenge any Minister to defend the rates of wages being paid.  The salaries paid, on the other hand, to secretaries, assistant secretaries, higher civil servants, etc., may not be considered altogether reasonable by some.  It depends on one's point of view. Remembering the wide gulf there is as between the higher civil servants and the ordinary workers, the salaries would appear to some to be too high. That view has been expressed outside this House.  The officials themselves may not regard the salaries as adequate from the point of view of the responsibility of the work they do.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, I challenge the Government, from the Taoiseach down, to defend the rates of wages paid to those in the lower ranks of public employment. I also challenge them to defend the conditions they impose on these people.  Large numbers are still temporary, after long service, with no sick pay and no superannuation.  If the Taoiseach is really serious in his desire to evolve some national machinery in regard to industrial relations, then the first thing he should do is to put his own house in order.  It will not require a Minister for Labour to do that.  I hope the first task the new Minister will shoulder is the remedying of the legitimate grievances of thousands of our fellow citizens.  Many of them are in receipt of less than £10 a week. They work long hours.  There are employees of the Department of Justice working hours far in excess of the hours worked by those employed by the most reactionary employers.  They work over 70 hours a week.  I trust the Minister for Labour will devote some attention to these.</P>
    <P>I was concerned to hear Deputy Esmonde talking about the appointment of five or six men to adjudicate. I do not know whether he means that he and his Party are in favour of arbitration. <Col N="1677" /> There appears to be a growing trend in Government circles towards dealing with disputes by way of arbitration and the acceptance of decisions. In recent years the services of the conciliation officers attached to the Labour Court have been of tremendous value. These officers, with their knowledge of the background and circumstances of disputes, are asked to intervene and try to bring about an acceptable solution. The difficulties have been (a) there are not sufficient of these officers and (b) because of the nature of present arrangements, the officers are only called in at a stage when a dispute has already reached the point of confrontation. If these officers had been available in the earlier stages to have informal discussions with both sides, I have no doubt that quite a number of disputes could have been resolved without reaching the point of confrontation. The difficulty is that these officers are called in to assist at a point where both sides have already taken up an attitude.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect the new Minister for Labour should take into consideration.  In recent years we have had investment in industry in this country by concerns from America, Germany, Japan and so on.  At least a percentage of these investing firms and their representatives had an impression, wherever they got it, that there were two factors favourable to their development in this country.  The first was that there was an adequate supply of labour that could be readily trained because of the intelligence and the ability of the Irish worker to accept the benefits of proper training.  We all agree that factor is there.  Because of the degree of unemployment in this country, there has been such a pool of labour available to outside interests.</P>
    <P>The second factor is this: at least a percentage of those coming here got the impression that there was no necessity for them to recognise the workers' right to join a trade union, engage in trade union activities and have their interests safeguarded by trade unions.  There have been cases in Limerick, Galway, Cavan and elsewhere where foreign managements not only did not welcome workers employed <Col N="1678" /> by them becoming members of their appropriate trade union but over a long period used every possible means to discourage and prevent Irish workers from exercising their right to become members of a trade union and have their trade union negotiate for them and represent them in all things. If the new Minister for Labour does nothing else, he should make it clear to anyone coming from abroad to establish any kind of undertaking here that the workers of this country are entitled to join a trade union and that in no circumstances should an employer interfere with their right in that regard.  He should make it clear that he would recommend to the Minister for Industry and Commerce that no public funds would be available to any employer to deprive an Irish citizen of his right to join a trade union.</P>
    <P>I understand the Taoiseach has again indicated that agricultural labourers should not be included as coming within the scope of this new Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already told the Deputy that this is the Fifth Stage of the Bill and only what is in the Bill may be discussed. The Deputy says the agricultural labourer is not included.  Therefore, he is cutting himself out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not use the term &ldquo;agricultural labourer&rdquo; again. This Bill should apply to all workers. That term should be an all-embracing one.  The word &ldquo;worker&rdquo; is not confined to industrial workers, manual workers, clerical workers, professional workers or other workers who have been the subject of earlier discussion. It is to be hoped that the new Minister for Labour will try to ensure that no workers of any kind are paid miserable, starvation rates of wages.  There are certain sections of workers in this country, who, by direction of the Ceann Comhairle, shall remain nameless at this stage, in receipt of wages which are not sufficient to meet the normal needs of workers to provide for themselves and their families.  The machinery available to these workers has not been such as to make it possible for them to secure the normal <Col N="1679" /> average rates of wages, hours of work and proper conditions of employment.</P>
      <P>Having regard to that, it is only logical that unless there is a change of heart on the part of Ministers and of members of other bodies concerned, all we can do is point out that the Minister for Labour should not be precluded from looking after the basic interests of workers.  Our general attitude to the Bill is that while the establishment of the new Department is welcomed, it still does not mean any specific satisfaction: the appointment of the new Minister and the establishment of the Department do not in themselves mean there will be any improvement.</P>
      <P>There has been emphasis on the number of man-days lost during the past two years because of disputes and we should like to point out as vigorously as possible that the new Minister must, first of all, carry out an exercise in depth into the cause of such disputes. His first exercise should, of course, be an examination into the attitude of the Government during that period.  It is because the Government failed to deal with the pressing economic problems of the country that the situation developed to the point at which workers had to seek compensation for the continued increase in the cost of living.  The workers' efforts have been resisted continuously and unjustly. The situation developed to the point where the workers were forced to resort to the only weapon left to them.</P>
      <P>By and large, workers in this country have a mature approach to their problems and none of them wishes to reduce his average industrial wage of £10 or £11 a week to the payment given by his union during a dispute. No man with a wife and one or two children wishes, through involvement in a dispute, to cut down still further the low standard of living currently being enjoyed by his wife and family. Workers do not engage in strikes just for the fun of the thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, the new Minister must, first of all, engage in an exercise in depth, into the approach of the Government Departments to the problems <Col N="1680" /> of the lower-paid State and semi-State employees.  He must then carry out an exercise in depth into the reasons for the disputes that have been occurring. If he does this, he may be of some benefit to the community.</P>
    <P>We on this side of the House are disappointed that at a time when the term &ldquo;productivity&rdquo; is on the lips of everyone, the efforts of employers are aimed at producing the same or even more with the employment of less labour.  The aim in productivity improvement is to reduce the unit cost and the main aim in many cases in this country is to ensure that the same number of employees, or fewer, produce more goods.  Given sufficiently high productivity, employment may be maintained or slightly increased but we must realise that the productivity of each worker concerned has increased. It is therefore disappointing to us in the Labour Party that the Government have not shown an example of increased productivity by having the work of Government carried on by fewer Ministers.  In fact they are increasing the number of Ministers.  Let the NIEC, who have made so many pronouncements on productivity, have a work study carried out on the efforts of Ministers and on the need for the number of Ministers we now have. While we welcome the appointment of the Minister for Labour, we recommend very strongly to the Taoiseach that he should consider calling in work study experts to examine the productivity of his Ministers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not be very long on this but I feel I should say something about this important matter.  As has already been said, the Labour Party and the trade unions welcome the setting up of a Department of Labour and its establishment is an admission at last that the Irish Congress of Trade Unions have been right all along.  It can truly be said that many of our labour disputes can be traced to the absence of a Minister for Labour.  There have been disputes coming within the ambit of Departments of Government and when trade unionists tried to get the Minister responsible for such Departments to <Col N="1681" /> take an interest in them, they were told that the Minister had no authority to deal with them.</P>
      <P>When the Taoiseach was introducing the legislation for the setting up of this new Ministry, I understood him to say that he would like to see a situation come about in which Ministers in their various Departments would not be completely tied to their desks in their Departments and would have more freedom of action.  I trust that as a result of the establishment of this Ministry of Labour, the many Government Departments that have to deal with labour matters will bring about a situation in which the new Minister for Labour will look after labour matters in those Departments. I have in mind the possibility that the new Minister will have a look at the antiquated machinery that exists in those Departments as far as labour disputes are concerned.</P>
      <P>I can recall my own experience as a trade union official in trying to make an approach to these Departments in regard to wages and conditions.  That experience was most frustrating.  That can be said of the Board of Works, the Department of Local Government, the local authorities, and the ESB.  At one time I was chairman of the ESB manual group of workers and the approach of the management to questions of wages and conditions was most archaic.  There was no way of getting at the people charged with responsibility for negotiations in labour matters.  They were not prepared to talk because, at the back of their minds, they always felt that it would end up at the tribunal in any case. This is all wrong.  If you cannot get officials of State and semi-State bodies to sit down and talk, you are not likely to get private employers to do so.  The cause of the difficulty may be the inexperience of those charged with the responsibility of negotiating with trade unions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure that a close look will be taken at all these matters when the new industrial relations legislation comes before the House and I trust that a serious review will be undertaken of the Labour Court and its operation.  Whilst the Labour Court <Col N="1682" /> has been in existence for a long number of years, the number of conciliation officers in that court has not increased very greatly.  There were four at the time it was established and now there are six, six men to deal with a considerable number of unions and a considerable number of employers.  Is is any wonder that when we go to the Labour Court, we find that there is a queue?  Perhaps this is one of the reasons which prompted the Taoiseach to establish this new office.</P>
    <P>The new Minister should make sure that in appointing conciliation officers to the Labour Court they will be given every opportunity to get to know their job.  The system of appointment at the moment leaves a lot to be desired and we find that when these conciliation officers get to know their job, they are shifted to some other post.  There is a great need for these men being given an opportunity to see how the job is done, perhaps even in other countries. We must marvel at the success that has been achieved by some of the conciliation officers when we take into consideration the many problems that have been thrust on the Labour Court. The job of work done by them is commendable.  If we ensure that they are not overloaded with work, we will obtain satisfactory results in the industrial field.</P>
    <P>I would also hope that the new Minister would not only be responsible for trying to keep the peace and improving productivity but would also be charged with having a look at the minimum rates of pay.  There are thousands of people in this country in receipt of less than £10 a week.  I know of people who are in receipt of only £7 10., £8 and £9 per week.  This is all wrong and it is time to have something done about it.  At the moment it is impossible to make any progress for we find one local authority waiting for another to make up its mind.  This alone is a good reason for the establishment of a Ministry of Labour and we hope that when he gets down to his job, the Minister will set up suitable negotiating machinery affecting all types of workers.</P>
    <P>People will have to take an interest <Col N="1683" /> and display confidence in the usefulness of the reorganised Labour Court. The Government will have to be extremely careful and the Minister concerned will also have to be careful to ensure that he is not taking one side as against the other.  There is no doubt that the Taoiseach in his speech last week appeared publicly anyhow to be talking down to the trade unions.  That is the way it is looking anyway.  Perhaps the time has come for the Taoiseach to talk seriously to employers. If this country at the present time is going through a bad period, surely the people who can make the sacrifices can be called on to make them.  Surely there is nothing wrong in asking employers to curtail their profits.  They owe it to the nation because they have been having it easy for too long.</P>
    <P>I would also like the Taoiseach to take a lesson from what he and other Ministers experienced when they stood up in this House and indicated that there should be only a three per cent increase in wages.  This resulted in frustration for everyone.  As from the time that statement was made, the employers took a stand.  Attempts were made then to try to bring both parties together but the talks were beaten before they started.  This again I say will be the function in the future of the Minister for Labour.  The Minister undoubtedly will be charged with responsibility for bringing both parties together with a view to having them, if at all possible, agree on a round of increases but we should not start beating people's chances to bring about settlements before talks start.  That type of attitude should cease.</P>
    <P>Having regard to what my colleague, Deputy Larkin, said, I think we should bear in mind the importance of not seeking to advertise this country as an undeveloped nation and giving industrialists outside the idea that they can come here and obtain cheap labour. This undoubtedly has happened in many schemes, particularly down in Shannon.  You have people coming to Shannon in the belief that they can get away with paying workers with buttons.  They could not understand when they found that this country was <Col N="1684" /> reasonably organised trade unionwise. They went off again just because they found that our people were not prepared to work for buttons.</P>
    <P>I feel also we should bear the thought in mind, when we come to the appointment of more people to the Labour Court and extending the size of the Court, the importance of ensuring, whether they come from the trade union side or the employers' side as members of the Labour Court, that they have a knowledge of industrial relations, that they have a knowledge of negotiations.  I trust the Minister for Labour, whoever he may be, will succeed in his endeavours.  Unfortunately, we are not in a position to know who he will be.  This matter is so important that we should know who is to be the Minister for Labour. I do not know whether we will be afforded an opportunity of commenting on whether or not the person concerned is a fit and suitable person to act as Minister for Labour.  The job itself calls for somebody who knows and is well versed in labour negotiating machinery.  I sincerely hope that we do not get somebody who is not so versed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are four matters that were mentioned in the course of this discussion, on the Final Stage of the Bill, to which I want to refer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First of all, as regards the Agricultural Wages Act, the decision that the responsibility for the administration of this Act should not be transferred to the Minister for Labour is open to reconsideration at some future time.  It seems to us that there are aspects of that decision which would require much greater consideration than it would be possible to give it now. Deputy Tully, I think, misunderstood the effect of that decision.  It is not intended that the Minister for Labour will not have responsibility for quite a number of other matters that will affect agricultural workers, including the specific matter he mentioned, the retraining of those who wish to leave agriculture for other types of employment. He was, I think, quite unfair in his reference to the work of the Agricultural Wages Board.  The outstanding <Col N="1685" /> feature in our wages statistics since the Agricultural Wages Board was established is that the wages of agricultural workers have been increasing percentagewise far more rapidly than of any other category in the community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>That is because agricultural workers are paid with buttons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On the contrary; it was because the Government realised that there was a situation regarding agricultural workers which justified it that the legislation to establish minimum rates of wages for agricultural workers was enacted.  I am saying that legislation has had the effect of giving agricultural workers a more extensive and continuing improvement of wages than any other category of workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the many suggestions that were made here in relation to the composition and functions of the Labour Court, these will arise in connection with legislation for amending the Industrial Relations Act which has been given its First Reading and which will come before the Dáil in the autumn session.  I do not wish to refer to these suggestions now because they will be far more relevant to that legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Corish referred to Dr. C.S. Andrews and to remarks concerning him that were made in this Dáil for the purpose of emphasising that they were not made, as far as he was concerned, by way of personal animosity to Dr. Andrews.  May I say straight away that I was very much concerned about these remarks, not because of any hurt to Dr. Andrews' feelings but because of their implications with regard to the continuing and successful operation of our socialised industries here?  We have set up a number of socialised concerns, State boards, to carry on important public services and commercial undertakings. If they are to succeed and if this association of public with private enterprise in our Irish economy is to succeed, we must be able to attract into <Col N="1686" /> the service of these concerns, into their top management people of the highest possible quality and we must be able to keep them there.  I do not think we can attract them or keep them unless we are prepared to pay to those in top management salaries equivalent to those which they could hope to get in private enterprise of the same size, and there are not many private undertakings of that size.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not apply to the Taoiseach.  He should be paid for his work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Not alone must we be prepared to pay these men the salaries they would otherwise secure from private industry but we must also, those of us who are concerned with the successful operation of these undertakings, keep them immune from the type of personal attacks Deputies sometimes engage in.  This also will be a very serious deterrent in getting into the service of those companies the men who are required and that was the reason for my concern about certain statements that were made in recent times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>They get twice as much as the Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dillon spoke about inflation raging in the country.  I do not know why he makes those statements.  The fact is that none of our economic indicators at the present time justifies the statement that inflation is raging in the country if, by inflation, is meant excessive demand attributable to the accelerating circulation of money.  The fact is that the level of retail sales in this year is rising much more slowly than in previous years, the balance of payments deficit is contracting, and bank deposits are rising.  These are not signs of inflation raging.  They are an indication of the success of the Government's measures to keep inflation under control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have the situation where prices are being pushed up by rising costs due to wages rising more rapidly than productivity.  If we could get a situation of relative stability in respect of wages, then we could hope with a <Col N="1687" /> reasonable expectation of realising it, that productivity will again improve to overtake these higher wages.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter I want to refer to.  Deputy Dillon referred to what I said yesterday regarding the dispute in the Irish paper mills.  I want to say that I am informed that real negotiations are now in progress in regard to that dispute and we can hope the outcome will be its termination.  But I referred to it merely to identify for the Dáil and those who are concerned with industrial relations matters outside the Dáil a possible kind of problem we may have to contend with some time, the possibility of the intractable strike, not a strike that would go on for ever but a strike that would go on for so long that the employer would find that he had no business to recover when it came to an end and the workers would find, perhaps, that they had no jobs to go back to.</P>
    <P>This may be a theoretical situation but if that situation ever arose&mdash;and I am not presuming to say whose job it would be to decide that negotiations are not likely to produce a settlement&mdash; something must be done by somebody, either by the Congress of Trade Unions acting on the unions, by the Federated Union of Employers acting on the employer, either to bring about effective and realistic negotiations or to get their common consent to submit the issues in dispute to the judgment of the Labour Court and to accept that judgment.</P>
    <P>This is a theoretical situation which may never arise, but if it does arise in future, we will at least have a Minister for Labour who will be able to give it some specialist attention and to explore ideas as to what can be done about it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully very rightly pointed out that there are many aspects of our industrial relations situation in which there are irrational procedures and anomalies of one kind and another which are productive of difficulties.  I am quite certain that not all of these will be put right by any Minister for Labour, no matter how energetic or competent he may be, but I hope his appointment will mean that we will <Col N="1688" /> start the process of putting them right and, even though new difficulties may emerge, at least some old difficulties may be removed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I made reference to the fact that State employees, manual workers, have no tribunal to which we can refer their cases.  Would the Taoiseach consider that the time is ripe to give them such a tribunal or to put them under the Labour Court?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <P>The point I was trying to make is that the Labour Court was set up to handle disputes arising in industry.  Its personnel were selected because of their acquaintance with the character of disputes arising in industry.  When there was legislation introduced here to give local authority employees the right to go to the Court, I pointed out that this was not a court that had any particular competence to deal with the problems arising in local authority employment and that would apply also to agricultural workers.  If there is to be a Labour Court operating for agricultural or local authority employees or Government employees, it has to be, perhaps, slightly different in form but certainly different in personnel from the Court that now deals with industrial disputes.</P>

      <P>Deputy Sweetman has brought to my notice a case of a widow in Naas whose husband was employed for his working lifetime by the local authority there.  He retired in 1961 and from then until he died last year, he was not making voluntary contributions. I think the position in law as it now stands is that such a widow is precluded from getting a contributory widow's pension because the worker had not the necessary qualifying average contributions of 39 contributions per year in the relevant period.

What I should like the Minister to clarify, if he would be good enough to do so, is, for such purposes will the State take into consideration in this particular case the five years during which the man was not making voluntary contributions or will the average of 48 be calculated up to the date upon which he retired as distinct from the date upon which he died?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If it is calculated up to the date upon which he retired, I would imagine that his widow and very many others will not have any great difficulty in establishing an average of 48 but if a person is required to establish that average over a period which includes five years of retirement, and perhaps more, it will become increasingly difficult, with the advance in the age of the person, for his widow to qualify under the average of 48.  Really the point which is not entirely clear is whether or not the conclusion of the qualifying period is the date on which <Col N="1691" /> a person retires and ceases to make contributions or the date on which a person dies.</P>
    <P>We recently had in this House and in the Seanad weeks of debate on the Social Welfare (Occupational Injuries) Bill.  The Minister has yet to fix a date on which that Act will come into operation. He mentioned in the course of his introduction to this debate that that date will coincide with the dates for other changes which he is making under this Bill.  I plead with the Minister not to delay implementing the provisions of the new Bill which will provide double benefits and more for recipients of workmen's compensation because the present limit of £4 10s is utterly and completely and cruelly inadequate. Unless we remedy that great injustice without delay, workers will have good reason to believe that democracy here is incapable of working in their interest.</P>
    <P>One appreciates that there are difficulties to be overcome in the setting up of the new machinery.  It is our regret in the Fine Gael benches that the increases and benefits were tied to the implementation and setting up of new machinery because we felt that the consequences of tying increased benefits to new machinery would be to have a regrettable delay. We can only hope that delay will be as short as possible and anything the Minister can do to expedite the date of the operation of that Act and the operation of the other benefits of this Bill will be welcomed by us.  I do not know if the Minister will be in a position to state in the course of this debate the date on which this Bill and the Occupational Injuries Bill will come into operation.  We hope he may be able to give us a date before the debate on the Bill concludes.</P>
    <P>We are glad that the Minister is taking the power, which is apparently necessary, to recover from defaulting employers the full value of benefits or assistance given by the State to employees in respect of whom the employers have not made the necessary insurance contributions.  It is regrettable that the State is not as alert or as anxious to recover these payments <Col N="1692" /> as it could be.  It is all very well to say that a worker who has lost his insurance benefit through the default of the employer has the right to proceed against the employer for any loss sustained.  The fact is that the people whom this type of insurance social welfare scheme is intended to benefit are the very people who have not got the means or the capacity to instruct lawyers to institute legal proceedings on their behalf.  There are very many cases in which people go without the statutory benefits to which they are entitled simply because they have not the means or opportunity to institute legal proceedings against defaulting employers.  I should prefer to see the State once and for all taking over this task and with all due expedition ensuring that employers refund to the State the full value of contributory and non-contributory pensions and other benefits or assistance paid.  Then the State could in turn be recouped by the persons who might have received some kind of temporary allowances from the State.</P>
    <P>It is a cause of considerable regret to us in Fine Gael that the £268,000 which the State has saved this year by reason of the new reciprocal agreement between ourselves and Britain has not been ploughed back into our social welfare code for the benefit of recipients. After all, this House has already voted this money to be expended on behalf of the people in receipt of pensions and allowances of one kind or another and it is being mealy-mouthed in the extreme to take this money back and use it in trying to bolster up the rather shaky Exchequer.  This money has already been voted and it is a very small proportion of the total amount spent by the State in social welfare and an even smaller proportion of the amount being spent by the State in all matters.  It is highly desirable that this small pittance should be returned to social welfare funds and distributed in the provision of some small relief for some section of the community.</P>
    <P>I have had occasion before, as the Minister knows, to complain in this House about the archaic system under which we oblige thousands of pensioners and other social welfare recipients in Dublin city to queue up <Col N="1693" /> weekly and monthly to receive old age pensions, contributory and non-contributory, widows' and orphans' allowances, blind pensions and children's allowances.  It seems to be inexcusable that we should oblige mothers of young families to attend in the midst of all their other family problems and tasks at post offices for several hours to collect these measly allowances.  In the suburb of Ballyfermot, where the vast majority of the people have young families and where mothers are obliged to bring their children to school in the mornings and prepare midday meals for them, at the same time looking after younger members of the family, 4,600 such mothers are required to attend every month at their local post office to get their children's allowances.</P>
    <P>The State may argue that it is necessary to have personal attendance for children's allowances in order that identity may be established.  It is quite ludicrous to suggest that any operator in a Dublin suburban post office can possibly know the identity of people attending with their books to collect children's allowances.  It is certainly not possible in a post office where 2,000, 3,000 or 4,000 mothers have to attend to get their children's allowances. I plead with the Minister once again to do away with that utterly unnecessary imposition on recipients of children's allowances and old age pensions. We know for a fact that there are many people who by-pass the local post office in Dublin suburbs and pay the high cost of public transport to the centre of the city in order to avoid queueing for hours at their local post offices.</P>
    <P>The State may say with all accuracy but with little concern for the real, compelling needs of families that there is no need for recipients of children's allowances or pensions to attend on the first day on which the allowance or pension comes due.  There may be no legal obligation to do so but there are many cases of really urgent and compelling need to attend on the first day on which the allowances become available.  Indeed, the Dublin Corporation rent office would be in turmoil if it could not rely on people being paid children's allowances on the first <Col N="1694" /> possible day and in so doing, avoiding the inevitable consequences of eviction for non-payment of rent.  It is difficult to see why the Department of Social Welfare cannot arrange to stagger days on which children's allowances are paid and days on which other allowances are paid.</P>
    <P>If we are to maintain the system of payment through the local post office, it would surely be better to ensure a steady flow of people upon the days recipients of social welfare benefits become entitled to payment for the first time rather than the situation which operates in many Dublin suburbs of having queues of people not only in the post office itself but outside on the pavement.  Some of these people are in such dire financial straits that, notwithstanding the inclemency of the weather or the fact that it may be the day for the payment of children's allowances, they will endure the suffering of standing in the wind and rain and storm, queueing up for hours on end, in order to ensure that they will get payment at the first available opportunity.</P>
    <P>The staggering of days could be related to the alphabetical sequence of the initials of the applicants or it could be arranged that a person could get the children's allowance in monthly instalments which would coincide with the date on which application was originally made.  Several other rules could be applied to ensure that these days would be staggered and the sooner this is done the better.</P>
    <P>There may be Deputies who do not appreciate the gravity of this problem and who may think I am exaggerating. I got these figures last year from the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, which clearly indicate how serious the problem is.  The reference is column 224 of the Official Report of Wednesday, 30th June, 1965.  In Ballyfermot, 4,182 children's allowances are paid on one day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>That is Deputy Seán Dunne's constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is mine, too.  Deputy Dunne does not maintain the whole of the Ballyfermot area under his wing.  In Crumlin, 2,380 children's <Col N="1695" /> allowances are paid on the one day and in another post office there the number is 1,610.  But the total allowances paid there on some days, if you coincide the payment of old age pensions and widows and orphans' pensions, bring the figures up to 2,694 and 2,697 respectively.  In areas such as Rathmines, where a smaller proportion of children's allowances are paid and a higher proportion of old age pensions are paid, the total works out at much the same, 2,650.</P>
      <P>Does it not concern the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs that the postal service becomes disrupted on the days when pensions and children's allowances are paid, on certain occasions?  I am certain the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs would be quite happy to be relieved of this burden. Why the Department cannot issue payment orders which would be negotiable anywhere is difficult to understand.  The requirement of establishing identity is ludicrous in large urban areas where it is impossible for post offices to establish the identity of the multitudinous applicants who come before them.</P>
      <P>On that score, there was a time, I think, when children's allowance dockets could be cashed by people with bank accounts.  It might be argued that such people should not get children's allowances but this is one of the very few social welfare benefits not subjected to a means test.  So long as they are entitled to it, it is difficult to see why the Department of Social Welfare brought in a prohibition against the cashing of children's allowance vouchers through banks, if only to relieve the pressure on the post offices and also to avoid the obligation of personal attendance at post offices.  I would encourage the Minister to make this small amendment.  I think that, as the years go by, an increasing number of people will have bank accounts and ought to be encouraged to cash their children's allowance dockets there rather than imposing a burden on the unfortunate post office clerks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the midst of all the industrial disputes and talk about industrial disputes which we have had in recent <Col N="1696" /> years, time and again, in this House and elsewhere, protest has been made, and I think justifiably made, about the difficulty of workers in obtaining public assistance when they are on strike or locked out by their employers through no fault of their own.  We have had the Minister for Social Welfare on numerous occasions pretending here that no difficulty whatsoever arises in paying public assistance or other benefit to people who are locked out so long as they can establish entitlement to it.  The fact is that every possible obstacle is put in the way of people who are locked out in industrial disputes to prevent them and their families from getting very urgently-needed public assistance.  This has been called, and I think not incorrectly, the punishment of innocent workers.  Apparently it is felt in the Department of Social Welfare that the innocent should suffer.</P>
    <P>It is common case that workers do not welcome strikes.  They are the people who suffer most in industrial disputes and they are the people who have not put a bit aside for the rainy day.  A person on strike, with the approval of his trade union, will receive what may in fact be, and is in most cases, a totally inadequate weekly sum but the unfortunate person locked out may, in some cases, not receive any kind of allowance from his trade union. The erection of a series of barriers and obstacles and personal indignities against people who are involved in industrial disputes, particularly in lockouts, is something we should disturb our conscience about and we should see to it that we ease the burden of these people.  Their anxieties and sufferings are already great.  We should not add to them by imposing all kinds of indignities and unfair obstacles when they apply for necessary assistance for themselves and their families.</P>
    <P>On Tuesday, 28th June, 1966, I addressed a question to the Minister for Social Welfare in regard to the amount of income precluded from being taken into account in the granting of home assistance.  I asked him to state the authority for it and the date of the fixing of the amount.  The Minister told us that in granting home assistance, non-contributory widows' <Col N="1697" /> pension or children's allowance may be taken into account only in so far as each exceeds 10/- a week.  He told us that an excess of 10/- a week was fixed by the Social Welfare Act 1948&mdash;18 years ago&mdash;and in respect of pensions and children's allowances, it was fixed in 1952.  Quite clearly, if there is any purpose in this, it is to allow applicants what is regarded as some miserable minimum.  If that figure were 10/- in 1948 and 1952, and if it has any relevance to those things, it clearly has no relevance to the requirements of people in 1966.</P>
    <P>I think I gleaned from the Minister's remarks and from his reply to supplementary questions that he is a bit bewildered at the existence of this particular requirement at all.  He points out rightly that in assessing need for home assistance, the critical matter is the need of an applicant and not what public assistance a person may already be receiving.  It is a question of the comprehensive need of a particular applicant.  This artificial figure should not have any bearing upon the assessment of whether or not a person is or is not in need of the pauper relief which we call home assistance.  If that is the Minister's private and personal view, I would ask him to take an opportunity in this Bill to bring in the necessary amendment to do away with this 10/- altogether.  If, on the other hand, it is thought necessary in justice to the recipients of home assistance to keep a minimum figure of this particular kind on the statute book, then, clearly, the least we can do now, to make the figure relevant in 1966, is to quadruple the figure and to put it at a minimum of £2. Either course is clearly necessary and I think I am not misinterpreting the Minister's attitude in the matter when I say he has a certain sympathy with the view I am expressing.</P>

      <P>I understand that the closing date for applications for the Autumn competitions, which this year is 17th August, is fixed by reference to the deadline set by the United States authorities for the receipt of particulars of successful candidates and the courses they wish to pursue in the United States.</P>
      <P>The selection process must often be completed before the results of the University honours degree examinations are available in order that places can be arranged for successful candidates in American academic institutions in the following Autumn.

      <P>The financial position of the B &amp; I Company was very fully explained in the chairman's address to the recent annual general meeting, which received wide publicity in the public press.  As explained by the chairman, the company's loss in the year <Col N="1701" /> ended 31st December, 1965, was due to increases in overheads and direct labour costs, coupled with a decrease in earning from livestock, conventional goods and passengers in circumstances outside the company's control.  The company has reorganised and strengthened the management structure and has under active review passenger and car transport and the rationalisation of livestock traffic.  The company's unit load carryings increased by 50 per cent in 1965 and a further increase of 50 per cent is expected in 1966.</P>
      <P>The Board of the company has set itself profit targets for future years.  It expects to make a profit in the current year and to improve the profit position in succeeding years.</P>
      <P>I am confident that the vigorous steps taken by the Board will lead to more profitable operations in future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only be reasonably optimistic, but the Deputy will appreciate that the Board took over in March, 1965 and it took some time for them to understand the operation of the company and to appoint new staff and undertake the most modern type of investigations and engage in sales and development work on a modern pattern.  They have not had very long, certainly in the case of the shipping company, to make their final plans.  In the meantime, as the Deputy knows, cross-Channel traffic is very rapidly changing to that carried by unit loads.  For example, the kind of problem they have to face is that the actual realisation per ton for freight is about the same as it was in 1960, even though regular freight charges have increased since that time, and that because of the very dramatic change from carrying goods loose to carrying them in containers, the Board entered into a transitional period in the case of a company which has <Col N="1702" /> carried up to now a great deal of general traffic.  I hope that they will be able to rationalise and improve their methods of operation so that they will have a profit in the future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister's reply not suggest that the directors of the B. &amp; I. are a bunch of greenhorns who know nothing about shipping and have to learn the job to make the company pay?  That would rather arise from the Minister's reply because heretofore the company was paying quite well.  Is he satisfied that the directors are the right men for the job?</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose taking Questions Nos. 4 and 5 together.</P>
      <P>Under the legal arrangements which have operated up to the present time cross-Border haulage of goods for reward was confined on the one part to the Ulster Transport Authority and on the other part to CIE, the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway Co. and the County Donegal Railways Joint Committee.</P>
      <P>The Government have had the position in respect of this traffic under consideration in the light of the enactment of amending road transport legislation in Northern Ireland which, among other things, provides for the dismantling of the UTA monopoly and the licensing of individual hauliers.</P>
      <P>The Government, having had regard to representations by licensed hauliers in the State and bearing in mind the desirability of achieving the maximum possible measure of improvement in trade and commercial relations with Northern Ireland, have decided that the licensed hauliers should, subject to the limitations of their licences, be facilitated in participating in this traffic.</P>
      <P>This means that licensed hauliers in the State whose areas of operation are contiguous to the Border and who wish to participate in this traffic may apply to the Ministry of Development, Belfast, for the grant of licences. Similarly hauliers licensed in Northern Ireland may apply to my Department for licences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1704" /> Licences granted would not, however, authorise a haulier from one area to engage in point-to-point haulage in the other area.  Hauliers must furnish such traffic records as may be required by the terms of the licences granted.</P>
    <P>These arrangements are being introduced on an experimental and administrative basis.  They will be subject to continuous review and to a formal review at the end of 12 months when the position will be reconsidered as necessary in the light of experience.</P>

    <P>In 1961 an area of 8¾ acres at Castlelough, along the shore of Lough Derg, was allotted by the Land Commission to the Trustees of the Portroe Branch of Muintir na Tíre for the preservation of boating and bathing facilities for the public.  This plot was fenced, in part, from the adjoining <Col N="1708" /> lands but I am informed that it gives adequate access to the lake for the public.  Other parts of this estate between the shore road and the lake were included in various other allotments. As far as the Land Commission are aware, there has been no encroachment on this allotment to Muintir na Tíre either by sale of part of it or by the erection of unauthorised fences.</P>
    <P>On the general subject of access to beaches and other places of recreational resort, I would refer the Deputy to the replies given to Questions on 15th February and 23rd March last by the Minister for Local Government. The preservation of amenities is primarily a matter for the Planning Authorities under the provisions of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963.</P>

      <P>The defendant in question was convicted in the Dublin Circuit Court in 1946 on a number of counts including robbery and housebreaking and was sentenced to three years penal servitude. He did not appeal against conviction or sentence.</P>
      <P>It is well settled that a free pardon is granted only for the purpose of proclaiming the innocence of a person who has been wrongly convicted and that an application for the grant of a free pardon ought not to be entertained unless there is some good ground for thinking that there has been a miscarriage of justice.  In my considered view, there is no such ground in this case.</P>

      <P>The Minister is aware that this gentleman was convicted on evidence which <i>inter alia</i> included the evidence of a convicted criminal and that recently he applied to the Supreme Court for an extension of the time to appeal?  This application was refused on the grounds that he had not brought it within a reasonable time.  An explanation was given to the courts that efforts were being made by this convicted person to have the matter reopened at departmental level.  Having regard to the fact that many police officers involved have now retired and that this man has persisted for over 20 years in proclaiming his innocence and in saying that he was wrongly convicted, would the Minister not think that some sort of inquiries should be conducted into the matter?  It is most unusual for a person to persist in saying that he was wrongly convicted for so long a period.</P>

      <P>The Government's views on promotions of this kind were made known by me in a public statement issued to the press, radio and television on 6th May, 1965, when a report appeared in a cross-Channel newspaper that arrangements were being made for the establishment of a <Col N="1717" /> gambling club in Dublin.  My statement indicated not only that such promotions would appear to contravene the Gaming and Lotteries Act, 1956, but also that the Government would not tolerate the establishment of any gaming club that might find a loophole in the law and that amending legislation would be introduced, if necessary, to prevent its establishment.</P>
      <P>Later, inquiries privately addressed to my Department by persons interested in the promotion of gambling clubs in different parts of the country were answered similarly.</P>
      <P>On 5th February last it was reported in the daily press that an application had been made in the Dublin Circuit Court with a view to the grant of a certificate under the Registration of Clubs Acts which would permit a body known as the Irish Sporting Club to have a premises in Merrion Square registered as a suitable premises in which intoxicating liquor could be sold.  The newspaper reports indicated that the club would be used for gambling by members.  On that occasion I had the solicitor for the promoters of the club warned by the Garda of the Government's views, and a copy of the official notice of 6th May, 1965, was given to him.</P>
      <P>My attention has now been drawn to newspaper reports of last Saturday to the effect that circulars are being issued by the management of the Irish Sporting Club inviting several hundred persons to become members of a club in which gambling would be carried on, on payment of a subscription of five guineas each.</P>
      <P>I can only repeat that the establishment of such a gambling club will not be tolerated and that, if necessary, legislation will be enacted to prevent it.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health the number of places <Col N="1721" /> where fluoridation of water is taking place at the present time; what is the position in regard to the remainder of the country; if tenders have been invited; and, if so, when they will be accepted.</P>

      <P>Eleven public water supplies, serving 912,000 persons out of an approximate total of 1,550,000 people on piped water supplies, are fluoridated at present and two other supplies, serving 41,000 persons, are expected to be fluoridated within the next few weeks.</P>
      <P>Tenders for the supply and installation of fluoridation equipment at six supplies have recently been approved by the Minister for Local Government and tenders have been sought by local authorities in respect of 27 other supplies.  A number of the latter tenders have already been submitted to the Minister for Local Government for his covering sanction to their acceptance.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister not aware that certain local authorities inserted advertisements in newspapers asking for tenders for these works as far back as September, 1965, and that nothing further was heard up to last week?  Since that time, certain changes in design and equipment have taken place which would enable the work to be carried out more efficiently and at a much lower cost.  Does the Minister intend to sanction these tenders or what does he propose to do about this?</P>

Ballinasloe asked on 10/1/'66 and the tenders have not been sanctioned.  Longford asked on 24/2/'66.  Does the Minister believe it right for a public authority to ask for tenders, get people sufficiently interested to submit tenders and then leave them waiting six or eight months in the dark?  Is it the Minister's intention to sanction cases, some of which have been outstanding for nine months?  Is it due to shortage of money, or what, that they have not been sanctioned?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will ensure that dispensary doctors, including doctors attending TB clinics, will issue certificates or letters to patients on request for the purpose of seeking priority on local authorities' housing lists because of their illness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The regulations governing the letting of local authority houses are primarily a matter for the Minister for Local Government.  However, I can tell the Deputy that under the regulations, a housing authority is required to obtain, and have regard to, a report and recommendation from the chief medical officer for the purpose of determining priority for tenancies of local authority houses.  For this purpose, the chief medical officer must acquaint himself with the family circumstances of applicants and must, in accordance with the regulations, give due weight to cases where one or more members of the family are suffering from tuberculosis.  To oblige dispensary and other local authority doctors to issue certificates or letters to patients, as suggested, would add to their duties without serving any useful purpose, inasmuch as the chief medical officer is in a position to obtain from these doctors any relevant certificate he may require for this purpose.</P>
      <P>If the Deputy has some specific difficulty in mind, I shall, if he will be so good as to furnish particulars to me, have the matter examined, in so far as I may have any function in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not appreciate and agree that considerable delay is caused where a patient, particularly a TB patient, who would get priority for a local authority house, is refused at the clinic a certificate to the effect that he is attending the clinic and is suffering from TB? Considerable delay is caused.  He has to communicate with the local authority and with the doctor and wait for an answer Would it not short circuit the procedure and serve a very useful <Col N="1724" /> purpose if the certificates were issued on request?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that some applicants for houses bring along a certificate from their own doctor or dispensary doctor but it does not in any way speed up the possibility of granting them a house.  The chief medical officer is well aware of the number of tubercular patients in the area over which he has jurisdiction and I am absolutely satisfied that the suggestion made by the Deputy would not speed up the process of giving these people a house. The Deputy will be further aware that under the Housing Bill which is almost law there are certain changes whereby the determining priorities are established. It says, for instance, that the housing authority shall obtain and have regard to a report from their chief medical officer.  This would have to happen in every case.  Finally, I should like to point out that in the case of a tubercular patient the doctor, for instance, in the sanatorium within the health authority area automatically informs the chief medical officer who has to be consulted by the city or county manager before a house is allocated.  To sum up, I am satisfied, and I think the Deputy will be, that the position is quite satisfactory.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not agree that the chief medical officer in the city of Dublin cannot adjudicate as to whether a person should have priority or not because of an illness if the doctor at the clinic the person is attending will not furnish the information to the chief medical officer? These people cannot produce any evidence that they are suffering from TB.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to point out that a district medical officer or dispensary doctor as we call them, is obliged to give, when required, a written certificate signed by him to the health authority as to the state of health of any patient attended by him and the duties of other local authority doctors are, in general, wide enough to enable such certificates to be obtained from them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>He is not required to furnish it to a patient.  It is not part of his duties to give a patient a certificate. I can assure the Deputy, from personal experience, and I am sure he will bear me out, that it does not get a house for such individual any quicker to have a document from a dispensary doctor because, I can assure him again, the chief medical officer is quite conversant with the health of the person, particularly of tubercular patients.  Also, the Deputy must be aware that when a person fills up an application form for a house, before the city or county manager will allocate a house, the health inspector must submit a report and, as we all know, health inspectors call and make a report in each case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Minister that the system he has in mind does not operate in the city of Dublin and unless a certificate from a medical gentleman is submitted to the housing authority, no priority will be given, irrespective of the illness the person may, in fact, be suffering from.  These people cannot get such a certificate from the dispensary, particularly in Charles Street, for instance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I announced last year that I had decided to discontinue publication of the annual report in its present format, that in future the statistical tables, which have hitherto appeared as Appendices to the Report, would be issued annually as a separate publication and that a report on progress and developments in the field of education generally would be published at intervals of three years.  It is intended that these triennial reports on progress and developments will contain information, as may be appropriate, on developments in all aspects of education including some which have not been covered in the Department's annual reports hitherto.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister appreciate that one difficulty at the moment in talking about matters educational is that we do not have anything approximating to an annual report on the actual educational position in the country, that at the moment in connection with the statistics relating to education, there is a backlog of years not covered?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Part of the delay in producing the report in the past has been due to difficulties in obtaining statistics which we will have to overcome and I think we have made some progress, but part has been due to the preparation of a more general report. For the report to be valuable it would be better to have it at an interval.  We decided that three years <Col N="1727" /> was the most appropriate but I am conscious of the fact that statistics have been delayed and it is because of that that I am making these arrangements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education if he is aware of dissatisfaction amongst teachers and candidates with the honours mathematics papers in this year's intermediate examination caused by the considerable variation between the standard of the sample papers issued to schools by his Department and the actual examination papers; and if steps will be taken to give due allowance to candidates in respect of this difficulty, particularly in view of the fact that these were the first tests in the new mathematics courses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the question relates to the leaving certificate and not to the intermediate certificate examination as no sample papers were issued to schools in connection with the intermediate certificate examination.</P>
      <P>In framing the honours leaving certificate papers in mathematics the standard of the sample papers was adhered to as far as could be reasonably expected.  In addition, in the examination papers there was a wider choice of question than in the sample papers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1728" /> A sample analysis of candidates' worked answer books indicates that an appropriate standard has been maintained.</P>
    <P>That the standard of the sample paper was adhered to is evidenced by the fact that very few adverse comments have been received in my Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that many secondary teachers have expressed considerable alarm at the variation between the sample paper and syllabus on the one hand and the examination papers themselves, and not only as to the standard but as to the sequence?  Is he aware that students turned up to sit for examinations in leaving certificate mathematics expecting that in the first paper a certain series of questions would be asked and that in fact the series on the first paper were totally different from what they had been led to expect by the sample papers, causing, perhaps, a certain amount of terror in the minds of candidates? Would the Minister ensure that in future an effort is made to maintain the sequence which people are led to believe will exist in the examination papers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that there has been any widespread dissatisfaction with this paper.  In fact, my Department has received only three complaints and the report from the Association of Secondary Teachers of Ireland has been generally favourable. As I said, the choice given to the candidates was wider than in the sample papers and tests we have made on the written answer books show that the proportion of honours and failures is almost the same as it was last year, so that I do not think there is any validity in the suggestion that students were upset in any way by the form of the paper, which, incidentally, I am not aware, and cannot accept, was of the nature suggested by the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister do <Col N="1729" /> something about improving communications between himself and the teaching profession because the number of complaints I have got exceeds the number he says he has received?

I cannot therefore indicate when tenders may be invited for new vocational schools at these centres.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister not aware that long ago it was decided by the Mayo Vocational Education Committee to build the schools in those areas, that the need for the schools is already there and that the answer the Minister has given does not appear to me to be factual because I know the situation and all the members of the vocational education committee know it?  The only reason I can see is the reason given by the chief executive officer at our last meeting when he said that there was no money available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of what the CEO said at the last meeting but he should be well aware, if the Deputy is not so aware, of the survey that has been going on and of the effects which it has had when it has shown that plans which vocational education committees had adopted and pushed for many years were not now in the best interests of education in the area.  One of the big problems is that plans had been pushed for the building of smaller vocational schools whereas the examination by the Development Branch of my Department into the facilities available in the area and the school-going population revealed clearly in many cases that this is the wrong provision <Col N="1732" /> and that what should be done is that larger schools should be built and some of the smaller ones cut out and the students, if necessary, transported to the larger schools.  As a result we will be able to provide adequately for all the children a wide curriculum.  If we do not do this, we shall find that we have a number of small schools that are able to cater in a very limited way for some students and certainly not able to cater for all the students.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister not aware that invariably it is the Department that has cut down on the size of the schools proposed by the vocational education committee?  I know that is what happened every time we put up plans in County Dublin.  Can the Minister give us any idea when he is likely to reach the end of his consideration of this survey?  Is he doing it region by region and, if so, when will he be in a position to tell any area that they will be able to build a vocational school?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already done so in some cases.  Obviously, you cannot have a survey done all over the country at the same time.  You must do it region by region.  This, in fact, is what has happened.  In a number of areas, we have completed the survey. As a result, vocational schools have been told to go ahead.  In other cases, we had to stop them.  Similarly, in regard to secondary schools, the same considerations apply.  Where, in the past, the Department cut down on vocational schools&mdash;I am aware of some cases where it happened&mdash;the reason was that, at that time, the overall educational plan did not envisage all our children receiving post-primary education.  This envisages a <Col N="1733" /> new approach to the construction of buildings and the serving of the particular areas concerned.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy means has the State paid anything towards the cost of these buildings before the work was commenced or before the repayment of the loan was commenced, the answer is that the State has not done so because the scheme was not so framed.  There are a number of cases where building has taken place under this scheme and where the buildings are at present occupied.  The <Col N="1736" /> only reason a grant has not been paid in these cases is that the managers of these schools have not yet commenced repayment of the loans they have taken on.</P>

I understand it is to protest against the condition of the building, the failure to repair it.  As I explained in my answer, on the basis of the proposal for an amalgamation, this will not arise until the end of school year which is almost finished now.

After very many years of pleading the Minister for Local Government and the Minister for Finance have been able to get away from the archaic restrictions which require that motor cars have to be taxed at the beginning of the year or at the commencement of particular quarters and that they could not be taxed at any other time of the year.  It took many decades to get the Government and their advisers to see that it was possible to do otherwise.  May we hope that it will not take as long to persuade the Minister for Social Welfare and his advisers that we should get away from the artificial restriction of contribution years to these particular months?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1741" /> Why should we get away from them?  We should get away from them for the simple reason that as they operate, some people are required to make not just 156 contributions for a particular purpose but 178, if they happen to be unlucky enough to start in employment at a different period or to be born at a different time of the year.  The present regulations suit only the people who are born and commence work at a time convenient to these particular periods.  I do not know why the Minister cannot amend the law to provide that the contribution years can commence at different times of the year so that if a person is able at any given time to establish the required number of contributions up to the date of application, he should be able to get whatever benefit, allowance or assistance is given.  It is something that is worth considering and if the change is made, as it was in the case of motor taxation, it will be found that the nettle had not got as many stings as was thought it had originally and it would mean a greater share of justice for a greater number of people.</P>
    <P>We have not yet in this year, and correctly so, turned our minds away from the Golden Jubilee of the Easter Rising and the declaration that we as a nation would cherish all the children of the nation equally.  How tragic it is that in this year, far from cherishing our children equally, our social welfare code is such that we give to large numbers of our people insufficient to provide them with a diet which is not deficient.  We give them insufficient for that purpose and we further punish them by giving them an insufficient allowance for clothes and rent and other necessities.  This is not treating the children of this nation equally.  We have a great deal more to do, and perhaps more tax to pay, in order to treat all the children of the nation equally but it is an obligation which we will have to undertake.</P>
    <P>I mentioned yesterday that the tragic thing about this year's Social Welfare Bill is that the benefits will not become payable until 1st November next, although the taxes to pay for these and other improvements will <Col N="1742" /> have been contributed since the beginning of the financial year.  I emphasised that it is ludicrous to suggest that social welfare beneficiaries are not paying their share of taxes. The amount of the increase in social welfare voted this year is negligible and I believe it can be demonstrated that the amount of the increase is much less than the burden in taxation which has to be borne by the hundreds of thousands of people who are in receipt of welfare payments.  It is significant in relation to that, and in relation to the argument that taxation percolates down to even the poorest in the community, that Ireland, with the exception of France, has the highest ratio of indirect taxation to national income.  In fact, one-fifth or 20 per cent&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is from the United Nations Yearbook of National Account Statistics, 1961 and 1962. These figures indicate that the ratio of indirect taxation to national income in Ireland is 20 per cent, in Britain 17, in the Netherlands 12, in Italy, 17, in Germany 18 and in Belgium 12. That is for the year 1960.  I have not got any more recent figures than those. They indicate that here the poorest of the poor, through the system of indirect taxation, are paying a larger proportion of their own benefits than people in other countries This is a very serious matter because it means that not only have we the worst standards in social welfare payments but we also require the poorest of the poor to pay the greatest proportion as compared with the practice in any other country in Western Europe towards the benefits they obtain and towards the whole corpus of national taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is why we have no real equality where the less fortunate amongst us are concerned.  We certainly do not treat all the children of the nation equally and we, on the Fine Gael benches, will continue to fight for a greater degree of social justice here so that in the not too distant future it <Col N="1743" /> can be said with some degree of sincerity that we, as a society, cherish all the children of our nation equally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I was under the impression that the confines of this debate were very limited and, because of that, I propose to deal with the matters contained in the measure before the House.  I shall be as brief as possible.  One would never have thought that the headlines in the evening papers on the day the first Budget was introduced here, saying 5/- increase for pensioners, would turn out to be 5/- per week for a very limited number.  In fact, the increase in pension, as I read it, applies only to those who are destitute.  Who can fit into that category?  I do not know.  I thought I knew until last week when I found the Minister here in the House defending the action of one of his officials who ruled that a woman who had a cottage in which she lived on her own, and a garden which she was unable to till, and out of which she could get no use, had an income of £3 per year. From what the Minister said earlier, I assume now that that lady is not destitute and she will not therefore qualify for the 5/- increase.  That is just one case.  I am sure there are literally hundreds all over the country in the same position.</P>
      <P>While it is a good idea, I suppose, according to the Minister to confine this to those who have nothing, the Minister must, I think, be referring particularly to those who live in rooms in this city and in the big towns because he will catch out nearly everyone else, if he wants to, as being in receipt of an income of some kind. The fact that this increase will not be paid until 1st November next is something that should never have become a practice in this House and it is a practice which should be changed forthwith. It is no answer to say that I belonged to a Government in which the same practice applied.  It has applied apparently all down through the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One thing I can never understand is that civil servants, and others, who get increases in salary never experience <Col N="1744" /> any hesitation on the part of those responsible for paying them in getting those increases backdated not only for a year but, in some cases, for a year and a half while an unfortunate old age pensioner gets 5/- but five months ahead.  I do not say that in denigration of civil servants, and others, but if the principle can be applied to those with substantial incomes, then it should be possible to apply the same principle to those who receive very little.</P>
    <P>There have been a number of changes suggested and I suppose we must be thankful for small mercies.  It is now proposed in certain conditions to allow domestic servants and female agricultural workers to draw unemployment benefit.  But the Minister proposes a qualifying period of ten years in the case of these people.  Would he explain to me why this is being done?  It is a pity he was not in the House this morning when we had a lecture from Deputy Dillon on our classless society. Domestic servants and female agricultural workers earn very small wages and, according to the powers that be, they are in the low-caste category.  Yet, they are told that they will have to wait until they have ten years stamps before they qualify for unemployment benefit.  Anybody else can qualify, if under a certain age, with 26 stamps.  If they are over the age, they can qualify with 156 stamps.</P>
    <P>Surely the Minister will agree it is ridiculous to introduce an entirely new category?  Most young people who take up domestic service and the few who go into agriculture do not as a rule remain, or intend to remain, indefinitely at that particular type of work.  They may get married after five, six, or seven years while still in their early twenties. If they have a spell of unemployment in the meantime, despite the fact that they have paid for their stamps, they will not qualify for unemployment benefit.</P>
    <P>I do not know what mean-minded person thought this up.  I am prepared to say the Minister would not be responsible for doing something like this.  Someone who had domestic service difficulties must have decided that this was one way in which to ensure that <Col N="1745" /> domestic servants would not be able to draw unemployment benefit and would, therefore, have to go around looking for another job, or starve.  That is the position as it stands.  It is just too bad, when the Minister did decide to bring in something, that he should decide it in such a way.  Before the Bill is passed, I would appeal to the Minister to withdraw his ten years qualification and agree that domestic servants and female agricultural workers are human beings and as such entitled to draw unemployment benefit if they qualify for it in the normal way.</P>
    <P>There has been an increase in the stamps.  The percentage increase for voluntary insurance is rather high but there is not much quarrel with it. Insured workers, once they know the money they are paying will go to improve benefits for their fellow workers, never complain, even when a substantial increase, such as the increase of 1/5d per week this year, takes place.  They accept that as necessary.  In the case of domestic servants and female agricultural workers, they will have the name and the Minister will have the gain.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the fact that £268,000 was saved as a result of the British Labour Ministry agreeing, after many years, that those who qualify for pension in Britain and return to this country can continue to get increases in their pensions in the same way as they would, had they elected to continue living in Britain.  We are very glad to know this matter has reached finality and we are very glad to know that such pensioners will at least have parity with those in Britain but we did not know that the Department of Social Welfare proposed to take this £268,000 and put it into their coffers to ensure that these people would be at the loss of the amount of increase in their British pension.  I know the Minister can say that the regulations are there and what applies to one must apply to all.  That may be so.  At the same time, this is a let down which the Minister must feel. After all, we are not so badly off for money that we have to rob to the <Col N="1746" /> extent of £268,000 the &ldquo;kitty&rdquo; of the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>A question that arises again and again is that of those persons who apply for pensions on the grounds that they seek to have their husbands presumed dead.  Maybe many of the husbands would be glad if they were presumed dead.  It seems to me a bit peculiar that somebody who disappears out of the country and is missing for as long as 30 or 35 years cannot be presumed dead and that the unfortunate deserted wife is still left in the position of being a grass-widow and as such has no claim to any benefit from the State.  Perhaps the Minister would look into this.  I want to pay this tribute to him.  In his relatively short time in the Department, he has introduced a number of modifications in the code, some of which, I am sure he will not deny, were suggested from these benches.  But he did at least consider them and have them attended to fairly quickly.  I am grateful to him for that.  This is another matter we feel could be improved upon.</P>
    <P>I wonder whether the Minister has considered the situation when the last Budget was introduced compared with the situation now?  Does he still think that, apart from the group covered by this Bill, other social welfare recipients will be in the same position as they were before the introduction of the first Budget this year?  Surely it must be obvious to him that, although it appeared the cost of living was remaining static for a considerable time, it has now started again on its upward trend and the 3.5 or 3.9 points it had gone up early this year is likely to double before the summer season is out.  Does the Minister not think some effort should be made now to compensate those on fixed incomes who cannot help themselves but who must try to live on what they get from the Department of Social Welfare?  It may cost a lot of money but nobody will deny our first responsibility should be to those who cannot help themselves.</P>
    <P>It often strikes me dealing with trade unionists throughout the country that we do not seem to have the realisation that the worker of today is the pensioner <Col N="1747" /> of tomorrow and that the pensioner of today was the worker of yesterday.  If that could be brought home, we would probably have a different attitude entirely to this whole question of retirement pensions and old age pensions.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ryan referred to the fact that some countries abroad pay very much higher pensions.  One of our troubles here is that our unemployment problem is so great.  If we had full employment &mdash;I hope we will have it some day, although it does not look like it now&mdash; naturally from the income we got from their stamps and employers' stamps, together with what we would save in not having to pay them unemployment benefit and assistance, we would be able to increase very substantially the pensions and benefits other social welfare recipients require.</P>
    <P>One of the things that has surprised me when dealing with non-contributory old age pensions is this.  An estimate is made by the investigating officer of the income of the person.  If that person has earned £300 the previous year, the officer will blandly put down the income as £300.  It requires a lot of explanation to point out to him that, if the person stopped work, naturally the income is not £300.  On one occasion I had the experience of trying to persuade a man who had got it into his head for some peculiar reason that the money the applicant had got the previous year was still in his possession. It was a considerable time before I could shake him sufficiently to agree that the person concerned had to buy food, fuel and clothes and pay his rent so that the money was going week by week.  This is a rather annoying thing which occurs from time to time.  Perhaps the Minister might pass the word to anybody still carrying out that sort of investigation and persuade him to drop it as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>With regard to the contributory old age pension, as I said before, it was an excellent idea to introduce it.  The only thing I cannot understand is that occasionally we have a delay for which there seems to be no reason at all.  I had a case where I made an <Col N="1748" /> application with all the necessary documents three months ago on behalf of an old man.  There was no question about his age.  Not alone was he over 70 but he was 79 years of age.  He had a full insurance record all his life up to the age of 79.  Do not tell me how he succeeded in getting a card stamped for the past nine years.  He was employed by the Office of Public Works as a mason.  How a man of 79 could go up on top of an old castle and do repair work beats me, but I understand he was an excellent mason. Since that application went in, there has not been one cheep from the Department, good, bad or indifferent. His birth and marriage certificates were sent in.  He has no family depending on him now.  I checked his insurance record myself.  I am satisfied he would qualify for a full pension, but apparently the people in the Department are not so satisfied.  That is one of the annoying things in an otherwise very well run Department which cause a certain amount of trouble.</P>
    <P>Usually when speaking on this Department, I pay tribute to the Minister's officials.  He himself I seldom bother.  I believe he has enough to do without having the ordinary day to day worries of the Department put on his table.  But where I feel an unsatisfactory decision has been given, I have no hesitation in going to the Minister and on every occasion I found him ready to have the matter investigated almost immediately.  His officials&mdash;maybe all civil servants are the same if one is dealing with them as often as I deal with the officials in this Department&mdash;appear to be very decent people.  Very often complaints arise simply because correct particulars are not given.  I should like to pay tribute to the indexing department of the Minister's Department.  If one is applying for an old age pension, it is very important to ensure that the correct information is obtained.  I find that by giving an approximate age, name and an approximate address, in a matter of minutes the full particulars of the insurance record can be obtained.  This is an excellent service of which I do not think everybody is <Col N="1749" /> aware.  It should be publicised more. Perhaps it could be included in the Department's document SW4 which the Minister brings up to date from year to year.</P>
    <P>Recently I came across a case where a person was working for five or six years full time, and became ill.  As far as he was aware, and as far as he is still aware, his cards were fully stamped each year.  However, when he made application for disability benefit, he was surprised to find that one card was blank.  I do not know how this could happen but I imagine the Minister's investigating officer would be on the job pretty quickly to find out why that card was blank.  The result is that the benefit has been held up, although everybody outside who was dealing with the cards seemed to be under the impression that the cards were fully stamped.  It may be due to an error, but it does impose a considerable amount of hardship on the unfortunate person concerned who cannot get benefit until the matter has been cleared up.</P>
    <P>In this regard could the Minister not consider, as he intends to do under the new Industrial Injuries Bill, where somebody has the normal qualification for insurance benefit, and where such a failure as this occurs in the stamping of the card, having the payment made to the person concerned?  There is nothing so annoying to a man with a family who falls ill as to discover that he may have to wait for six, seven or even ten weeks to elapse before the matter is cleared up.  I know a person can apply for some assistance, but people in country districts, particularly, are very proud and do not want to ask for home assistance if they can possibly avoid it.  There is nothing wrong with applying for it but they feel it is not the thing to do.  If the Minister is prepared to provide under the Industrial Injuries Bill that the State would pay and recover from the employer, I do not see any reason why it should not be done in this case and why the employee should suffer simply because somebody has been negligent.  Occasionally it happens that the error is in the Department&mdash;I say <Col N="1750" /> only occasionally&mdash;but no matter who is responsible, the employee should not suffer as a result.  If a person does not receive benefit because the card is not stamped, the State should recover the amount involved.  This thing of leaving it to the person to recover the amount himself is a lot of cod.  The State should recover it, and that would solve the problem.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Industrial Injuries Bill, Deputy Ryan said that £4 10s a week was a very small sum.  Probably he did not know that if somebody has a family, he can get social welfare in excess of £4 10s, but it is very much smaller than what is to be got under the Industrial Injuries Bill.  Would the Minister give us some idea as to when he proposes to bring this Bill into operation?  If a date is not fixed, I can see a great deal of trouble arising.  If the Bill becomes law before the insurance which people have taken out with insurance companies in respect of workmen's compensation can be terminated, there will be a great deal of trouble as to who should be liable for the payment.  The Minister ought to make up his mind.  It is long enough since the Commission was set up originally by Deputy Corish.  It is long enough since the Commission put in its report, and it is long enough since the matter was first discussed in this House.  I know there were amendments and that the Bill has only recently passed through the Seanad, but there has been too much delay on it.  If the Minister could give us an approximate date for the operation of this legislation, it would relieve many people's minds.</P>
    <P>In regard to blind people, I believe they should be treated in a special way.  It may be all right around the cities and towns where these people have an organisation to look after them, but when one goes out to the country districts.  one often finds a blind man or a blind husband and wife who have no one to help them.  They do not get as good value for the little money they have as the person with sight.  The sightless person must accept everything he is told.  He depends on other people's advice and often that advice is not so good.  The State <Col N="1751" /> should try to improve the position of blind people and give them very much more than they are getting at the present time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one thing on which we all agree in this House, no matter what Party we belong to, that is, that social welfare benefits should be increased.  How we provide the money for that is something on which we may differ.  However, I am sure even Deputies in the Opposition would agree with me that no Minister since the foundation of this State has done more for people who need social welfare benefits than the present Minister. The Occupational Injuries Bill which he has put through both Houses of the Oireachtas recently is one of the finest pieces of legislation on social welfare that has been introduced for some time.  It will do away with this idea of the man who is injured, who has a wife and family, getting £4 10s a week, having to look for home assistance and having to look for the difference between what he would get in national health benefit and the £4 10s.  Under this Bill when it becomes an Act, the man with a wife and two children will receive £9 1s per week, which is a big improvement on what he got in workmen's compensation, £4 10s.</P>
      <P>We are all aware that in the 1965 Budget money was provided to give increases in social welfare benefit from August to the end of the financial year, and from January until the end of the financial year as far as contributory pensions are concerned.  Therefore, most of the money provided in the 1966 Budget was provided to pay, for the full year, the cost of the increases in social welfare benefits in the 1965 Budget.  As the Minister said in his speech on the Second Stage of this Bill, all the money available has been given to those who are practically destitute or who have very little income, and surely no Deputy would disagree with that.  That is one thing I often noticed about the present Minister, that he has always tried to give as much as possible to those who have very little.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another welcome feature in this Bill.  One thing I could never <Col N="1752" /> understand was why women employed in agriculture or as domestic servants could not qualify for unemployment benefit as a woman, or a man, for that matter, employed in any other type of employment could qualify.  This is an addition to the social welfare code on which I wish to congratulate the Minister. However, we have under the Social Welfare Acts some problems, which I can understand from discussions with the Minister and his officials are difficult to get over.  There is the case of the man with a farm or business who is reaching the age of 70.  He hands over the business but retains the right of occupation and maintenance and he can draw the pension.  However, in the case of a worker whose wife reaches the age of 70 before he does, she cannot qualify for the non-contributory old age pension.  Something should be done about that.</P>
    <P>It would be interesting to quote from the Minister's speech about widows' contributory pensions.  He said:</P>
    <P>The question of modifying the contribution conditions for widows' contributory pensions is a matter I have had in mind for some time. The present conditions are quite satisfactory in cases where the husband dies while still insurably employed even where he may be fairly young, as the requirement of having 156 contributions paid, that is to say, the equivalent of three years paid insurance, and the yearly average of 39 contributions paid or credited over the last three or five years immediately prior to his death are comparatively easy conditions to satisfy.  If they are satisfied, as they are in the majority of cases, the widow gets full contributory pension for life without any test of means.  However, they are not satisfactory in cases where the number of contributions during the years immediately prior to the husband's death is low due, say, to a break in insurable employment for any reason.  Similarly, they are difficult to satisfy where a man has a regular but limited amount of insurable <Col N="1753" /> employment each year, and is, say, self employed during the remainder of the year but for one reason or another fails, or is unable to pay voluntary contributions.</P>
    <P>A number of cases have come to my notice in which there has been a considerable amount of insurance over the husband's working life but not sufficient contributions in the vital three or five years before his death to qualify the widow for a pension.  It could be argued that the man must have failed, for one reason or another, to exercise his rights to become a voluntary contributor and thus to preserve his pension rights but to learn after her husband's death is of little consolation to the widow, particularly where she knows that her husband had a large amount of insurance in earlier life which in the event is useless to her for pension purposes.</P>
    <P>I propose to remedy this position in the Bill by continuing the existing requirement of 156 contributions paid but, where a widow fails to satisfy the existing average test, to provide an alternative test under which the average will be calculated over the full insurance lifetime, full pension being paid if the yearly average so calculated is 48 or more and reducing pensions being paid where the average is less than 48. This will enable more widows to qualify for contributory pensions either at the full rate or at reduced rates.</P>
    <P>That is one point of which I have had personal experience where it happened that a man was ill for a number of years and neglected his contributions or did not send in certificates.  When such a man died, there was very little that could be done about it.  Now the Minister has taken in the full lifetime of insurance in order that the widow will qualify for some pension.</P>
    <P>The present Minister and Government have brought in most of the social welfare schemes now in existence but there is one class that is excluded from any benefit.  I refer to the non-contributory disability pensions.  Those we have <Col N="1754" /> not got and I am sure the Minister feels that something should be done about this class of people.  They are people who are born incapable or become incapable early in life.  They reach the age of 16 years and see their brothers and sisters and playmates going to employment while they are left a burden on their brothers and sisters or on the family.  The very fact that they know that they will not qualify for any State assistance is a handicap in itself and I would ask the Minister to look into this problem of a non-contributory disability pension for such people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to congratulate the Minister on the measures he has brought into this House for the relief of the social welfare classes.  There is one point which I would bring to his attention and I feel very strongly about it.  This is the question of the workers in the blind workshop in Rathmines. Every evening when they leave the workshop, we see them queueing for buses, perhaps to bring them to the north side of the city.  They have to queue up with people who have their full faculties and I do not think it would need any special legislation to provide a bus service for them such as is provided for incapacitated people in other institutions.  It would make life more livable for these people.</P>
      <P>It is also a fact that housing authorities when allocating houses do not take into account the fact that a person is blind.  A man working in the Rathmines workshop for the blind might be rehoused in Coolock or Raheny.  The Minister might consider requesting the housing authority that accommodation be provided for blind workers near their place of work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also the case of people who have paid social welfare contributions for many years and may have had to stop working.  In my constituency there is a hospital catering for incurable people and many of these spend up to 40 years in it.  Could the Minister see his way to make some small weekly payments to these people so that they could buy some small articles for themselves?  Some of them have nothing coming to them.  Their families <Col N="1755" /> have died out and were it not for the kindness of the people running the hospital, they would not be receiving a penny to buy even a handkerchief. These are small points where we are concerned but they are important to the unfortunate people themselves.</P>

      <P>I think I can thank Deputies generally for their approach to this Bill.  I cannot complain if the general attitude is to ask for more so long as there is no objection to what is being done.  There was some criticism of our social welfare services generally which I think was not justified. Nobody, least of all anybody on this side of the House, has ever maintained that we have reached a satisfactory standard in regard to all our social welfare services and I must say that I find it hard to visualise the state ever being reached in which we can consider that we have achieved the optimum in that regard.  I imagine that it will always be possible to make further progress.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ryan quoted some figures in regard to various matters from sources which I was not able to trace.  I do not know if he stated where he got them but I certainly have not been able to trace the exact source of these figures.

      <P>There is one thing that Deputy Ryan did not mention, that is, the identity of the group of dieticians and statisticians who published figures with regard to the amount of money which it was stated to be necessary to provide an adequate diet for people <Col N="1756" /> in different age groups.  Deputy Ryan did not specify where that came from but it should be obvious that the interpretation he was putting upon the deductions made by these people was hardly a realistic one.  He did not give the full range of age groups but, as far as I can see, if we did apply the figures for individuals in different age groups to the make-up of our population as defined in the census, we would discover that to provide an adequate diet for our population would take something between 40 and 50 per cent of the national income and when one considers that it is also necessary to provide housing and clothing, that would not appear to leave very much for luxuries.</P>
      <P>We do know that, in fact, there is not anything like that percentage of the national income spent for this purpose.  These figures, interpreted as Deputy Ryan interpreted them, would tend to prove that the average working man would not be able to feed and house and clothe his family from his wages but we know that, in fact, he can do this.  So that I do not think these figures were very relevant in the context in which they were quoted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to this question of the quoting of percentage figures of the gross national product which are given in these tables supplied by bodies such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, great care should be taken to make sure that we are comparing like with like. These figures have been repeatedly quoted and they have been bandied about both here and in other places as if they formed a realistic basis for comparison between countries and were a clear indication of the state of social welfare in the different countries concerned.  In actual fact, these comparisons should be judged in the light of the warnings which are given in these reports as to the comparability of data.  It is quite clear that in comparing percentage figures of the gross national product such as, for instance, are given in Table IX of the comparative tables in the Statistics of National Accounts, 1950-1961, which was published by the OECD in 1964, <Col N="1757" /> we are not in all cases comparing like with like.</P>
    <P>In the introduction to that publication, for instance, there is a paragraph devoted to explaining the difficulties of making true comparisons between the accounts for various member countries.  In addition to that, the general observations on these comparative tables include the following statements:</P>
    <P>The percentage structure shown in Tables V to IX generally refer to the two years 1950 and 1960. These percentages are more appropriate for comparing changes in structure as between the two years in any one country rather than for making structural comparisons as between countries.  In making comparisons as between countries the limitations to the comparability of the data which were outlined in the introduction have to be borne in mind.</P>
    <P>Having regard to these warnings and observations, it is obviously unwise to rely on these statistics to compare this country's performance in regard to social services with that of any of the other member countries of OECD.</P>
    <P>If we use these percentages in the way in which it is stated to be appropriate to use them, they show that the Irish improvement between the two years in question is more marked than in many of the other countries and that is only up as far as 1960 and since 1960 there have been considerable improvements and development in our social security services.  For example, we have had the introduction of the old age contributory pension scheme since that date and this year we have the Occupational Injuries Bill which has almost gone through the two Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>As I said, we are not always comparing like with like in the figures given in these documents.  In our case, the figure given generally refers to the services administered by the Department of Social Welfare, that is, the income maintenance services only, and indeed not even all of these are administered by the Department of Social <Col N="1758" /> Welfare.  So, they are not all included in these figures, in some cases at any rate.</P>
    <P>It is clear, however, that in many other countries other things are included. For example, the inclusion of military service and war pensions in the case of a country such as France or Belgium, which maintain comparatively large standing armies and which, through having been involved in two world wars, have large numbers of disability and dependants' war pensions in course of payment, obviously, makes the comparison between these countries and a country such as ours completely illusory because these things are not included in our case and, even if they were, they would not loom so large.</P>
    <P>Of course, in the case of many countries, in addition, occupational injury benefit, which is only now coming within the scope of our social welfare system, is already included.  So that, there are many cases of things other than those which are included in our social welfare figure being included in these other countries and therefore the percentage figures of gross national product or national income, as the case may be, are not a reliable basis of comparison.  Some countries include such things as expenditure on private schemes of social insurance as well as amounts paid to workers who are ill but whose employers continue paying wages to them.  Other fringe benefits conceded by employers are also included in social security expenditure figures in some countries.  The people who compile these figures recognise that they are not strictly comparable and they warn students of these documents to bear that in mind.  So the figures quoted are not strictly applicable and certainly cannot be utilised as they were utilised here.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ryan described our social welfare benefits as &ldquo;miserable pittances,&rdquo; a typical instance of exaggeration by the Party opposite when they are out of office.  When in office, it is a fact that these &ldquo;miserable pittances&rdquo; were allowed to become more miserable in relation to the cost of living because they were not increased anything like as regularly as they were under the present Government <Col N="1759" /> and some were never increased at all.  While I do not accept the description of our social welfare payments as &ldquo;miserable pittances&rdquo; I am prepared to admit that in some, but certainly not all, cases the amounts it is possible to pay are still too low.  It is undeniable that since the Government came into office in 1957, we have made considerable progress in raising our social welfare payments to a satisfactory level.  There is a very considerable gain over the cost of living shown by every one of our social welfare payments, and if a satisfactory position has not yet been reached, it is largely because the base from which we started in 1957 was too low and that was due largely to the almost complete neglect of social welfare during the two Coalition periods in office.</P>
    <P>It is desirable that I should place on record exactly what has been achieved in this respect.  In February, 1957, prior to the change of Government, the cost of living figure stood at 135.  In May, 1966, it had risen to 185, an increase of 37 per cent.  In this Bill we are providing for an increase in the maximum rate of non-contributory old age pensions of 5/-payable to old age pensioners who have no means.  That will bring the maximum rate to 52/6.  It stood at 24/-when we took over in 1957.  That represents an increase of 28/6 or 119 per cent against a cost of living increase of 37 per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it both Opposition Parties are agreeing on this.  I may pass on then by saying that these &ldquo;miserable pittances&rdquo; are much less miserable than they were in 1957 and that they are improving each year.</P>
      <P>There are one or two other points to which I should refer and one is the question of the provision I propose to make for the payment of unemployment benefit for domestic servants. This is being provided for the first time in this Bill and I want to assure Deputies that my sole intention in doing so is to benefit genuine employees in this field who would otherwise have to pay higher contributions if unemployment benefit was to be made available under the usual conditions. I was surprised by the vehemence of Deputy Tully's attack on what was proposed here.  I thought it was agreed that it was not necessary to require workers in this field to pay full rate contributions and that in fact genuine unemployment did not normally arise in this type of work, that a new job would be readily obtainable&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>If they were prepared to accept very bad conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and that the type of case we had to cover was the person who had been in one employment for some time and was not readily adaptable to another job in another household. The theory up to this was that there was no unemployment in this field, but like other Deputies, I have concluded that this is not true.  It must have been obvious that if we made unemployment benefit available on normal terms, there would be considerable scope for abuse in this case, and I certainly believe&mdash;first, I want to make it clear that I have no intention of doing anything to make cheap labour available to anybody; and I resent the implication that that is so &mdash;but I believe that it is not necessary <Col N="1761" /> to require these people to pay full rate contributions and that this will meet the need that exists there for unemployment benefit.</P>
      <P>If it appears, after some experience, to be warranted to apply full rate contributions and make unemployment benefit available on the usual conditions, that can be done but I think we should accept this as a first step and an advance on the present position where these workers are not insurable for unemployment benefit.  If it is found not to be sufficient improvement, the matter can always be dealt with again.  My only desire is to provide the cover that is necessary.</P>
      <P>Both Deputy Ryan and Deputy Tully referred to the fact that after fairly protracted negotiations, we have succeeded in getting the British Government to accept responsibility for paying increases granted in their pensions to their pensioners residing in this country.  It was always appreciated that one of the effects of this would be to remove some of these pensioners from the scope of our non-contributory pensions and thereby, not save money for the State but make more of the money devoted to social welfare available for other people in need.  The availability of the extra money was taken into account at the time of the Budget and was a factor in making it possible to provide the present increases in the difficult financial circumstances which existed at Budget time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but we knew what was coming and were able to make an estimate of what the financial result would be.  The suggestion that money received in the form of British pensions should be disregarded as income while other incomes continue to be assessed has, in my opinion, nothing to recommend it.  Possibly we can postpone further comment until the Estimate debate.</P>

      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>Before section 38, the following new section inserted:</P>
      <P>38.  Sections 44, 45 and 46 of the Principal Act shall have effect as if the words &lsquo;question specified in paragraph (a), (b) or (c) of subsection (1) of section 42 of this Act&rsquo;, wherever they occur in those sections, did not include a reference to a question arising under this Act as to whether an accident arose out of and in the course of employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an amendment which was passed in the Seanad.  We had a lot of discussion there about appeals.  This amendment is designed to enable an appeal, or reference to the High Court, <Col N="1764" /> as provided in section 45 of the Social Welfare Act, 1952, to be made in relation to a question arising on a claim for occupational injuries where an accident arises out of or in the course of employment in a similar manner to that in which such appeal may now be made on any question in relation to insurability under the Act. Under this arrangement, where an appeal is made against a decision of a deciding officer involving the question of whether the accident arose in the course of or during the employment, the Minister may, at the request of the chief appeals officer, refer the question for decision by the High Court.  If the question is decided by the appeals officer, any person could appeal therefrom to the High Court on a question of law.</P>
