      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>In that case, I will move vote No 51 first, as it is the biggest.  I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £850,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1966, for Remuneration of Civil Servants.</P>
      <P>Deputies will recall that in my last Budget I made provision to meet claims which, because they were awaiting settlement, could not have been included in the published Book of Estimates.  By 3rd November of last year, as I then informed the House, the vast bulk of Civil Service grades had been dealt with on the basis of key decisions given by the Civil Service Arbitration Board bringing pay into line with rates previously in operation outside.  The claims remaining to be heard by the Board concerned departmental grades and were based largely on internal relativities with grades which had already had revision. I said then it would be clearly unfair to prevent these small groups from having their claims processed at arbitration, and this has in fact been taking place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present Estimate covers payments from 20 different Votes and, in <Col N="855" /> the absence of a global Estimate, it would have been necessary to introduce Supplementary Estimates for each of these Votes.  The cost of pay increases on ten other Votes can be met from savings on those Votes.  For nine Votes we will require Supplementary Estimates for other reasons.  All these Supplementary Estimates will include provision for extra expenditure arising from pay increases.  The pay increases are adjustments of the eighth round of pay revisions.  In the Civil Service, the grades of clerical officer and Post Office clerk were among the first to effect eighth round settlements in 1961 and obtain maxima of £814 and £783 respectively while rates began to emerge in employment outside the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>An example is the revised eighth round settlement for Board na Móna clerical staff, who were awarded a scale of £350 at the bottom rising by annual increments of £50 to a maximum of £1,050 with effect from 1st April, 1963. These scales applied following a Labour Court recommendation.  This scale was also applied in other instances.  The maximum net of pension deductions was approximately £1,000.  Post Office clerks and clerical officers pressed claims for a revision of their eighth round settlement when the higher rates began to emerge in outside employment. The Post Office clerk was the first to be dealt with and, early in 1964, the Civil Service Arbitration Board awarded a maximum of £952 with effect from October, 1963.  Later clerical officers effected a conciliation settlement based largely on this arbitration finding which gave their grade a maximum of £1,000 with effect from 1st January, 1964.</P>
    <P>The Civil Service is a closely-knit organisation and a revision of the salary rates of one grade inevitably has repercussions on those of the related grades.  For example, the maximum of the scale awarded by the Arbitration Board to Post Office clerks was almost equal to the maximum salary then being paid to the grade in charge of them.  Clearly, therefore, the pay of the supervisory grade had <Col N="856" /> to be adjusted.  Similarly, the revision of clerical officer pay had an immediate effect on that of the supervisory grade of staff officer, which is recruited exclusively from the clerical officer grade. It also had an immediate effect on the grade of executive officer, a substantial proportion of which consists of promoted clerical officers.  Following the revision of pay of executive officers, the higher executive officers brought a claim for higher pay before the Arbitration Board which issued its findings on the claim in March, 1965.</P>
    <P>It may not be generally realised that each Civil Service grade coming within the scope of the conciliation and arbitration machinery may submit to the Arbitration Board pay claims which it has failed to resolve to its satisfaction at conciliation.  Quite a large number of cases, some of them very small in numbers, elected for arbitration with the result that the process of determining the pay of many Civil Service grades has been a very long one. Key claims governing important groups of civil servants have been determined following a series of arbitrations which were all accepted by the Government and used as a yardstick for settlement in other cases.  A common feature of most of these claims has been their reliance on comparison with cognate groups outside the Civil Service.  It is evident from the findings of the Arbitration Board that this comparison has to a considerable extent been established to the Board's satisfaction.</P>
    <P>The finding of the Arbitration Board on the higher executive officer's claim brought that grade's maximum fairly close to the maximum of the next highest grade, that is, assistant principal, the lowest of the General Service grades outside the scope of conciliation and arbitration.  From the grade of assistant principal upwards&mdash; that is, assistant principal, principal, assistant secretary and secretary&mdash; there is no scheme of conciliation and arbitration.  Higher executive officers, having been adjusted close to the maximum of the assistant principals, an adjustment was clearly required in the scale of assistant principals which, <Col N="857" /> in turn, necessitated adjustments in higher grades.</P>
    <P>In the original eighth round settlement, a decreasing series of percentages had been applied to grades above that of higher executive officer.  To avoid undue compression, it was decided to accord on this occasion to these grades the same percentage, that is, 16½ per cent, as had been awarded to higher executive officers by the Arbitration Board.  In addition to this revision, a further adjustment was made in the salaries of secretaries and assistant secretaries with effect from 1st April, 1965.  It was found necessary to make a special adjustment in their remuneration by reference to that of their equivalents in outside employment and, in particular, in State-sponsored bodies. The circumstances that in these bodies the levels of remuneration were substantially higher than those paid to top-ranking civil servants, despite the heavy responsibilities of these higher civil servants, had resulted in a marked and undesirable deterioration in their relative positions.  The adjustment approved was intended to go some distance to correct this distortion.</P>
    <P>In Vote No. 6, there is a further sum of £57,500 which is in respect of an excess on the salaries at Subhead A, of which £49,000 relates to status increases awarded to higher grades and £4,000 to additional posts created during the year, plus a provision to cover contingencies.  This sum is intended to cover higher officers in the Department of Finance.  It is entirely fortuitous that it appears as a separate item from the main Vote, No. 51; this Supplementary Estimate had already been put forward into the machine of the Dáil Office before the larger Vote was ready.  In fact, these two Votes are for the same purpose.</P>
    <P>There is a further Supplementary Estimate for which I am responsible &mdash;Vote No. 16, Law Charges.  This is for a sum not exceeding £39,200. It is divided into four subheads.  Subhead A is for a supplementary sum of £24,200 required to pay increases awarded to professional and sub-professional staff in the Offices of the Attorney-General, the Chief State <Col N="858" /> Solicitor and the Finance Solicitor; these awards were subsequent to the fixing of the original provision.  Subhead D is for a supplementary sum of £6,500 required to offset an increase in the number of criminal trials and an increase in the sum paid to medical witnesses giving evidence in road traffic cases.  Subhead E is for a supplementary sum of £6,000.  This excess is attributable to the increase that has occurred in the number of criminal trials, including <i>habeas corpus</i> applications.  Subhead F comes under the heading of General Law Expenses. It is for a supplementary sum of £6,500 and the expenses under this subhead include expenses of jurymen, payment of costs awarded against the State, gratuities to attendants at Green Street Courthouse for extra duties in connection with the trial of provincial cases at the Central Criminal Court.</P>
    <P>The House will remember that in a recent Act&mdash;I forget which one&mdash;there were greater facilities given for the transfer of a trial from a local venue to the Central Criminal Court.  These have been availed of to a considerable extent.  There is also a requirement for car hire for local state solicitors, incidental costs incurred on official business, payments for reports of judgments, transcripts of evidence, copies of summonses and certificates of convictions, and also for the pursuit of offenders in the metropolitan area and the conveyance of articles for analysis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The Supplementary Estimates introduced by the Minister in respect of these wage and salary adjustments will be approved naturally, because we support the system whereby wage and salary adjustments are made on the basis of the Civil Service Arbitration Board awards. Having said that, I think this whole question of wage and salary adjustments in recent times has not had the best possible presentation.  While one can understand the circumstances involved in processing and dealing with many of these applications and the fact that a backlog of cases being dealt with has arisen from time to time in respect of the processing of <Col N="859" /> these awards by the Civil Service Arbitration Board, it does appear from recent awards that additional staff ought to be provided to get the work done or that some change should be made in the procedure whereby awards would be dealt with on a more expeditious basis.</P>
      <P>As the Minister remarked, the present award completes a number of applications that were before the Board for quite a considerable time and many of these awards dealt with eighth round adjustments.  If we are to attract and retain in the Civil Service people of the right calibre it is important nowadays that they should be paid remuneration comparable with that which is available in outside occupations. On the other hand, one is struck by the extent to which one State or semi-State body is used by another as a yardstick to get wage and salary adjustments.  That has presented many difficulties and been responsible, to a considerable extent, for the leapfrogging that has taken place in respect of some of these changes in remuneration.</P>
      <P>While it is right and proper that these adjustments should be made, the timing of the awards, particularly the status awards, certainly was open to criticism.  The timing of these announcements coincided with a period in which exhortations were being made to other sectors of the economy to exercise restraint.  It is a fact that a number of these claims were in process of being considered and were in prior to that period, and only meant adjustments being implemented which had been under way previously.  However, it is important that a proper presentation should be made.  The delays that have occurred might be avoided if some more expenditions procedure were adopted.  I should be interested to hear from the Minister whether the proposed tribunal that is considering the question of salaries and wages and remuneration generally will deal with this aspect of the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One other aspect that has not been sufficiently considered is the position of lower-paid workers.  One of the criticisms <Col N="860" /> that has been expressed both in respect of State employment and, indeed, in respect of certain categories of workers in semi-State institutions, is that, while there may well be justification for these considerable increases to persons in higher grades, the position of lower-paid workers has not been adequately considered, having regard to the rises in the cost of living over the years and, particularly, the substantial rises in recent years.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of retired personnel.  The Minister mentions adjustments in respect of the eighth round.  As the House is aware, pensions are based on pay at retirement, and there is considerable dissatisfaction, and justifiably so, with the hardship imposed on many pensioners, civil servants, Army or Garda personnel, who retire from State employment just previous to wage and salary adjustments being made.  It means they have substantially lower pensions than those people employed in the same position who retire just a few months later.</P>
    <P>It can be argued that that was always the case.  While that is so, the position nowadays is very different because of the steep drop in the value of money and the fact that pension increases and wage and salary adjustments are made for the purpose of compensating for this drop in the value of money or increase in the cost of living, and in the case of wage and salary adjustments, are made primarily on the change in the consumer price index.  There are possibly other factors but in so far as pension increases are concerned they always lag behind, both in the sense that they are not brought into effect immediately and are never adjusted in line with the wage and salary adjustments which take place for those still serving.  Consideration must be given, and should be given, in justice, to those who have retired, because of the fact that this deals with the eighth round.  We should see that changes of this sort apply retrospectively in respect of those people.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to another matter which I think has been the subject of <Col N="861" /> considerable concern, that is, the recent loan negotiated by the Government in Germany and in London.  The reasons for this situation reflect, I believe, the criticism which the Government must bear for the general mismanagement of the public finances over the past few years and particularly the serious deterioration in the credit situation in recent months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>This does not actually arise on the Supplementary Estimate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the Vote for the Office of the Minister for Finance and I think there is no limitation on the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but it covers the whole Vote of the Minister for Finance.  The position is that a year ago there was unlimited credit and that credit was available for even highly speculative operations.  Now there is a shortage of credit for many essential programmes.  This first manifested itself in late summer when building societies and bodies of that sort restricted the amount of credit available. When one examines the position, it becomes obvious there has been a very marked change in the increased accommodation which became available during last year.  I find that the Government and local authorities got £28 million more between December, 1964, and December, 1965, and during the same period, the private sector got £0.4 million.  In other words, all the increased credit was hogged by the Government and by the local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This situation manifested itself even before that.  Up to July last the increase which had become available shows for that 12 month period to July, 27 per cent of it had gone to the State and local authorities compared with 12 per cent to the private sector. For the rest of the year, the situation, which I have mentioned, was even more serious.  The position has been reached in which the Government have <Col N="862" /> now to seek, not merely in this country, but abroad, loans on what can only be regarded as very onerous terms.  While, in many circumstances, there is justification for external borrowing for sound projects, the position is that the recent loan which was negotiated can only be regarded as being on very onerous terms.  One of the reasons given for that situation is the fact that the loan which was being negotiated in America in the autumn did not materialise.  As I understand it, the loan was negotiated and then because of what is described as congestion, it was not proceeded with.</P>
    <P>We are entitled to know why this loan was not floated at a particular time, what happened in the arrangements which prevented the loan being proceeded with and why the situation was allowed to deteriorate to such an extent that we had to make, first of all, special application to the International Monetary Fund for a loan of £7 million to £8 million and now the loan in London and Germany.  The terms of this are substantially higher than any previous loan.  It can, of course, be said you have to pay the terms available or you have to pay the rate demanded in order to get the loan.  I believe this reflects the failure of the Government to adopt a proper order of priorities in respect of the capital programme and the fact that the situation has now been reached that, not merely have we exhausted all available resources here, including very considerable borrowing from the banks here, but the amount borrowed by the Exchequer during the portion of last year was over 32 per cent higher than for the similar period of the previous year.  This all emphasises the fact that the Government and local authorities are taking an undue share of the capital available and that private enterprise, business, farmers and others, are finding it extremely difficult.</P>

      <P>I must intervene again in respect of the widening of the debate by the Deputy.  In a Supplementary Estimate, the debate is confined to matter specifically set out in the Estimate for which a supplementary sum is required.

However, I feel that because of the serious situation which has developed, it is a matter which requires to be ventilated and it is for that reason I regard it as coming within the general scope of the administration of the Minister's Department.  It may be true to say that the Minister inherited this situation.  To that extent, I think it is probably the Government of which he is a member who deserve the severest criticism but the Minister inherited this situation, and the serious problems it has created for many sections in the community is one that has not been sufficiently adverted to. It has caused great difficulties for individual farmers and traders, as well as individual businesses.</P>

As Deputy Cosgrave has said, there will be many opportunities during the next few weeks to comment on general Government and financial policy.  Even if this were something which was controversial, the Labour Party would be at a slight disadvantage in that they did not get a copy of the Minister's brief, which Deputy Cosgrave seems to have got.</P>

I have spoken in this House repeatedly of my grave concern at the situation which could arise if, through the management of the public debt, we allowed the ultimate sovereign authority of the Oireachtas to be transferred from this House to Zurich, New York, or anywhere else outside Oireachtas Éireann.  I think that danger is now upon us.  We are now paying, if I am to adopt the method of calculation employed by the present Minister's predecessor, Deputy MacEntee, the equivalent of an interest of over ten per cent on the loan recently raised in Germany and Great Britain.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash; on paper but there are more to come, and a Book of Estimates which has an unprecedented figure on the cover.  However, I want to recall that the broader issues of finance were under discussion in this House early last year.  The Minister concluded his observations with the following paragraph&mdash;I refer to what he said on Thursday, 20th May, 1965 &mdash;Volume 215, column 1878:</P>
      <P>I have dealt in some detail with most of the points raised and I do not wish to delay the House longer. We have in this Budget not only a good social welfare Budget but, from the fact that we have made provision for increased expenditure on agriculture, industry, housing and other forms of productive effort, a good economic development Budget as well and, please God, with the assistance we have been offered from the other side of the House and the co-operation we can expect to get from the country, we can have greater developments, greater progress and perhaps even a better Budget next year.</P>
      <P>That Minister was sustained by the advice of the distinguished Civil Service for which we are now voting a substantial amount of money, but unsustained by that precedent advice, I ventured to strike a somewhat different note at column 1333, volume 215.  I made my concluding observations in the following terms:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could elaborate at length on a variety of other aspects of the cost of living, but I elect deliberately, for the purpose of bringing this whole problem into focus, to dwell on this tri-partite dilemma&mdash;rising cost of living, rising adverse balance of trade, rising adverse balance of payments.  That cannot go on indefinitely. What remedy do the Government propose whereby to correct this deadly evil which, if allowed to continue, will one day <Col N="867" /> have to be faced?  The longer we wait to face it the greater menace it will become for the survival of this country, not only in economic freedom but in political freedom too.</P>
    <P>Those two forecasts were made eight months ago.  I yield to none in my admiration for the beneficiaries under Subhead A of this Supplementary Vote, but I dare to say that my prognostications approximated more closely to the event than those of the Minister, who presumably had the advantage of their advice.</P>

      <P>I am referring to salaries, wages and allowances.  Surely I am entitled to state what I said, that the Minister had the advantage of their advice, and that my comment approximated more closely to the truth than what the Minister said with the advantage of all the advice, well paid as it is.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the only comment I desire to make on it.  You, a Cheann Comhairle, are the final authority on that.  If our discussion are to be limited within that narrow definition of this Vote, nothing remains to be said except that what is due on foot of contracts falls to be paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want the Minister to avail of this opportunity, if he will, to correct, if it is wrong, one astonishing mistake which appeared in yesterday's newspapers. I accept your ruling that this is an Estimate for no other purpose than to discharge an obligation when it comes in course of payment on foot of contracts entered into by way of arbitration.  There appeared in yesterday's papers the statement that the astonishing terms accepted by the Minister in respect of the German and London loans were due to the fact that he urgently needed the money to meet charges that would come in <Col N="868" /> course of payment between now and the time when revenue from next year's Budget would begin to flow into the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I know our financial situation is critical in the extreme, but I cannot feel that our financial revenue balance can be of such a character that we must borrow in London and Berlin or Bonn to meet charges that will come in course of payment between now and 31st March.  There may have been some misunderstanding of the phraseology employed.  It may be inappropriate, but I think it would be advantageous if the Minister would make it clear that we are not so absolutely on the bare boards as that public statement would suggest.</P>
    <P>In the light of your intervention, a Cheann Comhairle, I will return to these matters in greater detail when other financial business comes before the House, but, <i>ad interim</i>, I think the Minister ought to explain certain matters and I hope that the indulgence requisite to permit him to do so will be forthcoming from the Chair.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cosgrave raised a number of questions that I might deal with first.  It is perhaps untimely that the provision for these increases is coming now, many months after the occasion arose for them.  As I said, these increases have been mainly due to disparities that arose out of the general eighth round of pay increases. These disparities arose primarily because some of the grades we are now dealing with effected the eighth round pay increases very early on, and other comparable sectors effected more advantageous pay increases later on in the eighth round, and there followed the natural demand for adjustments by these public servants who had effected their pay increases at such an early stage.  There followed that the adjustments in the higher grades, that is, the grades higher than the Post Office clerks and the clerical officers, the two grades to which I referred initially.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true that because of this there is greater need for expendition in the arbitration proceedings.  Within the Civil Service, there are scores of separate staff organisations, each of which <Col N="869" /> is entitled to process separately its claim at conciliation, and if dissatisfied there, at arbitration.  As the House is aware, it is not very easy to get arbitrators who are acceptable, and who appear to be independent.  I use the words &ldquo;appear to be independent&rdquo; deliberately because it is easy to get objective and independent arbitrators, but it is not easy to get both sides to agree to such arbitrators.  Therefore, the pool of persons available and acceptable is very limited.  In many cases the same arbitrator operates in a number of schemes and, as a result, the arbitration claims have to take their place in his queue and in the general queue as well.  However, there are a number of different arbitrators and, objective though they may be, their objectivity in relation to scales on salary applications for kindred or related grades in the Civil Service is not the same, with the result that we have had this leapfrogging in the salary claims and the scales applied in the public service generally.</P>
    <P>For this reason the tribunal on pay levels for the recruitment grades was set up and in direct reply to Deputy Cosgrave the tribunal will not, in fact, deal with the difficulty to which I have referred, that is, the delay in hearing arbitration claims.  It will report on the relativities it feels ought to apply and it will guide the arbritrators in these conciliation and arbitration schemes in the future; but, over and above that, in order to avoid this disparity in arbitration awards caused by the fact that there are a number of different arbitrators, the Government have now decided to introduce legislation that will have the effect of channelling these arbitration claims under the one roof, so to speak, under an enlarged labour court.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Will this apply to the Civil Service as well as to&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The intention will be to enlarge the Labour Court itself and to make provision, if necessary, for the appointment of assessors with, very likely, a person common to all claims sitting in so that this disparity which has been emerging will, <Col N="870" /> to the fullest extent in our power, be eliminated.  I think that you will have that very desirable effect in the first instance and also, I hope, the effect of there being not too long a queue of those waiting to have their arbitration claims heard.</P>
      <P>In connection with the number of arbitration claims, I might say that, since January, 1964, no less than 64 cases have been submitted.  As the House is aware, many of these cases can each take a number of days to hear and certainly much longer than that to determine and to have a report presented and an award made.  That gives some indication why there has been this long delay in hearing some of these claims, provision for which we are now making.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cosgrave mentioned that there has been some comment on the level of salaries of civil servants generally and of higher civil servants in particular.  There has been some criticism of the increases that have been granted to higher civil servants. I think we ought to get this into proper perspective.  In the first place, and without pretending that this is the first time it has been said&mdash;I know it has been said by many members of this House&mdash;I think we can justifiably be proud of the quality of our Civil Service not only in its administrative standard but in the standard of its integrity as well.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>In recent years, a tendency has been developing as a result of which many of the best brains leaving our universities are not attracted to the Civil Service.  Special steps have had to be taken recently in order to enable young civil servants with obvious extra ability to acquire university degrees that would be of value to them and to the public service in later years.  Up to 20 years ago, I think we could say that the Civil Service was a very attractive occupation for even the best Honours brains leaving our universities but that situation has changed.  Apart altogether from the necessity of ensuring that we attract the best talents that we possibly <Col N="871" /> can to our public service, we must also regard the position of outside employments <i>vis-á-vis</i> the service, especially in the top grades.</P>
      <P>The highest grade in our Civil Service is the Secretary of a Department and his maximum salary is £4,750 a year.  Some few of them earn higher than that, up to £5,200 a year, which is the top salary.  If we make comparisons with the salaries enjoyed by civil servants in other countries, and indeed in the Six Counties, one will see that our higher civil servants are by no means overpaid.</P>
      <P>The highest salary paid by the Stormont Government is £5,800 which is several hundred pounds higher than the highest salary we pay in our Civil Service and, under a recent revision, equivalent ranks in Britain now receive, at the highest, about £9,200 and the ordinary heads of Departments about £8,600.  So, on that basis alone, I think it is only fair to say that our higher civil servants are not by any means overpaid and, in fact, on that comparison, are paid considerably less than their counterparts in rank and ability can command in the Six Counties and certainly much less than they can command in the United Kingdom.</P>
      <P>I think we can make a more useful comparison within the State, in that we have persons recruited to the public service in another way, through the State-sponsored bodies.  The chief executives and chief administrators of the State-sponsored bodies in most cases can command a considerably higher salary than the heads of Civil Service departments.  I do not think it can be claimed that these chief executives or chief administrators have duties more onerous in any way than have the heads of our Civil Service Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we make a comparison with the business world&mdash;and I have taken some trouble to inquire about the rates of salaries of top executives in the business world&mdash;I am told that, in large public companies, these rates lie somewhere between £5,000 and £10,000: in some cases they may be <Col N="872" /> above it.  I think we can safely take a very conservative average of about £7,000.  Therefore, comparing our standard salary of £4,750 with this average of £7,000, again, I think it is demonstrably clear that our higher civil servants are in no way being overpaid.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave asked, in this context, about the rates of pay of lower-paid workers.  I think I stated very clearly, in the course of the debate on the Report of the NIEC, that the Government were concerned about the rates of pay of lower-paid workers and advocated for the consideration of the employers' and the workers' organisations that, in any increase that would be implemented in the present year and in the coming months, special regard might be had to the claims of these lower-paid workers so that, with in the percentage increase thought to be feasible and which was put at that time at about three per cent, there might be a tolerance in favour of the lower-paid workers but it was felt that the higher-paid workers might accept a lower percentage increase in order to allow that tolerance in favour of their worse-off colleagues.</P>
    <P>The problem of retired persons is one with which one always has sympathy.  Indeed, I met them quite recently and heard their claims as to the disparity that had arisen between the pensions they enjoyed and the pensions enjoyed by people who retired from similar grades in later years.  It is true that because of the increase in salaries persons retiring later enjoy proportionately higher pensions.  An effort was made in recent years to increase the pensions of these retired persons and last year a good effort was made when a percentage increase higher than ever before was granted to them.  Like many other things, this is a budgetary matter and I do not think I can discuss it further at this stage.</P>
    <P>If I may refer to the loan, even though the Ceann Comhairle ruled it out of order&mdash;the Sterling-Deutschemark loan&mdash;which was recently negotiated, it is true that the terms are high but the international bond market <Col N="873" /> is very high and interest rates are increasing rapidly in accordance with the law of supply and demand.  The terms are in line with those obtaining in the Deutschemark market itself at present.  A recent issue by the Federal Government of Germany gave a yield to redemption of 71/4 per cent which is similar to the yield in the Sterling-Deutschemark loan we are seeking.  It is important that the first issue in a foreign market by this country should be a success and in order to make it successful we must pay the going rate.</P>
    <P>It is true that we have had to resort to foreign borrowing at present because we realise there is only a certain capacity within the country from private and public sources for creating investment for capital development.  It has been put at about £70 million to £75 million and that has been our experience, taking one year with another, as regards the capital that we can get from the savings of our people generally.  If we are to maintain our progress of economic development at a reasonable rate, we must seek capital from abroad and I think there is nothing wrong in that so long as we can remunerate it and devote the moneys received in that way to productive purposes generally.  The loan we are now getting through this Sterling-Deutschemark issue is needed for our public capital programme.  I know I am slightly out of order but since the matter was raised before the Ceann Comhairle ruled it out of order.  I think I am in order in replying even in this short manner.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not see the newspaper comment but what I have said now is a fair comment on that. This borrowing in the Deutschemark-Sterling loan is needed for the purpose of our capital programme and also of course to ease the pressure to which Deputy Cosgrave referred of public borrowing from the banks.  It is true that the public sector took up a very disaproportionate amount from the commercial banks in the past year and it is very desirable to avoid doing that <Col N="874" /> so as to permit private sector development to the fullest possible extent.  The borrowing to which I have referred will help to ease that situation.</P>

    <P>This Supplementary Estimate provides for increased expenditure in all three sections of the Social Welfare Vote for the current year.  Under the head of Administration&mdash;Subheads A to D&mdash;£159,000 extra is required. Under Social Insurance&mdash;Subheads E and F&mdash;the additional sum sought is £1,307,000.  For Social Assistance&mdash; Subheads G, I and J&mdash;the supplementary <Col N="876" /> provision is £2,471,000.  The gross total comes to £3,937,000, but, as there are surplus Appropriations in Aid, estimated at £102,000, the net additional requirement from the Exchequer is £3,835,000.</P>
    <P>Of the £159,000 extra now sought for Administration Expenses, £116,000 arises on the Salaries subhead.  This is required to meet the cost of pay revisions for certain grades which was not included in the original Estimate. The gross amount is £176,000 but this is offset by expected savings of £60,000 on the original provision of £1,632,000. Under Subhead B, an additional sum of £10,000 is required to meet higher expenditure on travelling expenses and subsistence.  An adjustment of an underclaim by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs in the previous year is mainly responsible for an increase of £8,000 under Subhead C&mdash;Post Office Services.  The extra provision of £25,000 under Subhead D&mdash;Insured Persons' Medical Certificates&mdash;is attributable to an increase in the capitation rate on which payment to medical certifiers is based.</P>
    <P>The bulk of the additional expenditure under Social Insurance and Social Assistance arises from the increases in Benefit and Assistance rates and other improvements effected by the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1965.  A part of it is, however, attributable to a rising trend in expenditure otherwise.  The 1965 Act provided, amongst other things, increases under the Insurance scheme of 10/- weekly in all the principal rates of periodic benefit for both beneficiaries and their adult dependants.  On the Assistance side, the Act provided for increases of 10/- or 5/- weekly, as appropriate, in the rates of non-contributory old age and widows' and orphans' pensions and 5/- in the rates of unemployment assistance for both applicants and adult dependants.</P>
    <P>As regards social insurance, provision is made for increasing the Exchequer contribution to the Social Insurance Fund under Subhead E by £1,300,000 bringing the estimated total for the year to £11,018,000.  As Deputies are aware, provision is made <Col N="877" /> under this subhead for payment into the Social Insurance Fund of the amount by which the expenditure of the Fund exceeds its income in any year.</P>
    <P>The revised expenditure of the Fund in the current year is now estimated at £27,790,000, an increase of £1,818,000 on the original provision.  Revised income is now estimated at £16,760,000, an increase of £506,000 on the sum originally estimated.</P>
    <P>The main increases in Fund expenditure are disability benefit £675,000, old age (contributory) pensions £270,000, unemployment benefit £358,000, widows' contributory pensions and orphans' contributory allowances £282,000 and Adminstration costs £117,000.</P>
    <P>On the income side, the increase is almost entirely attributable to an expected rise of £500,000 in the yield from employment contributions, the rates of which were increased from the beginning of last January.  In addition, the insurability limit for non-manual employment was increased from £800 to £1,200 with effect from 6th September, 1965.  One effect of the later provision is to bring back into compulsory insurance many employees who had received pay increases which brought their remuneration over £800 a year.</P>
    <P>As regards social assistance, the increased provisions are non-contributory old age pensions £1,780,000, unemployment assistance £461,000 and widows' and orphans' non-contributory pensions £230,000.  In this connection, I should mention that the additional expenditure arising out of the 1965 Act already referred to includes provision for paying unemployment assistance to smallholders in certain specified areas through a modification in their case of the system of assessing means for unemployment assistance purposes. This modification took effect from 3rd January last.</P>
    <P>In the case of the final subhead&mdash;L. Appropriations in Aid&mdash;the estimated increase of £102,000 in the current year falls under Subdivision 1&mdash;Receipt from the Social Insurance Fund under <Col N="878" /> section 40 of the Social Welfare Act, 1952.  This relates to administration costs incurred by my Department in connection with the social insurance scheme.  The increase of £102,000 in estimated receipts from the Fund arises out of the recovery of the insurance portion of the additional expenditure of £159,000 required for the administration Subheads A to D.</P>
    <P>I think I have covered the principal matters affecting this Supplementary Estimate.  I shall be glad, however, to furnish any further information which Deputies may require.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): This Supplementary Estimate, introduced on the eve of the Budget, affords an opportunity of discussing the rates of social welfare benefits, their adequacy or inadequacy, in relation to the cost of living.  Further, we will have the main Estimate for the Department in the not too distant future and that will provide an opportunity of going into the administration of the Department of Social Welfare in the detail. Therefore, I do not propose to take up the time of the House to any great extent in discussing these matters.</P>
      <P>There are, however, a few topics I should like to deal with briefly.  Since the Minister introduced his Estimate here last, we have had an increase in the rate of old age pensions and other social welfare payments resulting from moneys provided in the last Budget.  I propose to say a few words about the increase in the contributory old age pension from 37/6 a week to 47/6 a week and to ask the Minister a few questions arising from it.  We know that from August last the maximum rate of non-contributory old age pension was increased from 37/6 a week to 47/6 a week but we know also that in order to qualify for that maximum payment, the income of the pensioner or claimant could not exceed £26 5s. per year. I should like to ask the Minister to tell the House on what basis his Department increased the pensions payable at the rate of 37/6 a week to 47/6 a week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that these increases were <Col N="879" /> given on a hit or miss basis.  I should like to ask the Minister if any investigation was carried out.  On the discussion on the Budget, the Minister said it would not be necessary to carry out an investigation before granting this increase.  I know for a fact that no investigation was made but I am not complaining particularly about that. The point I want to make is that a certain percentage of old age pensioners who were in receipt of 37/6 a week had their pensions increased by 10/- a week to 47/6 as from 6th August, whereas the remainder did not receive any increase.  Many of the remainder who received no increase&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>They received 5/-, surely?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): Yes, that is what I mean.  Many of the remainder received an increase of only 5/-, but later on, in September, October and even in November, when they applied for the maximum increase of 10/-, it transpired that a good number of them were held to be entitled to the full increase but yet they were only paid the additional 5/-, bringing them up to the 10/-, from the date on which they applied for it, although it was manifestly clear from the investigation that their means did not exceed £26 5s per year on the relative date, 6th August, 1965.  The balance of this increase, namely, 5/-, should have been paid retrospectively as from 6th August when the investigation revealed that they were entitled to if from that date.  It is probably correct to say that prior to the Social Welfare Act, 1965, there was not a very strict investigation of means as between nil and £50 because a person with £50 qualified for the full old age pension of 37/6 a week.  Therefore it is difficult to see how some people were singled out and got the 47/6 from 6th August whereas others did not.  I am not suggesting that there were any ulterior, unfair or political motives involved&mdash;I want to make that perfectly clear&mdash;but it was <Col N="880" /> done on some sort of hit or miss basis which was unfair, and after the investigations these people should have received the full 10/- from 6th August. I trust that I have made that clear and I wait the Minister's comment.</P>
      <P>I should like now to deal with the method of calculating the means of claimants for old age pensions.  I think it is too harsh in certain cases.  The investigators and appeals officers rely on what I will describe as technical or legal income, which in fact is not actual income.  Take the case of a widow living on a farm with a son.  The owner of the farm has died many years ago&mdash; in some cases I know of, the owner died over 30 years ago&mdash;without leaving a will.  Some other members of the family have emigrated.  The son marries and brings in a wife and has children and for all practical purposes, the son is the owner of the farm.  He runs the farm and perhaps he has gone out and worked on the road and earned money to stock the farm, or has worked in England and has come home with the money to stock the farm.  Yet when the means of the widow are being calculated for the old age pension, she is deemed to be in receipt of one-third of the income from that farm because on her husband's death, many years ago, she became legally entitled to one-third. In many cases she is assessed with one-half because the other children are away, and the son is assessed with the other half.  As a result she gets a very reduced old age pension. I can point to many cases of that sort and I do not think it is a fair approach.  It is availing of technicalities to deprive this old lady of the pension to which she is clearly entitled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, if she takes out a grant of administration and goes through the formality of sending the deed halfway across the world, getting it executed by the people abroad, and executing it herself in favour of the son, then of course she becomes entitled.  I am aware of that, but furthermore, even if she assigns her interest over to the son who is at home, then unless the children who are abroad&mdash;and perhaps some of them cannot be found&mdash;also assign their interest in the farm to that son, the mother will be deemed to <Col N="881" /> have an income from it and will be deprived of the pension.  There should be a commonsense approach to this problem.  If there is a mother who is a widow, aged perhaps 72 or 73 years, living on a farm of 30 or 40 acres, with a son who is 40 years of age, perhaps married&mdash;indeed whether he is married or not&mdash;but certainly if he is married and has a family, does the world and his wife not know that the son is in control of the farm, that the son is running the farm and is in receipt of all the income, that it takes all that income and more to keep himself, his wife and his family in existence and that the old lady who is there is merely marking time until the Lord calls her?  She has no actual income from the farm at all.  I would like the Minister to look into that point and instruct his investigation officers to take a more practical approach when assessing the income of people of that type.</P>
    <P>There is only one other matter I want to mention.  It arises out of unemployment assistance for smallholders which comes under the Supplementary Estimate.  In the Social Welfare Act last year, the method of assessing the means of small farmers who are applicants for social welfare assistance in certain counties was changed.  In the case of a farmer whose valuation does not exceed £10, means is assessed at £20 per annum for every £1 valuation. Advertisements appeared in all the provincial papers inviting smallholders to apply for unemployment assistance. The smallholders in County Cavan thought Santa Claus had arrived prematurely. I am sure the Minister's Department was flooded with applications. However, the advertisement should have contained an example of the type of person who qualified.  A great number were disappointed. Applications came in by the hundred, but very few qualified.  I was thinking of putting down a question to ask the Minister in respect of a number of counties how many smallholders are in receipt of unemployment assistance this year as compared with last year and other years.  In some counties the new system worked to deprive people of unemployment assistance.  I know the Act <Col N="882" /> provided that a person in receipt of unemployment assistance last year could not be cut off this year, but in the counties with which I am familiar, no more people have qualified for unemployment assistance this year than in other years.</P>
    <P>We will have an opportunity of dealing more extensively with the adequacy of the benefits paid when discussing the Budget, and we will discuss the administration of the Department on the main Estimate.  I would ask the Minister to have second thoughts about the people who did not get the full 10/- per week old age pension under the 1965 Act until they applied for it.  Then they got it only from the date on which they applied, whether that was October, November or even January.  It may be a small sum to the Minister, but £5 or £6 is a lot of money to these old people.</P>
    <P>I would also ask the Minister to consider the case of the claimant for the old age pension who has not taken out a grant of administration to her husband who died many years ago. In fact, she has no income from the farm because her son living with her is the actual owner and is in receipt of all the income from the farm.</P>
    <P>In some counties the Minister might reconsider the effect of the new method of assessing the means of small farmers who are applicants for social welfare benefit.  I know the Minister had the best intentions when he introduced this.  I concede that when it was being introduced, I thought it would be a benefit, but I do not think it has worked out that way in all cases. I know that in theory, it means a small industrious farmer on a farm with a valuation of £9 could make a lot of money from it and still have his income assessed at only £180.  But in some cases it has worked out to the disadvantage of the people concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to have become the habit of the Government to keep bringing in Supplementary Estimates, admittedly for necessary things, right up to the end of the financial year.  Here, when we are about to start discussing the financial <Col N="883" /> year 1966-67, we have before us Supplementary Estimates for £3,835,000 for the financial year 1965-66, most of which has been spent.  The Minister may say he did not know this money would be required and that would be a fair explanation, But the Government should do better budgeting.  Some attempt should be made to know at the beginning of the year what money is actually being spent.  If that is not done, we are going to reach the stage where any Budget will simply be guesswork. If one looks at the number of Supplementary Estimates introduced this year, one must assume that the guesswork carried out by the Government before last year's Budget was particularly wild.  We have reached the stage where there seems to be a tremendous amount of extra money required.</P>
      <P>I have always found the Department of Social Welfare most co-operative from the Minister down.  I do not trouble the Minister very often because I do not believe Deputies should cry on the Minister's shoulder for every little problem.  The proper way is to raise it through the ordinary channels in the Department.  I have done that and I admit I have received nothing but courtesy from the Department. Occasionally you might meet a sore head, but we all cannot be in good form all the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year an alteration was made in respect of the non-contributory old age pension, but no attempt was made to assess the then means of those drawing the pension.  I had a few cases &mdash;I grant you, they were dealt with quickly&mdash;of people whose means had been assessed ten or 15 years earlier when they first applied, but no attempt was made to find out if their circumstances had altered in the intervening period.  It is all right to say these people should have known that with the new means test they would not qualify unless they proved their income was less than £26 a year.  But I do not think we should expect old people completely out of touch with the world, who find it extremely difficult to carry on their own existence, to know these intricacies.  The result was that many <Col N="884" /> people did not get the 10/- when they were in fact entitled to it.</P>
    <P>I would say that, even as yet, quite a number of people have not received the 10/- increase, though they were entitled to it, simply because they did not know and did not apply.  They still do not know why they were paid 5/-instead of 10/-.  There may be some way of resolving this problem, some way of re-assessing means.  Another point is that some people who got only 5/- queried it.  An investigation was carried out and, even though it was perfectly clear that at the time of the granting of the increase, namely, 1st August last, they had less than £26 per year, the increase was not granted to them retrospectively to that date; it was granted with effect only from the date on which they brought the matter to the notice of the Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the income of £26 per year, it is very difficult to calculate that a person has in fact less than £26 per year.  Deputy Fitzpatrick mentioned the person with a small farm which is being run by a son or some member of the family. In fact, the means are assessed against the original owner who had the farm in years gone by.  At old age pension sub-committee meetings, I am always intrigued by the way in which the pension officers assess means in these cases.  They seem to have an idea that if someone is working for himself or living with his parents, looking after the farm, all that person is entitled to is the minimum rate of wages for a 5 ½ day week.  I find it impossible to persuade these people that someone who is looking after a farm, particularly a farm on which stock is involved, does a seven-day week; he may get an hour or two off here and there, but, if he is looking after stock, he must be there on Saturday and Sunday as well.  In every case the minimum <Col N="885" /> rate of wages for an agricultural worker is trotted out by the pension officer, and it is assumed this is the rate that should apply.  Fresh instructions should be issued to these pension officers who assess means.</P>
      <P>Another thing that puzzles me is how these people can be expected to buy fencing and pay for its erection at the rate allowed for this type of work.  Those of us who have experience know that you cannot get someone to erect a fence in a couple of hours, though that is apparently what the pension officers think, and disappear after that, for the minimum agricultural wage.  Again, this reacts against the unfortunate person who is applying for a pension for the first time or for some increase that has been granted.  From the point of view of cost alone, there seems to be no idea of what fencing material actually costs.  Other replacements are treated in the same way.  They do not seem to be considered at all by the pension officer when assessing means.  That is a mistake; possibly it is due to the fact that the matter has never been brought forcibly to the attention of the Minister.  He should now have a look at this and see if he can adjust the situation.</P>
      <P>I know a number of people who applied for pension increases and got them without any delay. However, I should like to know whose was the big brain in the Custom House which decided there was only one way to deal with the matter and that was by calling in all the pension books.  The Minister is aware of what happened. There were piles of pension books lying in his Department for some unfortunates to wade through and, while this was happening, the income of those entitled to these pensions was nil.  I am not blaming the Government or anybody else for this.  But a mistake was made by somebody and such mistakes should not occur.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had experience of one particular case.  He was not a constituent but an acquaintance brought him in to me in my office here in Dublin.  The complaint was that for six weeks this man, who lived alone, had not got one <Col N="886" /> shilling from anybody.  If he was not hungry, he certainly looked it and, if he was not cold, he certainly ought to have been.  I phoned the Department at once and within 24 hours the man had the pension book in his possession. I am not blaming the officials who were trying to cope with this huge number of books and this very awkward situation.  I am blaming the individual who decided this was the way to deal with the matter.  Surely it could have been done in alphabetical order, perhaps, over a period in order to prevent hardship, a hardship which persisted right up to Christmas.  It was then the books were finally clear.  That is a blot on what is otherwise a wellrun Department.</P>
    <P>We shall be discussing the main Estimate in a short time and I will not therefore elaborate on the Department generally but there are one or two matters I should like to mention.  With regard to smallholders, it is very difficult for a smallholder on the MeathCavan border, living in very bad conditions, whose land is as bad as or worse than his neighbour's on the adjoining farm in Cavan, to see the man in Cavan entitled to draw assistance while he, because he is living in Meath, is not.  That is the type of discrimination to which the Government have lent themselves for quite a number of years, and not just this Government but successive Governments. If one lives in a certain area, one gets preference.  That is wrong. Deputy Clinton, a neighbour of mine, knows quite well the area about which I am talking.  Just beside the Cavan border this situation is causing a great deal of annoyance.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick talked about the people in Cavan who applied but got nothing; he did not hear half as many complaints as he would have heard if he had been living in Meath because of the numbers there who did not get it, not because they were in better conditions than those in Cavan but simply because they lived in County Meath.  These are reasonably intelligent people and I think the Minister should do something to make this apply all round.  For years people from <Col N="887" /> certain areas get preference over others where the division of land is concerned. This is an extension of that.  These people have a grievance, and rightly so.  They ask: &ldquo;Is it not extraordinary that if we lived in a certain area, we would be entitled to something to which we are not entitled now because we are living in a particular area?&rdquo; Where they live is what governs the situation.  That is wrong.  It makes a mockery of treating all the children of the nation equally; we are back to the old aphorism that all are born equal but some are more equal than others.</P>
    <P>Another matter is the way in which unemployment benefit figures are compiled. It could be embarrassing to the Government to allow people in certain areas to be included because they would be listed as unemployed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>But it is the Department of Social Welfare that pays the money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy is thinking of unemployment assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, of course; if I said &ldquo;benefit&rdquo;, I am sorry.  However, does the Minister suggest that the people who are receiving this assistance now are unemployed or are not looking for employment, because that is the test which is applied?  If they are looking for employment, they should be included in the list.  This is something which, I suppose, every Government have got away with since the State was founded or since statistics have been compiled.  It is something which no one should get away with.  In addition to people who sign at the employment exchange and who are being paid some benefit or assistance, there are thousands of people who have no job, who are anxious to get a job but who are not included for one reason or another.  A little bit of juggling around in compiling the figures may help the Government but it does not help the people who are affected by it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Quite a number of people have been <Col N="888" /> brought back into insurance, employees who have had increases which brought their remuneration over £800 a year, and arrangements have been made by the Minister's Department to ensure that if, through no fault of their own, they are out of benefit they will get credit to bring them back into benefit.  One of the things which so many of these people are glad about is that it brings them back for benefit under the Health Act, because most of those who are now included are people who would in the normal way&mdash;there are exceptions of course&mdash;be entitled to benefit from unemployment.</P>
    <P>The Minister is now preparing his Estimate for the coming year.  Is there any possibility, even at this stage, of trying to impress upon him this idea: since men and women who are 65 years of age&mdash;sometimes 64½ years of age if they are &ldquo;ikey&rdquo; enough&mdash;can draw unemployment benefit if there is no suitable employment for them from then until 70 years of age, is there any reason why these people should not be able to draw old age pensions at 65?  If the Minister cannot do it now, would he put it on the short list of amendments to his social welfare legislation? This matter does cause a great deal of trouble at the present time.  It means people have to travel and sign at the exchange, whereas when they reach 70, they can draw as much, or perhaps more, and they do not have to travel.  That is outside the ambit of this legislation but it is something the Minister might consider.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to draw the attention of the House to a certain anomaly in the present social welfare system.  The Minister is already aware of the matter to which I intend to refer but I believe it is important to mention it in the House.  On 27th August last year, employees in the Galway Foundry and Engineering Company who are members of the AEU Union decided to withdraw their labour.  As a result of this withdrawal of labour, the employers were forced to close down the foundry.  There were three or four other employees in the factory who were not a party to this strike but who were thrown out of employment, <Col N="889" /> due to the action of their fellow workers.  These men have been working, 30, 25 or 20 years with the firm and have been contributing towards the social welfare fund.  They reported to the union in Galway what had happened and were told to go back to the foundry and to offer themselves for work and not associate themselves with the AEU strike.  They went back to the firm and were told there was no work for them.</P>
      <P>A natural course for these workers then was to call down to the local labour exchange and sign on.  They were not accepted and they got no unemployment benefit, although they had been regular contributors for many years.  They were all men with families and they were left for two months without any assistance from the State and no means by which they could maintain their families.  They endured great hardship, and when I brought the matter to the notice of the Minister in November, the matter was rectified as from 1st November.</P>
      <P>However, the Minister informed me that he could not do anything about the anomalous situation, although I think he agrees it is something which needs improvement.  Where men are put out of employment due to a strike, even though they are not a party to it, I am told they are not entitled to any benefit.  If this is so, I am surprised that more attention has not been drawn to it in this House before now.</P>
      <P>I should like to put on record a letter of 22nd September, 1965, which was written by the manager of this firm, the Galway Foundry and Engineering Company, Ltd., to An Roinn Leasa Shóisinalaigh, Claddagh Quay, Galway:</P>
      <P>Re: M/s. P. Burke, P. Lee, M. Moran&mdash;Employees.</P>
      <P>A chara,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We write in connection with the above employees to state that it is now apparent that these workmen&mdash;&mdash;members of a different trade union than the tradesmen&mdash;were not consulted prior to the withdrawal of labour by the tradesmen on Friday, 27th August, but realised <Col N="890" /> that the factory could not continue to operate as a result of this action by the tradesmen.</P>
    <P>Whilst they are anxious to continue in their work here, the Company cannot, unfortunately, offer them suitable employment at present.</P>
    <P>I wish to put on record also a letter of 24th September, 1965, to the manager of the Galway Foundry and Engineering Company, Ltd., from the Branch Secretary of the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union:</P>
    <P>Dear Sir,</P>
    <P>This is to confirm that our three members, Patrick Burke, Martin Moran and Patrick Lee are not in dispute with the Galway Foundry and Engineering Company and are prepared to return to work, as the dispute which took place was an unofficial one involving members of the AEU.</P>
    <P>I should like to hear from the Minister if anything can be done to improve a situation like this where three honest, hardworking men, who were regular contributors to the Social Welfare Fund, can be deprived of benefit, even though they were not involved in the strike and at no time withdrew their labour.  I would ask the Minister to give this matter his attention so as to ensure that such a situation cannot arise in future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFoley" hpid="Mr. Foley Mr. Foley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>On this Estimate there is only one case which comes to mind as requiring amendment.  It is the case of a man who has been insured for a considerable number of years and who about a year or two before his death, becomes uninsurable.  He is a regular contributor to social insurance and his wife finds on this man's death that she is not entitled to a contributory pension. This is an injustice to the wife of a man who has contributed for a long number of years to social insurance, but who just because, not through his own fault, for two years, or maybe one year, before his death, he was not an insurable person.  Owing to this, his wife was not entitled to a contributory pension, whereas, on the other hand, in the case of a young married <Col N="891" /> man who has, let us say, not half the number of stamps this man has, on his death, his wife will receive a contributory pension.  I feel this is somewhat unjust and I would ask the Minister, in this particular case and in any similar case, to look into it and see if any adjustment can be made.</P>
      <P>I also feel that if the Department would deal with this on the basis of about ten or 15 years and work it on the basis of the number of contributions each man has made, it would cover this unfortunate person who does not receive a contributory pension just because her husband was not contributing two years before his death, although he may have contributed two or three times as much as the young man whose wife is entitled to a contributory pension.  That is only one case which I can see needs some adjustment.</P>
      <P>The increases given last year were substantial and were more than welcomed by all, but though they were substantial, the rates of pension are still too small.  I would ask the Minister to look into this again.  I know he has a very tight budget and has to keep within the limits of his Estimate but I would ask him to try once again to provide for this more needy section of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>In commenting on this Supplementary Estimate, one could say that the Minister has brought about great and beneficial changes in the social welfare code in the last number of years.  I must pay a tribute to him for having accepted a number of resolutions regarding the code in general and for easing in a very kindly way a number of provisions which pressed down on smallholders throughout the country who would be deemed to be in receipt of unemployment assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer to unemployment assistance and to say that we appreciate the Minister's action in relaxing the code in regard to this section of the community.  It is no mean achievement to extract from the Exchequer, last year, a sum of £5½ million which <Col N="892" /> was devoted solely to increases in unemployment assistance, social insurance and the remainder of the social welfare code in general, old age pensions, contributory and non-contributory pensions and so on.  While we all appreciate his action in dealing with benefits and assistance in general, I must come to a point which has for a very long time been a source of friction throughout the country in general in relation to the unemployment assistance code.</P>
    <P>We are familiar with the fact that certain types of farmers, primarily those deemed to be in the £1 to £10 rateable valuation class, go off unemployment assistance from March to the end of October.  We are not at all happy about the rules which provide that those farmers go off yearly at certain periods of the year, and it leads one to speak on the subject of what are known as Employment Period Orders.  Frankly, I have looked up the social welfare code and, going through it, I never can understand the reasoning or the logic behind what are known as First and Second Employment Period Orders.  It can be said at the outset that those orders are unjust, unfair and inequitable.  They are unjust in so far as the idea behind them seems to be that a farmer living on a rateable valuation of £3 19s 6d is entitled to remain on unemployment assistance throughout the year, while his neighbour, who may be living down the road, and who indeed may be in worse circumstances, who may have a larger family, is required to go off unemployment assistance from March to the end of October.  It can be said that these orders are inequitable in that that is so.</P>
    <P>We have a large number in that group.  From recollection the figure stands at something like 68,500 or 69,000 farmers in that particular category. I have no documentary proof before me, nor have I had time to brief myself properly on the subject, but some years ago I went into it in detail.  I think it was at an Árd Fheis that I brought this matter before a former Minister for Social Welfare and I again took up the subject last year. I think one would be correct in saygory <Col N="893" /> ing that one can appeal to the present Minister who has shown himself thoroughly familiar with all aspects of the social welfare code, especially in relation to smallholders and I believe one could appeal again on the floor of this House that something be done to wipe out these orders and to provide a more equitable system.  The present system is not just or right, and indeed, it is no incentive to better farming, even amongst small farmers. It is no incentive to increased production, nor is it an incentive to a higher standard of living amongst those farmers to continue to enforce such orders on this particular category of farmers.</P>
    <P>We are paying, and this House provides for, certain subsidies in respect of agriculture, housing, health and so on.  At the other end of the scale, we are providing that we shall penalise a man merely because he lives on a rateable valuation over £4 and we shall put him off unemployment assistance from March to October each year.  One could say, finally, that this provision has nothing whatever to recommend it to anyone who studies the social welfare code.  I make this appeal in the hope and in the knowledge that the Minister will do his best in this coming year to wipe out this inequality and so go a step further on the road to keeping up the good work he has been doing, because it will be admitted on all sides of the House that we have made great strides in social welfare in general.</P>

      <P>One cannot help but make references to the increase in the old age pension given last year in the Budget, but one must say that it is a kind of hit-and-run type of scheme.  I cannot, for the life of me, understand why these cases were not investigated prior to giving the increases.  I am quite satisfied that the Minister, in his reply, will say: &ldquo;Surely you did not want me to investigate every case in the country; you did not want to create hardship on the applicants by being re-investigated&rdquo;.  But I am fully convinced of this fact&mdash;that if it were not for our Just Society policy in the last general election, I doubt if there would <Col N="894" /> have been any increases given to the old age pensioners.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not terribly interested in whether or not the Deputy believes it&mdash;it is a fact.  The way in which the scheme is operated at the moment should be sufficient to convince the Deputy, or any other Deputy on that side of the House, of the fact. The 10/- was given to a number of people without investigation.  A number of people got 5/- more or less to shut their mouths but these people who did get the 5/- increase&mdash;and I do not know what percentage of them would have got it&mdash;re-applied to the Department of Social Welfare to get the full 10/- which, in my opinion, a big percentage of them were justly entitled to.  At the moment some of the cases are only being investigated and I am sure this investigation will go on for the next few months; but, when they are granted the extra amount, as Deputy Fitzpatrick has said, they should get it from the date the scheme was changed, away back in August of last year.  It is most unfair of the Department to deprive them of it.</P>
      <P>We have the case at the moment of a woman who is in receipt of a widow's pension and, when she comes to the age of seventy years, it is quite possible she would not qualify for the full old age pension, due to the method of calculation.  I do not think, in 1966, anybody's income should be reduced. The Minister should have another look at this and make sure that this unfortunate woman will get the full old age pension.</P>
      <P>Reference was made to the change in employment assistance.  If my information is correct, I think there will ultimately be, under the new Act now in operation, fewer people in receipt of unemployment assistance than there were prior to the introduction of the Act.  I think that will be the position in County Leitrim: fewer people will be in receipt of benefit.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>He is not interested. The basis of calculation is £20 to £1 of valuation.  For a farmer with a valuation of £10, the calculation is that his income is £200.  I do not know who got this brainwave but I wish the Minister or some of the higher officials of his Department could come down to any county in the west of Ireland and get himself an income of £20 on £1 poor law valuation.  It is altogether too high.  The Minister should have another look at it because, in my opinion, it is really ridiculous.</P>
      <P>Deputy Carter made a point, with which I am very much in agreement, in relation to the people in receipt of unemployment assistance for six months of the year if their valuation is over £4.  If it is under £4 they are in receipt of it for the whole year round. There is no reason why that figure of £4 could not be substantially increased in order to take in a bigger number of people who would qualify for benefit for the full year.  That figure of £4 has been there, I think, for some years and, due to the increased cost of living and many other things, everything suggests that the figure should be increased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like the Minister to give me some information on this matter.  The North Western Cattle <Col N="896" /> Breeding Society employed a number of people last year as warble fly operators, and the Department of Social Welfare have decided that these people are insurable.  They were not paid directly by the Society; they were paid by the farmers for whom they did the work.  A number of them, being sons of farmers, would not qualify for any benefit under the Act.  I should like the Minister to have another look at this.  The North Western Cattle Breeding Society appealed to the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Social Welfare about this decision.  I should like the Minister to make some reference to it when replying.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be very brief. Deputy Tully spoke about people who were brought back into compulsory insurance.  There is a section which is not insured at all, that is, domestic servants.  There is no justification for the fact that they are not eligible for unemployment benefit.  It may be true to say that normally it is easy for them to get a new job when they become unemployed, but in many cases these people have been in the same job for a considerable period of years, and having developed a set of habits, find it difficult to get a new position that will suit them.  Sometimes they become unemployed when they are at an advanced age, and this is a further disability they have to carry.  There are many cases of hardship which are well known because unemployment assistance is not available to them.  I would ask the Minister seriously to consider this section.  They have no trade union to back them and there are very few people to put their case forward.  They are an unfortunate section of the community who are being cast aside, so to speak, by the Department of Social Welfare.  I think the Minister should rectify this position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that in the future the same sound thinking will apply as applied last year and for some years past in relation to social welfare benefits.  Substantial increases were made last year in many of the benefits.  Many people feel that they are not up to the standard at which we would like to see them.  I hope further consideration <Col N="897" /> will be given to this in the future, and I trust that Minister, who is doing such a remarkable job, will ensure that the arguments which were valid on the last occasion will be valid in present circumstances.  I am quite sure that the national response which was there last year will be there in the future to meet any demand for a further increase in social welfare benefits.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately we were treated again to political speeches like that made by Deputy Reynolds who spoke about the policy of the Just Society, but there was an unjust society when they were in power and they should be ashamed to talk about social welfare advances. Cuts-back were a feature of their day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I can interpret the debate as meaning that the House in general is quite willing to give me the amount of money I am asking for in this Supplementary Estimate, and so far as I can interpret the tone of the debate, the only complaint is that it is not more.  I am always interested to hear suggestions for improvements in our social welfare services.  I would be the last person to say that we have <Col N="898" /> reached the end of social welfare development in this country.  I can see many more things waiting to be done and, indeed, mostly when suggestions for specific improvements are made, they do no more than confirm my own opinion as to what are the desirable lines on which to make progress.</P>
      <P>The only limit to the development of social welfare is the availability of money, that is, the capacity of the community to finance it.  Therefore, all the suggestions made for specific improvements have to be considered in conjunction with the need which I admit is still there to improve the rates of payment in the existing social services&mdash;not all of them.  Some are reasonably satisfactory in our circumstances, but social assistance payments in particular, I quite freely admit, are inadequate for the purpose which they have to serve.  There is an urgent need to improve them.  The thing is that there has had to be&mdash;always I suppose but in particular since we got back in 1957&mdash;a concentration on improving our economy, on improving the capacity of the community to finance social welfare.  In spite of that necessity, as I have pointed out on a number of occasions, we have been able to arrange for gradual improvements in social welfare.  In this Supplementary Estimate, we are asking for money to be provided to finance the first really major step forward that was made last year.  As I said before, that can only be regarded as the beginning of a process that must continue according as it is possible to get the money to improve these benefits.  I am not by any means complacent with regard to the level of social welfare cover in this country and I hope to see many further improvements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think Deputy Tully was on the wrong lines when he referred to what he described as this habit of keeping Supplementary Estimates until the end of the year rather than having the actual Estimate when introduced sufficiently accurate to cover the amounts that will have to be spent. As Deputy Tully knows, the Book of Estimates is published before the Budget.  This increased expenditure we are dealing with here today arose <Col N="899" /> largely because of the increases granted in the Budget, plus some other extensions of the Social Welfare Act which were made last year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I take it, then, that when the Book of Estimates is being prepared there is no knowledge of proposed increases?</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Book of Estimates is framed, purely and simply, on the basis of the legislation that exists at the time for the provision of social welfare services.  Therefore, in any year in which increases are granted, we may take it that unless something extraordinary happens there must be a Supplementary Estimate.  Since Fianna Fáil took over in 1957, there has been such a Supplementary Estimate every year because it is only since that time that social welfare increases have become so regular.  So, the Supplementary Estimate is inevitable.  The Social Welfare Supplementary Estimate, in particular, is usually kept until fairly late in the financial year so that it can be as accurate as possible.  It is not easy to make an exact estimate of what these increases will cost and the later we keep it in the financial year the more accurate the estimate will be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was surprised to find, in the discussion of this Supplementary Estimate, some criticism of the fact that, before the award of the 10/- increase in the case of old age pensioners whose means are under £26 5s. a year is made, there is no investigation of circumstances. If Deputies will look back over the speeches that were made both at the time of the Budget last year and on the Social Welfare Bill, they will see that one of the major criticisms advanced was that this would mean a wholesale reinvestigation of means by the Department of Social Welfare.  A dire picture was painted of what the result of such a reinvestigation would be. <Col N="900" /> I pointed out that we had, in fact, got the information available on which to base these awards.  It is true that some of the information was rather out of date.  In a number of those cases where a question was raised for the increase of the pension, the means, as previously assessed, were reduced and the increased rate of pension was paid. Therefore, what has happened, in fact, has been, if anything, the reverse of what is was suggested would happen. We have not had a wholesale &ldquo;upping&rdquo; of the means of old age pensioners. Instead of that, our estimate of the number of people who would qualify for the maximum rate of pension was on the small side and, in fact, a bigger percentage have qualified.  In cases where there was a reassessment of means&mdash;mainly as a result either of a direct request from the pensioner or approaches by public representatives&mdash; there have been a number of instances where the means have in fact been reduced and the higher pension awarded.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall come to that later.  That is due to the system that application for an increase in pension has to go through this process of the old age pensions committee and it can only be increased or decreased as a result of a question being raised with regard to the means and it can be done only from the date on which that question was raised.  I can see no way out of that short of abolishing the system for the award of pensions that exists at the moment and, indeed, that might not be a bad idea.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see why the same consideration should not apply. I think the type of case Deputies referred to here was rather the type of case in which the means assessments had become out of date and the means had actually decreased, possibly because of reduced efficiency of the person concerned.  The estimate that was made of the numbers that would qualify for the maximum rate of pension at the time of the Social Welfare Bill was that 71,000 would qualify for 10/- and roughly 41,000 for 5/-.  In actual fact, 81,551 have received 10/-and 31,734 have received only 5/-, that is, 73 per cent of old age pensioners have qualified for the maximum increase. Therefore, I think the allegation that what was described as a new means test would be very severe and would result in increasing means being assessed against a large number of existing old age pensioners has been proved wrong and should be withdrawn.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>There are people worse off.  Only a few weeks ago, Deputy Esmonde asked me if I would not think of providing something extra for those who have no means&mdash; and I think he was on the right lines.  I think that it is in that direction we should move.  We should have pensions graduated as far as possible in accordance with the means of the people, when the amount of money that is available is limited&mdash;and the amount of money which is available for social welfare, although it has been increasing, is still limited and I certainly cannot visualise a time when it will not continue to be limited.</P>
      <P>It was claimed by Deputy Fitzpatrick that the means test for old age pensioners is too harsh.  In fact, the means test for old age pensioners is a lot less rigorous than the means test for other social assistance benefits.  A number of things are disregarded. Deputy Tully went into some detail about the method of assessing the means of farmers.  His experience appears to be that a realistic view is not taken of the expenses incurred by old people in extracting some income from a small farm.  It may be that there is some need to have another look at the manner in which the cost of materials and labour is taken into account.  On a number of occasions, in looking at particular cases, I must say that I had some doubt about that but on the whole I think it was quite fair, although we may need to get some more uniformity into the system of allowing for costs of production on the farm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point raised was the question of an old age pensioner who has <Col N="903" /> a son, whether married or single, working on the farm and to all intents and purposes in control of the farm.  In a case like that, whether it is a case of intestacy or not, it can be dealt with by the old age pensioner or pensioners, whether man or woman or both husband and wife handing over his or her or their interest, whatever it may be, in the farm.  So long as that is done in an irrevocable way, the means of the farm will not be assessed against that person or persons.  It is reasonable to ask that to be done before the person or persons can be dissociated from the farm profits.  They should divest themselves of their interest in it a legally binding way.  Apart from anything else, that is good social policy. They can maintain the right of residence and maintenance in the home and that is assessed at a very nominal value, usually a shilling a week or £2,12,0 a year.  Very likely, as Deputy Fitzpatrick said, they have not in fact got any more rights on the farm than residence and maintenance and do not get any more out of it.  It is a very considerable advantage to elderly people residing on farms to have the handing over of the farm accepted for old age pension purposes and I think rather than press me to do something more about this, Deputies should encourage old people to hand over their farms in such circumstances to their sons or daughters or nephews or other young persons residing and, in fact, working the farms.</P>
    <P>Questions were raised in regard to the unemployment assistance scheme for small farmers and the new method of means assessment.  This has in fact brought a large number of people into benefit who were not getting any assistance before and, to my knowledge, has not adversely affected anybody.  I do not see why it should because there is a provision that anybody who finds the factual method of means assessment more favourable can opt to remain on that system.  It was suggested that the assessment of £20 per £1 valuation is far too high. No doubt it is higher than the amount being extracted from these farms by many of the people concerned but at <Col N="904" /> the same time, some thousands of new people qualified under this method of assessment who were ineligible when the factual method was applied.</P>
    <P>That shows that this is not as excessive as some people thought because in fact people who were excluded on the factual basis can qualify under this method of means assessment.  It shows that for the really industrious and efficient farmer at any rate, it is not too high.  For one reason or another, a number of people are not extracting that amount from their farms but we have had only a short period of experience of this method of assessing means and I, certainly, would not be inclined to reduce the amount, at any rate until I have some considerably longer experience of its operation.</P>
    <P>While dealing with unemployment assistance for small farmers, I should mention that one of the suggestions made by Deputy Carter, and which was supported by Deputy Reynolds, was that the practice of making Employment Period Orders should be discontinued. There are theoretical justifications for both the first and the second Employment Period Orders.  I am not going to give them to the House again because I am not convinced of the force of these arguments at all.  The one reason I will give for not abolishing the Employment Period Orders is that according to the latest estimate it would cost £590,000.  Any question of spending more money on this aspect of social welfare has to be considered in conjunction with the claims of all other sections.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely that argument assumes that all the people who are disbarred because of the Employment Period Order would in fact be unemployed over the period?  That is the biggest argument the Minister has against it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>No. I can tell Deputy Tully that the officers of my Department are quite well able to take account of the number of people who would in fact get employment.  At any rate the estimated cost is £590,000.  I have not got that amount available and I do not know when it will be possible to consider stopping the practice <Col N="905" /> of making Employment Period Orders. I suppose one effect of it is that it does encourage people whose own farms are small to take casual labour with larger farmers and to take whatever employment is available in these rural areas.</P>
      <P>It was suggested by Deputy Tully that this new method of means assessment for unemployment assistance for small farmers should be extended outside the areas where it applies.  The decision to do this was based on the fact that there are certain areas where the small uneconomic farm predominates and constitutes a separate kind of social problem which is peculiar to these areas, and the definition of the congested districts which we have taken for this purpose is the widest definition that is available.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Molloy raised the question, which has been raised before by way of Parliamentary Question, of people who are disemployed because of strike action taken by other people, not being eligible for unemployment benefit.  As I have explained before the possibility of arriving at a more acceptable formula for this is under discussion with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the last discussions took place with them in 1964.  Since then the <Col N="906" /> Congress has been studying the situation and their further views are awaited.  If we are to arrive at a more acceptable formula, it is desirable to get the views of the people concerned first before&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>My colleague, Deputy Foley, referred to the position of the widow of a man who had been an insured worker for practically all his life but went out of compulsory insurance a few years before his death and did not avail of the opportunity to become a voluntary contributor.  I think he is thinking of the same case as I am thinking of myself.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a matter which is under consideration.  The existing provision, whereby eligibility for a widow's contributory pension is based on insurance over the last three or five years, was originally intended to make it easy for a widow to qualify for the contributory pension, and of course it does that in the case of a widow of a man who became insurable only comparatively shortly before his death.  It has, however, had the effect of excluding some people whose husbands had quite a long insurance record, and I agree that that is something which should be looked into.</P>

    <P>The point which Deputy Dowling raised was raised last year in some of the discussions we had, that is, in connection with unemployment benefit for <Col N="907" /> domestic servants.

I am not in a position as yet to say whether or not I will be making changes in that sphere this year, but if we have a Social Welfare Bill, I suppose the matter can be discussed then.

      <P>To continue last night's discussion, I was about to draw to the Minister's attention the expense involved in the use of the helicopter mercy service.  I also told him about the publicity that was given to it both by his Department and the Department of Defence.  Mercy missions are all right, but are they mercy missions?  My experience proves that the opposite is the case, that they are merciless missions. When I inquired as to the expense <Col N="908" /> involved in the carrying of a critically ill patient by helicopter, I was told&mdash;so were the Limerick Health Authority&mdash;by the Department that the cost of the mercy mission service was £67 an hour from the time the plane leaves its stable in Casement Aerodrome until it flies back.</P>
      <P>I see no mercy attached to such a mission and I should like to point out to the Minister&mdash;I wonder why he is not here this morning&mdash;that you can charter a plane from Shannon Airport to carry 20 or 30 people to Belfast for a much smaller sum.  In reply to a question last week or the week before, the Minister stated it was purely a book arrangement, a book entry as between his Department and the Department of Defence.  That was the impression he left not alone on the House but on the people of the country generally.  I do not know what the Minister means by the term &ldquo;book entry&rdquo;.  I call it a book exit&mdash;an exit from the cheque book of the person involved.  I see nothing but an exit and a brutal one at that&mdash;£67 per flying hour.  Where is the mercy about that mission?</P>
      <P>I throw my mind back to a couple of years ago when they were snowed out in County Wicklow and an unfortunate woman, a maternity case, was brought down a mountainside on a shutter.</P>

      <P>By Limerick Health Authority who are directly under that Minister's control.  I wish to impress upon the Minister that we must get rid of this hypocrisy that is being carried on by the Minister since he took office&mdash;this camouflage, this misleading of the people about the mercy service.  What the Minister is saying in words he is denying in actions.  I am sorry he is not here; I suppose he has a good reason for being absent.  This thing has got to be stopped if we are to be honest, if we wish to get the job done.  We in the Labour Party have gone to extremes to see that the people get a good health service, and we are right behind anything the Minister may do to improve the services.  Before leaving the subject of the helicopter service, I should like to say that I intend raising it tomorrow morning at a meeting of the Limerick Health Authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last night we dealt with the question of doctors and hospitals and with other matters referred to in this document of Mr. Aesop.  We dealt with the ophthalmic services, with the treatment of the poor old people to whom I referred as discards.  I instanced how ruthless some of the resident medical superintendents can be in the insistence on their rights <i>vis-á-vis</i> the secretary of the health authority and the county or city manager who is primarily responsible for the administration of the health services by the authority.  One such superintendent&mdash;I have had experience of this&mdash;has questioned the right, the presence of our city manager in an institution in which the superintendent is alleged to be superintending.  When our city manager, while investigating a complaint made by me, went to the hospital, his presence there was questioned by the resident medical superintendent. I pointed out last night that on many occasions patients requested me to go there and see them, but when I went there, at reasonable times, I was refused admission by that superintendent. I was told I had no right other than the right to call during normal visiting hours laid down for <Col N="911" /> the ordinary general public.  I applied to the Minister for Health to have the matter rectified and brought into line with the regulations in regard to mental hospitals, where members of the board are entitled to call at reasonable times.  That was turned down by the Department within the past five or six months.</P>
    <P>We have the Minister now coming along taking upon himself the right to pack these committees&mdash;I shall deal with this later&mdash;and I am sure the Minister for Health, being honest, knows nothing at all about packing or gerrymandering.  I know that well.  He is a very innocent boy, God bless him. I said it last night and I shall say it again tomorrow night if I am alive. However, is it not a sad state of affairs that we, who have stood trial before the verdict of the people, have not got the right to cry halt to some screwball who is in a job he is not fitted for and to which he is not entitled?</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should not attack officials.  The Minister for Health is responsible for the administration of his Department and any criticism should be directed at him, not at individual officials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="StephenCoughlan" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to bring this matter to the notice of the Minister so that he can act on it.  I want him to realise what can happen when too much power is given to an individual. Any philosopher will tell him that it is not everyone who can wear authority. Some people with authority do not know whether it is turned inside or outside across their shoulders.  They cannot wear it.  They try to impress on everyone the great people they are. We, the elected representatives of the people, have to work in the interests of the people and we should not be hampered by such people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come now to another unfortunate section of the community who have received little or no consideration in the White Paper, the mentally handicapped children.  In my part of the country, we long knew of the &ldquo;cupboard child.&rdquo;  It was like consumption long ago; everybody ran away from <Col N="912" /> it.  Thank God, Noel Browne surfaced it and made it like an ordinary cold in the head.  But we still have the &ldquo;cupboard child&rdquo;&mdash;the child thrown into the cupboard when the neighbours or visitors come into the house. There is no provision for such children in this much publicised White Paper, Were it not for the charity, hard work and devotion of the religious orders, I do not know where we would be.  I have experience in my constituency of their hospitals and schools and the work they are doing to try to provide some place in life for these unfortunate children.</P>
    <P>It is a downright shame for the Minister that he has not provided a large sum for the education and training of these children.  The Minister may be excused for not knowing the price of the helicopter but he has no excuse so far as this is concerned.  Every year the Minister and I organise certain charitable functions, football matches, dances, flag days and so on in the city of Limerick.  He organises a team and I organise a team to play each other in a friendly match.  Every year we get about £500 or £600 from this. We started these functions because we saw how neglected such children were in Limerick.</P>
    <P>Our first action when we got a few quid together was to start a school for mentally retarded children.  I went to His Lordship, the Bishop of Limerick, and he gave me his wholehearted support. He sent two Sisters of Charity for special training, and they are now teaching those children in the school in Limerick.  But we were faced with the problem of transporting these children to the school.  It was because of that we started these charitable functions.  We now have a minibus on the road.  It collects the children every morning from door to door, brings them to the school and back home again in the afternoon.  In this Christian country of ours today, is it not a sad reflection that we have to go cap in hand begging charity to try to do something which is the responsibility of the Department of Health?</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government (Mr. P. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Minister not indisibilit <Col N="913" /> cate on page 44 of the White Paper that he is doing something?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="StephenCoughlan" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall come to that in a minute.  We also have the problem of X-rays.  In the Limerick Health Authority, we cannot cope with the demand for X-rays we have every day of the week.  A person is sent for an X-ray.  It may or may not be a simple thing, but that person is out of work. He may have to wait three, four or five weeks before he gets to the X-ray because the queue is so long.  He has to resort to social welfare benefit, workmen's compensation or maybe home assistance.  Nothing is being done about this problem.  We have complaints about it every day at meetings of the health authority but yet nothing is done.  I would impress on the Minister the necessity for, not an overdose, but a good healthy dose of these pep pills he talks about in the White Paper.  Instead of condemning pep pills, he should recommend them for himself and his Department to put a bit of life in them and get something done.</P>
      <P>On the question of children's allowances, the Minister has doubled these but, again, we say that is not enough. With regard to the increased maternity benefits, I can tell the House that it was a hard battle to get an increase in maternity benefit for the quads in Limerick.  It took six months of ballyragging the Minister every day and it was only in deference to public opinion that he gave the increase in the end.  The Minister proposes to increase maternity benefit 100 per cent.  I am rather wondering about another Minister who gives £15 for a calf.  But the Department of Health gives only £8 for the birth of a child.  I do not know which is regarded as the more important, the calf or the child.  It is £15 in one case and only £8 in the other. Nevertheless, £8 is a big jump from £4 and a bigger jump still from £1, which was all it was for the quads in Limerick, £1 per head.  This is some improvement, but it does not go far enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like now to do a little parsing and analysis on Mr. Aesop. As I said last night, this is a stolen <Col N="914" /> document; nearly everything in it has been stolen from the Labour Party.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Labour document in miniature.  I want to go back now to the days when we were in the back bench of the Leaving Cert. class.  It is a big change from that to the front bench of the House of Parliament. At page 23, paragraph 27, the Minister states:</P>
      <P>It will become increasingly necessary to ensure that doctors in general practice have opportunities for post-graduate study to keep themselves familiar with developments in medicine.</P>
      <P>The Minister does not tell us what facilities he will make available to the GP to enable him to do a post-graduate course.  How will it be done? I think we will have to prescribe a fine dose of sleeping pills for ourselves, as well as pep pills, so that we may start dreaming.  This is nothing but a dream, the most of it.  The part stolen from the Labour Party we want to see implemented as quickly as possible, but I fear it will not happen in our time.</P>
      <P>In paragraph 31, the Minister says:</P>
      <P>A recent projection of the population, prepared by the Central Statistics Office, taking into account the natural increase (that is the excess of births over deaths) and allowing for a reduction in emigration with economic development, suggests that the population by 1976 may be as high as 3,152,000 and that by 1981 it may be almost 3,400,000.</P>
      <P>More sleeping pills: more of the dreams.  Where did the Minister get that figure?  What does he think we are?  I want the Minister to answer these questions when he comes to reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="915" /> In paragraph 32, we find:</P>
    <P>Secondly, the changing balance as between the rural and the urban population will affect the organisation of the services and, in some degree, the diseases which they will be designed to combat.  In 1960, 37.0 per cent of our workers were employed in agriculture, forestry and fishing.  By 1970, it is expected that this proportion will have dropped to 28.7 per cent.</P>
    <P>What a reflection!  We want to see rural Ireland preserved, maintained and populated, and here is the Minister telling the truth for once: the flight from the land is on and he is preparing for it; he hopes and prays it will continue with even greater speed than in the past.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 44 deals with proposals for new service.</P>
    <P>The details of this service will be discussed with the medical profession...</P>
    <P>I repeat what I said last night; the word &ldquo;discussion&rdquo; and the phrase &ldquo;will be discussed&rdquo; appear on every page of this White Paper.  &ldquo;Discussions will take place: This will be discussed.&rdquo; I am sure every Deputy was circularised by the Medical Association with regard to payment and it is our understanding that there is disagreement already in that matter. However, discussions will take place. I am dizzy from the repetition of the phrase in this document.</P>
    <P>... before any final decisions are taken, but it is possible at this stage to indicate that the Government have in mind that the service will be such that an eligible person will have the right to be attended by any doctor participating in the scheme who is living within a reasonable distance...</P>
    <P>What is a reasonable distance?  That has to be defined.</P>
    <P>... who is willing to take him as a patient and who has not already a full list of patients...</P>
    <P>Where do we put up the &ldquo;House <Col N="916" /> full&rdquo; sign?  I want the Minister to tell us that when he is replying.  I want to know what this means.  I know what the document is all about.  I know why it was introduced.  I will take the song and dance out of it now once and for all.</P>
    <P>In the same paragraph, on page 32, we find:</P>
    <P>but that there would probably have to be some restriction on entry into the service by other doctors, to avoid too many doctors participating in any area and each not having a worthwhile panel...</P>
    <P>Who is advocating restrictions here and who will administer the restrictions? Who is going to find out whether the panel is worthwhile or not?  Some doctors are available the whole round of the clock and some engage in activities like shooting, fishing, golf, and so on.  Who will plan the panel?</P>
    <P>Paragraph 45 on the same page reads:</P>
    <P>... The dispensaries would not be retained by the health boards for the provision of general medical services. Where the premises were suitable and were not needed for other health services, it might sometimes be possible to rent or sell them to doctors for adaptation as general surgeries.</P>
    <P>To me that means that the doctor can buy the old dispensary or what remains of it from the health authority.  If it is not in good condition, he can put it into a condition where people can visit him.  Then he will divide the &ldquo;haves&rdquo; from the &ldquo;have-nots&rdquo;.  The men and women with the medical cards, the &ldquo;have-nots&rdquo; will go down to the old dispensary, but the &ldquo;haves&rdquo; will go up to his parlour and sit down and read <i>Time</i> or whatever is put before them in the waiting room.  The rats can continue to run around the dispensary as they are doing at present.  I want to see that sort of thing stopped.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>That will not be for a long time.  Fianna Fáil are funking the local elections, as it is.  Do not draw me into that arena.  Paragraph 48, page 33, deals with the supply of drugs, medicines and appliances under the new service.  The last sentence of it reads:</P>
      <P>It is, therefore, hoped to negotiate a satisfactory and economical scheme with representatives of the retail pharmaceutical chemists under which prescriptions given by doctors to patients under the service would be dispensed by retail chemists from stocks supplied by the health authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apparently the health authority will buy a delivery van and go round to the chemist shops in Limerick and throw in boxes of medicines and tell the chemist to fill his shelves with them.  A chemist is a highly qualified man.  He has to do a very difficult course in chemistry and science and the examinations are extremely stiff. The majority of candidates fail their final examination when doing it for the first time.  That is an indication of the severity of the examination for pharmacists.  The Minister has taken it upon himself to turn this highly proficient man into a messenger boy and a parcel wrapper.  There will be no longer any compounding to be done.  All his years of education and of swotting at night time when every-body else is asleep will go for nothing. I do not think that is fair.  All he will have to do is read the doctor's prescription <Col N="918" /> and hand out the medicine over the counter.  I should like to hear more from the Minister about the supply of drugs when he is replying.</P>
    <P>It is very easy to be critical.  There are many good things in this White Paper.  Being a Labour document, it was bound to be so.  The Minister has stolen our document and rehashed it. He has no intention of implementing it.</P>
    <P>We agree with what is proposed in paragraph 51, page 34.  At present in the issue of medical cards, the income of the house, the rent and overtime are taken into account.  The application for the medical card is sent to one employer, then to the second employer, and to the third employer.  From there, it is sent to the labour exchange and to the home assistance officer.  It is time for a change in that system.  We agree with the proposal that only the means of the person concerned and his or her spouse would be taken into account.</P>
    <P>We agree completely with paragraph 57 on page 36, dealing with the general nursing.  We come then to paragraph 59, page 37, where treatment in hospital is needed for defects discovered in school health examinations in national schools.  This treatment is provided irrespective of the parents' means.  I am glad the Minister for Education is here.  Why not apply this to all primary, secondary and vocational schools?  You cannot go half the road; you must go the whole way.  As you have made your bed, you must lie on it.  We maintain that this school examination should apply generally to all schools, primary, secondary, technical and vocational.</P>

      <P>One man or two men.  However, we will leave the poor Minister alone.  He has enough on his plate and we will let charity prevail at this stage.  We will give him our moral support as far as it will take him.  I want to say, on behalf of my Party, that we are concerned that this matter should be one for national schools only.  Why not apply it to all <Col N="919" /> children?  As far as we are concerned, they are all equal and are all entitled to the same benefits.  They can demand the same benefits and why not let them have them?  I cannot see, for the life of me, why our medical officers cannot enter the private schools or secondary schools and carry out an examination just as detailed as they do in the national schools.  I am putting that before the Minister for his consideration.</P>
      <P>I want to move on a bit.  I have already dealt with the helicopter service, and I want to move on now to page 45, paragraph 81.  That brings me back again to the discards, those poor unfortunates who have been thrown on the dung-heap of life.  The Minister comes along here and gives a figure based on the year 1961.  Why 1961?  Why did he not come closer home?  Is it because the figure for 1961 suits his palate and would be much more palatable to his Party and the people?  Is he being untruthful with us? I am sure that is the last thought in the Minister's head, knowing him as I do.  It is not within his power.  I want to know why he did not give us a later figure if it was available.  I do not know whether it is or not.  He gave us, on the preceding page, page 44, the same figure here for the years 1936, 1946, 1951 and 1961.  Why not bring it up to date and I am sure we would have a more vivid and certainly a more unpleasant picture of the situation with regard to our discards, the old people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We agree in full with paragraph 83 on page 46 in connection with home nursing.  This is a good idea.  As I said last night, thanks be to God, we have reached a stage in the country today where girls of Leaving Certificate honours standard are clamouring for the nursing profession.  They cannot be facilitated.  I am glad the Minister has now set about making some provision for those people and at the same time, is giving us this home nursing, as I will call it, which is badly needed.  This will save our hospitals a whole lot of trouble and make beds available for more urgent cases.  We are in whole-hearted agreement with that.  I have <Col N="920" /> already dealt with the maternity cash grants and compared them with the heifer scheme of the Minister for Agriculture.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>You will not throw me off.  I already discussed, last night, the dental service.  Indeed the Minister for Health got front page news this morning in one of our national papers with regard to the statement he made concerning the services as supplied in Limerick city.  I am sure, at our health meeting tomorrow, he will be taken to task on that, as he has already been taken to task by the manager and the secretary of our health authority when he made an outrageous accusation with regard to an overdraft we were carrying of £300,000.  He accused us of ineptitude, as he did the Dublin Health Authority, last week.  He accused us of not being up to date and of being backward in arranging our accounts and our estimates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The matter was thrashed out at our last health authority meeting but there has been no reply from the Minister since.  That is only one of the times he has had to sit back in his box as far as Limerick is concerned.  It happened again at a Tuairim meeting the other night with regard to this.  With the help of God, we will have a treble after tomorrow's meeting of the health authority in Limerick with regard to the dental services which he said to me last night were the worst in Ireland. <Col N="921" /> That will be proved tomorrow.  I do not accept it at this stage.</P>
    <P>I now come to the final few paragraphs in this document on which I expect a clear-cut and honest reply from the Minister.  He says, on page 61, paragraph 121, that having regard to the general economic conditions, he is going to see what public expenditure in hospital buildings can be carried out.  We are anxiously awaiting that.</P>
    <P>I come now to the most important paragraph of the whole document.  On page 64, paragraph 126 says:</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the strong case for changing the administration of the health services in this way the Government would not wish the change to be made if there were a danger that the transfer from them of their health functions would so diminish the scope of the local authorities' work that they would become ineffectual bodies evoking little interest in the community.  This danger is not real.  If the existing local authorities lose the direct administration of the health services, which now makes up about one-third of their total activities, they will still remain beneath the Government itself, probably the most important administrative organs in the State.  Shorn of their health functions, the county councils would but be restored, as respects the scope of their work, to what they were in the nineteen-thirties, as health services of our present-day scope are quite a recent addition to their functions.</P>
    <P>Listen then to this amusing statement:</P>
    <P>The local councils will retain responsibility for the general planning and development of their areas, for the improvement and maintenance of the roads system, for housing development, for sanitary services and for several other general local governments functions.</P>

      <P>The road across the former Rockingham estate from Boyle to Ardcarne, which is not a public road, has deteriorated in some places due to heavy traffic and to work on the laying of water pipes which is at present in progress.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that the statement in question was much too sweeping and did not present a fair and balanced picture.  The Pigs and Bacon Commission's staff are doing a good job on the selection of bacon for export and my Department's veterinary staff are concerned to ensure that the highest possible standards of hygiene are maintained in the factories.</P>
      <P>In the case of many factories, major works of reconstruction and re-equipment are being carried out under my Department's scheme of grants for the modernisation of bacon factories, and these works are contributing greatly to the improvement of conditions at the factories concerned, many of which are quite old.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that there has been an appreciable improvement generally in the quality of our bacon in the past few years.  Naturally, all concerned will continue to strive for a further improvement.</P>

      <P>The Minister will agree that these remarks have caused considerable concern and the Minister will remember that about 12 months ago I raised this matter very strongly in the House and the outcome at that time was that I got a foolish solicitor's letter.  I am very disappointed that no improvement has since taken place. Can the Minister tell the House whether any serious action has been taken against offenders since that date?  At that time the Minister said he was going to institute some form of fines for offenders.  Has that been done? Has any firm been fined?  Was any serious action taken to make them come into line, or are a limited number being allowed to export inferior bacon as suggested?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a very tendentious sort of question.  First of all, this statement by this member of the Pigs and Bacon Commission came as a great surprise to everyone concerned, because on two recent occasions the Chairman of the Pigs and Bacon Commission indicated that considerable improvements were achieved over the past year or so in the quality of bacon exported. For instance, in an address to the bacon curers and farmers, on 21st January, the Chairman of the Pigs and Bacon Commission said that there was a significant and sustained improvement in the past year in the quality of our bacon exported.  I think most of the people concerned in this matter would agree that that is the position. As I have said, strenuous efforts are made at all times by the staff of the Pigs and Bacon Commission, and the veterinary officers of my Department responsible for these matters, to improve the situation.  We spend a great deal of money on grants to bacon factories to help them to modernise their premises and bring them in line with modern requirements.  Action is taken constantly&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>In one case a bacon factory was closed down because of <Col N="932" /> its inability to meet our requirements. Apart from the rather drastic action of closing down a factory, we are by instruction, propaganda and exhortation endeavouring to improve the position. Only grade A special and grade A bacon are exported.  All bacon exported is examined first by the veterinary officers of my Department for butchery and hygiene, and subsequently by inspectors of the Pigs and Bacon Commission, for quality.  No opportunity is lost to impress on everyone concerned the necessity of ensuring the highest possible quality.  Only last month we had a conference of the veterinary staff concerned in my Department which reviewed the whole position and discussed what could be done to improve matters, and decided on various actions which will be taken.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The special supplementary examination in Irish for recognised pupils who would have qualified for the award of the Leaving Certificate if they had not failed in Irish is being provided in implementation of recommendation 178 of An Coimisiún um Athbheochan na Gaeilge as accepted by the Government in the White Paper &ldquo;Athbheochan na Gaeilge&rdquo;.  No such recommendation was made in regard to the Intermediate Certificate.</P>
      <P>In any event, the conditions for the award of the Intermediate Certificate are not the same as those relating to the award of the Leaving Certificate. I am satisfied that the position in this regard in so far as the Intermediate Certificate is concerned is adequately catered for in the provision which enables a candidate to be deemed to have passed the examination, who, having passed in four other subjects, fails in Irish but obtains at least 30 per cent of the total marks in that subject.  Furthermore there is a choice of two Irish papers, one of which is set on a lower course.</P>

Grants have been given in the case of new or recently enlarged or improved national schools.  A special grant is provided towards the cost of school requisites which may include audio-visual aids, such as tape recorders, record players, film projectors, and so on.  The extent of the grant depends on the size of the school.  It <Col N="940" /> is related, I think, to the cost of the work involved.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will have a good deal of settling to do before this year is over.  I was dealing with paragraph 126 on page 64 of this document.  The Minister in this paragraph pours forth his sympathy for the unfortunate, hardworking public representatives on the ground of the time, energy and ability they give to the working of local government generally.  The Minister knows in his heart and soul that he is not being truthful.  As public representatives, the more powers and responsibilities we have, the more we take from the officials and that is how we want it. and how the people generally want it.</P>
      <P>The gem of this concoction is contained in paragraph 127 on page 65 under the heading &ldquo;Proposals for Regional Administration.&rdquo; It states:</P>
      <P>The Government accordingly proposed that legislation should be introduced to transfer administration of the health services from the existing local health authorities to special regional boards.  The membership of these boards, it is envisage, would be made up of persons (including representatives of the medical and related profession and, where appropriate, of the voluntary hospitals) appointed by the Minister for Health and members elected by the county and county borough councils for their areas.  They would thus represent a partnership between local government, central government and vocational organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="967" /> What a glorious dream!  Knowing the innocence of the Minister as I do, having spent most of my life looking at him and listening to him and trying to decipher what he says today against what he will do tomorrow&mdash;the very opposite&mdash;I must condemn this. When I speak personally, I really mean that we in the Labour Party condemn this out of hand because this leads to only one thing: giving the Minister power to pack&mdash;which he is adept at, as he is adept at the gerrymandering that is going on today in the city of Limerick.  It is power he will hold over the appointees, and I am sure they will not come from the Labour or Fine Gael membership in Limerick. On this body he will have the final say as to who will represent the people and who will implement proposals and see to the needs of the people in the administrative area.</P>
    <P>We say this is wrong, unjust and unfair. It is the next thing to dictatorship. Are we to give any consideration to the voice of the people or the local authorities or even the National Authority?  Does it mean anything any more so far as the Minister for Health is concerned in the light of this paragraph here?  We shall go the whole way on this.  We believe the people to run this authority are the people who represent somebody and we have no objection to representatives of the different professions, provided they have no vote on any matter of financial significance to the authority.  We do not have to stretch our imagination too far to see, with the Minister's group in charge, where this whole administration could lead.  Now is the time to stop it and we vehemently disagree with this paragraph.</P>
    <P>I should like now to turn to paragraph 129 on page 65:</P>
    <P>Some only of the local councillors would be included in the regional boards, but it is intended that there should be local advisory committees&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>for what I do not know</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;on which other councillors also might serve, to advise the regional <Col N="968" /> board and its officers on the local operation of the services.  In this way, the existing very live local interest in the development of the health services can be preserved.</P>
    <P>Did anyone ever hear such nonsense?</P>
    <P>Who is planning for the planner?</P>
    <P>Now I turn to page 66, paragraph 130, to the sentence:</P>
    <P>The members of the boards would have much the same powers of direction and control over their executive&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>this is a gem</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;as local elected members have over the manager, including control of the budget.</P>
    <P>Will anyone tell me&mdash;and I have been a member of a local authority for 16 or 17 years&mdash;what control we have over the manager?  None whatever. The only authority we have over the manager is to have the matter raised in the Press and through the Press, embarrass the manager as an administrator. That is the only power we have to bring the manager to book.  We have to depend on that.  If that does not cause him or his administration embarrassment, or perhaps cause embarrassment elsewhere, our power is nil.  Here we have a repetition of the same thing.</P>
    <P>As I said in the Minister's absence, there are people who can wear authority and people who cannot, and he knows it as well as I do, from the experiences we have had in our constituency of people who have been given authority. Every day we are moving more and more towards the dictatorial approach of the Government's Party with total disrespect for the public representatives. I have spoken at length on this document.  Candidly, I think it is a fraud and that it will never be implemented.</P>
    <P>I want to say in conclusion, now that the Minister is here, that everything comes home to roost if we take our time.  As I said before, statements have been made on television, at dinners, at dances, at Tuairim symposia, and in all kinds of places, about <Col N="969" /> this great document on the future development of our health services.  I remember not so very long ago when the Minister returned to his native city as Minister for Health.  Organised bands came out to meet him and there was a great hullabaloo and a great fanfare at the city boundary to welcome him to Limerick.  That was very nice. Promises were made at the time that the entire health services were going to be torn from stem to stern.  We were told that we were marching into the Garden of Eden, that there would be no more trouble, medical cards, hospital bills and helicopter bills were all going.  It was a completely revolutionary approach and this is the result. If this is all that the Minister has to hand up to us, it is a pity he wasted so much time and a pity that there was so much money wasted on television, on Tuairim symposia and on all kinds of things all over the country welcoming this.  I repeat what I said at the beginning, that it is only camouflage, creating a haze to blind the people to the present economic crisis through which the country is going.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Health and medicine is a subject that seems to be bedevilled. It is difficult to know why.  Perhaps it is due to the fact that we are placed on this earth to suffer and to die and that subconsciously we feel utterly frustrated because no matter what steps we take to avoid those possibilities, they will still come.  It means that no matter what system we devise it will not be successful.  This subconscious frustration must have its outlet in some place and it has its outlet in attacking whatever schemes are proposed to improve our health and medical services. Everyone must have an interest in health legislation because at some time or other almost everybody becomes ill and suffers the consequence. There is no doubt that everybody must die and we look to medical care to provide for the prevention, cure and alleviation of our illnesses when they arrive and of whatever bodily defects we suffer.  We also hope that medical care will prolong our lives and help up when we are dying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="970" /> Health legislation must have a few definite objectives and may have a few secondary ones.  The primary objective of health legislation is the education of the whole community in the taking of preventive measures which are in their own interests and in the interests of the health of the community. It must also educate them in regard to what services are available and what they should do when they become ill. It must also provide services for people who cannot provide them for themselves. This objective is just as important as the first one I mentioned. To my mind, those are the two primary essentials in any health service.</P>
    <P>Health services may have secondary objectives.  Health services may be used as an economic or social weapon to help redistribute the wealth of the community and as such I suppose nobody will find fault with it, but as such it should not become a primary objective.  Also, from time to time in other countries&mdash;it would never happen here&mdash;health legislation is used by political Parties to enhance their prestige and increase their power, but, as I said, that would not happen here so there is no need to deal with it further. Very few will disagree with me in the objectives I have outlined and the big problem of this House is to try to translate that into a practical system of medicine.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt whatever that the best system of medicine is the one that enshrines the direct doctor-patient relationship.  This is the system under which the doctor has the direct responsibility for his patient and under which the patient is absolutely responsible to the doctor, chemist or any of the other medical services for the fee paid.  Unfortunately, down the years, in no community has society succeeded in redistributing its wealth at wage level in such a way that each person will be able to provide his own medical care, and for that reason the State has to come in.  It has been accepted for quite a while that the State must provide services for those who really need them.  There are many ways in which this can be done and it is in <Col N="971" /> deciding which one of these should be adopted that the political Parties of this country take different sides.</P>
    <P>Firstly, I shall take the Fine Gael Party.  As I understand their policy, they suggest a comprehensive service for 85 per cent of the people based on insurance.  That takes in the lower-income group who cannot afford to pay an insurance premium and, therefore, the premium should be paid by the State or perhaps by the local health authority.  The upper 15 per cent are excluded and they are to look after themselves.  This system of medicine is offered to the people with free choice of doctor and also with a means test. What I cannot understand is how it can be run without a means test because, firstly, no matter what way it happens, there must be some test to decide the 15 per cent who are excluded at the top.  There must be some other system of eliciting information at some level to decide for what group the health authority or the State will pay the insurance premiums, the group we recognise as the lower-income group.</P>
    <P>Secondly, we have the Labour Party.  They offer the country a comprehensive health service such as the people of the United Kingdom have. Anyone who is aware of what has been happening in the UK during the past few years will not be anxious to have such a system of medicine for this country.  It has given rise to a lot of trouble during the past 12 months. Doctors and State have been at loggerheads. It is not settled yet.  Whatever is the reason&mdash;whether it is the patients, or the capitation fee, or whether the people of the United Kingdom have a different outlook from our people, or whether the doctors there are different&mdash;it is obvious it almost broke down at general practitioner level last year.  The solution has not been reached yet.  Certain terms have been put before a pricing body but they have not been priced and if they are not priced favourably to the profession, it is almost certain this row will start all over again.</P>
    <P>Then we have the Fianna Fáil Party. <Col N="972" /> It is true to say that whatever progress has been made since 1945 was due to the 1945 Health Act or the 1953 Act. Whatever defects the 1953 Act had, to my mind, it had no defects as far as the health of the people in the lower-income group was concerned.  They have a comprehensive health service, though, I admit, they had not a choice of doctor, but this must not have been a big disability in spite of all the criticisms in the House during the last day or so because the complaint is that the managers and health authorities were not allowing more and more people into the lower-income group and obviously more and more people would not be anxious to get into that group if the service were not up to standard. Let those who will take credit for it, I think it reflects credit on all concerned in it.  No matter what system you have that is good and giving benefits you will have others trying to get into it.</P>
    <P>This further extension of the medical service, as envisaged in the White Paper, to my mind, goes along the right lines.  In it once more we are deciding that we are prepared to help fully those who need full help; we are prepared to help partially those who need partial help.  We have decided that the taxpayer will not be asked to pay more than is absolutely necessary to provide these health services and this, to my mind, is as much as any health service could be expected to provide if we are not to go for a doctrinaire approach.</P>
    <P>Having decided all that much, we have got to decide what everybody expects from us.  In the health services you have three parties: the patient, the medical profession and the State.  A patient expects a few things from the health service.  If he becomes acutely ill, he expects reasonably prompt and fairly efficient treatment.  If necessary, he expects a bed will be available in a hospital immediately.  He expects to be taken there in a proper mode of conveyance.  When he reaches there, he expects he will get the highest standard of treatment possible and at all stages throughout the service he expects to be treated as a human <Col N="973" /> being should be treated in any circumstances.</P>
    <P>If he is chronically ill or less urgently ill, a patient expects treatement in his home or in a place convenient to his home.  If that cannot be done, he expects hospital and consultant services will be available to him within a reasonable time and at a reasonable place.  He expects that when he goes away from his home to get such treatment, those places will have the equipment and the staff to provide him with all that is necessary to diagnose and to treat his complaint.  When that has been done, he hopes the treatment will be continued in his home by his family doctor.</P>
    <P>Further, throughout all those stages and all those illnesses, a patient hopes he will get all this without any imposition on his finances so that when his illness is over, he will not be financially embarrassed by it.  I feel that the scheme envisaged in the White Paper will do all those things.</P>
    <P>The next persons concerned with the service is the medical profession. The general practitioners find themselves in a most unusual position now. They are expected to be on duty all the time throughout the entire week and they are expected to provide a service at all times if they are called on. Taking the overall picture, I think they do this and I was pleased that throughout this discussion most of the speakers agreed this is so.  To my mind, the two most valuable things a doctor can offer to the community are his education in his profession and his time.</P>
    <P>We all appreciate how important are his education and his experience but I think very few people appreciate the time factor in a doctor's life.  His time is divided into two obvious divisions and one not so obvious.  The good conscientious doctor will provide time to do his work.  He will provide time for leisure and to spend with his family.  But he must provide a third time which not many find it easy to provide&mdash;he must provide time for study.  To my mind, his working time should be organised as far as possible. If it is not organised as far as possible, <Col N="974" /> he will find it difficult to provide time for leisure and study.  Some doctors succeed very well in organising their time, others not so well.  Probably the district medical officer is one who does not find so much opportunity to organise his time.  On occasion he is reluctant to do it.  It is hard to say the reason why, but one feels it is because he is considered the State doctor.  If he sets out to organise his time at all, he may find himself labelled discourteous, lazy or unwilling to work.  He probably takes the easy way out.  That organisation of time is the basis of good service to the community.  Having organised his work time, he is able to organise his leisure time.  It goes without saying that in a rushed world such as this, everybody must have some leisure.  I am not going to labour that point.  However, I propose to labour the third point&mdash;this question of study.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that the Minister and his advisers are fully aware of the problem because they mention specifically in the White Paper they intend to provide post-graduate study for doctors.  This will not be enough.  The most they can provide probably will be a fortnight or three weeks, maybe every two years.  It is hard to see it coming every year.  But the doctor can and must spend a certain amount of his own time studying.  He must keep in touch with recent advances.  He must know what is happening around him.  He must know what the recent advances in medicine have to offer his patients.  If he has not read his medical journals, his patients are reading <i>The Readers Digest</i> and other magazines and are probably better up than he is. He always finds that the push is there. This is an aspect of the doctor's life very few outside the doctor's family appreciate.  I would suggest to the Minister and to all concerned that it is an important aspect of the doctor's life.  As far as possible, through propaganda and by one means or another, this aspect should be made as public as possible.</P>
    <P>Having said all that, I may be giving the impression that the patients abuse doctors badly in Ireland as regards time.  I would not like to give that impression.  What I am afraid of is this. <Col N="975" /> If we in extending our health services have the same experience as they have had across the water and in other countries, this is likely to happen. Possibly it is something that was not foreseen in other countries, but we should benefit by their experience and realise that it is probably one of the biggest abuses that has occurred in Britain, giving this capitation system and State medicine such a bad name as far as we are concerned here.</P>
    <P>In the White Paper patients are offered a free choice of doctors.  I do not think anybody can find fault with this, but the question comes up: at what level will choice of doctor cease? This was raised yesterday by Deputy Corish in the form of a question: Whether there would be a choice of doctor in local authority hospitals? The question was answered fairly reasonably, but it does not cover the whole problem.  The Minister envisages the health organisation of the country on a regional basis.  When that is done, will a patient have a choice of specialist from one region to another? In other words, will the patient living in region A, if he happens to think the specialist in region B or region C is better than the one he has in region A, be given the right to go to that particular specialist?  This is important. Anybody dealing with people in the country appreciates that this occures several times a month.  I am not going to exaggerate.  It is a question to which the Minister should turn his mind.  No doubt it will cause difficulty in administration, but until you reach that stage and give them this choice, you are in fact not giving a free choice of doctor throughout the whole scheme.</P>
    <P>Another aspect is the question of remuneration.  I understand each Deputy has received a document dealing with remuneration and I hope they have all read it by now.  As pointed out in that document, there are three or four different systems of remuneration. It is felt by the medical organisations in this country that the fee for service is the best system of remuneration. Under the fee for service system, you <Col N="976" /> are paid for the work you do, and if you have to do any extra work, you get paid for that.  This is not the case under the capitation system and under the salary system.  I am fully aware that this is a big problem, with big financial implications, but this is the system the majority of the doctors here believe to be the best one.  It is only fair to say there are some doctors who feel that the capitation system would suit them best.  As the Minister has to discuss these matters with those people afterwards, I do not intend to pursue this subject any further.</P>
    <P>There is one aspect of the health services I should like to advert to and to which I do not think anybody has adverted.  At times when it has been my duty to examine people seeking jobs, I often wonder is this a futile operation.  This was brought to my notice particularly some years ago when it was necessary for a child applying for a county scholarship to submit himself for medical examination. At that time it meant, if the doctor turned the child down because he had some health defect, the child could not sit for the county scholarship. I always felt at that time that this was wrong because the delicate child, to my mind, is the child who should get the scholarship.  If there were a limited amount of money available, perhaps the delicate child should get first preference.  Over the years there has been a change of view on that, so much so that that examination is removed and in fact county councils are giving scholarships for children with defects.  That is as it should be.</P>
    <P>I wish to push this question further. In doing so, it probably enters the province of the Minister for Finance rather than the Minister for Health, but as it is his responsibility to look after health, I feel I should mention it here.  When people come for an examination, having applied for a job in the Civil Service, county council or other such place, this question again comes up.  If this person has a health defect, you must turn him down for the job. I think this is absolutely wrong.  There is no good in talking here about improving the health of the people and <Col N="977" /> helping to alleviate their defects, unless we are going to place them on the same level as healthy people. Instead of having those people examined with a view to excluding them from particular jobs, it should become the policy of the State to employ them.</P>
    <P>I say &ldquo;the policy of the State&rdquo; rather than the policy of private companies. It would be unfair, I think, to ask private companies to do this.  On the other hand, unfortunate people suffering from rheumatism, defective hearts, diabetes, bronchitis and various other ills, should be taken into the public service and into the service of local authorities, having the same opportunities and receiving the same treatment as the healthy.  Until such time as policy is reoriented in that direction, we will not have done a complete job.  This is much more important than extending health services to those who cannot afford to pay for them.</P>
    <P>It would, of course, be a matter for the Department of Finance.  There are financial implications in it and there would be objections to it, but I believe a policy could be worked out.  The public services and local authorities should be made to absorb these people and the onus should not be placed on the private employer.  Until this is done, we shall not have a complete health service.  Furthermore, all are not born with equal opportunities.  If one is born with a defect and, because of it, is excluded from Government jobs, then there is no equal opportunity. It is time this aspect was adverted to so that families and the unfortunates who are affected will know that there is an employment outlet, and not a limited outlet at that.  That is one of the most important points I can make in this debate.</P>
    <P>I have heard a good deal of complaint about the building of dispensaries. This is hardly a matter for the Minister for Health.  In Roscommon, we have built a great many new dispensaries, first-class buildings, properly heated.  What is done in Roscommon can surely be done by every other <Col N="978" /> health authority, if the will to do it is there.</P>
    <P>The gravest defects in our present health services are those which leave no scope for people in the middle-income group to be supplied with teeth, hearing aids and glasses.  Some of these items are very expensive and very few can afford to supply them themselves. I hope these matters will in future get priority.  I think these services should be provided before any of the other services mentioned.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the mentally handicapped and the aged.  It is unfair to criticise the Minister because the problem has not been resolved. It is a big problem.  We have had it for years.  It has never been faced up to fully, but, since the Minister took office, he has made great efforts to come to grips with the problem. One of the biggest difficulties in coming to grips with it is that it is so hard to get people to do anything about it.  It is very hard to convince people that money should be spent.  A start has been made and I have no doubt progress will continue to be made.  No matter what we do here, no results will be achieved unless there is goodwill everywhere.  This is where the third party, the State, comes in.  It will be the business of the State to ensure the services are not abused and to ensure that those responsible do their duty.  The biggest problem will be in providing the personnel to do the work.  As services expand, the State will be up against it because medical appointments elsewhere are very attractive. It often amazes me to see the number who return to work here, remembering what salaries are like in other countries.  If there is an increased demand for specialists, these will have to be brought in from outside. It may not be very easy to get them to come in.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay tribute to the Minister for the work he is doing.  He has been criticised for not doing enough and not going fast enough.  I think those who criticise realise that medicine is a costly business.  No community in the world, no matter what <Col N="979" /> system has been adopted, has succeeded in giving free health services at all levels to everybody.  There is always some stop and stay in every community. We are not a very prosperous community and it is my belief that the Minister and the Government are giving a fair share of our prosperity in the health services to those who need it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Gibbons spoke very comprehensively on the health services in general.  He referred only in passing to the problem of the mentally handicapped.  Deputy Coughlan dwelt at some length on this problem.  It is a problem that deserves more than a passing mention.  It is a problem which is causing very serious concern and istress in many households.  It does not get, in my opinion, sufficient space in the White Paper.  We are not told enough about the Minister's intentions for the future.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gibbons says he is aware of the problem and he has been trying to make the public aware.  I do not think it is necessary to build up any public opinion whatever in relation to this aspect of health services.  I am a member of a board catering for the mentally handicapped and we have at the moments a waiting list of about 300.  I do not know what the position is generally throughout the country, but I am aware that every public representative is plagued with people in serious distress coming to see if he can do anything or use any influence to get a child or, perhaps, two children into an institution catering for the mentally handicapped.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not sufficient for the Minister to say that he is in receipt of the Commission's report since last April and that he intends to deal separately with the problem in another White Paper. These unfortunate people have been waiting for years while this special Commission were sitting and while they were producing their report.  It was hoped that, as soon as the report came to hand, the matter would be treated as one of urgency and every effort would be made to meet the <Col N="980" /> plight of these people and cater for them.  The White Paper states:</P>
    <P>The Report of the Commission of Inquiry on Mental Handicap, published in April, 1965, is under consideration by the Government.  As it is intended to publish a separate White Paper indicating the Government's decision on the recommendations in this report, it is not proposed in the present White Paper to discuss the development of the services for the mentally handicapped.</P>
    <P>Whatever information is available to the Minister should be made available to the House so that the anxiety of these unfortunate people may be allayed.  Let them know that the problem is being treated as an urgent problem.  Additional beds have been provided in recent years in various parts of the country and arrangements are under way to provide more beds. However, every scrap of information or any tentative plans the Minister has for the future, should be made known now.  The Minister and the Department should let the people feel they are sincerely concerned about this problem and are doing everything possible to meet it.</P>
    <P>There is another problem which gets only passing reference in this White Paper.  It is a problem to which I attach a good deal of importance and about which, in the course of the past couple of years, I tried to get something done.  I have put down a number of questions in the hope of getting diagnostic facilities made available on a national scale for cervical cancer. This is a problem in relation to which we have been dragging our feet.</P>
    <P>Some years ago I was supplied with the limited figures available in relation to the number of preventable deaths which occur annually from cancer of the cervix.  I was appalled to think that while we could be saying lives here, we were doing very little about it. In the Dublin Health Authority in recent times, we have got permission to set up a small diagnostic centre and we have employed two nursing technicians. I believe we have also got permission from the Department to employ a cytologist.  There appears to have been some difficulty here.  The <Col N="981" /> Appointments Commission are making this appointment and have advertised unsuccessfully at least once.  Here again the Minister's intentions and the limited service available should be made known throughout the country, and it should be stressed how important it is for people to avail of this service.  An indication should be given of the number of deaths that occur annually, deaths that can be prevented if only these simple diagnostic facilities are availed of.  When the Minister is replying, would be indicate why it has taken so long to provide coverage for this on a national basis?  My information is that it requires only a very limited investment to prevent a very large number of deaths from cervical cancer.  This is one of the few forms of cancer where something can really be done and it is extremely disappointing that we have failed for so long to provide these facilities.</P>
    <P>I have great sympathy with the Minister in the circumstances of the present time.  He has come into a Department that has been practically stagnant for years and where, in regard to health services, very few improvements have taken place.  There is an enormous job to be done.  I believe the Minister has the energy, the ability and the urge to do this job, but he finds when he looks around there is not a shilling left in the kitty with which to do anything.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has already announced that any improvement in the health service, like educational facilities, must await the advent of better times.  We have no indication when these better times are expected. In every page of the White Paper with which we have been supplied it is a question of wait and wait indefinitely.  There is no period given for doing anything.  To the extent that certain improvements are indicated we are glad but I am very critical of this White Paper which vaguely describes the long-distance views of the Government in relation to possible improvements in the health service.</P>
    <P>The first line of the introduction to this White Paper reads: &ldquo;This White Paper describes briefly the origins of the health service...&rdquo;  The people <Col N="982" /> generally are not concerned about the origins of the health service.  The people want to know what improvements are going to take place and when, and &ldquo;when&rdquo; is the important thing.  The third paragraph on the same page says: &ldquo;The changes proposed are complex and fairly costly. Their complexity rules out any question of their introduction in the immediate future....&rdquo;  What is meant by the immediate future?  When will the changes proposed take place?  Is there any indication as to when these improvements will be effected?  I cannot see anything specific in this White Paper.  It would be far better if the proposals were much more limited and if the Minister would say that the people were going to get the benefit of these improvements in six months' time or in 12 months' time, but no such commitment is there.</P>
    <P>The Minister says on page 3 of his statement:</P>
    <P>The White Paper proposes a number of important changes in the general medical service.  It is intended to introduce a choice of doctor in the service and, we hope, a choice of chemist.</P>
    <P>These are definite improvements which we are all well able to recognise. They are improvements which Deputy O'Higgins had recommended ten years ago.  However, can the Minister tell us when the people can expect these changes, at the end of what period? Is it at the end of a year or two years?  That is what is important to the people.</P>
    <P>The Minister further states:</P>
    <P>It is intended that the limits for the categories eligible for the service will be clearly defined instead of being subject to individual local interpretation with a rather vague legal formula as at present.</P>
    <P>The second part of that statement indicates that the humiliating aspect of the health service remains, that is, the means test, that the Minister is determined to retain the means test and that the people will be denied, for an unknown period in the future, what all <Col N="983" /> the countries in western Europe have at the present time, that is, a comprehensive medical service for the vast bulk of the people.  There is no country, as far as I know, in western Europe, that has not got that for the vast majority of the people.  The United Kingdom, Denmark and Sweden apparently have 100 per cent such coverage.  Austria, France and Germany have nine-tenths coverage.  The Netherlands, Norway, Switzerland and Spain have four-fifths coverage.  Belgium has three-quarters and in Luxembourg, Portugal and Italy the vast majority of the population are covered. I think it is right to say that in most of those countries payment for those services is based on insurance.</P>
    <P>Various people have condemned the Select Committee on Health Services set up some years ago.  I served on that Committee for a period of three and a half years.  Mark you, I think it did a lot of good in so far as it has helped to convince the Minister, or perhaps his predecessor before him, that enormous improvements were urgently needed.  The Minister says that the basis for his White Paper came in the main from the evidence collected in the course of that inquiry.  All I can say is a very large volume of evidence was collected from the various interested and associated groups who were allowed to express their opinion. That opinion was in favour of a comprehensive health service for the vast majority of the people.</P>
    <P>Today, Deputy Gibbons, who gave quite an enlightened discourse on this subject, said he did not understand the Fine Gael proposals in this regard. The only thing he seemed unable to understand is how one could eliminate the means test and still have 15 per cent of the people excluded.  Of course, the answer was that those 15 per cent excluded themselves because they were not obliged to make a contribution and they were people who were so obviously in the upper income group that it was easy enough to recognise them.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in the course of defining <Col N="984" /> clearly the eligible categories, has not said to what extent this will extend the services.  He has not given any estimate of the change that will make.  We know, at the present time, that approximately 30 per cent of the people are covered.  What percentage will be covered when the Minister's yardstick is used?  We all know it is quite wrong that in the poorest county in Ireland, County Leitrim, something like 24 per cent of the people are covered by medical cards and in counties like Carlow and Meath, 40 per cent and 50 per cent of the people are covered.  That is all wrong and it is something which should have been looked into some considerable time ago.  The local yardstick should be eliminated and some sort of more specific measurements used.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see it is proposed to do that in this White Paper, but the Minister, as I say, has not indicated whether this will bring in a greater percentage of the people for the purpose of general medical services.  Is it intended, in the places where you have approximately 40 per cent or 50 per cent of the people covered by general medical service cards at the moment, that they will be reduced to 30 per cent?  Is it a levelling up and down so that we will eventually arrive back at approximately the same figure, only that we will get a more equitable distribution of the health service to the people but using a different yardstick and by using different means of dealing with the problem?</P>
    <P>That is one of the things which the Minister should have indicated.  He should have indicated more clearly how those various improvements outlined in this White Paper will be paid for.  He should have indicated their cost, first of all.  The cost, he has told us, will be approximately £4½ million.  When are we to arrive at that £4½ million expenditure?  Is it at the end of one, two or three years?  At what date will we be involved in that additional expenditure?  When we are involved in that additional expenditure, where is it to come from?  The only thing the Minister has done is to indicate that the demand for health services from the rates in the present year <Col N="985" /> will not increase and that the Department will pay 100 per cent of the amount in excess of what was paid for health services last year.</P>
    <P>That is one of the things that have created a good deal of confusion in various counties.  I think something like this was said in the course of some of the explanations or statements that were made.  If the health services in a particular county cost pound for pound last year and adequate provision had been made, there would be no change in the present year or the future year, 1966-67; it would still be pound for pound.  If there was under-provision last year, say, to the tune of one shilling in the pound, this year it would be 21/-and if there was over-provision last year, to the time of 1/-, it would be reduced by 1/- to 19/-.  That is over-simplification and it has led to a good deal of confusion and a good deal of upset in various counties where an increase in the rates has already been sought by the county managers.  This, I know, has arisen in some cases to meet existing debit balances but there are other cases in which many public representatives, and the people generally, do not appreciate that it is not 50 per cent of all expenditure in the health authorities that is met from the Department, that there are certain expenditures which the Department do not meet, paying 50 per cent.  An example of that is loan charges and bank charges.  Where there is fairly considerable capital development in the coming year and where these loan charges are heavier and bank charges are heavier, there would be, on that account alone, an increase in the rates for that particular purpose.</P>

      <P>One of the things to which I should like to refer is the extension of the income limit, for the purpose of institutional and other services, for the middle-income group.  That, of course, is a real asset and is something which is appreciated by everybody.  There is a figure given in the White Paper for the cost of this and, in fact, it surprises me that it is as high as it is because of the fact that the voluntary health scheme has been such a success and so many people are now covered by it.  I would say that the vast majority of the people up to the £1,200 income limit who would not be entitled to general medical services would now have themselves covered by way of voluntary health insurance.  Of course, I assume that if they are covered by insurance, they do not have to be covered by the improvement in the health service for the middle-income group suggested here.</P>

      <P>It is no harm to have that aspect of it made clear.</P>
      <P>I shall now turn to the question of drugs being supplied at a reduced cost.  That is not new, of course, as the Minister knows; it has been in existence for the past two or three years in some certainly, if not all, of the health authorities.  I have never had any real difficulty, in hardship cases, in getting the health authority to meet their difficulties, even though, on paper, their income was quite well above the limit laid down for the middle-income group.  It has been my experience, in such cases, that expenditure on drugs has been met pretty generously by the health authority.  It is something which caused a lot of hardship in various households for a long time, but not for the past two or three years since a directive was sent out from the Department that this should be done.  It is mentioned in this White Paper and one might get the impression&mdash;if one were not familiar with it&mdash;that it is something new.  It is not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="989" /> While I think this White Paper contains many excellent proposals for the future and makes many badlyneeded improvements, where it falls down completely is, first of all, that it fails to accept that there is a need for a comprehensive medical service, and that it refuses to recognise that, although all the information available to the Minister should indicate that it is extremely desirable to have such a comprehensive service.  When it refuses to see and to accept that, even though all the countries in Europe have such a service and even though we are very ambitious to get into Europe and hope we will be in Europe by 1970, we are still working on our health services on the basis of improving an existing health service, on the basis that we must have here at all times a means test and that the people who get this complete cover for health service must first prove their eligibility.  It is very unfortunate that we should call on our people to prove, first of all, that they are poor before we will give them the service to which they should be entitled.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 50 of this White Paper says:</P>
    <P>A persistent basis of criticism of the present service lies in the different standards of eligibility which are a consequence of local variations in interpreting the formula for the lower income group mentioned in paragraph 10, and in the fact that the standards for eligibility are not published.  Local health authorities must operate the law as they find it and variations such as these are probably inevitable in the operation of this somewhat vague criterion.  It is, therefore, no reflection on these authorities that the Government accept these criticisms as valid.</P>
    <P>That is nearly an apology.  I mean&mdash; they are either right or wrong.  I repeat:</P>
    <P>It is, therefore, no reflection on these authorities that the Government accept these criticisms as valid.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 51 commences by saying:</P>
    <P>It is proposed to introduce legislation <Col N="990" /> under which the Minister for Health would make regulations specifying the classes of persons entitled to participate in the service.</P>
    <P>That is something which is long overdue and something we are all very pleased to see coming about.</P>
    <P>One thing which interests me is that it is proposed to do away with the dispensaries completely, to sell them to the doctors or do something else with them.  Where are the clinics to be held? We are hoping to improve the dental services, the ophthalmic services and the aural services.  Where are these services to be given?  It was always very convenient, especially in the poorer areas, to have a well equipped health centre adjacent to a school, so that a mother could bring two of the children to school and one or two of the other children to the health centre. We should have health centres convenient to schools where these examinations can take place.  It would be a wonderful thing if instead of disrupting the work of the schools, the children could be taken to an adjacent health centre which was fairly well equipped for examinations.  It would be well worthwhile maintaining quite a number of these modern health centres for that purpose.  They are fairly well equipped already and where they are not well equipped, the equipment should be improved.  I think it would be the loss of an asset if these centres were to disappear, and if the services now provided in them were to be provided in future at the doctor's home or at accommodation he would provide adjacent to his home.</P>
    <P>I want to refer now to something which occurred during the week as a result of a reply to a question raised by Deputy O'Connell about the pharmacies of Dublin Health Authority areas.  In answer to a supplementary question, the Minister made a statement that I feel he should not have made.  He said that two people who were identified had been summoned to his Department and that certain aspects of the work of the pharmacies had been particularly inept.  All I can say is that all the evidence that I can get in relation to this matter indicates that <Col N="991" /> the reason why the services were not better at the pharmacies of Dublin Health Authority was the failure of the Department to sanction various proposals over the past three or four years which were intended to improve the service.  Without this permission from the Department, it was quite impossible to carry on as they had been carrying on.  That was indicated more than once to the Department, and certain proposals were made which were not sanctioned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not correct. I will deal with it when I am replying. That is a serious statement and I would not have made the statement that Dublin Health Authority pharmacies were inept if I did not think they were.  I represent the people <i>vis-á-vis</i> the Department and the health authorities, and my first consideration is the patient.  They were inept.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister would not make that statement if he did not feel they were inept.  I will give him credit for that.  There are two sides to the statement and I think it is rather unfortunate that the people who were criticised were not in a position to defend themselves.  It has always been the practice in this House not to criticise people who are not in a position to defend themselves.  I have worked very closely with these people since 1961.  I was chairman of Dublin Health Authority and I worked in very close association with them.  They are doing an enormous job and the top ten of that organisation are as good as you will get anywhere in Europe.  You could not find a more able and dedicated group of officials than those people.  I am saying that in public and I will not get any particular benefit from saying it.  I was not in any way prompted to say it.  I have always felt that way about them.  One thing you can say about Dublin Health Authority is that the people at the top are murdered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister in his White Paper speaks of reorganising the administration of the health services on a regional <Col N="992" /> basis.  That has been done in Dublin city and county where one authority is looking after one-quarter of the population.  I am giving my personal view from what I have witnessed at close quarters.  I think that is far too great a number for one health authority to cater for.  I remember when I was chairman of the authority, we had a visit from one of the late President Kennedy's expert hospital administrators.  I remember when a certain person from the Department was giving him a look at what we were doing in relation to health, the man from the Department said to the American: &ldquo;One of the greatest things we have ever done in this country is the amalgamation of the health services.&rdquo; I asked him what number of people would he consider to be the optimum number for one single health authority to deal with and he had no hesitation in saying: &ldquo;one quarter of a million.&rdquo; That was his idea of the upper limit of the population that could be adequately provided for by one health authority.  All I can say is that the top ten or 12 people in this organisation are completely overloaded and are carrying so much responsibility that they will not continue to carry it.  The whole question of reorganisation and producing new health authorities is something the Minister will have to consider very carefully.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to take this out of the hands of the county councils, but I think the county councils will carry on with the same number of staff, as if they had not got the responsibility to administer the health services.  I have read the White Paper and the only justification mentioned in it is that if the State pays a very large proportion of the health services bill, then you cannot have a situation in which the health services will not be administered directly by the State.  In my view, that is a vote of no confidence in the local authorities.  It is tantamount to saying that because the State is providing a large portion of the money, they would use it irresponsibly.  I do not believe that, because I think most of the people in the local authorities are responsible and intelligent, and they realise that even though the money is coming from <Col N="993" /> central taxation, they themselves are making a large contribution towards it. What I think will happen is that we will set up another administration machine.  It will be an expensive machine and it will provide more jobs for the boys.  I do not think it will save any money or improve the health services.</P>
    <P>If we look at this whole problem seriously and decide on what type of services we should have, our local authorities are quite capable of administering them efficiently.  I am well aware of the fact that institutional services and hospital services must be regarded on a regional basis, but I see no reason why the various countries could not get together and form a region and have the institutional services provided on a services rendered basis, as we do in Dublin city and county and in Dún Laoghaire.  We pay for this type of service on a services rendered basis and there is no argument, row or discussion.  It works quite well and it is something that could work quite well throughout the country without setting up another new and expensive organisation.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with most of the matters to which I wanted to refer in relation to this White Paper.  I shall conclude by saying that it is regrettable&mdash;when a major reshuffle and reorganisation of the health services was proposed &mdash; that the Minister has decided that the health services we are to give our people must still be based on the Medical Charities Act, 1857, that was brought in here just as a famine relief and that we still hold and intend to hold all the despicable aspects of this means test to which the people have been objecting for so long.</P>

      <P>This White Paper stems from the 1953 Act and reflects the revised thinking in the Department and the experience gained in the administration of this Act.  I am sure it was considerably helped by the evidence given before the Select Committee on Health Services.  It is also designed, I think, to fill out the services provided for or promised in section 21 of the 1953 Act.  This White Paper is a plan, a blueprint, of the health services. The objectives are fairly clearly set out. <Col N="994" /> Some of the objectives, the Minister said, may not immediately be realisable because of financial stringency but that should not deter their preparation.</P>
      <P>The White Paper is a spur to action. Any businessman, any farmer, any industrialist, will make his plan so that he will be able to assess the resources available to him.  He will know what resources are available to him so that he can mobilise them.  The Minister has done this.  He set his targets and said: &ldquo;I want about £4½ million.&rdquo; We know where we are.  How he will get these resources is a matter for the Oireachtas.  There is nothing final as yet.  He has made this very plain in this White Paper.  Discussions are being held and will be held with the doctors, chemists and other professional organisations.  He has listened here to two days' debate on the White Paper and possibly he will have to listen to another days' debate.  He will have the benefit of articles in the public press, letters, and what have you, with the result that whatever legislation will emerge from this will be well-informed legislation.</P>
      <P>This White Paper is nothing more than a sketch plan.  Legislation is foreshadowed and the result will be a certain modification of the White Paper which will not abrogate the basic principles on which it is founded.  We are not giving a free-for-all to everybody but we shall also see to it that nobody will be in want.  These principles are not abrogated in this White Paper and will be preserved in future legislation.</P>
      <P>Many improvements are visualised in the White Paper.  Everybody welcomes the choice of doctor.  As Deputy Mrs. Crowley said here last night, we all love a choice, a choice of doctor, a choice of clothes and a choice of many other things.</P>

There are plenty of fellows down the country, heaps of unknown Ministers for Health, silent Ministers, fellows drinking pints in a pub or maybe mending some tractor part, and they also thought of this so there is no use in one side or the other side of the House saying: &ldquo;We thought of it first&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>These interruptions are helpful.  There will be a lot of consultation regarding doctors' <Col N="996" /> fees, and so on.  Deputy Gibbons was very helpful in his contribution.  With goodwill on both sides, and the over-riding desire for the full and effective care of the sick, I think it will go through.</P>
      <P>On the subject of drugs, negotiations are on foot to provide a more economic service through the normal retail channels and that is welcome.  Deputy Fitzpatrick was afraid that the heavy hand of the Civil Service was falling in relation to drugs but I do not think that is the position.  I have been discussing this matter with doctors.  They welcome the preparation of this national formulary because it is done in consultation with the Department, doctors and chemists.  I hope it will lead to efficiency and economy.  It will not prevent the prescribing of expensive drugs.  It is merely a guideline for chemists, doctors and medical people and that is all it pretends to be. Even Deputy Clinton paid tribute to the manner in which the drugs are administered and their costs are handled in his public authority.</P>
      <P>I now come to this question of the lower, middle and upper-income groups and the issue of medical cards. On page 28 of the White Paper, there is a list which gives the percentage of population on the general medical services register.  It ranges from Carlow County Council at 47.1 per cent to 24.4 per cent for Leitrim County Council and, coming to the Minister's area, 26 per cent for Limerick County Borough.  It indicates the subjective approach to this whole problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the fixing of limits of remuneration, the exclusion of the income of children and the abolition of the family income concept, we shall get away from the means test when these eligibility limits are fixed by the Minister. The means test does not arise in the lower-income group.  I feel it will speed the examination of claims and will take away any suggestion of a means test.  These regulations are subject to agreement by the Oireachtas and will generally be known as a result of wide publication which, in turn, will save Deputies, county councillors and others an awful lot of stupid and unnecessary <Col N="997" /> trouble.  Coming back to percentages, if we all followed Deputy Nolan down to Carlow we might have 50 per cent of the people in the lower-income group.  You have ten per cent who are looked after by the voluntary health insurance scheme, about 300,000.  You are mighty near a comprehensive service.  I suggest the Minister should take a kindly but fairly hard look at the causes for these variations between counties, especially in the counties which are over the national average.</P>
    <P>Another point on which there seems to be a difference of opinion in the House is the hospital charge of 10/-per day.  I thoroughly agree with the Minister that these charges should be retained for some very good reasons. First, this is much below the economic cost but the principal reason is that it would disimprove the bed turnover if the charges were removed.  If a person knows he has to pay nothing, he stays longer in the hospital bed. The charge of 10/- a day is a great incentive to him to get well.  In any event, if there is a hard luck case, there is always some means of relief. If anything, with the increase in incomes to £1,200, I should be inclined to increase this charge.  If it yields about £500,000 now, it might be worth another £150,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know it is for that reason that there is relief on the out-patient charges for X-rays.  The more we can have domiciliary treatment and the more out-patient service and home nursing there is, the more beds there will be available for urgent cases.  We can have more domiciliary care with the increased number of district nurses especially in the case of aged people, thus freeing costly and much-needed beds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Athlone we have a voluntary organisation reconstructing a building to act as a social centre for elderly people who come there three nights weekly to hear music, play cards or enjoy television and so on.  Where they <Col N="998" /> are single people, they can also be visited.  We propose in Westmeath County Council to give a contribution towards this work.  I should like to read a report from our county MOH on the question of the care of the elderly and chronic sick.  Some significant statistics are given here.  It states:</P>
    <P>Of greater significance was the 40 per cent rise in those 85 years of age and older between 1951 and 1961.  In 1951 there were 13,285 persons in this latter age group in the Republic and in 1961 the figure had risen to 19,535.</P>
    <P>Again he says:</P>
    <P>Many will require help to continue at home and it is in this field that the greatest need exists for an extension of the care and welfare services given through the Local Authority and voluntary agencies. The elderly and chronic sick cannot survive in comfort at home without a &ldquo;home-help service,&rdquo;&ldquo;meals-onwheels&rdquo; nurse visits and nursing aids.</P>
    <P>This report is made by a man in the field whose opinion must be respected. Later on he says:</P>
    <P>Until these services are made available, the strain on institutional accommodation will continue. Elderly persons are much happier in their own homes or in small residential homes forming part of a normal community and they must be facilitated to continue in this happier environment.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 84 of the White Paper says pretty much the same thing:</P>
    <P>... if the best value is to be obtained for the aged from the health and assistance services and the efforts of the voluntary agencies there must, at the central level, be a clear line of responsibility for seeing that there is the necessary co-ordination of the various services.</P>
    <P>The Minister proposes to do that.  It is proposed that this will be the responsibility of the Minister for Health and that his Department with the cooperation of others will encourage <Col N="999" /> local co-ordination.  Such efforts should be strongly encouraged.  We contribute to this in County Westmeath.  It is sad to see old people shuffling about county homes but it is sadder to see them falling into open fires, as frequently happens.  Any help given in this direction on a voluntary basis should be supported even to the extent of £1 for £1.  People feel they have a responsibility in respect of the elderly. Most of us are parents and we shall, if we live, become old people ourselves. We can say: &ldquo;There but for the grace of God...&rdquo;  The Romans and the Chinese have a tradition of reverence for the aged.  It is an emotion that is easy to evoke and it brings out the best in people.</P>
    <P>On the question of finance, the Minister is casting about for possible sources of revenue.  Would he consider asking his colleague, the Minister for Finance, to allow as a deduction from the profits of a business, any donation given to the building of a home for the aged or some such project, or some donation given towards the purpose of helping these people?  I should prefer there would be some specific donation rather than some general help, such as building a home or a clinic.  Big money prizes are offered for golf competitions, dairy queens and beauty contests and rightly so, as the donors get good publicity.  In giving that money to provide a home for old people or to pay Jubilee nurses to look after them or some specific aim of that kind, so long as it is a definite object, the donor could be assured that it will be allowed as a deduction and a good bit of revenue might be obtained.  I do not know the position with regard to estate duty, whether such gifts are exempt, but you could have a case of somebody dying with a bad conscience and bequeathing a few thousand pounds towards a geriatric unit.  He would get the same publicity as if he gave a golf trophy or provided prize money in some other way for some competition but it would serve a dual purpose of aiding a useful, charitable, worthwhile cause and ensuring publicity for the donor which is only proper.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1000" /> Coming back to the question of voluntary effort, I think we could mobilise more voluntary effort for the aged.  One could organise flag days through voluntary effort and the Department could contribute £1 for £1 for the benefit of the aged.</P>
    <P>Training for employment is another fruitful field of voluntary service in which good work is already being done and, as in the case of the aged, it is something that excites sympathy and secures generous support.</P>
    <P>I should like to stress the preventive services.  Again Dr. Flynn, our county MOH, had something to say on that subject.  In effect, it was that we should never let up; we should not become complacent.  Incidentally, he reports an increase in tuberculosis.  It is very slight but it is still there.  He says:</P>
    <P>Many times in previous reports I have warned against complacency and the statements that the problem of tuberculosis has been solved.  This is far from fact&mdash;the disease is under fair control but there are many years of hard work ahead before the goal of eradication will be reached. Despite much publicity there are still many persons who fail to avail of X-ray facilities provided by the mobile mass X-ray units.  Until there is 100 per cent response of all adults to these X-ray sessions persons with advanced disease will be discovered each year.  Of the 31 new respiratory cases registered in 1964, at least seven had advanced disease of both lungs and positive sputum.</P>

      <P>It is the annual report of the county medical officer of health for Westmeath.  I am sure all these reports are in the Department. These reports are valuable in that they are reports from men in the field.  We need not be complacent about any infectious disease.  I was interested to hear reference to some new device but the point is that all these are free services because any infectious disease affects the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1001" /> The dental, ophthalmic and aural services under section 21 of the Act are to be extended to cover all schoolgoing children.  This is frightfully important, as important as the care of the aged and rehabilitation.  Preventive medicine in the care of children up to school leaving age is essential and should get first priority.  These children are the citizens of the future and by looking after them now, they will have the <i>mens sana in corporate sano</i> which is a must.  Last night Deputy Coughlan seemed to have solved the dental problem and he told us about a dental mechanic and called him by a strange name&mdash;I do not know what it was.</P>

      <P>This man spent three years on the Continent and took impressions and the Deputy wanted him to be brought in to play a more active role.  Deputy Coughlan did not make an impression on me.</P>
      <P>I cannot conclude without paying a tribute to our general practitioners.  I would not be one for all the tea in India.  They are called out in the middle of the night and I like to have my night to myself.  I know of general practitioners who did not furnish bills to people in the middle-income group because they knew that their circumstances were not good.  I am sure Deputy L'Estrange knows doctors who are dedicated men.  There may be some bad ones amongst them but there are bad ones amongst us all.  On the whole, they have done a fine job.  Perhaps when they are called out at 3 a.m. to a midwifery case, they may groan but they go willingly.  Certainly tribute should be paid to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some poor descriptions have been given of Dublin dispensaries.  The Minister will tell us when he is replying what he will do with many of the other dispensaries in the country, many of which are good.  There will be parts in the west where you will always have dispensaries and only one doctor, but that cannot be helped.  There are some beautiful dispensaries and some good use will be found for them.  A good thing about the abolition of the dispensary system is that it will do away with class distinction between the <Col N="1002" /> lower-income and the middle-income groups.</P>

      <P>It will be removed completely as far as the lower-income group is concerned. There will be no means test for the average man in the lower-income group.  As far as the medical costs are concerned, the only time a means test arises is when a man looks for a reduction in the hospital bill.  The expression &ldquo;means test&rdquo; had a kind of emotional connotation in the past, but we have moved a long way since that.</P>
      <P>I dealt earlier with the so-called paternity of this paper and I would appeal to all Deputies that whenever important social legislation is going through the House&mdash;and we had some in recent times: the Housing Bill and the Succession Bill, and we will have Bills arising from this White Paper and regulations being laid before the House by the Minister&mdash;to try to have as broad a measure of agreement as possible.  We must cease playing politics.  You do not play politics with houses or with health.  Both the Housing Bill and the Succession Bill had a large measure of agreement. When the Minister is introducing whatever legislation he may be introducing, let us have as great an element of agreement as possible.  In the past two days, we have got rid of a lot of material from our systems and now we can write off all that, and if the same spirit prevails, if we are actuated by the same spirit, we will put that legislation through quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards finances, we will have to leave that to the Minister.  I see him advancing over a broad front.  He is not tied to knocking of one section now and another section at another time.  His estimate is up by £2 million, whatever pruning was done, and he has substantial projects on hand. Whether it takes him one year or two years, whether all this is done by 1967 or 1968, does not matter as long as we are progressing and advancing towards the goals in the White Paper. Deputy Coughlan called it Aesop's <Col N="1003" /> Fables, although he admitted finally that it was a White Paper, which was an admission for him.  Whichever way it goes, I wish the Minister the very best of luck.  He will have his work cut out.  Many tributes have been paid to him from all sides and whoever thought of the choice of doctor, or the choice of hospital, or of this thing or the other thing, there is the man who is going to legislate for them&mdash;&mdash;</P>
