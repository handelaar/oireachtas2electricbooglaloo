    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether he made suggestions to the authorities at Radio or Telefís Éireann following which news items were changed or deleted; and, if so, the number of occasions and the reasons for his actions on all such occasions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether he suggested to Radio or Telefís Éireann that certain individuals be not allowed to broadcast; if so, the number of occasions and the reasons for his actions on all such occasions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Radio Telefís Éireann was set up by legislation as <Col N="1046" /> an instrument of public policy and as such is responsible to the Government. The Government have over-all responsibility for its conduct and especially the obligation to ensure that its programmes do not offend against the public interest or conflict with national policy as defined in legislation.</P>
      <P>To this extent the Government reject the view that Radio Telefís Éireann should be, either generally or in regard to its current affairs and news programmes, completely independent of Government supervision.  As a public institution supported by public funds and operating under statute, it has the duty, while maintaining impartiality between political Parties, to present programmes which inform the public regarding current affairs, to sustain public respect for the institutions of Government and, where appropriate, to assist public understanding of the policies enshrined in legislation enacted by the Oireachtas.  The Government will take such action by way of making representations or otherwise as may be necessary to ensure that Radio Telefís Éireann does not deviate from the due performance of this duty.</P>
      <P>I do not propose to reply any more specifically to Questions Nos.2 and 3.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very difficult to follow the answer given by the Taoiseach, without having had an opportunity of looking at it.  I gather that the Taoiseach says that members of the Government have responsibility and that each Government Minister and the Government as a whole have the power to make representations or give directions to Radio Telefís Éireann as to what news items should be included?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not appear from what the Taoiseach said that it has this basic independence because in his answer he inferred that because the Government had this responsibility, they had the power to interfere if they thought it was for the public good.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Has any individual member of the Government a right of censorship as opposed to a right of reply on Radio Telefís Éireann?  Has any individual member a right to say: &ldquo;Take that item off&rdquo;?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Has any member of the Government the right to say to Radio Telefís Éireann: &ldquo;Take this item off&rdquo;? I concede the right of the Minister to say: &ldquo;I claim the right to offer a statement in reply to what you are <Col N="1048" /> putting on&rdquo; but has he a right to say: &ldquo;Take that off&rdquo;?  If he has, Radio Telefís Éireann is a miserable pawn of the Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs has that power. When Telefís Éireann was being established we had very considerable hesitation in adopting this device of entrusting it to an independent authority instead of retaining it as a service under the control of the Minister responsible to the House, as was the radio service before the Act of 1960. There is, I think, a very special obligation on the Government to ensure that the decision to entrust this responsibility to an independent authority does not conflict with the public interest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. Carty)</NameTxt>
      <P>Figures for the net outward passenger balance by sea and air are the only indicators available of net emigration for periods other than intervals between successive censuses of population. While the figures in question proved, in the intercensal periods 1951-56 and 1956-61, to be reasonably accurate indicators of net emigration the same was not true for the last intercensal <Col N="1050" /> period 1961-66.  In that period the aggregate returned for the net outward passenger movement by sea and air was about 40 per cent larger than the net emigration for the same period. A possible explanation of this is the increase in the number of tourists who entered the State in each year across the land border and subsequently departed by sea or air.</P>
      <P>Because of the incidence of tourist movements, figures relating to inward and outward movements by sea and air can give varying results at different periods of the year.</P>
      <P>For the twelve-month period ended August, 1966, the net outward passenger movement by sea and air was 36,960 persons.  The unreliability of this figure as an indicator of net emigration must however be stressed.</P>

      <P>Does not a particular important parliamentary principle arise? The Taoiseach claims the same right to approach Radio Telefís Éireann, as any other Minister charged with the responsibility for a State-sponsored body has a right to make such representation, but will he not agree that any such Minister &mdash; notably the Minister for Transport and Power&mdash;if he makes <Col N="1055" /> a specific representation outside the day-to-day operations of the institution, is bound to answer to this House for the order he gave?  Is the Taoiseach not now claiming the right to give directions or make representations of an exceptional character to a State-sponsored body, without the corresponding obligation of answering to Oireachtas Éireann for the order he gave?

      <P>Nobody claims that Radio Telefís Éireann is like a leper colony into which no citizen of this State may send a letter or speak a word.  All I am asking the Taoiseach is this.  He says: &ldquo;I have as much right as Head of the Government to make representations to Radio Telefís Éireann as a State-sponsored body&rdquo;, just as he says: &ldquo;any of my Ministers responsible for a State-sponsored body is entitled, under specific circumstances, to take a specific action&rdquo;.  I am asking does the Taoiseach not agree with me that one of his Ministers, doing that in respect of a State-sponsored body, must then answer to Dáil Éireann if he is asked to do so? Does the Taoiseach claim the right, exceptionally, in regard to Radio Telefís Éireann that he can make these exceptional representations or issue these exceptional orders, without the corresponding right to answer to Dáil Éireann because, if he does, that is all wrong, because the only difference between dictatorship and parliamentary government is that all the Ministers &mdash; whether they are Fine Gael, Labour, or Fianna Fáil Ministers&mdash;can be called to account for their actions in Dáil Éireann?

      <P>Cash grants amounting to 20 per cent of the cost are provided by Bord Fáilte for the construction of additional guesthouse bedrooms or the improvement of existing guesthouse accommodation.  Heretofore, these grants were confined to guesthouses which would have ten guest bedrooms on completion of the project.  I recently authorised Bord Fáilte to make grants available to guesthouses which would have five guest bedrooms on completion of the project.  Owners of private houses can avail of these grants to enable them to attain registrable standard.</P>
      <P>I have also authorised the payment of grants of 50 per cent of the cost, up to a maximum of £75, of architectural surveys of registered premises with less than 20 bedrooms, provided the associated development works proceed.</P>

    <P>Registered guesthouses are also <Col N="1058" /> eligible for assistance in the form of guaranteed loans and interest grants.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte recently carried out an investigation of accommodation requirements and have estimated that it will be necessary to provide 2,000 additional bedrooms a year up to and including 1970 to achieve the target set for tourism in the Second Programme for Economic Expansion.  Of the total of 2,000 bedrooms, it is estimated that 1,200 should be in hotels, 300 in guesthouses and the remainder in supplementary accommodation.

      <P>With a view to the preparation of a drainage scheme a joint survey of the Finn catchment was commenced this year by engineers of the Office of Public Works and the Northern Ministry of Finance.</P>
      <P>The Fane is No. 20 on the priority list of minor catchments to be dealt with under the Arterial Drainage Act 1945, and it will be some years yet before it is reached in the programme.</P>
      <P>The Dromore river is in the portion of the Erne catchment which lies wholly within the State, and for which an arterial drainage scheme is at present being designed.  It will be at least a year before the design is completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the Northern authorities are dealing with the portion of the Blackwater north of the border in sections commencing at the outfall into Lough Neagh.  They do not expect to reach the border stretch for three or four years and the Office of Public <Col N="1062" /> Works then hope to join them in the survey of this section.

      <P>As I have stated to the Deputy, a scheme is in process of being designed at the moment.  I think it would be premature to attempt to speculate about the date when work will commence because the scheme, having been designed, will have to be examined as to its merits and as to its cost, and for those and other reasons, it would be unwise to attempt to speculate about the probable date of the commencement of work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>The laying off of men arose mainly from the completion <Col N="1064" /> of works on the Ballina and Deel River rock cuts and the seasonal suspension of rock excavation works elsewhere on the scheme.

      <P>May I inquire if the Parliamentary Secretary realises the seriousness of turning men out of employment at present, in view of the wave of depression that has hit the country, and particularly the west of Ireland, as a result of the Minister for Agriculture not having helped farmers to dispose of their cattle and sheep which are left on their hands?

      <P>I suggest that the Deputy should discuss the cattle and sheep part of his question with the Minister for Agriculture.  As far as the employment of men on the Moy drainage scheme is concerned, at such work as rock cutting and drilling, it should be evident to the Deputy that it is not possible to carry out rock drilling in winter time and it is not the normal practice.

      <P>On 3rd September, 1965, an application was made to Dublin Corporation for planning permission for the construction of an extension to an existing cleaning works located in Synge Lane at the rear of 15 Harrington Street.  By order dated the 29th October, 1965, Dublin Corporation decided to refuse the permission sought and on 1st December an appeal against this decision was received in my Department.  An objection to the grant of any permission in this case, was also received by me from the occupier of an adjoining house.  A decision on the appeal will be made as soon as possible.</P>

This is of particular benefit where &ldquo;hard shoulders&rdquo; are provided on major routes as a built-in safety feature.  These shoulders or margins serve as emergency stopping or parking places for vehicular traffic and provide a &ldquo;safety zone&rdquo; for pedestrians.  They are not intended as an additional lane for vehicular traffic and should not be so used.  I may add that the significance of these markings is stated clearly in the &ldquo;Rules of the Road&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 68 to 70 together.</P>
      <P>Regarding Questions Nos. 69 and 70, I would refer the Deputy to the reply given by the Taoiseach to similar Dáil questions.</P>
      <P>As regards Question No. 68, on the date in question I telephoned the Radio Telefís Éireann News Division to protest about the manner in which a statement of mine and a contradictory statement from a farmers' organisation were presented in juxtaposition on the 9.45 p.m. television news bulletin. In my statement, made in Dáil Éireann in reply to questions from Deputies, I specifically advised farmers to hold on to their cattle, where possible, until prices improved.  This advice was given by me on the basis of an objective appraisal of the situation and with the best interests of the farmers and of the nation in mind.  It was accepted by the House.  For the RTE News Division to confront this advice with a contradiction from an organisation representing a section of farmers could, in my opinion, only serve to make perplexed farmers more perplexed.  I pointed this out to the News Division.  I did not ask that the other statement be deleted from television or radio news bulletins.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Because I thought there was a very important fundamental national interest involved in this matter.

      <P>In response to questions from Deputies which I believe were asked for the purpose of genuinely informing the farmers of the situation.  I gave my advice in this regard.  My recollection, at any rate, is that no Deputy challenged that advice.  It was accepted by the House, and I think it was a very unwise thing to say the least of it, for Radio Telefís Éireann to follow that solemn advice of mine given as Minister for Agriculture with a contradiction by one organisation.  I pointed this out to the News Room of Telefís Éireann and I think I was absolutely right in doing so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice whether his attention has been drawn to the circumstances in which a homeless and friendless man was sentenced to one month in jail at the District Court in Swords, County Dublin for stealing 10/- which the Garda stated they accepted he wanted to buy food, being both physically and mentally ill; and whether he will release this man from jail and ensure that the appropriate social services will be alterted to protect him and to provide such services as his essential welfare may require.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have inquired into the case in question.</P>
      <P>The form of this question is based, presumably, on a newspaper account of the court proceedings but the account is, understandably, abbreviated and does not give some relevant facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In sentencing the defendant to imprisonment for one month for house-breaking, the court, on 4th October, took into account the fact that at another court on 9th August the defendant had been given a suspended sentence of six months imprisonment after a plea of guilty to six separate charges of theft committed during a period of three months earlier in 1966. In committing the defendant the court recommended that while in prison he should be kept under observation as to his mental condition.  He has been under observation as to his mental <Col N="1089" /> health but there is nothing to show that he is mentally deficient or unstable.</P>
    <P>The defendant has, on occasions, refused to accept, or failed to keep employment procured for him by the Garda and a number of social agencies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the District Justice is reported in the papers, and has not corrected it, as saying: &ldquo;I do not think anybody in the courtroom is very happy about the result of the case but it is the best I can do in the circumstances of the society in which we live&rdquo;?  He describes himself as satisfied that the man at the time of sentence is not only physically but mentally ill, as satisfied that the man is homeless and friendless and hungry and as satisfied that the man entered the premises through an unlocked door and took from the room 10/- out of 30/- because he needed the money for food.  Is it appropriate in those circumstances that that man, friendless, homeless, hungry and sick, should be sentenced to a month in jail because, if that is true, we are not a civilised, much less a Christian community?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us get this thing in perspective.  I read the newspaper report myself and I have investigated the matter very closely.  What I said in my reply are the facts, that there were six other charges against him as well as this particular one. From investigation of the matter, I am satisfied that the abbreviated newspaper report did not contain accurately what the District Justice said on the occasion.  Secondly, I am satisfied that, on the personal level, from this man's own point of view, having regard to his mental condition and otherwise, the best place for him is where he is under proper medical supervision and observation and from his point of view, it would be better if the matter were allowed to lie at that.</P>

      <P>We are bound to give consideration to the welfare of any destitute person who comes within our knowledge but, surely, if a person in <Col N="1090" /> this country is friendless and homeless, our purpose should be to show that in our society nobody can be friendless, that if he has no other friends, he has 147 friends here in Dáil Éireann; that nobody in our society can be homeless: that if someone is homeless, we will provide him with a home; that no one can be sick mentally or physically with no one to care: that if he is sick mentally or physically we will take care of him, we will take him in?</P>

      <P>The midland areas, in common with other parts of the country, already have available to them generous incentives, including grants and tax concessions, which have been provided by the Government in the interest of stimulating new and expanded <Col N="1103" /> industrial activities.  The incentives available by way of tax concessions are applicable uniformly to all areas of the country and provide for full relief from tax over a period of years on profits derived from exports. Industrial grants are applicable to the midland areas on the same basis as to the rest of the country with the exception of the undeveloped areas. The legislation enacted in 1963, however, substantially reduced the differential between the industrial grants available to undeveloped areas and those available to other areas in the country.</P>
      <P>I do not consider that the introduction of legislation to provide for special incentives applicable to the midland areas would be warranted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I was dealing with the matter of differential rents last night.  There are a number of points which I wish to add.  In particular, I wish to answer some of the criticisms raised, particularly by Deputies who have talked about Dublin and Dublin Corporation's proposed new rents scheme.  I want to indicate, from what I know of this proposed scheme, some few facts and figures that, if they are known, are not apparently appreciated.  These figures, to my mind, are very necessary in order that the workout of this new proposal should be understood.</P>
      <P>The methods of applying the new scales, I understand, very briefly come in this manner.  Assessable income is arrived at by taking the income of the tenant or the main breadwinner in the house.  His income is first of all reduced by £1.  A maximum of £4 for each subsidiary earner, excluding the first 10/- of any income this earner may have, is then added.  A reduction of 10/- is made in respect of each child under 16 years of age who has no income and who resides with the parents in that particular house.  The children's allowances &mdash; whatever number they may be &mdash; are excluded entirely from assessable income.  The calculation of income from social welfare benefits, other than certain contributory benefits, will be at the 1957 level &mdash; not at today's levels.  A comparison of this new formula in order to arrive at assessable income with that which has already been in existence would fall mainly under the following heads. Again, the principal income in the old scheme was reduced by 10/-.  It is now proposed to reduce it by £1.  Under the old scheme 5/- per child was allowed for each child after the second.  That was a deduction from the ultimate income and it has to be compared now with a deduction of 10/- for every child under the proposed scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to subsidiary earners, their income under the old scheme was reduced by 5/- and was subject to a <Col N="1106" /> maximum consideration in the overall assessable income of £2.  That has been changed.  Under the new proposals that is now reduced by 10/- but is subject to a maximum of £4 to be added. These figures will give the Deputies a broad picture of the manner in which income for the purpose of determining rent on the various scales is arrived at.  There again we have to consider the situation in relation to the application of the new proposed scales.  In relation first of all to any rent revisions that take place in regard to existing tenants, it is proposed under the new schemes to spread any increases over five years.  The highest increase in the first year will not exceed 9/- a week.  It must also be deduced from these proposals that tenants with up to nearly £14 per week will, in fact, have their rents reduced, not increased.</P>
    <P>There is then the point &mdash; most Opposition Deputies ignored it, deliberately or otherwise &mdash; that the increases apply only to maxima and therefore only the better off tenants will be affected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I can record only what I have been given to understand.  If the Deputy finds my information is wrong, I am sure he will be only too happy to correct me.  To continue with what is allegedly wrong.  I should also point out that the new scales, as will be clear from an examination of what I have said, provide for enhanced allowances which will benefit poorer tenants in particular.  I understand that no tenant will pay a greater amount in the ordinary run of things, excluding newly-weds, than one-sixth of his assessable income in rent.  Percentages may give the picture more clearly.  On the calculations made, 35 per cent of the tenants affected will, in fact, be affected downwards; they will have their rents reduced.  These things must be taken into consideration in discussing proposed rent increases and they should, in particular, be taken into consideration when the Minister is accused of causing rents to be increased.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> Is it correct then that the earnings of <Col N="1107" /> children under a certain figure &mdash; it is, I think, £2 &mdash; are excluded?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>£4.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  What will be excluded from the calculation is the first 10/- and up to £4 of what they earn. A maximum of £4 will be included. That is, after 10/-, anything up to £4 may be included.  Anything beyond that is not taken into account in calculating the assessable income of the particular family.</P>
      <P>I have some other figures which are, I think, relevant.  I do not want to load the House down with figures because I think everyone will agree that Dublin Corporation's overall differential rents scheme is a very complex one.  However, in order to pay the maximum rent under the proposed new scheme, a tenant with three children will need to have an income of £28 per week, or over, if he is in a four-roomed house.  If he is in a five-roomed house, he will need to have something around or above £31 per week assessable income. It is known that there are something like 100 tenants in the corporation scheme &mdash; it is a very small percentage &mdash; with family incomes of over £60 per week.  There are a few thousand with family incomes of over £30 per week.  I have not got the exact breakdown, but, as a guideline to what lies behind the proposed rationalisation of rents, I want to go on record as pointing out that the old maxima, much lower than are now proposed, worked out positively in favour of the better off tenant.  That was demonstrated time out of number.  When there was an increase in wages or earnings, the poorer tenant invariably found himself in the position in which part of his increase went in paying an addition by way of rent whereas the person on the maximum had naturally to pay no increase at all.  The system, as I say, worked in favour of the better off tenant.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the City Manager's proposals will have the effect that the rents of some <Col N="1108" /> thousands of corporation tenants will be increased 200 per cent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no fewer than 35 per cent of tenants who will have their rents decreased.  I did not hear anyone slap the City Manager on the back for that effort nor did I hear anybody comment on it from that side of the House.  I am rather surprised, and a little disappointed, that the only utterances we have heard from the Labour benches were directed at supporting a system which aids the better off while doing nothing for the less well off.  Genuinely I have been disappointed about that.</P>

Different local authorities may devise their own schemes of renting to suit their particular circumstances and they might not suit another local authority.

I have gone on record, before ever this circular was issued, as saying that until it is demonstrated that there is no truth in this belief, that there is no fat to be got from those who are battening on the ratepayers of Dublin by living in houses on subsidised rents far below what they could afford to pay, I did not, and could not, go to my colleagues in the Government to ask for more money from the taxpayers.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not.  I have two notes in reply to two Deputies who brought up the point that this was a revenue earner.  I want to say this is not the purpose.  It is certainly not the purpose I had in mind at any time, that it should be used as a revenue earner.  My belief, in regard to this, for quite a considerable time, is that, first of all, we have rents at a level beyond the capacity of quite a number of people to pay.  Those people, in some cases, are struggling to pay their rents. They are not able to do so.  We have others who did not accept the offer of houses over the years because even at the lowest level of rents obtaining, they were not able to afford the rents asked.  Those people still continue to live in unfit conditions.  I want to see them rehoused.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to see local authorities in the position that they can rehouse those people.  I want it to be clearly understood that if we are to build more houses and reduce the rents, we have <Col N="1115" /> got to find a lot more money than we have found, even up to now.  If there is truth in the belief, and the allegations I have heard made outside this House, that there are tenants in corporation estates or indeed any other estates, who are in fact well able to pay more than they are paying, and that they are getting away with paying those low rents, when they could afford to pay properly for their houses, then I feel that those people in those circumstances should be asked to pay a little more so that we may charge a little less to those who are unable to pay the rents of the houses they are in, or who could not take houses because the present rates are too high.</P>
    <P>The alternative to this is that we throw more onto the rates.  This is the only alternative at the moment.  In a few months' time, we will have the local elections.  Many of the Deputies who oppose what I have said, in regard to increasing the rents for people who can afford to pay them, obviously have their eyes, when talking about the increased rents, on those local elections. The great majority of the people in this town are ratepayers at the moment.  Do those people who oppose what I have said about these increased rents have an eye on the effect on the ratepayers?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Those also can be added to the other ratepayers.  As I say, the great majority of the people in this town, from the point of view of the effect they would have on the local elections, are, in fact, ratepayers.  Is it that you want to play one off against the other?  It is always better tactics politically, if for no other good reason, to try to play with the majority rather than the minority.  Have the Labour Party slipped up in this matter?  Some of them, not all, seem to have mixed the group they wish to pander to at the moment.  That group is in fact the minority group.  They are no better off, in pandering to those people, except to leave the poorer sections poorer, and without houses, because they cannot <Col N="1116" /> pay the rents they are asked to pay. This is something which the Labour Party should consider.  As I say, not all of them seem to be of the same voice in this connection.  We had other voices from their Party on this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am suggesting that there are some people on the Labour benches who are in fact pandering to popularity, and to what may be gained from the better off people.  They are trying to side with them.  When they do so, they neglect the poorer sections of the same group in this city, and indeed in any other city.  This really astounds me.  I cannot understand it.  That is why I feel this is not just the voice of the Labour Party, that it is not the voice of most of the Labour Party and that there are in the Labour Party yet many members who believe that the people who have first call on us are those poorer people for whom we should provide those amenities and that we should get around to the point where we believe that those who may have been of that class in the past, but have fortunately passed from that, by reason of a rise in their living conditions over the years, should be asked to pay more.</P>
      <P>Those who are against what I propose say: &ldquo;Anything you have got for a good period in the past, when you were poorer, you are entitled to hold on to, even if by so doing you make the poor poorer still.&rdquo;  I do not understand this and probably I never will.  Let me go further and say that there are over 100 cases of incomes of over £60 gross in the week and a couple of thousand with gross incomes of over £30 a week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have also got to get down to this point of whether the ratepayers of this city are better able to bear a greater amount for the subsidising of tenancies than the tenants of council estates or whether it is fairer in all the circumstances, if there is something to be got from the better-off tenants, that <Col N="1117" /> we should get that before we go to the ratepayers to ask them for more, and to pay subsidy to help the poorer elements in the community.  As I said at an earlier stage, until it is demonstrated that such a situation does not exist, and some people would have us believe that there are no such people living in corporation houses, that there are no people who are living in corporation houses and subsidised, I cannot accept the idea put to me that the State, through taxes, should contribute a greater amount through subsidy towards this particular matter out of the taxpayers' pocket.</P>
    <P>I think it only logical and fair that until we lay the ghost, if there is a ghost, that there are people well off getting away with small rents, I cannot see how the Members of this House or the members of any local authority can say to the ratepayers, about whom the same Deputies will scream, that we will leave these better-off people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>That we will leave these better-off people in the situation they are enjoying, with a subsidy from the rates and the subsidy from the Government, because they are already there, that even though they have good houses at very low rent and have much more than good value as a result, we will leave them there and charge on the rates so many more pence in the £ this year, that we will go to the Government and to the Minister for Local Government and try to get more pence put on the taxpayers in order that these people should be allowed to continue to get benefits.  I do not think that in our circumstances we can afford to give that while so many people are yet unhoused, or are paying rents they cannot afford with the incomes and commitments they have.</P>

      <P>This is a differential rents system which has been accepted by a great many people.  It has its faults.  No system was ever devised that has no faults.  But, by and large, it has appeared over the years that it is making quite a lot of inroads in our housing estates throughout the country. The earnest of it is those who pay will, if they do come down, have to go down the scale again.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I checked on that little note last night.  What I am trying to point out is that with the £16 to £18 a week, this is brought about because we do not take people on a high level of income.  It is undoubtedly the income at the time of borrowing that is in question.  On the other hand, while only the income of the borrower is in question, it is also very likely that that person borrowed at or around the time he got married or shortly afterwards, and for the next 20 years, even though his income may go up, his liabilities <Col N="1122" /> will, undoubtedly, all too often rise even faster.  The last state of this poor man, probably 20 years later, is no better than the first state.  The whole point is that we have those people whose incomes rise but whose liabilities also increase &mdash; they may get little notes &mdash; and unless they anticipate some liabilities, they will not buy a house.  I do not imagine a single fellow will build a house for himself just for the pleasure of sitting on his own for the rest of his days.  The type of person who undertakes to build a house, even without dependants, and whose earnings on average are around £16 to £18 a week and is undertaking this sort of repayment for 35 years of £4 to £5 a week or £3 to £5 a week, depending on how much he borrowed, is less well off than the great majority of those who are in council houses.  They are undertaking these liabilities.  They are not imposing on the community, and not standing around waiting for the community to build a house for them but taking the burden on themselves.  These people are a credit to the country, particularly at that income level.  They are a credit to any country and should be a headline to others better off who look for council houses.  It would be doing those people a service, those people whose income is much higher, to give them a little nudge to wake them up to the fact that they should now go out and build their own houses, which is the ideal of every adult person in any country.  It would be a service to those people to point out to them the courage of people who earn £16 to £18 a week, that is, the people who borrow under the SDA.  Their courage should be brought to the notice of the others who are better off and the encouragement might induce them to build their own houses.  They would thank those people who brought it to their notice every day of their lives thereafter.</P>

I want to reply on this matter of the £18.  I gave a figure about the proposed new scheme of rents in Dublin city.  Tenants with up to almost £14 a week will have their rents reduced.  I have not got the figure for £18, where there are no dependants, other than the man and wife.  By the time the £14 people have got £4 further up, they will be on the maximum, up the scale a bit.

    <P>The rents problem is a very big one, a very vital one and has a bearing on the future development of and addition to our housing estates because if we feel &mdash; as many people say we should feel &mdash; that the ratepayers are already carrying in many cases year after year more than is fair, then we have got to look around and ask ourselves: &ldquo;Is, the taxpayer contributing to this housing subsidisation business a fair share or can he reasonably be expected to add a bit more to it?&rdquo; as I am being asked to do.  Coming back from that, <Col N="1126" /> in so far as the taxpayers is concerned, until you have demonstrated that there are not people in the housing estates in Dublin or elsewhere getting away with it, I cannot &mdash; even if I wanted to &mdash; nor would I have any hope &mdash; go to my colleagues in the Government looking for an increased subsidy for housing.</P>
    <P>If it is demonstrated that there is nothing in what is being said, in what is being brought to me and what is being said outside and all around the city &mdash; and the only way it can be demonstrated is by ascertaining whether or not people are earning the amounts we believe they are earning &mdash; then these increases do not take place because if they have not the income, they cannot and will not be asked to pay the increases.  If they are not there, I will carry it along to the Government and say to them that Dublin Corporation, the elected members, have done this in a way that would have flushed out any of these people and we find there are none.  If the ratepayers cannot be asked to pay any more to reduce the rents of the 35 per cent, I would be going and saying: &ldquo;Look, the Government must come in on this to help the corporation to keep the rents down so that these poor people can afford to occupy the houses.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If we get to that stage, then the Minister for Local Government will have a case with which to go to the Government.  At the moment he has no case; he cannot face up to the prospect of even talking, and this applies to any Minister for Local Government, not me today, yesterday or the next day.  I have long since given this as a view and a tip-off to the people over there who are interested in the whole matter in Dublin, that this is the way to approach the whole problems if they are to hope to succeed.  In raising subsidy rates from the central exchequer, they must demonstrate that it cannot reasonably be got anywhere else.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister gives the impression that unless the rates burden is increased to that point, there will be no consideration for a revision of the level of subsidy which, apparently, has been dropping considerably year <Col N="1127" /> by year for the past ten or 15 years. The Minister has the figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation is this: I believe we have the responsibility, as a community, to provide for those who cannot provide for themselves and, as the demand in providing the standards of the various services rises with the change and modernisation of these times, the burden becomes heavier on the community.  Therefore, any slipshod method of approaching the administration of the services which may have been capable of being covered in the past cannot be afforded in the future.  Therefore the rationalisation of rents, in this particular instance, is one which Deputies and councillors should endeavour to carry out, with the very good object of enabling them to provide more for those who need something most and to charges less for the services to people who cannot at the moment afford to pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>This document has been concocted by the City Manager, presented by the City Manager and will be processed by the City Manager.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is that it has been attacked without its having been discussed and I am merely giving a version, I hope as objectively as I can, of what I understand to be the proposal of the manager.  It will have its airing, its discussion and will ultimately, in some form, be carried out or otherwise given to the Minister for sanction.  I can assure the House that when a proposal does come to me, it will get the greatest possible consideration in every detail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will now step down the country for a moment and suggest that there is something in the Clonmel differential rents scheme &mdash; which has already been discussed down there &mdash; which I believe to be wrong and which I will not sanction in its present form.  This comes from a statement made by Deputy Treacy in talking about these rents down there.  He said that the rent increases up to 10/- applied indiscriminately and were a drag on the standard of living of the working <Col N="1128" /> classes.  He said he was not against differential rents in principle; he was last year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>Neither am I.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is at least three of us in the House who are not against them in principle.  We would have come quite a way if we could convert all the others in the House.  It is only a matter of working them out but what I want to say to Deputy Treacy is that he is completely wrong, or his scheme is completely wrong, if the increases are applied indiscriminately. That does not constitute the &ldquo;differential rent&rdquo; principle which Deputy Larkin, Deputy Treacy and I have agreed upon.  Indiscriminate increases are not differential rents. Each tenant's rent is related to his ability to pay &mdash; that is the whole essence of differential rents.</P>
      <P>Another point mentioned here &mdash; and I think it came from the country as well &mdash; was that rents might be increased without the tenants being told why.  If that is a feature of the rents scheme of any local authority, they will be humped out the door of the Custom House faster than anything that ever came in before.  These are only little odds and ends but they are an indication of my attitude towards the proposals that will come forward. When proposals come forward which appear to be fairly reasonably based and, above all other things, attain the end of reducing rents for those who cannot pay, I will begin to look favourably on them, but if I find that these proposals are put forward merely as revenue earners, I am afraid they will not be acceptable to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Their primary objective must be to bring down rents, and keep down rents to a sufficiently low level &mdash; even down to zero &mdash; that we will be in a position to say truthfully that there is no one in this country who cannot get a house because he cannot afford to pay rent.  That is the aim and the ideal which I think we are entitled to set for ourselves.  If a differential renting system, or any other system, can help to bring about that situation, it will be sympathetically considered.  If it does <Col N="1129" /> not contain this very elementary and, I would say, primary object of enabling rents to be put down and kept down and reduced further to cater for all our people, and for the poorest of our people, the local authorities need not bother sending it to the Custom House because I will have no interest in it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no quarrel with the Minister on that score.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that is more than enough to say about these renting systems because the further we go, the more confusing it gets.  That is my aim and so far as I am concerned in any part I will play in differential rents or rents of any kind in order to house the poor, anything that tends in that direction will be sympathetically considered.  Anything that does not will get a very severe examination, and I would not hold out much hope that any scheme that does not will get my approval.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree that his whole argument proves our argument when we accuse the Government of believing that building houses is a bad investment?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought the Deputy was arguing that Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil agreed that it was a bad investment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I have asked the Minister a question.  Will he say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say more than just &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  Not only do we not believe it is a bad investment but we believe it is an essential investment.  We believe we must invest even more in it.  The essence of the whole exercise is to provide houses for a greater number of people at cheaper rents.  That is for people who cannot afford to pay.  Those who can afford to pay more can pay it, and if they do <Col N="1130" /> not like it, they can leave the house. They will be given an opportunity to buy the house.  If they do not want to move, they can stay and pay the rent, or they can buy it.  A remedy which will immediately occur to them is that they can get out and but their own house, and leave the house they are in for someone who is less fortunate, and who will then be charged a rent related to the new income.  The new tenant may get the house at a lower rent than the tenant leaving was paying.</P>
      <P>This is the whole endeavour of the officials of the Department and of myself as Minister for Local Government in a Fianna Fáil Government. This has always been our intention, and our actions have spoken louder than words over the past 34 years. Since Fianna Fáil took office, we have always been vitally concerned with house-building, particularly for those who cannot build houses for themselves. I am happy to assure Deputy Harte that we join with all those who hold the same view and we will continue to have that as our outlook. Everything that can possibly be done will be done to bring about the happy situation in which the people will have housing adequate to their needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>

      <P>Deputy Larkin spoke at length on this Estimate, as did Deputy Harte for almost three hours.  The Minister should be allowed to make his speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Larkin missed his cue.  We do subsidise these people. We subsidise everyone who builds a house, up to a reasonably high standard.  We subsidise them up to 1,400 square feet and, if anyone wants to build a castle or a mansion, good <Col N="1131" /> luck to him and more power to him if he can do it, but we will not subsidise him.  We subsidise 99 per cent of the houses that go up in this country, no matter who builds them.  In the case of private building, we do it by way of grant and in the case of public housing, we do it by way of subsidy on loan charges.  We do help them.  So far as the SDA group is concerned, the only complaint is that we are not providing them with money to help more of them. This is a very vital service, as everyone knows.  It is not a question of what you pay for the money.  It is a question of how you get the money.  We reserve this money for people who might not be able to get it from the ordinary commercial sources.  This is an invaluable service which we should like to expand and extend to more people if we could.  Maybe we will if we have sufficient money to add to that which we are already spending.  The Deputy should not get the idea that I am merely giving them empty praise for their endeavours.</P>
      <P>Points were raised that the level of the grants should be increased, that reconstruction estimates were too low, that names and addresses of inspectors should be made available, that there was too much red tape, and that advice should be given to tenants intending to purchase houses.  The level of the grants was considered and debated at great length during the passage of the 1966 Act, and I do not think there is any point in arguing that matter all over again here tonight. Estimates for reconstruction jobs are standard prices in the Department and those prices are constantly reviewed and brought up to date, so I would not agree with a general condemnation that these estimates are too low.  In deed we have reconsidered cases where it was suggested that the estimate was too low and we have revised estimates in a number of cases.  But generally, our estimates are in or about what a fair price would be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been no undue delay in the payment of grants.  I want to say this again.  I hope it will be repeated by many people in this House: there has been no undue delay in any <Col N="1132" /> general way in the payment of grants in the present financial year.  I do not anticipate any general undue delay for the remainder of the financial year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister referring to the Department of the local authorities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>We hope to give a service to the people building their own houses which will be as fast as our administration and procedure allows.  This has always been the endeavour of my Department.  There has been much talk about red tape which surprise me because there is not a great deal of red tape that is unavoidable very often by people outside rather than inside.  We get applications in respect of houses that are already being lived in.  We get applications for grants to do reconstruction that has already been done.  The work is covered over and plastered.  We are told they had to put in this and that but it is very hard to know at that stage.  We want to be fair to the people and we do not disbelieve them in any case.  We go out in the belief that we are there to help them pay for the very necessary work they have done in building a new house which they badly need long after they have done the job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In these cases, undoubtedly, there will be delays.  Inspections are necessary. Their plans may have been wrong in some respect and their standards may not be standards with which we can agree and which will cause loss to themselves later on.  We see if we can get these matters remedied if it is possible but sometimes the cost is beyond the capacity of the applicant.  Therefore, we have to pay him nothing and leave him in a worse condition or pay him less than he would otherwise be entitled to get for a job which is inadequate. These cases can continue to come in.  Other Departments say: &ldquo;If you do not apply and get approval beforehand you will not get any grant.&rdquo; I agree that is the neat way of doing it but in our case we take into account a job that perhaps started four of five years ago and for some reason was stopped and then they re-apply.  Things <Col N="1133" /> have changed and they come in again. We go to any lengths to try to accommodate these people because we believe our primary purpose is to help people to build or reconstruct houses. Anything we can do, we wish to do it, if it is within the law.</P>
    <P>If there are delays that appear to the applicant as niggling matters it may be found that if the people had a full understanding of the situation, we are delaying their cases in an effort to find a way around the law so as to help them to get grants that otherwise perhaps they would not be eligible for. These delays do happen, especially in a Department as large and wideflung as the Department of Local Government. Files are occasionally mislaid and documents that should have gone into one file inadvertently find their way to another in some cases.  These things will happen and will continue to happen but, we hope, in as few cases as possible.</P>
    <P>When criticising the administration of these grants in these cases we should realize that we are dealing with a situation where there are probably the bones of 37,000 cases of one kind or another &mdash; over 27,000 I think in the past year. All these various cases entail at least two inspections, possibly three or four or five.  In some cases we are notified that the work is finished and when the inspector calls the person is not at home or he may be at home but the work is unfinished which he said had been finished.  I have seen cases where the applicant says he has finished the job but he leaves some things unpainted or he has not put on door knobs or put glass into some of the windows.  He intends to have this done by the time the inspector gets down to make the inspection but something else turns up and he does not do it.  It may be that the inspector is on a circuit near the applicant and is with him very quickly when the file goes down but the fact is that if the job is not finished the applicant has wasted the inspector's time and his own.  No grant can be made, he must still finish the job and he must still notify us.  Only when everything is nearly right can we pay the grant.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1134" /> I do not claim that we are infallible in the administration of these grants or in doing these inspections but we claim that we try to make as few mistakes as possible and give the benefit of the doubt to applicants in every possible way within the law.  I would ask applicants, of whom there are thousands, to take a little more trouble in trying to do their part in regard to submitting applications, getting approval of plans and doing things a little more in the order that would help us in the Department to help them.  If they do that we will give an even better service in the future than we have been able to give in the past. I cannot say more than that about the talk of red tape.</P>
    <P>Section 24 of the Housing Act of 1966 has a bearing on the question of dower rooms in local authority houses because in that section provision is made in respect of local authority houses for an additional room to be added.  This may not be the entire answer to what is advocated here but it is certainly a very big improvement in regard to local authority houses.  It was suggested finally that we should give more advice to intending house purchasers.  All I can say is that this is something we would be eager to do and we have been looking into the matter to see what we can do.  An explanatory booklet is, in fact, at present being prepared.</P>
    <P>In regard to group water supply schemes the points raised generally were in regard to the inadequate supplies of water and in some cases that has become only too evident.  In this regard I should say that yield-testing at source&mdash;this is now being carried out; it was not done in the early stages which I think was a mistake as was found to the cost of all concerned, not in a great number of cases but in quite a number &mdash; will, I think, take care of 99 per cent of cases in the future.  We may still have an odd one where the supply dries up or disappears without any explanation but I think we can look forward to a fairly trouble-free operation in regard to adequacy of group water schemes in the future.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1135" /> The specific case of Ballinabreana, Co. Carlow, was mentioned and I agree that the delay complained of is too long but the selection of a suitable source of supply took more time than one might expect.  I see that the design of the scheme has now been approved by Carlow County Council and the people who are pushing the scheme are making satisfactory progress.</P>
    <P>Subsidies on local authority houses were mentioned by quite a number of Deputies.  There were complaints also that the subsidy had been reduced in respect of the rehousing of subtenants. Another complaint was that housing authorities are reluctant to rehouse subtenants. That was from Deputy Cluskey, of course.  It was said that local authorities were not allowed to rehouse subtenants.  That suggestion came from Deputy Coughlan.  The first man to raise the matter was my old friend from the deep south, Deputy Corry.</P>
    <P>Under these general headings &mdash; other Deputies spoke about them &mdash; housing authorities must let their houses in accordance with the statutory priorities and not in accordance with the subsidy payments allowed.  This means that they let their houses without question of the subsidy coming to the houses. That is what determines how A or B gets a house.  This is probably not clearly understood but it must be understood as being the actual position. I wish to emphasise that I have told housing authorities time and again, and I wish to repeat it now, that we in the Department do not prevent the rehousing of subtenants who are overcrowded. The rehousing of subtenants at the moment qualifies for the higher rate of subsidy if, (a) the tenancy was created in a rural area before 1st July, 1964, and in an urban area before 31st January, 1952; or, (b) the family concerned qualify on compassionate grounds and are unable to pay more than the minimum or the near minimum differential rent.  Compassionate grounds or inability to pay the lowest or near lowest differential rent&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make clear what Deputy Cluskey said.  There has been a problem that subtenants have not got the same opportunity for re-housing as others even though they live in overcrowded conditions.  An immediate review of that situation would be of tremendous assistance to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will appreciate that a very high percentage of subtenants are living in small box rooms.  Hundreds of them have gone to live in houses already overcrowded by other members of their families. They are worse off than people living in single rooms.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have said, the review has been going on for a considerable time and I hope &mdash; I do not express more than a hope &mdash; that we shall find adequate grounds for applying the higher subsidy to people who heretofore did not qualify.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is very necessary but if it never arose, I think the review would still have been necessary.  Deputy Clinton and others raised the question of rehousing persons from caravans.  The rehousing of persons who have been living in caravans qualifies for the higher subsidy in any cases where there are compassionate grounds and when the families are <Col N="1137" /> unable to pay more than the minimum or the near minimum rent fixed under a differential rents scheme.  If the higher subsidy were to be conceded automatically for families rehoused from caravans there would be a danger &mdash; I do not think it is putting it very strongly to say there would be a danger &mdash; that caravans would be used to jump the queue for houses&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I fear that Deputies from that side would scarcely settle for that.  The differential subsidy is not nonsense as the Deputy has suggested. It has been a very big force and I hope it will become an even more potent force in the future in the carrying out of the policy enunciated and applied by all Parties at various stages for the demolition and the eradication of all unfit houses.  The upper subsidy is the incentive to get rid of unfit houses: the lower subsidy is the normal subsidy and the higher one is the extraordinary one.  Therefore, the differential cannot be said to be all nonsense.  I agree that when all the unfit houses have disappeared we can come to the idea of a uniform subsidy which, in such circumstances, would appeal to me very much.  It would be far simpler to operate and easier to administer.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann condemns the manner in which the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries last January misled the farmers about future prospects for cattle and sheep and calls on the Government to take urgent steps to protect those engaged in the livestock industry from the immediate disaster that faces them as a result of the serious drop in cattle and sheep prices which has occurred at the same time as the farmers are being asked to pay increased rates and find their credit restricted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion standing in my name and that of other Fine Gael Deputies is tabled for the same reason as the <Col N="1139" /> farmers all over Ireland, even from the most distant parts of West Cork, have started marching to Dublin, to emphasise their extraordinary difficulties and to protest in the strongest possible way at the Government's failure to realise these difficulties and to recognise the hopeless state of farm incomes in the present year.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture fails completely to appreciate that many farmers are facing disaster because of the complete collapse of cattle and sheep prices.  This collapse has hit all farmers but, of course, the smaller farmer is feeling it by far the worst, and small farmers are to be found all over Ireland.  The West and South-West perhaps have been worst hit because the traditional income of the farmers there depended on the rearing of young cattle until they were one or two years old, when they were sold, and also on the rearing of sheep on the hill and mountain areas.</P>
    <P>We all know, unfortunately, what has happened.  I am familiar with the position in this part of the country.  I have spent many hours in cattle marts looking at the prices being offered and the prices, in many cases, having to be accepted because people must sell.  I have gone to the West of Ireland, too, to investigate the position there on the spot and I have been appalled at the prices people have had to take.  It is well known that cattle prices have dropped anything from £10 to £20 per head since this time last year.  I have seen calves that this time last year would be selling at £15 and £20 a head selling freely at cattle marts at £5 each.  That is a very serious situation. It is a serious situation for the dairy man because it represents a reduction of 6d per gallon in his milk, but more serious still for the small farmer of the West of Ireland or whatever he may be.</P>
    <P>Let me give an example of the extreme hardship that exists.  I came across one case in the West of Ireland where both a man and his wife were out trying to sell 10 young store cattle.  They were Aberdeen Angus <Col N="1140" /> Shorthorn cross from one and a half to two years old, and the woman said: &ldquo;We have got to sell today whatever happens.  This is the third time we have had them out and this is the worst price we have yet been offered but we have got to sell,&rdquo; and she added: &ldquo;Our children are going back to school.&rdquo;  I did not catch the point immediately.  I said: &ldquo;I suppose you have a large family.&rdquo;  I discovered there were nine in family, that the two eldest were at secondary school and the third at vocational school.  It was quite obvious in that case that the most pressing need was clothes for the children, and school fees, and of course, the rates are coming due.  Her pride and decency would not allow her to say any more.  These are, in my opinion, sturdy and decent people. They do not mind hard work, even hardship, if their reward enables them to rear their family and give them a reasonable education, but they are being denied that at present.</P>
    <P>It has been shown conclusively that there are many people who are trying to get a living from the land today earning as little as £5 per week. As long as these conditions exist the Minister has an obligation to take all the necessary steps to overcome them. I do not believe these steps have yet been taken.  We are only playing at the problem and little or nothing has been done so far for these small farmers. We have a few trials in the West of Ireland on a pilot farm scale, but it does not spell relief for the majority of those people.  I do not think they are going to continue to accept the position. They have seen that the way to get the position improved is by kicking up a row and that the people who make most noise get most.</P>
    <P>This motion draws attention to the manner in which the Minister misled the farming community last January in relation to future prices and prospects for cattle and sheep.  Not only did the Minister make those statements in January but he repeated them in May.  It is very difficult to understand, with the information that should be at the Minister's disposal, why he himself appeared to be so misled, <Col N="1141" /> if he was not making political capital out of the situation at the time. It was reasonable to expect that these difficulties would arise, and the Government Party largely precipitated the crisis we have today.  Cattle numbers were artificially increased through the heavy subsidy.  We know the response there was to that subsidy, that it brought results and that these results were proudly boasted of on many occasions by the Minister and the members of the Government Party.</P>
    <P>It is something to be proud of to be able to increase cattle numbers as they have been increased, but there was no preparation made to dispose of these extra cattle.  There was no effort made to set up a proper marketing organisation.  We on this side of the House and the farming organisations outside the House have been badgering the Minister and the Department on the necessity for setting up a meat marketing organisation and for setting up a proper promotional board for the selling of live cattle wherever we can sell them, let it be in England; let it be on the Continent.</P>
    <P>At the present time, there are rumours abroad.  Yesterday, the Minister was apparently in a very happy mood.  I hope he has something worthwhile to tell the House this evening. We all will be glad to hear that outlets have been found.  If outlets have been found now, it is fair to ask why it was necessary to wait so long to make this effort and why were so many poor farmers throughout the country compelled to sell their young cattle at give-away prices awaiting this effort.</P>
    <P>There is a rumour abroad that we now have an outlet for approximately 2,000 cattle in East Germany which are to be slaughtered in West Germany. If the Minister has an announcement of that kind to make I should like that he would announce the price and, perhaps, the subsidy that will be provided by the Irish Government to enable the sale of these cattle to take place.</P>
    <P>This morning's paper carries a news item to the effect that we are selling 10,000 cattle to Egypt and that some of the cattle have been shipped already. <Col N="1142" /> Everybody will be anxious to hear how much money this sale has put or will put into the pockets of the small producer. Are dealing men to go into the markets in the West of Ireland and elsewhere and buy this limited number of cattle that perhaps we have an outlet for at the lowest price at which they can get them?  Will there be nobody competing against them at realistic prices?  What is the element of profit for the exporter?  Is all this money finding its way into the pockets of exporters and dealers?  How much of it is going back to the farmer?  My opinion and the opinion of many other persons is that the headage subsidy that is already being paid is not finding its way back to the farmer.  I have asked the Minister to try to find a way in which it will find its way back to the farmer.  The Minister gave the impression that he was anxious to do that but so far there has been no indication that a scheme is to be brought into operation.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the blue card system that is in operation in respect of cattle and the arrangement whereby every beast is ear-tagged, it is difficult to understand why the headage subsidy for fat cattle could not be paid from person to person when a blue card was surrendered until, eventually, it was returned at the port.  It would seem not to be beyond the ability and wisdom of the Department of Agriculture to devise a scheme whereby the subsidy would go back direct to the farmer.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to see how the small farmer who is not producing fat cattle is to be looked after.  Unless there is some competition in the market in which the small farmer has to sell his cattle, or unless the Minister can take over all the Land Commission land that is available and stock that land and all the institutional farms available to the Department with that cattle, thus creating opposition to the dealers and exporters, this scheme will spell no relief for the small farmers in the West of Ireland.</P>
    <P>In my view, the position will deteriorate now that we are coming to the end of the grass season.  Cattle fed on <Col N="1143" /> the 11 months system will be pouring on to the market and unless sizable outlets are found immediately, there will be chaos and many farmers will go down and will not come up for a long time.</P>
    <P>The important thing here is to pinpoint, not so much how the crisis has arisen, but how relief is to be provided. It is not easy to remedy matters when a crisis has developed.  There are certain things that can be done.  It is imperative that the headage subsidy paid at present should be continued until next March, perhaps to the end of next March, or that a guaranteed price for fat cattle during the spring months should be named now, in advance.  In addition, the banks, the Agricultural Credit Corporation and the rate collectors should be called on and credit should be made freely available from whatever source it can be provided to enable farmers to keep their cattle or to enable the unfortunate persons who have lost heavily on their stocks and who have had to sell to get into cattle again.</P>
    <P>The important thing is to recognise that there is a real crisis.  I feel that that fact has not yet borne itself in on the Minister.  It is fantastic that as late as last May the Minister, when outlining the benefits that would accrue from the Trade Agreement, should have stated at Volume 222, column 1503, of the Official Report, that there was provided:</P>
    <P>...a solid foundation on which the profitable expansion of cattle and sheep production can be based, and livestock producers can expand output in the confident knowledge that adequate export outlets and satisfactory market prices will be available.</P>
    <P>In the next column, he said:</P>
    <P>...the international outlook for beef points to an assured outlet for all the cattle we can produce.</P>
    <P>An assured outlet is not of very much use to any country unless the prices are economic.  Unfortunately, we have neither a secure outlet not a sound foundation.  The serious aspect of this is that the farmers have found that <Col N="1144" /> immediately they increase production of any commodity the price decreases and they are back in slump conditions. It would take a tremendous effort to restore confidence as far as the farmers are concerned so that they would continue to produce cattle in the numbers we all feel desirable if farming is to be. as profitable as we would like it to be. If they are to be convinced that it is a good thing for them to produce cattle there will have to be some guarantee that this type of thing will not recur and that the Minister will not let them down when anything goes wrong.</P>
    <P>The attitude of the Minister is that he refuses to meet the representatives of the people who are in difficulty. He refuses to allow their point of view to be put before the people on Telefís Éireann.  I do not think that such an attitude will help in the solution of our problem.  In the unfortunate circumstances in which the farmers now find themselves the least that they expect from the Minister who represents them is that he would meet them and discuss the difficulties.  I think he should apologise for his own failure and should accept from the farmers any recommendations they may have to make as to the best possible ways and means of overcoming the difficulty and restoring confidence.</P>
    <P>There are many ways of dealing with this problem.  None of them is easy. The important thing to remember is that it is the weakest of our farming people who are worst hit here.  The Minister's efforts should be directed towards finding a way of getting anything in the nature of subsidies or assistance channelled back down to that unfortunate farmer whose circumstances compel him to sell.  The bills of the grocer, the rate collector and all the other bills due by someone rearing a family are waiting.  He must sell, whatever the price.  Undoubtedly the feeder will suffer heavy losses in the present year.  But he will recover. If he loses this year, he will restock at giveaway prices.  Usually his credit position is better than that of the small farmer.</P>
    <P>The Minister gave an assurance here at Question Time yesterday that he would see that any small farmer needing credit would get it from the Agricultural  <Col N="1145" /> Credit Corporation and that that would cover 95 per cent of the farmers.  I hope he is right in that. I hope the credit will come as fast as it should come in order to save these people.  No words of mine or of any other Deputy could over-emphasise the difficulties the farmers are going through at present.</P>

      <P>I accept gladly an obligation to explain my policies and my actions to the Deputies of this House, to listen to their censure if they feel like censuring me and to accept suggestions which they may seek to put forward.  But whereas I will consult with others and listen to suggestions from other quarters also, I will never regard myself as being answerable for my policies to persons outside this House.  I think it would be as well if everybody concerned were quite clear on that particular issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to get a proper understanding <Col N="1146" /> of the present situation in the livestock industry, it is necessary for us to go back a little to have a look at the prices which obtained in recent years.  In 1963, the average price obtaining for fat cattle in the Dublin Market was 122/3d. per cwt.  In 1964, it climbed to an average of 148/9d. per cwt. and in 1965 rose again to 158/-per cwt.  This satisfactory trend of rising cattle prices continued into 1966. The store trade generally followed the same pattern.  The market for cattle and beef was strong all over Europe, prices were good and the outlook was generally regarded as satisfactory.</P>
    <P>This situation changed in June of this year.  The first thing for us to do is to examine how this change came about.  One of the first factors to which we must have regard is the very late and severe spring we encountered this season.  Fodder was scarce.  Farmers who would normally have fattened their cattle much earlier were not able to do so and were forced to hold them over for a much longer period than they would normally do at this particular time of the year.  This was followed by the seamen's strike which caused very serious disruption of the normal pattern of the livestock trade, particularly the store trade.  In the export markets, two particular problems developed.  The first was the restriction of credit which was imposed in Great Britain.  I do not have to remind Deputies that the British feeder is by far our most important customer.  The credit restrictions imposed in Great Britain affected very severely the ability of the British feeder to purchase our stock.  On top of this situation, we had an aggravation of the supply position on the British market.  Because of increased home slaughterings and a number of other factors, the British beef market became fairly heavily over-supplied.</P>
    <P>But from our point of view probably the most serious factor of all was developments in the EEC countries. Protection in these EEC countries against imports of agricultural produce from outside third countries has been steadily increased in recent years.  As Deputies know, there is now in force <Col N="1147" /> in the EEC a Common Agricultural Policy.  In regard to livestock, the principal factor of that Common Agricultural Policy is the mechanism of protection against third countries.  Each country fixes a guide price for beef and, according as the internal market price fluctuates in relation to that guide price, restrictions on imports from third countries are imposed.  When the internal price falls to within 105 per cent of the guide price, a half levy comes on; when it falls to 100 per cent of the guide price, a full levy comes on.</P>
    <P>In these countries, of course, the guide price has been consistently increased in recent years.  For example, in Germany in 1964-65 the guide price was 203/- per cwt.; in 1965-66, it increased to 218/- per cwt.; and in 1966-67, it is 229/- per cwt.  This increasing guide price has meant that a crippling protective barrier has been imposed against our exports of beef and live cattle to EEC countries.  To give Deputies an idea of the size of this problem, I shall just mention that, when there are a full levy and tariffs in force in Germany, these are equivalent to about £35 per head on the average fat animal.</P>
    <P>In 1965, we exported 160,000 head of cattle to the EEC countries.  This was a very valuable export from our point of view because, by and large, these 160,000 head of cattle were a sort of cattle not particularly suitable for, or in demand in, the United Kingdom market.  The export of these cattle and their absorption into the EEC markets was very valuable and important from our point of view.</P>
    <P>The coming into force of the higher common agricultural policy prices in April of this year dealt this valuable and important trade of ours a very severe blow indeed and, as I say, probably more than any of the other factors I have mentioned was instrumental in contributing to the very severe weakening of cattle prices which took place here from June onwards. I think it important that I should say a word about this situation in regard to EEC.  If anything, of course, it <Col N="1148" /> underlines again the correctness of the decision of the Government to seek full membership of the EEC as soon as we possibly can because this development has shown how unfavourably the working out of the Common Agricultural Policy, as against third countries, can be in our particular circumstances.  I think this will be a real problem of the future and it is something that the authorities in the EEC should take note of.  We are old, valuable and traditional suppliers to many of these EEC countries and we are good customers of theirs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest it is a very serious matter indeed suddenly to bring about a situation where this valuable export trade of ours, amounting to about £12½ million in a year, being the equivalent of about 45 per cent of our total exports to EEC, is suddenly brought to a halt.  I think that the authorities of the EEC should consider whether, in the long run, the harmonious development of European trade and commerce can properly be served if this sort of situation is allowed to continue.  Having said that, I want to assure the House that, from our point of view, there is one redeeming feature in the situation.</P>
      <P>For some time, we have been pressing the German Government and the Commission in Brussels to afford us facilities for the export to Germany of a certain number of our cattle in what is commonly known as the &ldquo;off the grass&rdquo; season.  I am glad to say that we have been met with a great deal of sympathy and understanding by the German Government and by the Commission in Brussels.  It has now been agreed with the German Government to afford us facilities during the coming weeks for the export to Germany of 2,000 head of our cattle, either in the form of live cattle or beef.</P>

      <P>To have a look at the general picture, the Second Programme recognises the important contribution which the livestock industry has to make to the general overall economic development programme and has set a target of an output of 1½ million head of cattle by 1970.  The main instrument which the Government decided upon to achieve this expansion in our cattle numbers &mdash; I am glad Deputy Clinton now admits it was effective &mdash; was, of course, the heifer scheme.  We are well on our way towards the achievement of that particular target of an output of 1½ million cattle by 1970.</P>
      <P>I reject entirely the criticism which has been made that we planned for an increase in the output of livestock and livestock products, without making any provision whatever for the marketing of these products.  We had many motives in entering into the Free Trade Area Agreement with the United Kingdom, but no motive was more compelling in encouraging us to enter into those discussions and to finalise that Agreement than this question of disposing of our agricultural surplus generally and, in particular, our livestock products and our dairy products.</P>

      <Col N="1151" /> Our first consideration in the negotiations was to secure access for our livestock production to the United Kingdom market and we did succeed in those negotiations in securing completely free and unrestricted access for our livestock and livestock products to that market.  That was the first essential step.  Side by side with that, we incorporated into the Agreement various arrangements, price support and otherwise, designed to ensure that the exports of livestock and livestock products to the United Kingdom market would be stabilised to the greatest possible extent.  It is absurd now for anyone to suggest that we were not aware of, and were not making provision for, the increased livestock output envisaged in the Second Programme for Economic Expansion.</P>
    <P>The main purpose of the Free Trade Area Agreement with Britain was to secure outlets for that increased production. At that time, and for long before it, when nobody in the Opposition and nobody in any of the farmers' organisations thought about the matter, established an export study group to go into the entire store cattle trade of this country to see in what way this store trade could be developed and how it should be promoted.  At the same time, we embarked on a promotional campaign in the United Kingdom designed to draw the attention of the British feeder to the benefits he could secure from Irish stores.</P>

I admit that in May of this year I had no indication at all that this situation would develop, and neither had anybody else.  Neither had anybody in the Fine Gael Party.

I say I did.  At the earliest possible moment, I introduced the headage payment subsidy on the exports of fat cattle to the United Kingdom.  The introduction of that subsidy undoubtedly had the effect of stabilising the market and there is no doubt whatever that the trade would be much weaker indeed at this point of time, and over the past month, had it not been for the prompt introduction of that headage payment subsidy.  At the same time, we spared no effort to explore markets wherever we could find them.  We have, as I <Col N="1153" /> said, successfully found an outlet for 2,000 head in the German market.</P>

I am aware that young cattle are difficult to sell and that that is causing farmers a fair amount of concern.  I want to repeat what I said yesterday at Question Time: in response to an invitation by me, the Agricultural Credit Corporation have introduced a new scheme whereby any farmer who is either unable or unwilling to sell his stock at the prices now prevailing, and who wishes to hold them over, can go to the Agricultural Credit Corporation and, by a mere formality, by simply signing a promissory note, can get a loan of £500 at the normal rate of interest, a loan which will not be repayable until July next, by which time he should have had an opportunity of disposing of his cattle.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make this single point now: 1964 was a good year for our farmers. Farm income increased by approximately £22 million.  Opposition Parties and certain vociferous farming organisations <Col N="1154" /> at that time were quite adamant that neither I nor the Government must claim any credit for that increase in farming income because, they alleged, it was brought about by an increase in cattle prices which, they said, was largely outside our control and for which we could claim no credit whatever.</P>

      <P>Cattle prices are indeed very important.  They are probably the one single factor that impinges most on the minds of our farmers.  It is only natural that that should be so.  But that is not the whole story.  We are faced with a situation in which we have to export a very high percentage of our total production and, whereas we will at all times endeavour to insulate the producer to the greatest possible extent against the fluctuations of that market, there is no doubt that in the long run we will have to seek other ways of increasing the farmers' income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that this also is being tackled energetically by the Government. We will leave no possibility unexplored for helping the livestock producer to enable him to increase his income.  We have a massive campaign for the eradication of disease which, when successfully concluded, will have a very beneficial effect on his income. We are trying, through our breeding policy, to improve the quality of his cattle.  Anything that can be done by the introduction of progressive policies <Col N="1155" /> will be done to help the livestock producer and increase his production and his output and efficiency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I wanted to clarify that point.  As a Member of this House who has a good deal of respect for the Minister, and indeed he could count me among his wellwishers, I should say that if votes of sympathy were allowed in the House, I would have no hesitation in proposing such a vote here and now.  I think the Minister deserves the sympathy of everybody. Yesterday the newspapers told us that here was the Minister for Agriculture with his coat off and his sleeves tucked up, contesting a very important race and, according to the newspapers, doing very well at the distance.  This morning the national newspapers headlined the Minister's pronouncement that in this House tonight we were to hear from him an announcement of major importance to the farming industry. All four of our newspapers made that quite clear and every farmer and every agriculturalist, and particularly those with cattle to sell, were waiting impatiently to hear this important announcement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have great sympathy with the Minister. This announcement has produced nothing.  I rather wonder if there is not <Col N="1156" /> something wrong with the Minister.  All of us may not be feeling our best at times and here is what he tells us, that he had got a concession from the German Government to sell them 2,000 cattle.  Everybody in this House knows that 2,000 cattle is an insignificant number so far as the total number of cattle for sale is concerned.</P>
    <P>What did the Minister say?  He said that it was an important, significant and useful concession in the conditions that obtain.  Later on he said that it was one of far-reaching importance.  That, to my mind, was the sum total of the Minister's pronouncement so far as the sale of our cattle is concerned.  I think I am right in saying that the Minister is now in the position, having made that empty statement, which was heralded so much yesterday and this morning, that he deserves the sympathy of us all.  Seeing that he has spoken for half an hour and said nothing of any importance, it is as well to forget the remainder of his statement for the present.  It is strange that on 12th October the Dáil should be discussing a motion such as that put down by the Fine Gael Deputies condemning the Minister for the misleading statements he made last January and which, unfortunately, had great repercussions on our cattle trade in recent months and caused serious losses to many farmers within the past two months.  In January of this year Deputies were rushed from their homes before the Christmas period was over and we were brought in on 4th January &mdash; something which had never happened since the establishment of this House &mdash; to discuss an agreement which the Taoiseach and the Government told us would have far-reaching advantages for the agricultural community. We were asked to discuss this matter on little Christmas Day.  In fact, it was the first time that this House was in session on a Church holiday and indeed, to some extent, in order to discuss this motion which was so beneficial, we went to the limit of conflicting with the laws of the Church.</P>
    <P>At this stage I do not want to repeat statements made by the Minister for Agriculture outlining the advantages of this trade agreement to the agricultural community.  I will, however, <Col N="1157" /> summarise one statement which the Minister made which was that in his opinion the agreement would benefit the agricultural community to the extent of £10 million per annum.  That was the figure mentioned in the Minister's speech on the 5th January.  At the outset, £10 million was going to be the initial advantage.  Not only did he make that statement but in other incidental statements he implied that so far as sheep, bacon and other agricultural products were concerned, there would also be a benefit.  We on these benches at that time felt that the Minister had not substantiated his statements and that they were grossly exaggerated. Having heard the Minister, and having heard the views expressed by different Party speakers, we felt that this Agreement was one to which we could not put our names and thus we decided to vote against the Agreement.  The views which we expressed at that time were deemed to be pessimistic and we were told by other Members that we were painting a very gloomy picture.  Unfortunately, however &mdash; and nobody regrets this more than the Members on these benches &mdash; our prophecies and views have now proved correct.</P>
    <P>We have reached the stage now, on 12th October, within three months of this Agreement coming into operation, at which cattle prices, as has been pointed out by the previous speaker, are depressed to the extent of at least £15 per head, on average.  Everybody knows what £15 per head means to the farmers, whether they are big farmers, or small farmers.  Some of us, going back to the Anglo-Irish Trade Agreement debate, felt at that time that the Minister's statement on the advantages that would accrue to the agricultural community was made without taking into account possible market fluctuations.</P>
    <P>We are all old and wise enough to know that cattle prices at our fairs and markets are, to a great extent, determined by prices in outside markets.  No member of the Government, and no Member on the other benches, for one reason or another, foresaw that a contraction in our prices in foreign markets, and particularly the <Col N="1158" /> British market, would take place.  Now, unfortunately, export prices have contracted in our main market.  We now find that the Minister for Agriculture is driving around the world, as far as Egypt, I understand, trying to get markets for our cattle.  His latest venture was to Germany who agreed to take the miserable amount of 2,000 head of cattle, without any tariff restrictions.</P>
    <P>We were told in the debate last January that we could expect a guaranteed market in Britain for 635,000 head of cattle.  It should have been known at that time, despite how great our cattle increases were likely to be, that we were unlikely to achieve that figure this year.  We did not achieve it last year, either.  It is no wonder then, having regard to those statements, and having regard to the impressions which have been created, that at the time we are discussing this motion, many of my neighbours and friends in West Cork are travelling up to Dublin.  They are marching to indicate their serious plight to the Minister, the Government and the country at large.  They will be joined by marchers from every county in the west of Ireland from Kerry to Donegal. Surely those people are not walking up &mdash; some of them more than 200 miles &mdash; for fun?  They are walking up here to indicate to the country at large the fact that their annual income has been depressed very much during the current year.</P>
    <P>I entirely agree they are fully justified in holding that view.  This is the year in which people have got increases in their salaries.  The ordinary wage earners, the white collar workers, the executives and so on, have got large increases over the past 18 months or so.  Some of those people have got four-figure increases.  During that same period, the farming community have suffered a big reduction in their incomes. Take the position of a small farmer who has ten head of cattle to sell during the current six or seven months.  The price he receives for those cattle means that his income has declined by about £150, or almost £3 per week.  He is not likely to get more than £15 or £16 per head.  Surely that <Col N="1159" /> man has a grievance and surely he is right in complaining to the Minister and the Government who lauded this Trade Agreement some nine months ago.  They said at that time that a golden age for the farming community was around the corner.</P>
    <P>The position, as I have stated, is very critical for the farming community and very critical for the economy because, whilst the numbers of our cattle have increased, I believe, despite the increase in numbers, that the actual value of the cattle has not increased.  I believe this is borne out by the latest statistics given to us by the Minister. A couple of weeks ago, in answer to a Parliamentary Question, he told us that the figures for the two months, July and August, were less than for July and August, 1965, despite his boast that cattle prices would increase very greatly indeed.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in his statement this afternoon, made certain apologies.  He said you cannot see into the future.  I appreciate that.  He more or less asked the people to forgive him in regard to the statements he made here last January, because it was impossible to foresee that prices would fall in our export market and that it was impossible to foresee that the EEC countries would give us no concessions to sell our cattle in their countries.  All this should have been in the mind of a responsible Minister for Agriculture. It should also have been in the mind of the Government when they were making those statements last January. At that time they should have taken into account that there was a likelihood &mdash; they should have looked on the gloomy side as well as on the optimistic side &mdash; that those promises could not be fulfilled if our export markets declined.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister has a difficult task and I know the Government and the Minister are as anxious as anybody that cattle prices should be as high as possible in the export market. I agree that this reduction in price is not attributable to any move the Minister made to have cattle prices depressed.  I am not trying to have any cheap slap at the Minister.  I <Col N="1160" /> know he is not responsible for the prices obtaining for cattle in other countries and I know that our exporters of live cattle try to get the best price possible, being businessmen of long standing.</P>
    <P>The newspapers today said the Minister intended setting up a marketing board and that this was a very good thing.  I hope this will help to sell our carcase meat at a more profitable price than we are obtaining at the present time.  There is one thing I want to say to the Minister in regard to this board.  I do not intend delaying the House in referring to it but I would like to say that when the Minister is appointing the personnel of that board, for heaven's sake, let him not think whether they are good Party supporters or not.  They could be good Party supporters but they might have no knowledge whatsoever in regard to the position they might hold on the board.</P>
    <P>I have tried to be as reasonable as I possibly could in assessing our present market position.  I said I removed the blame, as far as I reasonably could, from the Minister that his prophecies are not being justified.  At the same time, I want to make it quite clear that I cannot remove blame from the people who made statements in this House last January that they were competence to hold the important offices they hold in this State.  They were incompetent to do so and that incompetence has now been proved by the fact that all their promises have now gone by the board.  We have a similar position obtaining so far as the sheep market is concerned.  The numbers of our sheep, we are told, have increased very much and we have now a sheep population in this country of some five million.  Naturally with that number of sheep, there are bound to be big sales throughout the country.  Many sheep owners, particularly mountain sheep owners, are in a position similar to that of the cattle owners.  They are complaining that so far as sheep prices are concerned, they too have been misled.  I agree that sheep prices during the past few months have been well below normal.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1161" /> I had hopes that when the Minister got in to speak in this debate after Deputy Clinton he would have made a statement, having regard to the nature of the advance notice we got, and that I would be able to stand up as the next speaker and offer him my congratulations on having achieved some outstanding increases for the farming community.  I regret it is not possible for me to do so.  So far as Deputies sitting on these benches are concerned and so far as this Party are concerned, we do not want to make cheap politics out of the agricultural crisis.  We do not want to get cheap votes for anything the Government may do by way of achieving better prices.  We have a duty and an obligation to voice our criticism of the policies that have been implemented which brought about such a position during the past year.</P>
    <P>We have at the moment an uproar in the country.  I happened to pass through Bantry fair, last Friday evening, the day the West Cork marchers left the county.  What was the position there?  The Minister knows the answer quite well.  He was down there before the election and he got a great reception.  He gave great assurances and got a great welcome.  I should like to welcome the Minister to West Cork but the welcome in future will not be quite the same as it has been.</P>
    <P>That is typical of fairs and marts throughout the country.  To give an instance, a small farmer with four cattle at that fair expected a minimum price of £33 per head for the four cattle.  He was conversant with market fluctuations, or thought he was, but new prices were prevailing and he had to sell at a price of £25 per head, or a grand total of £32 less than his minimum expectations for the four cattle.  This is the type of thing you will find in fairs and in marts all over the country.  That is why we have this uproar about cattle prices.  This has nothing to do with personalities.  The poor consumer is gaining nothing.  He still has to pay the same price for his beef as he did last year.  I think it will be no harm for the Minister for Agriculture to have a word with his colleague on that score because he might <Col N="1162" /> get sympathy from the consuming public if that were to happen.</P>
    <P>I am grateful for the assistance you have given me, Sir, and happy that I have not aroused your wrath, because I would dislike to do so.  I would like to conclude by offering the Minister a little advice.  There are farming Deputies in this House and I think the Minister should consult with them about the present crisis.  He should also meet the farming organisations and hear their views.  They have a grievance and there is no use at the present time in the Minister getting on his high horse and ignoring these people.</P>
    <P>I note from previous experience that the Minister will avail of audiences, more often than not outside this House, to make statements and I would ask him to meet these weary farmers when they arrive.  Some of them have travelled 200 miles and others from 100 miles to 180 miles.  It will be appreciated that they are not, as I have said, walking that long distance for fun; they are doing it to focus attention on their plight and it is the Minister's responsibility to meet them and discuss their problem.  I hope that when the Minister meets them and discusses their problem he will be able to hammer out an amicable agreement that will be satisfactory to the Department and to these people.  It may cost money to do that.  Mind you, the Minister may get away from the House, due to the procedure obtaining here, with the statement he made today but he must have a little more to tell the House.  The Minister should meet representatives of the farming organisations because in all justice and in all fair play, his case today was very poor. I had sympathy for the Minister.  No matter what may be said, we know that Ministers in the Government, as they have a right to do and as all ambitious men have a right to do, are contesting a very difficult situation at the present time.  I for one have a certain feeling that one from the Front Bench will win&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The factors which have led to the present unsatisfactory condition in the cattle trade, the virtual closing of the Common Market to imports of cattle and beef as a result of the heavier domestic supplies &mdash; and I am glad the Minister has made a statement today that he has broken through there, with 2,000 head in the next few weeks &mdash; heavier marketing of fat cattle in Britain, increased supplies of Argentine beef on the British market, the shipping strike which left us with a backlog of cattle to market at a time when the beef martua <Col N="1165" /> ket in Britain was beginning to weaken, the credit squeeze in Britain which has affected demand for our stores, were all outside the control of the Minister, and the suggestions which have been made that there was some ready-made mechanism by which we could sustain cattle prices are, quite obviously, nonsense.</P>

Shipments of fat cattle in the month of September, 1965, to Britain numbered 7,000.  In September, 1966, they were roughly 20,000.

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter of house purchase loans and supplementary grants has been raised here in many ways and many specific points have been raised.  To reply in a general way, I should say that the original provision of £6,500,000 for house purchase loans and supplementary grants this year was greater than the amount provided <Col N="1168" /> in any year to date and compares quite favourably with the provision of £4.6 million in 1963-64, when there was no talk whatsoever of any shortage of money.  This provision of £6,500,000 has been increased by £500,000, as a consequence of the Government's decision some few months ago to increase the overall capital for housing, sanitary services et cetera, which brings us to a figure of £7 million for the purposes of these loans and supplementary grants this year &mdash; a figure higher than any figure ever provided at any time in this country.</P>
      <P>We have the talk, which I think is foolish and will do no good to any aspect of our development, the flamboyant, irresponsible and exaggerated statements made, for instance, by Deputy Dillon, taken up and chorused by a number of his colleagues, to the effect that the country is bust and that we have no money for anything. These statements, of course, are known by the people who make them to be untrue and talking in this way is doing damage &mdash; if it is possible to do damage &mdash; to the country and the prospects of its economy in the immediate future.</P>

      <P>The situation in 1956 &mdash; as I thought I had made terribly clear, starkly clear, I might say, earlier in my reply &mdash; had very distinct similarities in regard to the difficulties confronting the Government today and the Government of that day.  But what is happening today and what happened then have no similarity whatsoever. As against the deplorably bad conditions which were then truly existing, when the money was not there, we have money this particular year and we are providing more money this particular year than in any other year in the history of any Government in so far as my Department's operations are concerned.  This money, as I have demonstrated, is not a figment of my imagination but has been proven to exist by the issues which have already taken place from the Local Loans Fund to various local authorities <Col N="1169" /> for all sorts of local government purposes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>What I was drawing attention to was the difference between the real situation today and the really deplorable situation in 1956 and 1957. It is true to say that not only are we providing more money but money is issuing, to disprove these Jonahs who are talking in these terms.  It is also true that, while there may be some delays in the payment of supplementary grants and loans, the stage has now been reached, as it appears to me, that in most areas the allocations of money we have made for these purposes should be nearly equal in all cases, and equal in many cases, to the actual needs, as estimated by local authorities. Overall the position is one which has every appearance of improvement in regard to any criticism there might have been of it in the past six or nine months.  By and large, we are going ahead, despite all the difficulties we have encountered.  While the progress is not entirely satisfactory to me or to the Government &mdash; not enough is being done speedily enough&mdash;nevertheless, everything being taken into consideration, it must be admitted by the most prejudiced Deputy in Opposition that the situation is far better than they themselves would like it to be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>A Deputy who makes that sort of interjection does not do so to elicit information but rather to hear the sound of his own voice because figures and facts have been given here until not only am I tired giving them but the House, indeed, must be tired listening to them, figures sufficient to convince even the most sceptical and prejudiced of Deputies, that the situation is much nearer to what I say it is <Col N="1170" /> than what Opposition Deputies say it is and what they would wish it to be.</P>
      <P>Deputies Clinton, Cluskey, Seán Dunne and Larkin talked about the position in relation to house purchase loans in the Dublin area.  Dublin Corporation propose to spend £622,000 on house purchase loans during the period 1st September, 1966, to 31st March next and this sum is in excess of the total amount involved in respect of applications on hands at 31st August, 1966.  I should add that the corporation may now proceed on the assumption that their allocation for 1967-68 will be of the order of £1 million.</P>
      <P>That being so, I fail to see how Dublin Corporation representatives who are Members of this House can find so much to cry about at the moment, and why they will not give any credit whatsoever for the fact that the allocation to Dublin Corporation for this purpose is in excess of £1 million this year.  We have assured them that next year they can expect an amount of the order of £1 million again.  Not only are we saying what we will do and what we are doing this year, but we have said that for next year &mdash; and this is important in the allocation of loans which are seldom drawn in the year in which they are allocated &mdash; it will be of the same order as it is this year.  At the moment the moneys they have in hand are more than equal to the applications on hands at the end of August.  That being so they are now in a position in which they never were before because they know what they can expect next year.  This should have quite an effect on the activities of Dublin Corporation in regard to the allocation of loans for the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Capital allocation to Dublin County Council for house purchase loans for 1966-67 was increased from £650,000 to £820,000.  This allocation compares with actual issues last year &mdash; and mark this &mdash; of £480,000.  That is what was issued last year under this heading by Dublin County Council, and we are giving them an allocation of £820,000 for their operations under this heading in the coming year.  Lest anyone choose to say that last year they did not get all they wanted, that it was a bad year <Col N="1171" /> for various reasons, let us go back to the year before when there was no shortage of money and we find that what they got was £250,000, and that was what they spent.  So, giving them full freedom of spending in 1964-65 they actually paid out £250,000.  Last year they paid out £480,000 and this year &mdash; this terrible year we are told about &mdash; they are allocated no less than £820,000.  If that does not give the lie to those who say we are &ldquo;bust&rdquo; and have no money, I do not know what could more clearly do so.</P>
    <P>At the end of August, 1966, Dublin Corporation had approved of all loan applications on hands with the exception of loans totalling £156,000 which were being processed and which will be approved during the next few weeks if the individual applications are found to be in order.  That is the normal situation when investigations have to take place as to the overall validity, and so forth, of the applications.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is adept with figures and can more readily sort that out than I can.  I cannot talk and make calculations at the same time.  While I am on my feet here I am supposed to be talking.  Allegations were made that there was no money for loans and grants in Monaghan, Louth, Meath, Galway.  These assertions were made by Deputy Dillon, Deputy Coogan, Deputy O'Hara and others.  Deputy Dillon said we had not got six pence, but Monaghan got £77,000 for housing loans.  Approximately £10,000 was for payments on foot of 35 applications in hands.  That is the latest information I have.  I have already covered the position of Louth county in reply to a Parliamentary question.  Louth County Council by and large are as near to being satisfied with regard to the loans situation as any of us is ever likely to be.  Louth County Council are satisfied that the allocation for loans is reasonably adequate. In Drogheda, estimated demands for loans and grants is £114,000, and the allocation is £140,000, which <Col N="1172" /> may make some Deputies begin to wonder where they will use it.  The Dundalk allocation is £29,000 and that is regarded as being reasonably adequate to meet the demands arising this year.  I should add that no instalments on foot of these loans are held up so far as I am aware.</P>
      <P>We come now to Galway Corporation about which we hear such a stream of accusations from Deputy Coogan. The backlog in Galway has largely been ment according to my information, but there is an over-rigid attitude to new applications.  I have already mentioned that this was so in a number of cases, and I say that in the case of Galway city they are being over-rigid. I should add that unless they move soon in accepting applications they will not need any money for payments next year.  I do not want this to happen in Galway city where housing is needed.  They should be reasonable and accept new applications which they are not doing.  If they do so they will require money to meet payments on foot of these new applications. Unless they accept these applications soon there will not be any payments falling due next year because there will not be any need for money. I deplore this in the case of Galway city rather than welcoming it as some Opposition Deputies might seem to think I would.</P>
      <P>There was a suggestion that no money has been issued in Carlow.  In fact, £10,000 has issued for supplementary grants and an undrawn balance of £5,000 is available.  In relation to Carlow again, £195,000 has been allocated for loans and grants plus a substantial credit balance at 31st May, 1966.  So far as we can judge from all our information the position in Carlow is reasonably satisfactory.</P>
      <P>In Mayo we find that £50.000 issued from the Local Loans Fund for supplementary grants on 30th August, 1966.  I believe the backlog is being cleared by the council and it may even be cleared by tonight.</P>

      <P>It may have got mislaid on the way but it would be a large amount not to be heard of again.  We were told there was no money for grants and loans in Laois.  The counties of Cavan, Cork, Offaly and South Tipperary were mentioned by Deputy Fitzpatrick, Deputy Desmond, Deputy Burton, Deputy Hogan and Deputy Treacy &mdash; I do not know in what order, but I have a fair idea which counties they would be referring to.  So far as I know, taking Cavan, the situation is that Cavan County Council are as near satisfied as you can make a county council in these times that the combined allocation of £105,000 is reasonably adequate for <Col N="1174" /> roads and grants this year, so far as payments are concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> The Minister may take it that loans are still suspended and since I spoke here last week, I have asked when loans will be resumed, and I have had no reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall certainly check on that, as I will on any information given me by any other Deputy but, so far as I know, the £105,000 allocated to the county council is regarded as reasonably satisfactory &mdash; I shall not say 100 per cent&mdash;so far as it is directed to the operation of loans and grants for payment this year.  I should add that £46,000 of this particular allocation has already been drawn this year.</P>
      <P>Cork County Council has already had issued from the Local Loans Fund this year £265,000 out of their gross £640,000 for house purchase loans.  All applicants have been informed that they will be paid this year if otherwise in order.  The question of supplementary grants in respect of West Cork was raised and at 31st August last year there were unpaid grants to the total of £11,000.  An instalment of £15,000 was issued in the previous month, on July 15th.  There is £18,000 left to meet further payments and the position, again subject to any information anybody may have, is, by and large, all right.  The North Cork area has had £7,000 issued by the council for supplementary grants in the past few weeks and there is an undrawn balance of £9,000 available.  Again, the overall position seems to be adequate.</P>
      <P>Offaly has an undrawn balance of £17,000 available.  They had no outstanding commitments on 31st August and only £20,000 of applications awaiting approval.  This I should imagine is a very satisfactory situation. Laois had an undrawn balance of £14,000 and this allocation for that county we understand is again reasonably satisfactory.  There is a capital allocation for South Tipperary of £14,000, together with a credit balance of £6,000, with which they came in at 31st March last, and there is need for a loan of only £4,000 which is being approved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>There may be other appropriate times before the night is out.  It has been alleged that the gap between the houses purchase loan and the cost of the house is big and that there is a struggle to get the deposit. This case has been made by a number of Deputies, including Deputy Fitzpatrick. I agree that there are very few people in the country today, or at any other time, who find it otherwise than a struggle to get the wherewithal to go ahead with building houses for themselves.  It has never been easy for people to build their own houses, to get the deposit or the means together to make a start and I cannot see that it will ever be that easy to get these things.  It takes an effort, and in some cases a very big one, to get the means and the courage with limited means to undertake the cost of building a house, no matter what loans or grants may be available.  People still have to dip into their own pockets, which is hard to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards closing that gap, I think <Col N="1176" /> the House will agree that we cannot go all the way.  We do not have the money to go all the way.  Even if it came down to a discussion and we had the money to give 100 per cent, the question would arise whether it was a good thing or not.  It is hard to get money for almost anything at any time but where money is too freely available, the result may be bad.  Many a man is wiser and poorer today because the source of his loan was too easy when he was raising the money.  That applies to many things other than housing.  A question arises, even if we had all the money necessary as to whether we should try to give to anybody who wanted to build a house the full 100 per cent cost of it, without having regard to the ability of that person ever to get into a position to pay for it without carrying an undue burden for the rest of his life.</P>
    <P>It follows that an effort must always be made.  It certainly must be made today and it has been made in the past, and it seems as if some effort will always be required from those who wish to build and own their houses ultimately.  The question is only as to the extent of the effort.  At present, while I believe the effort is great, those who are going ahead with building houses &mdash; and there are thousands &mdash; and those who are improving them &mdash; and they number many thousands &mdash; are finding it difficult to meet the gap between the loan and the total cost&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is something to which it would be difficult to give a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; answer, as there are so many factors to be taken into account: changes in income limits; changes in the actual limit on the amount of the total loan that various people under the SDA may receive; the change in the cost of building; the improvements in the standards demanded by those who wish to build their own houses.  All these must be taken into consideration before we begin to compare the situation of ten years ago with that of today.</P>
      <P>We should also remember that ten years ago the incomes of the people we are talking about, in terms of pounds per week, must also be taken into account &mdash; that every person earning £7, £10 or £15 per week ten years ago is now earning £5 or £6 more.  If actual deposits, for various causes, have grown in amount, incomes also have grown and the problem of facing a higher amount may not be as difficult for them today as it was ten years ago. There may be some improvement in this respect by comparison with ten years ago.  People who did not build, who were not willing to build their own houses ten years ago, have since done so, are doing so and will do so in the future.  The discussion here has been very interesting but the points made in this respect were not very conclusive.</P>

If he intends to go on my speech, I feel sure he will not mind my quoting some of his speech and some of the allegations he made in it. There was a suggestion that farmers with a valuation of £60 should qualify for an SDA loan.  Land valuations for loan purposes equate to an income limit of £1,200.  An average valuation of £50 roughly covers 90 per cent of all farmers in the country.  I shall look into this but I can say from my limited experience that I think a £50 valuation would cover 90 per cent of our farmers.  I believe we have gone as far as it is necessary to go in this matter, but if, on examination, I find it necessary to go further and that there is a fair and just reason for our going further, I may indicate that I shall do so.</P>

      <P>They could get the supplementary but not qualify for an SDA loan.  Again, the income limit for the SDA loan is £1,200.  A number of general matters have been raised on the question of housing, and the OECD Report has been trotted out. Deputies who have quoted this Report here have made the deduction that we have the worst housing record in Europe, and they reckon they have got this information from a very objective report.  What they fail to appreciate &mdash; and I thought we had pointed this out before &mdash; is that the comparison with other European countries is very much subject to reservations, and I should like to list those reservations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, there is the comparative slow growth of population.  Secondly, there is overcrowding on the basis of occupants per room, and what we should keep in mind is that, on average, our dwellings are larger than the dwellings in Europe.  Fourthly &mdash; and this is very important &mdash; the percentage of gross national product may be low but the gross national product itself per head of the population is also low, and our <Col N="1182" /> total percentage of GNP related to our input in regard to housing compares more than favourably with that of other countries that have been quoted very favourably in the OECD Report. Fifthly, internationally this country is ranked high in the subsidisation of rents from public funds.  I shall not go over all we have already said about that tonight and last night, but when dealing with any of these tables, no matter by whom they may be composed, it is not fair to relate our figures to those of other countries in Europe in regard to housing effort, without making them subject to the reservations I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>Deputy Treacy suggested that cheap money, money at low interest rates, would solve our housing problem.  The problems it would not solve nobody knows.  Naturally we can only agree with him.  If the local authorities want to subsidise their interest rates nobody is stopping them, but it is only fair to point out that subsidising interest rates hides the real cost of doing the job.  There is no such thing, in the long term or in the short term, as cheap money.  Somebody else is paying for it, and when it is public money we are all paying for it.  We are paying for its administration with the result that we are taking more from the taxpayer and from the ratepayer than would be paid if there were no such thing as subsidisation of this item at all.</P>
    <P>Another matter raised by Deputy Clinton is that local authorities were told in the circular of March, 1966, to sell sites.  I am not quite sure what Deputy Clinton was implying, whether it was that they were told to sell the sites when things got so bad that they had to raise money to pay their debts. When it came from that side of the House that is the only interpretation I could put on it.  However, let me say there was no such suggestion in the circular of March, 1966.  If there ever was a circular that mentioned the selling of sites by local authorities it would have referred to the development of land into sites for houses.  That is the only context in which it would have emanated from my Department.</P>

      <P>In regard to the provision of recreational facilities on new housing estates, this is a very desirable thing to do and we should like the local authorities to do everything possible in this direction.  According to Deputy Booth, Dún Laoghaire has had a population explosion, and this is borne out by the figures already available from the recent census.  He suggested that, as a result of this sudden explosion, the housing needs of Dún Laoghaire have been under-estimated By the Minister and his officials.  I cannot agree with this.  In my Department we do not estimate the needs of any local housing authority.  Since 1960 this is a matter which should be decided, and is being decided, by the housing authorities and not by the Minister and his officials.  Therefore, if an under-estimation has taken place since 1960, I must suggest to Deputy Booth that he raise the matter with the officials in the Dún Laoghaire Corporation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has also been suggested by Deputy Coughlan from Limerick that the Department should devise a scheme to re-house the Army and gardaí.  I scarcely need to remind the Deputy that the National Building Agency was set up and that the provision of houses for gardaí is one of its objectives, which objective it has been working on faithfully since its inception.  To date the NBA have provided 383 houses; 48 are in progress, and some further houses are at tender stage.  I should add that we do not provide these houses willy nilly.  We provide them at the requisition of the Department of Justice where they want them, when they want them, and how they want them.  We have no discretion whether <Col N="1184" /> we build more this year or less next year.  It is entirely up to the Department who requisitions the NBA to do the job.  There are 383 new Gárda houses provided by the NBA since its inception, 48 in progress and a further number at the tender stage.</P>
    <P>The question of the provision of houses for the Army has been raised by the Minister for Defence with my Department and with the NBA.  I am glad of that because this is another job which I believe the NBA can very usefully carry out and would be quite happy to carry out.  Again, the ordering of these houses will rest with the appropriate Department, Defence, and the NBA, if and when requested to do the job, will no doubt do it equally as well for the Army as they have for the Garda.  This will help the local authority housing situation in many towns.  Naturally, a number of Garda and Army personnel are living in houses that might otherwise be available for civilian personnel.  If houses can be provided through the Department of Justice and the Department of Defence by the NBA there will be an advantage gained in those towns where Army personnel and Gardaí are living in private or local authority houses.</P>
    <P>The matter of the wholesale tax was referred to.  Deputy Clinton stated roundly that this would mean an increase of 8.1 per cent in the price of houses.  In reply to that I should say that it will have some effect on the price of houses but it will not be 8.1 per cent as indicated by the Deputy, for the reason that most materials used in the construction of houses are exempt from wholesale tax, with the notable exception of timber, glass and some sanitary ware.  This 8.1 per cent that was quoted by Deputy Clinton was calculated before the exemptions were granted and would have been correct had we had this discussion before the exemptions came into force.  I should say that the 8.1 per cent referred to the expected increase in the price of materials only, and not to the cost of houses, which is quite a different thing. Therefore, the figure of 8.1 per cent is, fortunately, much higher than the actual figure will be and I am sure Deputy Clinton will be very glad to know that.</P>

      <P>I cannot help that.  A plea was made by Deputy Dowling for more attention to be paid to the tenants' views in the design of houses.  I can tell Deputy Dowling that An Foras Forbartha are already undertaking research on housing design standards and the standards are also under review by my Department.  Special studies are on hand with UCD and the contractors' federation for a sociological survey, including the study of tenants' views of design.  What comes out of this will be the really vital matter but, for Deputy Dowling's information, there is a great deal going on about it at the moment and we are hoping for some good results.</P>

      <P>I can only repeat <Col N="1186" /> that local authorities may acquire sites that are suitable, on their own initiative. Where unsuitable sites are proposed they are required to make a special case which is considered on its merits.  In other words, if they feel that the site in question is not up to what would be, in their estimation, generally regarded as reasonably good, they need not necessarily dump it at that stage.  They may feel that it would be difficult to get another site and, if they wish, they may make a special case for the acceptance and use of a site that in their estimation is not really up to standard but which for various reasons it would be desirable to use and when they do so in these odd cases each case is examined on its merits and a decision given accordingly.  I shall now deal with the question of roads and road traffic.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Roads and road traffic are matters of growing importance. Many Deputies referred to these matters and gave various details and various views.  The only overall statement that I should like to make at the outset in this regard is that I assure all the Deputies who made suggestions that they will be most carefully considered and, if there is anything in them, that we will try to utilise them. We are grateful for them even if we find many of them not to be acceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were Deputies who spoke for and against main and arterial road <Col N="1187" /> improvement schemes.  I do not think you could draw a line down the middle of the House and say that all on one side were for and all on the other side were against.  Various Deputies have various views on the matter.  We should look at the facts in regard to arterial and main road improvement schemes.  The standards that are being applied in improvements on these categories of roads are based on accepted engineering standards.  While we may disagree in regard to some aspects of the standards, on the whole, it is difficult to find a case that will effectively jettison the case that can be made and has been made by road engineering experts and traffic experts who have made a study of these matters and have great experience of them, not only in Ireland but abroad. Some, of them have widened their experience by visits abroad and have returned to help us with our problems.</P>
    <P>Although I have often heard the reverse being stated, it is a fact that improved roads have a lower accident rate in relation to traffic.  It is the latter part of that statement that needs to be driven home.  We must keep in mind the qualification, &ldquo;in relation to the traffic on them&rdquo;.  All too often I have heard people say that there are more accidents on a road since it was widened and straightened than there ever were before.  Unfortunately, as a result of the growth of traffic and the increase in the number of vehicles, it can be said of any road that there are more accidents on it now than there ever were before.  There are more vehicles on it.  Unfortunately, where there are vehicles, whether moving or stationary, there are accidents.  This is all too true.  I admit that if none of them was moving, there would not be any collisions but there still would be accidents.  It is true that improved roads do show a lower accident rate in relation to the traffic using them and this is a very important matter that must be weighed very carefully when talking about money being wasted by the raising of the standard of certain heavily trafficked roads.  My regret is that there are not more funds <Col N="1188" /> at my disposal to do more about a greater number of heavily trafficked roads more quickly than is possible at the moment.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies tried to pit roads against houses.  Although it may not be intended as such, this is a gimmick I do not like.  We could also say that road expenditure should be considered in the light of what we expend on health services.  We could make a case that if we spent £x more on our hospitals and health services, we could save more lives than by improving our roads.  These arguments are easy to make but difficult to answer; indeed, it is almost impossible to answer them conclusively one way or the other.  The pitting of one service against another does not serve either of the services.  Deputies who have done this even while making such arguments have unwittingly made good cases for greater expenditure on the roads than at present.  We might ask ourselves &mdash; Deputies quoted the OECD figures in regard to housing standards &mdash; how does our expenditure on roads compare with that of other countries? Indeed, the question has been asked by Deputy Hogan of Tipperary.  Per head of the population it is very low. Our investment in motor vehicles is high, but in roads it is low.  That is per head of the population in both cases.</P>
    <P>According to Deputy O.J. Flanagan, road-widening schemes are being held up for lack of money. There is a way of proving this but, so far as I am concerned, I must deny this allegation.  Approximately the same allocations as last year have been made overall.  Perhaps Deputy Flanagan would give me details of jobs that have been held up?  If they are exceptional cases, I shall try to have them investigated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>You are getting an allocation just the same.  If Deputy Flanagan feels that not enough money is being spent on roads, I am sure he will join with me in opposing those who say we should take money from roads to spend on houses.  It is no solution to say we should spend less on roads and more on housing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1190" /> Deputy Donegan alleged that the expenditure on arterial roads has been deliberately curtailed by the Minister. This year the overall grants for arterial roads are the same as last year, and in particular the Louth grant is on that basis.  Work on the T.1, to which I am sure the Deputy was referring, has been impeded by difficulties other than the allocation to that particular county.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested I should consider new arrangements for the administration of arterial roads.  This suggestion was made by both Deputy Andrews and Deputy Booth.  Deputy Clinton went further and advocated that we should nationalise them.  Before any of these suggestions was made, I had in fact set in train the various investigations necessary for a proper appraisal of this whole matter.  I have in particular asked my officials to find out whether or not the present system of administration of road moneys is equal to the task before us at the moment, with particular reference to our arterial road system.  It may well be that a new organisation may be set up in the not too distant future &mdash; it is still too early to know &mdash; to handle the improvement, repair and maintenance of at least arterial roads, and perhaps more.  All I can say is that I am fully alive to the problem. The Department are working on it and we have had fact-finding investigations for a considerable time to get all the necessary information to enable us to make a final assessment.  If we find &mdash; as I believe we probably will find &mdash; that changes are needed and a new type of organisation will have to be brought into being, I will bring it into being if it is shown to be justified.</P>
    <P>Now we can come to the question of speed limits.  Listening to people both inside and outside this House in recent years, one would think that I personally, as Minister for Local Government, was the final barrier in the way of the prevention of further slaughter on the roads because of not allowing speed limits suggested by well-meaning Deputies and others, and that I was against the whole idea of trying to make the roads more safe. This charge is made in spite of the fact that it was I who had the opportunity <Col N="1191" /> and pleasure of introducing the legislation which empowered me by regulation to fix speed limits in this country for the first time.  The achievement of my Department and local authorities in bringing in speed limits on so many roads as quickly as they did has not been paralleled by any other country in the Western Hemisphere in recent years.  The result was that we got speed limits quicker than we might have.</P>
    <P>As a result, we have since been reaping some of the disadvantages in that not all of them were placed to the satisfaction of the public as a whole. Many changes have been requested; many changes have been made; and many more will be made in the future as a result of the review now taking place over all our roads.  I would again plead that it will take time to carry out this review if we are to do it properly.  The team working on this are working for the past couple of years. It is not possible to send out a dozen different teams.  Even if we had 12 teams doing these reviews, we should probably finish up in the same way as if the first installation of the speed limit signs were left entirely, practically, to the local technical committees set up by me in the fond belief that because the people on them would be the county engineers and the garda authorities they, with their knowledge of all these towns and villages, would be far better able to find the right places, the right towns and the right streets on which we would apply our speed limits.</P>
    <P>I say I &ldquo;fondly hoped&rdquo; that this would be the result but, fondly though I hoped it would be the result, it was only, I think, the 1st April that they came into being.  The cowls were taken off.  We saw these signs for the first time legally in existence.  That was on 1st April and on 28th of the following July, without any pressure or pushing from Deputies or anybody else, but from my own personal observations deliberately made over a fairly wide area of the country between 1st April and July, I immediately ordered a review to be carried out by these technical committees.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1192" /> Subsequently, in order to get some sort of uniformity brought finally into this matter, I had a small committee set up in my Department consisting of an administrative man out of my Department, a technical man out of my Department and a representative of the Garda Síochána to go back and vet the amended proposals that I felt would come from the local committees. It was I and my Department who asked these technical committees, inside eight weeks of the coming into operation of our first speed limit signs, to review their own work because we, in our observations in that short time, were not satisfied it was properly done.</P>
    <P>The role of that small committee since then is one of continuing work arising from the amendments being proposed as a result of this second look by these committees.  I had Members of the House, members of county councils, members of the public, and so on, and this is going on and will continue to go on without break until we have speed limit signs on every road in every county reviewed.  In order to bring about a more speedy introduction of the actual application of the reviews agreed on, we will bring in counties and blocks of counties at a time rather than doing the neater job of doing the whole big job at the one time.</P>

    <P>I would point out that the removal of a sign or signs, one or both, on a road, unless authorised and contained <Col N="1193" /> in an amended order or regulation made by the Minister under the Road Traffic Act &mdash; unless it is changed in those circumstances &mdash; means not only that they have not got the speed limit sign out as far as they want to get it but that there would now be no speed limit whatever on any part of the road. Of course, this was not brought to their notice by the learned people who knew so much at the time the matter was investigated.</P>

I am still very interested in this matter of speed limits and their effect on reducing the toll on the roads, whether inside the towns or outside them.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Some Deputies thought the driving test too hard, while other Deputies seemed to think it should be brought up to a higher standard.  We will always find mixed feelings with regard to such matters because there is always something to be said for and against.  I think Deputy Booth put it very well when he said the object is not to put more drivers on the road but to put good drivers on the road.  It is against that background that we should examine the matter in relation to the severity, or otherwise, of tests.  It is true, generally speaking, that those who take these tests may, from the mechanical point of view, be quite capable of making a machine move and may have had a great deal of experience of mechanically operating a vehicle, but there is a vast difference between being mechanically capable of operating one of these machines and being able to drive properly on the road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is towards proper driving that we lean and it would be our hope, through the medium of these tests, to weed out those who will not take the time even to acquaint themselves fully <Col N="1196" /> with the contents of the little booklet issued for their benefit.  It is short enough and simple enough, and it is an appalling situation that, in these days, when people are being killed and maimed in their hundreds and thousands on the roads, we still have with us those who will not study properly the rules of the road.  Yet, when they fail their tests because of their own lack of application, they immediately begin to howl that they have been unfairly dealt with by the tester.  We will not be browbeaten into releasing on to our roads drivers who give no guarantee that they will be safe themselves on the roads or that their presence on the roads will not endanger the physical capacity or lives of other road users.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that it must be very frustrating for people to fail these tests.  Would they and those who plead for them please remember that we do not do this for fun?  Neither do we do it for the sake of getting a second £1. Indeed, that could be a very costly venture on our part at a time when we are inundated with applications.  We have a list of applicants for test who have already submitted their pounds. We just cannot get around to them and it would be very foolish, for the sake of getting another £1, to add to the present list.  Bringing people back a second time just for the sake of the £1 would not be a profitable business. Indeed, it would show a loss.  It is not for the sake of the second £1 that people are failed, but that is the rather cynical approach one finds around the country.  There is no foundation for it.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister make it quite clear to applicants that, if they do not sign all the documents, they will be declared invalid?  The information is hidden away in very small type and applicants walk into the trap.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>On the new forms now being printed, that will be pretty evident and I do not think we should have much more of that kind of difficulty. The fact is that the tester does not know the applicant from Adam. In one particular case, the man under test was certainly the person who signed the paper there and then but that signature did not correspond with the original.  The tester's problem in such a case is to identify the applicant. It is difficult for people who have been caught out.  In the country the applicant may be out working and some other member of the family may sign the document and send it in. Then, when the applicant comes along <Col N="1198" /> for test and signs his name, there may be a complete discrepancy between his signature and the signature on the original application.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that.  The first time I came up against this, my immediate reaction was that the only solution would be to get the nearest garda to identify the applicant, but there is, of course, a fallacy in that.  The fallacy is that the garda station may be 20 miles away from where the lad comes from and nobody in the station might know him.  If it were the local station, the likelihood is that he would be identified.  In that position we would get over the problem but we would not get over all the problems.  We might find that the gardaí were beginning to resent this.  However, we are trying, through more clearly printed forms and every other device open to us, to avoid this in future in as many cases as possible.</P>

In time, the main intention would be to integrate these people into our community. That may be looked forward to but it may be a few generations ahead.  I do not agree with the idea of large camping sites or ghettos into which we would round them up, and I do not agree that we should deal with them as some sort of untouchables, less than human, who should be kept away from the rest of our society.

I know they believe that something should be done and the only question is: &ldquo;Where will we do it?  If we do it in this place, we may offend this person and if we do it somewhere else, we may offend that person&rdquo;.  If we come to grips with it, we can do a good quick job, and it will be the first step towards integrating these unfortunate people into the community as a whole.</P>
      <P>The charge was also made that we had reduced from £5,000 to £2,000 the amount for the rehabilitation of itinerants in this year's Estimate.  This was held as backing up the other charge that I have no great interest in this matter.  The real reason for the reduction was that our experience last year showed that £5,000 would not be needed this year and therefore we did not provide more than £2,000. If more be needed, even in these rather strained financial times, and if the need rose to £10,000, we will get it, where-ever it will come from, if the job is to be done before 31st March.</P>

      <P>I represent everybody, including the itinerants, and I hope <Col N="1202" /> that I have a few friends among them. We also have had it said here that the itinerants have responsibilities and that the problem must be handled firmly. This is true.  There are some who feel that some of these &mdash; like any other category &mdash; are not behaving themselves in all cases.  Again, might I point out to those who have not yet made any effort to provide those camping sites that if the itinerants have a camping site they belong to, it not only gives them the sense of belonging there and the little bit of security which, God knows, they have so little of, but it also has the effect that they can be more easily controlled than if they are not on camping sites.  That matter should be taken into account when considering camping sites.</P>
      <P>Pumps should be provided pending comprehensive regional water schemes. I had that notion, too, at one time, about seven years ago, but I gave it up. I do not intend to go back on it again. It might give impetus to the notion that pumps should spring up here and there.  They have the unhappy knack, wherever they are provided, of being there for far too long.  Indeed, the fact they are put in certain locations has often militated against the enthusiasm that might have been expected from local residents and local county councils in regard to going ahead with water schemes.  I do not like to see pumps provided but where it is absolutely necessary I agree they should be provided but only as a stop-gap.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Swimming pools were mentioned and I am glad they were, because they are something in which I have a very great interest.  I believe we have need of a great many of them in the future of this country.  It was stated by Deputy Dockrell that there should be a swimming pool in every housing scheme.  I take it that he was referring to the size of housing schemes we have in Dublin and not to the housing schemes as we from the country might understand them.  He went so far as to say that some of the big blocks of flats should be provided with swimming pools.  I would agree with this outlook but not in the same fine detail as the Deputy has mentioned.  I believe that in large cities such as Dublin, <Col N="1203" /> Cork, Limerick and Galway, while there undoubtedly will be a pressing demand for the olympic standard pool, the first thing we have to provide are swimming facilities for our own people.  I do not necessarily mean competent swimming facilities for the few competitors of high standards.  We want to see in the city of Dublin ordinary sized pools with ordinary capacity &mdash; pools with dimensions which can be regarded as adequate to serve many thousands of people.  We should then draw for the city of Dublin and other cities and towns throughout the country a blueprint based on this pool size related to the population.  We should then have a long-term programme. This would depend on our financial resources.  We should then have a blueprint on which we will work steadily and systematically, year by year, providing two or three pools per year.  Those should be of a pre-determined type and they should take into account what the needs of Dublin and those other places are in regard to swimming facilities.</P>
    <P>Those pools should not necessarily be of high competitive standard at all. They should be of adequate size and depth and with sufficient dressing room and other toilet accommodation and so forth to serve a given area within a short radius.  Those pools would be sufficient for the children of this and other cities and towns to swim in.  The children could learn to swim in those smaller pools without having to take special transport or to go very far from their homes or endanger themselves in any way.  I should like to see district pools provided in our cities and our larger towns throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Instead of spending £150,000 or £200,000 on the provision of an Olympic standard pool in this city, I would much rather see ten of the ordinary prototype pools I have been advocating in ten different housing estates around the city.  The children of the estates would derive far greater benefit from those ten pools, with very little extra cost, than from one big pool.  Competitive swimmers would monopolise such a large pool, between <Col N="1204" /> galas and training, and there would be no place in this pool for the ordinary kids of this city or any other town in this country.</P>
    <P>We must keep in mind that the elementary thing we want is a pool that will allow our kids and our young people to be taught to swim and in which they can practise swimming. Such pools should be of dimensions related to the population of the locality they are intended to serve.  It is not necessary that they should be filtrated, that the water should be heated, that they should be covered so that they could be used the year round or that the dressing accommodation should be appropriate to the capacity of the pool and the numbers they serve.  I have seen many plans requiring all sorts of frills for those pools.  They are not necessary as far as the basic requirements of this or any other city are concerned.  Until the elementary needs are met in a manner somewhat similar to what I have described the idea of spending money on the big elaborate pools is one which, though it may have my sympathy, certainly cannot have my support.</P>
    <P>I believe, over the next year or so, even before all the money we want becomes available again, we may find it possible to set out a relatively small programme of the smaller and cheaper pools and that we need not necessarily wait the coming of all the money we require for everything else.  When we think that a pool of the nature I have described, meeting and fulfilling the needs I have described, has been built for under £16,000 in one of our provincial towns, then we begin to realise that £100,000 could, in fact, build up to six of those pools in any given year. This, taking it against our total expenditure through local authorities and the Department of Local Government, is so infinitesimal, that when the arguments of those who say you could build 45 houses for that sum of money, are weighed against the overall good and the help given by those pools, it will be seen that we would be doing very great good in providing them.</P>
    <P>It may well be that a 25-metre pool is not the ideal pool.  It may also well be &mdash; I am now having this investigated <Col N="1205" /> for some time &mdash; that the £16,000 25-metre pool, taken on a <i>pro rata</i> basis, should be increased to a 33?-metre pool, with all the ancillary dressing accommodation required in the greater size pool.  If this is so, we may well be, in the near future, in a position to decide whether the 25-metre pool is, in fact, sufficient for any location or district or whether a 33?-metre pool meets the needs of a particular town or city, or whether a number of 33?-metre pools, intermingled with 25-metre pools, would be the answer to Dublin city problems.</P>
    <P>These are matters which we are sifting and discussing not only with local authorities, but with development companies, swimming authorities and swimming clubs.  I think the most worthwhile thing we have done for swimming is the building in Longford of a pool at £16,000.  A follow-up from that need not end with this one particular type or size of pool.  What I would like to say is that I hope any future swimming pools will keep near to the cost of that type of pool.  If we do this and we follow it up in that way, I believe we are realistic for the first time in 50 years.  We are facing up to something that we in the local authorities would be prepared to do rather than codding ourselves and codding the public that we are going to spend £150,000 on swimming pools.</P>
    <P>When we have these pools scattered around Dublin and other places, when we have competitors, then will come the demand and the real need to build, in addition to the small pools, large competitive pools from which we will send first-class swimmers from this country.  It is noted that from a few places, one a public school and another a public entertainment centre, notable swimmers have been emerging.  They do not have to have Olympic-type pools to become great swimmers, and some of them very great indeed.  I believe hundreds of thousands of swimmers will appear out of nowhere in this country if we give them the decent elementary need and fulfil that need by giving them an elementary sort of pool designed at a cost the country can afford, and add a few around the country over the years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1206" /> I should like to say to those who have felt that by having their plans delayed, I am against the idea of swimming pools.  I am in favour of them for several reasons, but I will not agree with what to me is nothing but wasteful spending on the design of some of the pools I have got.  They are no bigger than this pool I am talking about and they would cost two to three times as much to provide.  There is no sense or sanity in that approach and I would not have it as far as subsidy, or the Local Loans Fund is concerned. If they want to find money in another way for an elaborately finished structure of no greater size than the pools we are providing at the same cost, let them go ahead.  If they have that sort of money to build that sort of pool, so long as it is not money being diverted from any essential service, I will not stop them.  I will not supply money, even if I had it, for over-elaborate structures or greater ones than that about which I have been talking, or some version of it.</P>
    <P>If we come to the point where we can adopt a scheme of pools for any part or all of the country, and I hope we will get down to a programme for these pools, we will keep in mind that these pools can be built at the amount of money I have prophesied they can be built at, and of the same nature as that pool that is operating successfully. It has been said to me by an astute businessman who is on the committee that the operation of these pools in the city of Dublin would be a great commercial proposition for any man to put his money into, never mind getting money for it.  This is the view in Longford.</P>
    <P>If and when we get down to a programme of pools, from the applications in my Department over a number of years, and indeed recently, we can draw up some sort of priority list and it would be the first four or five on that list for the first year and the second five the following year and we would be adding and talking away from it as time goes on.</P>

      <P>The grand thing about these pools &mdash; and this is something I did not know myself; I thought you must have running water and that you must change the water three or four times every day &mdash; is that the water in these pools, if there is a proper filtration plant, needs to be changed only once a year.  That is all that is necessary.  If the filtration plant is working properly, water that is used in these pools can be used domestically and would be quite potable.  There might be a solution there where there is a shortage of water: the water which was in the pool in the winter could be used in the summer for uses other than swimming.</P>

      <P>I do not think so; we are a fair bit apart.  As the Deputy says, there are others who might be nearer.</P>
      <P>The delay in sanctioning a public sanitary convenience in the town of Cahir was raised.  The fact is the tender for this work was sanctioned in January, 1966, and the necessary loan approved in March, and it was not the fault of my Department that there was a delay in commencing the work. It was due to legal difficulties in regard to the transfer of the site to the local authority.  It can happen that things other than lack of my sanction and the lack of the availability of the loan hold things up, things over which my Department or the Government have no control.</P>
      <P>The financing of group water schemes was raised and it was asked how group water schemes were financed, what proportion of the cost was contributed by the local authority. The amount of the State grants in the group schemes is £60 per house and the local authority may also contribute up to £60.  In fairness to the local authorities, all of them have been paying the maximum amount for some years past.  The groups, theoretically, must contribute.  I say allegedly, deliberately, the groups must contribute at least one-third of the overall cost, either by way of cash or voluntary labour.  This, I think, is the answer to Deputy Jones's queries but it may be that, at the back of his queries, there was something he did not make clear, but if that is what he wanted to know, that is the answer.  If it is not an adequate answer, I will be happy to help him if he gives me details.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The progress in group schemes has been queried by Deputy Jones and I can tell him considerable progress has been made.  On 30th September, 1966, 173 schemes, comprising 2,000 odd houses, had been completed with all grants fully paid.  That is news to some Deputies: 173 schemes and 2,018 houses have been completed and all grants will be paid in these cases. The number of schemes in progress <Col N="1210" /> is 153, involving nearly 3,600 houses, for which 2,376 grants have been paid. Designs have been received for 118 schemes involving about 2,600 houses, and on 30th September, a total of 1,114 grants were paid compared with 511 grants in the corresponding period last year.  When I said a while ago things were not quite as bad as was being anticipated or desired, it was an under-statement, certainly in regard to activities on this front.</P>

      <P>We had young dynamos before and they did not get very far.</P>
      <P>Now we come to water pollution. This is a matter that has been cngaging the attention of my Department for some considerable time and we hope to do everything possible about it and to ensure that the future will be a little more clear in the real sense&mdash;I am talking about the water&mdash; than it would be if we did not do anything at all.  This is a problem in other countries and it could become one here.  The unfortunate thing is that once it has been allowed to take place, the vested interests that cause it are very hard to shift.  You will find all sorts of people defending them and making appeals on their behalf, and if it is an industry, as it almost always is, there will be the unanswerable case made that if you insist on those people preventing this effluent, the industry will close down and there will be 100 or 200 people out of work.  The real chance we have in this country is to try to prevent this sort of pollution taking place.  Then we will not have the sort of problems other countries have found it impossible to get over in regard to this particular matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The overall situation in regard to these sanitary services is not as satisfactory as the overall housing position, for the reason that we have not been able, and have not thought it wise, to devote as much money to new works on the sanitary services side as might be desired by the people who have submitted tenders to us.  But if we have not, it is not for the reason that we have not felt it most desirable that these schemes be carried out, and we will finance them, but the pressing problem of more and more houses is the greater one.  When a scheme has been held back for some months on the sanitary services side, it enables us to build some additional houses during those same months and we feel it is better to do this than to go on as if nothing whatever were required <Col N="1213" /> from us by way of additional money for housing.</P>
    <P>Planning is a matter which was talked about here to some degree and it did suffer in the debate from the fact that many Deputies did not appreciate that figures I gave in my opening speech had some significance.  I know there are problems about the application of the Planning Act, and its terms, and this has caused misunderstanding and frustrations.  But the real facts emerging are that almost 20,000 applications for planning permission were decided by local planning authorities in the year ended 31st March last and, of those, 90 per cent were granted. This could not be regarded by anybody as other than a display of reasonable attitude by the local authorities. In the same period, 1,075 appeals were disposed of and of these 1,075, 738 were formally determined by me, 186 were withdrawn and 151 were late or invalid.  Of the 738 formally determined, 171 were allowed, 219 allowed subject to conditions.  In 348 cases, the decision of the local authority was upheld and those who had appealed against it were rejected.</P>
    <P>Taking the number fully allowed to the appellants to be 23 per cent of the 171 and 30 per cent, representing the 219 allowed with conditions, gives us just over 50 per cent of the appeals actually determined in favour of the appellants, or applicants, in this particular case and this 50 per cent relates to ten per cent turned down by the local authority.  In all, it would appear that 95 per cent of the applications, between the local authorities' granting of permission and the Minister's subsequent granting of appeals, are, in fact, granted.  That leaves a residue of five per cent and, naturally, there will be amongst that five per cent people who feel quite aggrieved.</P>
    <P>But, on the other hand, these controls in planning, or indeed in anything else, are there &mdash; indeed if there was nobody being turned down, there would not be any need for them &mdash; and there is approximately five per cent in the ultimate analysis not getting through.  Ninety-five per cent are succeeding and, while there may <Col N="1214" /> be aggrieved people amongst the five per cent, it can only be taken from these facts and figures that the Planning Act, whether at local or central level, is being administered in a reasonable manner.  There is not the case for complaint that some Deputies have been making.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes; I hope I am in the process of solving it at the moment but it is difficult.  Naturally as the number of applications goes up, the number of appeals has tended to go up.  I would say that in the past year, and in the years since the Planning Act came into operation &mdash; with the new terms and regulations &mdash; there has been some misunderstanding in the application of the regulations and the laws down the country, where they might have been getting more appeals than would be regarded as normal and this, added to the fact that we are, like every other authority with any planning problems, short of planners, adds to our difficulty.  But I do believe that at the moment I have got around to the point where we can solve the backlog and once we have that solved, we will be able to keep things up in the future.  But there are undoubtedly long delays in many cases in respect of which I would love to say they did not exist but they do.</P>

There are other causes for the delay but I would be unfair if I did not say there are some cases waiting for 18 months.  There are <Col N="1215" /> undue delays I have not been able to keep up with, due to many factors, but which I hope to resolve during the coming 12 months.</P>

      <P>It is not a long delay. What might not be appreciated in the House &mdash; and maybe this gives cause for annoyance to some Deputies &mdash; is <Col N="1216" /> that when Deputies ask me about such and such an appeal they may not realise that these appeals are normally addressed to the Secretary of the Department.  Until that appeal has gone through the full process of investigation, inspection and report and is sent up finally to me with a recommendation, I need not necessarily be aware that that appeal has arrived in the Department, unless somebody brings it personally to my notice. Therefore, when Deputies know there are appeals in the Custom House and ask me: &ldquo;What about them&rdquo;, I can truthfully say, in many cases, that I do not know they are there, but I will know when I come to them.  I will know when they come to me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>If someone writes in consequence of an appeal being lodged in the Department in the normal and legal way &mdash; as it is the right of any citizen to do&mdash;and I am requested by letter to know what is happening about such an appeal, I will not necessarily even have knowledge that the appeal has arrived until I get the request inquiring after its wellbeing.  I inquire from the section dealing with these matters as to what the situation is.  I may get the information that it is under consideration. That is quite true.  It must come to me in the last analysis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not make the obvious answer.  I said &ldquo;some relationship&rdquo; and the Deputy disclaims that there is any relationship at all.  The rates which are levied are not an isolated tax but are part of the overall, rather complex, central taxation which spreads the burden of public finance as widely and equitably as possible. I know there can be cases of hardship. I have no doubt that hardship does and will exist.  In the case of the rates, this can be met by the local authority writing off the rates in these hardship cases.  I know that if you want to file this down a bit, it can be challenged.  If a person has a property which he wishes to retain on which the rates burden is greater than his means to pay, it could be held that the sale of the property would realise the amount due for rates and that there would be no question of the rates being irrecoverable.  However, many hardship cases could be dealt with by writing off the rates.  I do not think the number of cases which are not dealt with in a sympathetic manner can be very great.  I would hope that it would be negligible, or even nil if the action I have suggested were taken in every case where poverty or lack of ability to pay could be demonstrated.</P>

      <Col N="1220" /> It was suggested that many buildings are not properly valued.  There have been a number of investigations into local taxation.  One is still going on and the report of the committee in question is expected and will be published as an interim report.  If there is no solution to our local tax problem, at least we would as a result of these reports get a better appreciation of the difficulties that exist in trying to find alternatives to our rateable valuation and tax system as it applies at present.  There is much one can say about the local taxation system but I shall not take up the time of the House in going over that because at the moment it could only be views of a personal nature that I could express and it would not convey any indication of the character of the investigations that are going on.  When we have these reports and conclusions and the final report from the committee investigating the matter then we shall all have an opportunity of discussing the over-all situation as outlined in these reports and any alternatives suggested or any other suggestions that are worth considering at the appropriate time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but in the situation as I know it, people have been gone from what has been regarded as their home for long periods.  In the <Col N="1221" /> county to which I belong, people have the habit of being associated with those homes and their predecessors for generations and we have the view, and it seems to work fairly well, that until a person has gone from what was known to be his home for an unbroken period of 18 months, he remains on the old register.  That got over some difficulties which we had with migratory workers and immigrants and so on who were not really gone and were coming back.  Using this 18 month period has been reasonably satisfactory in regard to our problems.

      <P>It is not worth while unless you are hard put to it.  Presiding officers and poll clerks, it was said, could not vote at the recent Presidential election.  Unfortunately, it is only too true in too many cases.  The law which might have been amended in this regard has not yet been amended and poll clerks and presiding officers who were appointed to stations other than where they are registered, under <Col N="1222" /> the strict letter of the law, were not entitled to, and did not get, the transfer of vote they ordinarily enjoyed for general elections.  I very much regret this and hope we shall not have a recurrence of it and that those people who are giving a service to the community will have the same facilities in future Presidential elections as they now enjoy in regard to general elections.</P>
      <P>I have been asked whether any progress has been made as regards extension of postal voting.  Proposals for the amendment of the electoral law are being formulated at present and it is intended that a Bill will be drafted which will facilitate voting by election staff at Presidential elections as I have already mentioned and will also provide for the extension to certain classes of postal voting.  Do not press me to be more specific as regards these classes of persons; we shall have an opportunity of discussing it, when and if the measure comes to the House.</P>

To a great extent, that is true and that is a result of the extension of the city boundary.  I can assure those people who are not represented in the council of the new area to which they belong that this will not long continue and that they will have an opportunity of having their own elected representatives on the appropriate councils by the end of next June.</P>

    <P>I want to refer to Ballymun but not <Col N="1223" /> in a general way.  I heard Deputy Larkin say on one occasion&mdash;and I was not interested in interrupting to correct him nor was I absolutely sure that what he was saying was not true although I had very grave doubts&mdash; that the kitchens in the houses in Ballymun were so small that you could not swing a cat in them, that they were eight feet by five feet and that there was a door on both sides of them.  Since then I have had a thorough search made in the Ballymun houses and my people cannot find a house with a kitchen of these dimensions.</P>

      <P>No, the only compartment&mdash;I would not call it a room&mdash;in these houses that would come down to that size is the additional amenity of the downstairs second toilet that we have built into them for the benefit of the tenants.  It might have been that some of the fittings were missing when the Deputy visited the houses and that he mistook this compartment for the kitchen.  There is no eight by five kitchen.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but I know other people who have been as close to housing as Deputy Larkin has been for a longer period in Dublin city. Deputy Larkin has certainly been long enough concerned with these matters to know all about them and I fail to see how he could have arrived at an eight by five kitchen <Col N="1224" /> in one of those houses.  It could not happen.  We have three types of house: A has a diningroom-kitchen combined of 153 sq. ft.; B has two living rooms instead of one and a smaller kitchen of 88 sq. ft., somewhat more than double the eight by five kitchen Deputy Larkin has found; C has a kitchen of 103 sq. ft. with two living rooms.  Perhaps I should make the dimensions of A clearer.  The diningroom-kitchen is 153 sq. ft. and the total combined living space is fairly considerable.  It is ironical that the type of structure Deputy Larkin liked best is the one no longer to be built. It is like the three-card trick: no matter which one was pulled out of the three, Deputy Larkin would like it best because we are not doing it any more.</P>
      <P>This was not determined by the consortium building houses there and it does not mean they will get more money for doing less.  The fact is that because of the system of contract and pricing of their scheme, the question of whether one, two or three types of house were to be continued in production was determined by negotiation between the builders and the National Building Agency and any saving that may have been made as a result of the cutting down of this house, which was more expensive than the other two, did not mean a saving for the contractors. Therefore, the Deputy can rest assured that in arriving at the conclusion not to use this type of house, there was no conferring of benefit on the builder.  This happened because of the views of the NBA and their consultant advisers that this type of house was costing more than the others, that it was taking up more space, that it required a greater frontage and therefore that it cut down on the full utilisation of the site.  It was not worth the addition and agreement was reached that of the three types this type would not be repeated in any sections of the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cluskey spoke about Ballymun. He said the new flats were all right but the houses were not all he would like them to be.  He said they were a bit off-beat, that they would <Col N="1225" /> cost a lot of money to maintain.  The strange thing about this is that the corporation of which he is a member were consulted about a great number of things, not least being the type of house to be built.  It was only natural that we in the Department should have the views of the corporation and be guided by their experience so that anything we proposed to do ultimately would be examined by them and, if possible, have their approval.  This procedure went right through and let me say, in case I may be misunderstood, that the corporation had an opportunity to see the proposals and to comment on them.  They did not disapprove of the structures we are now building.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cluskey must surely accept collective responsibility for this even if he now complains about the houses and would like to disown them.  This is an old chestnut and I know where it comes from.  The idea this ramp tried to put across is that the upkeep of these houses will be costly, extremely high.  I should like to emphasise for Deputy Cluskey's benefit that this house was accepted and approved by London County Council before we ever came to look at it and those people have a fair bit of experience of house building in their great city.  This Lowthen Cubitt house has been improved since we got it here in that certain new features and better ways of doing the work have been found by us.  Surely what was good enough for London County Council, improved by us in the meantime, should be good enough for Deputy Cluskey?  I say it should, and I am not alone in this because London County Council approved of a version which is not as good as the version in Ballymun.</P>
    <P>This suggestion about the timber fascia and frontage causing untold trouble in the future is laughable.  I must draw attention to modern methods of weatherproofing timbers, of securing them against the vagaries of weather in our climate.  How can any Deputy say that timber facings today will be a cause great hardship, bother and costly maintenance in the future when they remember that <Col N="1226" /> we have been using timber for doors and windows since Adam was a little fellow and Eve was a little girl and nobody has ever said we should not use timber in doors and windows because it would have to be replaced in 50 years?  This is a type of argument I do not like to hear.  I have a fair idea where this criticism came from.  It came from a source which can ill afford to criticise what we in the NBA and the Department are trying to do for the corporation.  This ramp made this criticism for the benefit of members of the corporation and the sooner they stop this dog in the manger attitude, the better it will be for Ballymun and the city generally.  I know them; I know all about them.</P>
    <P>We had another aside from Deputy Cluskey to the effect that never at any time was he consulted about the houses or shown the houses to be constructed in Ballymun.  I have a record here of a visit by councillors and a photograph was taken.  In this photograph certain faces appear.  I know the faces very well and one of them would appear to me to be Deputy Cluskey. It must also have appeared to the Press photographer as Deputy Cluskey because the caption states it is Deputy Cluskey.</P>

      <P>This is no mirror.  This is Deputy Cluskey himself.  There is a very beautiful photograph of these houses.  Anybody would be happy to live in them unless he had a better one, and not many of us have.  Deputy <Col N="1227" /> Cluskey did see these houses, and he is not the only one.  There is a whole group of councillors, including our old friend, Deputy Burke, Deputy Larkin, Deputy Moore, former Deputy John McCann, Deputy Mrs. Lynch, Councillors Walsh, Stafford, M. Burke and Captain Kelly.  They are all there in the same photograph.  There were many more than that on the scene but they did not get into this.  Do not accept my recollection of these things.  There is the evidence from the newspaper that these people were there.  I just want to jog Deputy Cluskey's memory when he says he was not shown the houses constructed at Ballymun and was not consulted in this regard.  I do not know whether he meant that or whether he got mixed up, but he did have the opportunity of seeing them.  Therefore, I cannot see how Deputy Cluskey, who is also a councillor, can wash his hands of any responsibility and condemn these houses, although he was not too sore about them, I must admit.  I do not know what was in his mind.  Possibly he was thinking of the elections next June when he might be saying: &ldquo;Do not blame Councillor Cluskey.  I was not shown these houses.  I do not know anything about them, and my hands are clean&rdquo;.  If that is his approach, fair enough, but I do not think it is the way out in this case.</P>
      <P>Despite Deputy Cluskey's fears, these are very good houses.  They are bigger than the normal houses that have been built around this city for a considerable time.  They have the additional amenity of a ground floor toilet which is something most of our private houses do not boast of.  This is being provided in a house which already has upstairs its bathroom and toilet combined as any normal house would have.  With all the talk and criticism about these new houses and their inadequacies, nobody adverted to this second toilet on the ground floor adjacent to the kitchen and the back door, or the front door in some houses. I will guarantee there is not a housewife who goes into one of these houses in Ballymun who would not think more of having that facility than many other amenities in a normal house.</P>

If all these things count for nothing, if the loans mean nothing, the grants paid out mean nothing, if the activity around us means nothing, if the increasing population in Dublin city means nothing, there is no point in talking to the Deputy.  The tradesmen have not run out of the country as they did ten years ago.  There is £25,500,000 being spent this year on housing and sanitary services.  This is the highest figure ever provided by any Government in the history of this State.  What really emerges from this discussion over the past few days is that things are far better than Deputies opposite would wish them to be.  They are annoyed because the building industry did not collapse in ruins as it did in 1956 and 1957, that we are still occupied with building this year and will continue next year and the years after, that so long as Fianna Fáil remain in office, there will be no danger of the collapse we experienced ten years ago.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am raising a grave case of a citizen of this State who is described as homeless and friendless, hungry and sick, physically and mentally.  I do not know the man.  I know none of the attendant circumstances except such as were reported in the public press and I do not think it appropriate to attempt a re-trial of the merits of his case.  But in the course of the Minister's reply to me today he saw fit to say that in sentencing the defendant to imprisonment for one month for housebreaking, the court took into account the fact that at another court the defendant had been given a suspended sentence of six months after pleading guilty to six separate charges. At another stage of the Minister's reply, he said that there were other charges outstanding against the man.</P>
      <P>I do not think either of these questions is relevant to the fundamental question I wish to raise.  The man in question appeared before the District Justice in Swords.  I have no reason to apprehend that the report contained in the press was made by any other than a thoroughly responsible pressman for I do not believe the newspaper would have published it if they were not so satisfied.</P>
      <P>According to a report from which I am reading, which appeared in the <i>Evening Herald</i> of Wednesday, 5th October, 1966, the Justice said that he regretted sending the man to prison for a month and added &mdash; and these words are in inverted commas&mdash;&ldquo;our society caters for this sort in the same way we did a hundred years ago&rdquo;.  I want to avail of this House to challenge that statement.  I deny it.  I say that the method of dealing with cases of this kind one hundred years ago is not the method sanctioned by this Oireachtas for dealing with such cases now.</P>
      <P>The Justice continued &mdash; and then the inverted commas are re-opened:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;This man has been very seriously ill for a considerable time and he <Col N="1231" /> has pleaded guilty to breaking and entering a hotel by opening an unlocked door, and stealing 10/- from one of the rooms, leaving 5/- in silver behind him.  He did not touch any other property in the hotel, and the money he took was spent on food.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These words are all included in inverted commas, being the verbatim report of a responsible newspaper correspondent of a judicial person speaking from the Bench:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The investigating officer accepts that the man needed this money for food.  He has no friends or relatives, save one who lives 100 miles from here and with whom the defendant had not been in communication for two years.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Garda is satisfied that this man is not merely physically ill but, to some extent, mentally ill also. The state of our society&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>I want to interject.  Mark these words. These are the words reported as having been uttered from the Bench:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The state of our society does not provide for defendant.&rdquo;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to re-try the case.  I am saying that because we are the sovereign authority, because the Minister for Justice is answerable to us and not to the British House of Commons, because there are 144 of us here, this homeless, friendless man has 144 friends, because we represent the Irish people.</P>
      <P>Since this is evidently a case where the prerogative should be exercised and this man released from jail, I want to put the case that we cannot rest easy in this House if we believe that there is a man in jail who was mentally ill when the act complained of was perpetrated and when the sentence was passed and that, if that is the case, this man should be released. I want the Minister for Justice to say, &ldquo;I am going to take this man out of jail and I shall activate the social services by calling on my colleagues the Minister for Health and the Minister for Social Welfare to lend their aid to get this man straightened out.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Let us not delude ourselves.  I do not doubt that this is one of God's undeserving poor.  The deserving poor are sure of sympathy from all who behold them but the undeserving poor are entitled to justice.  I call the House to remember that nearly 100 years ago when somebody fired a shot at Queen Victoria and she was informed that the verdict of the court might be &ldquo;not guilty because insane&rdquo; she became most indignant and she got the law changed so that, if the sovereign was fired at, the proper verdict to bring in was &ldquo;guilty but insane&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1233" /> We are not living under Queen Victoria and I am putting it to the Minister that if there is a man of unsound mind, however undeserving, in jail for breaking and entering a house to get 10/- to buy food because he was hungry and homeless and friendless, we do not believe that the society to which we belong and over which we as Deputies of Dáil Éireann preside, this affluent society, does not cater for the likes of him.  I think it does and I think a prudent Minister for Justice would intervene at this stage and say, &ldquo;I propose to ask the Government to exercise the prerogative and release this man.&rdquo;  If he is of unstable mind, we have social services to meet that contingency.  If he is poor and hungry, and friendless, he has friends here.  As far as the homeless aspect is concerned, we have the means to meet that contingency also.  But because there are other charges outstanding against him and because he has offended in the past, that is no justification for condemning him for something he did while his mind was ill and sick.</P>
    <P>I am going to put this.  There is no one of us who might not sink into the gutter in our time.  But if any one of us did sink to the level of abandonment this unfortunate man has apparently reached and was brought before the court in Swords, he would have relations and friends who would be there with counsel and solicitors and undertakings and explanations.  The reason this man is in Mountjoy is that he had no friends and no relations and no one to speak for him.  I do not believe that any Deputy thinks this situation should be allowed to continue. I do not believe any Deputy thinks&mdash;I do not believe the Minister thinks&mdash;that because you are poor and friendless and homeless, you should be penalised for being mentally ill and for seeking to relieve your hunger by what is undoubtedly a crime, opening a door after nightfall and going in to find the money to buy bread.  I doubt very much if that is a crime in the eyes of God.  I do not deny that technically <Col N="1234" /> it is the offence of burglary or housebreaking, depending on the hour at which it took place.  But whatever offence he committed, if his mind was sick, is it appropriate that because he was poor and homeless and friendless we should shovel him into Mountjoy? If the Minister or I, which God forbid, should ever, through our own folly or misfortune, find ourselves brought low as this poor tramp apparently was, does he think it would be right when our minds were sick if we did something of this kind that we should be shovelled into Mountjoy?  There is perhaps some strange good fortune in the fact that the Minister's father is sitting behind him as a Deputy of this House. I do not think he would be absent from the courthouse if it were his son who stood before the Justice.  I do not think my family would be absent from the court if it were I.  This man had neither friends nor relatives to speak for him.  Everybody entitled to speak agreed that he was not only physically but mentally ill.</P>
    <P>I want to be able to raise my head again and to say that here in Ireland under our own Government we do make provision not only for the deserving but for the undeserving poor. If they fall into misfortune, we have the means and the will to help them and protect them, even if necessary from themselves, while they are ill and that we do not simply shovel them into Mountjoy.  I do not think that is an unreasonable request to make to the Minister.  I hope after the time for reflection he has had this afternoon he will be able to reassure us that he will ask the Government to exercise the appropriate prerogative and say that this man who is friendless, homeless, lonely, hungry and sick is friendless no longer but that under our dispensation, because there is no one else to speak for him, there are 144 Deputies of this House, all of whom are his friends as they are of any other citizen who needs his fundamental rights defended.</P>

      <P>On many occasions Deputy Dillon is certainly to be admired in his <Col N="1235" /> pursuit of the interest of the individual but on this occasion I think he just has not got hold of the facts, to use a phrase.  He is obviously working on newspaper reports of the particular matter.  I happen to have taken a personal interest in this particular case and have, as Minister for Justice available to me, both in the form of ordinary reports and personal reports, the exact situation in regard to it.  I can assure the Deputy that all the lay, medical and psychiatric advice is to the effect that this man is being very well looked after where he is.  I am sure the Deputy will accept that advice. This man is under top-class medical and psychiatric care for the short period in which he will be in jail.  I would say he is probably being much better looked after in that respect than he would be outside.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that the word &ldquo;jail&rdquo; which he uses in such a manner with a Victorian connotation is not the manner in which we use the term today.  We happen to have evolved here under successive Governments a humane administration of justice.  As far as anybody in this sort of condition in jail today is concerned, he is better off than he would be in most of the hospitals in the country and is fully catered for medically and psychiatrically.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <P>Now let us get back to the facts and away from the hysterical bluff which surrounds a lot of this matter.  As far as the court was concerned, the fact of the matter was that this unfortunate man was under a suspended sentence of six months for a conviction one month before that in respect of six distinct charges of theft involving substantial sums of money. There was a history of this type of offence in the case of the man who appears, while not to be insane in the fullest medical sense, at least weakminded. This is the criminal background that was before the justice in this case.  I am quite satisfied the justice did the right thing in the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1236" /> I exercised the prerogative of mercy, to which Deputy Dillon referred, on many occasions.  I take a very close personal interest perusing the files submitted to me and have regard to this right.  There is a sacred obligation residing in any Minister for Justice to exercise the prerogative of mercy and terminate penalties where he sees fit or where a case is made to him by Deputies or people outside that leniency should be exercised.  I do exercise it and have exercised it.  I have looked at this case in a very close and personal way.  I have here before me the medical report from the prison medical officer, who is a fully qualified psychiatrist.  His recommendation is that this man is not a subject for treatment in a mental hospital and that he is being properly treated in a gentle and humane way while under this officer's care.</P>
    <P>I do not believe in making hysterical outbursts about personal cases.  I suggested to the Deputy earlier today when replying to his supplementary questions that this man was much better left alone.  I am a reasonably humane person and I know this case personally.  This man is better off where he is today under the care he is getting than he would be anywhere else in this country.  These happen to be the facts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite satisfied, also, having regard to the files before me and the records of the unfortunate misconduct of this man, that the district justice had little option but to do what he did.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <P>The Deputy should not act merely on newspaper reports.  He should stop bluffing and, instead, take a close personal interest in the case before he raises it in the hysterical and hypocritical manner in which he has raised it here.  Not alone would he do a service to himself, to <Col N="1237" /> his Party and to this Parliament but he would also do a service to the unfortunate man concerned.  I take a very poor view of anybody who develops this theme to the point of hypocrisy, with all due respect to Deputy Dillon, who, on many occasions, fights for individual cases on the basis of the liberty of the individual, and so on.  This is a theme he often develops but, on this occasion, with all due respect to that theme, Deputy Dillon is guilty of blatant hypocrisy. If I were to interest myself in a case as a Deputy of this House, I should take care to interview the person concerned and to come here with the facts at the behest of his family and friends.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <P>I should make my case in this House on that basis.  I should not come in here in a hysterical and hypocritical manner and make the case on the basis of newspaper reports without advertence to this man's interests.  Deputy Dillon is doing no service to this man's future.  He is merely making use of this man's case across the floor of the House for the purpose of his own advertisement: I am afraid that that appears to be the position.  I happen to have taken care in this matter.  I have this man's medical record and the medical reports.  I am glad to say he is making good progress.  The man himself was not in a good condition, from the medical and physical point of view, largely due to his own troubles and his own wrongdoings.  He is now in good care and is making very good <Col N="1238" /> progress.  He will probably be in much better shape than he has been for a number of years as a result of the care and attention he is receiving by way of skilled medical and spiritual advice.</P>
