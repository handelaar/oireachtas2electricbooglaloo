    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers) Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 2, 3 and 4 together.</P>
      <P>Rural electrification has been affected by the general limitation on capital expenditure.  Because of the necessity for continuing expenditure on system improvement, because of increases in costs and also because the number of people seeking connection under the post development scheme is greater than was originally estimated, the Board had been finding difficulty in providing connection to all persons seeking supply.  In an effort to alleviate the position the Board had offered consumers the option of paying capital contributions, subject to refund later.</P>
      <P>I have reviewed the position and I have authorised the Board to proceed with connection in cases where houses are already wired and a firm commitment has been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say why, if the ESB have in fact lent £2,500,000 to the Government, they can now say they have not money enough to carry out necessary connection work unless the people who hope to get a connection pay in advance the <Col N="4" /> amount of money necessary to do the work, and why, in addition, they are asked to pay a flat charge?  How is that supposed to happen?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that people who applied for service have been asked to pay sums like £257 and similar amounts and where does he, or the ESB, expect the ordinary citizen to find this kind of money if the Government or the ESB cannot find it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The ESB have always been in the habit of offering people desiring connection the alternative of paying the service charge or paying the capital sum.  It would take too long to go into calculations or to give the nature of the refund.  I will be able to answer that if the Deputy asks a question on it.</P>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Tully, the Deputy knows perfectly well that there is a capital programme of some £100 million. The Minister for Finance explained the position to the House in regard to sums lent by State companies and other bodies for reinvestment in the general capital programme.  As I have already indicated, the cost of providing rural electrification has gone up, partly because of increased costs here, partly because of increased costs of materials or raw materials brought into the country for that purpose.  I have now made arrangements that some 3,000 people who wired their houses will be connected and every effort will be made to continue the programme of rural electrification and to see if it can be accomplished in the light of the capital programme as a whole.  It depends on the general financial situation. Eighty-three per cent of the rural dwellers are already connected and that is not a bad effort on the part of the ESB and the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>It is ludicrous for the ESB to ask a smallholder in a rural area for a loan of £300 in order that he may get an electricity supply.  Is this not tantamount to asking the smallholder for a loan, when the ESB say: We cannot do it because we have not got the money?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="5" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from the numerous statements which the Minister has made and which have no relation at all to the question here, will the Minister definitely state that those people who have wired their houses for connection up to now and have been refused that connection because the ESB had not the money to do it or because they could not reach that area due to shortage of money, will get their connection almost immediately?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not say almost immediately.  You cannot send gangs of people all over the country but, as I said, between now and the end of this financial year an arrangement is being made whereby the Board will proceed with connection in cases where houses are already wired and a firm commitment has been made.  The amount of money which would be available for this purpose could not have been predetermined earlier.  The work will be done in the course of the next six months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say if, in fact, in regard to the money which they are asking people to lend them now to do the work on their own houses, they will give a definite date for the repayment of that money and not simply say that a refund will be considered when the capital assets allow it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>In six years it will be paid.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> Does the Minister agree that the rate of rural electrification of new areas has been slowed down?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already indicated to the Deputy the position in regard to that.  As the Deputy knows, the ESB have not been bad in making predictions in regard to the future of consumption in the country.  It just so happened that the increase in consumption by domestic consumers and others in the rural districts exceeded, not by a very large amount, but by a small amount, what they envisaged.  As a result of system improvement, improvement in trunks and circuits has <Col N="6" /> taken up a larger amount of the total amount made available for rural electrification as a whole than was envisaged. I am asking the ESB why they made a calculation that, apparently, was not as good as others made in the past.  The fact is that the calculation was not entirely correct.  A larger amount of capital than was envisaged was taken up in system improvement. The amount of money required to connect a further 3,000 householders is now given as a result of a further examination of the total finances of the ESB.</P>

It was intended that the service would commence on the 20th May, 1966 but due to the British seamen's strike, it did not commence until 3rd July, 1966.</P>
      <P>I understand that increased sailings on this route next year will provide capacity for over 35,000 cars inward. Further substantial increases are dependent on the introduction of additional capacity.</P>

As far as major industrial groups are concerned, the position at the beginning of this year regarding target growth rates and actual performance is set out in Table 27 of the Appendix to the Progress Report for 1965 on the Second Programme for Economic Expansion and the position of agriculture is discussed at some length in the body of the Report.  Discussions on the annual review of industry will commence shortly and a corresponding estimate of the position at end-1966 will be published in the NIEC Report on Review of Industrial Progress, 1966, early next year.  For agriculture, an assessment for 1966 is not yet available.  A comprehensive assessment of targets and performance in every field of the Programme will be made a part of the mid-term review of the Second Programme, which is now being undertaken with a view to considering what remedial action or changes in Government policy are necessary.  The results of this review will also be published early next year. The Deputy will appreciate that it is neither desirable nor practicable that this review should be undertaken in a piecemeal fashion and that it is not, therefore possible to anticipate the results of the review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Details of sick pay schemes applicable to State employees were given in a reply by me to a question by Deputy James Tully on 30th November, 1965.</P>
      <P>The other information sought is set out in a statement which, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, will be circulated with the Official Report.</P>
      <P>Following is the statement:&mdash;</P>
      <P Just="Center">A.&mdash;SUPERANNUATION SCHEME APPLICABLE TO STATE EMPLOYEES.</P>
      <P>The statutory provisions governing superannuation of civil servants empower the award of the benefits set out hereunder.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="17" />
      <i>Established positions</i>
    </P>
    <P>Persons serving in establised positions, within the meaning of the Civil Service Commissioners Act, 1956 and the Civil Service Regulation Act, 1956, are normally awarded superannuation under the Superannuation Acts 1834 to 1963.  These Acts provide a pension of one-eightieth pensionable salary for each year of reckonable service (maximum forty eightieths) together with a lump sum of one thirtieth salary for each year of service (maximum forty-five-thirtieths) and a death gratuity of one year's salary or the lump sum appropriate to years of service, if this is greater. A minimum of 10 years' reckonable service is required for the grant of pension.  An established civil servant who retires before completing 10 years' reckonable service may be granted a gratuity of one month's pay for each year of service.  A minimum of 2 years' reckonable service is required for the grant of a lump sum and 5 years for the grant of death gratuity.  Established women civil servants who were serving before the passing of the Superannuation Act, 1954 (13th April, 1954) may be granted a pension of one-sixtieth reckonable salary for each year of pensionable service, if they did not elect for pension in eightieths with lump sum and death gratuity when this option was offered to them after the passing of the Superannuation Act, 1954.</P>
    <P>An established civil servant may retire with superannuation on or after reaching age 60 (or age 55 in the case of Prison or Asylum officers).  Before age 60, superannuation can be awarded only on ill-health retirement or on discharge from office.  Retirement from an established position is compulsory at age 65 (age 60 in the case of Prison or Asylum officers).</P>
    <P>
      <i>Unestablished positions</i>
    </P>
    <P>Persons serving in a whole-time capacity in unestablished or temporary positions (including civilian employees in the Department of Defence, Forestry employees and employees in the Office of Public Works) who retire on age (after reaching age 60) or on ill-health <Col N="18" /> or on discharge from office, may be granted a gratuity of one week's pay for each year of service up to 15 years and two weeks' pay for the 16th and each subsequent year of service.  A minimum of seven years' service is required for the grant of a gratuity.  If an unestablished civil servant dies before retirement, the gratuity appropriate to his service is paid to his dependants.</P>
    <P>Unestablished civil servants are also insured under the Social Welfare Acts for contributory old age pensions and other benefits.</P>
    <P>Where an unestablished civil servant is appointed to an established position one-half of his whole-time unestablished service reckons for pension and lump sum or death gratuity under the Superannuation Acts.</P>
    <P>In addition to the foregoing, special superannuation provisions for a few posts with special functions in relation to the courts of justice have been made under the Courts of Justice and Court Officers (Superannuation) Act, 1961, and the Courts (Supplemental Provision) Act, 1961.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Non-statutory awards</i>
    </P>
    <P>Marriage gratuities are awarded to established women officers retiring on marriage with at least 6 years' service, and consist of one month's pay for each year of established service, subject to a maximum of a year's pay.</P>
    <P>Ex-gratia gratuities of three-quarters of a week's pay for each year of reckonable service are awarded to part-time officers retiring on age or ill-health, or discharged from employment, provided they have served for at least 7 years.  In case of death, the gratuity is paid to the dependants.</P>
    <P>Note.&mdash;The foregoing provisions do not apply to the Defence Forces, Garda Síochána or teachers.</P>
    <P Just="Center">B.&mdash;EMPLOYEES OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WHO ARE NOT COVERED BY SICK PAY OR SUPERANNUATION SCHEMES.</P>
    <P>All employees paid out of the Vote for the Office of the Minister for Finance are covered by a sick pay <Col N="19" /> scheme.  The following are not covered by a superannuation scheme for the award of pension:&mdash;</P>

      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary indicate to the House whether it is the intention to bring these employees under a scheme of sick pay or superannuation, having regard to the fact that employees of equal service employed by local authorities throughout the country will be covered by such schemes and employees of most good employers will also be covered by such schemes?

In view of the unsatisfactory nature of the reply, I give notice that I propose to raise the matter on the Adjournment.</P>

      <P>The rural improvements scheme has not been suspended.  Schemes to the value of more than £200,000 have been approved to date this year, and further schemes will be approved within the limit of the available funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In August, 1965, there were approximately 1,700 rural improvements <Col N="23" /> schemes applications outstanding, more than enough to complete a normal programme of works for the following financial year, and the acceptance of new applications was suspended until these were disposed of.</P>
    <P>An exception was made in the case of applicants for works which formerly would have been eligible as minor employment or bog development schemes, and a total of 922 rural improvements schemes application forms were issued to such persons, of which 326 have so far been returned to the Office.</P>
    <P>Members of the permanent staff of the Special Employment Schemes Office rendered redundant by the merging of the minor employment and bog development schemes in the rural improvements scheme were transferred to other Government Departments.

      <P>The acceptance of new applications under the rural improvements scheme, except for proposals in former minor employment or bog development schemes areas, was suspended from 9th August, 1965.  As indicated in my reply to Question No. 7 on 5th October, 1966, it is not proposed to resume the general acceptance of new applications pending a decision as to alternative arrangements for carrying out the schemes.  In making that decision due consideration will be given to the desirability of making accommodation roads suitable for present day farm traffic, but competing demands on the Exchequer for other important services must also be taken into account.</P>

      <P>I am aware that a number of houses in Dublin which have <Col N="28" /> been demolished were previously in residential occupation and were suitable, or capable of being made suitable, for continuation of such use. Some of the houses are being replaced by alternative residential accommodation, such as flats while others are being replaced by commercial developments such as shops or office accommodation.

      <P>As indicated in my reply to a question by the Deputy on 1st March last, I have been examining the position.  I am considering an amendment of the Regulations under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, to bring the demolition of certain categories of buildings including houses under control.

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he will explain the full circumstances which governed his decision to give planning permission to a firm (name supplied) to erect a petrol filling and service station at Ballymakenny Road, Drogheda, in a residential area beside a school for mentally handicapped children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Drogheda planning authority decided on the 26th January, 1965, to grant outline permission for the construction of a petrol filling and service station and fuel depot on the site in question.  No appeal was made to me so the effect of the decision was to determine that the site could be used for the purpose proposed, subject only to satisfactory detailed plans for the station being prepared and approved.</P>
      <P>Detailed plans were lodged by the developers and on 9th June, 1965, the planning authority decided to grant approval thereto.  Appeals were made to me against this decision.  The corporation by resolution decided on 5th January, 1966, to revoke the approval granted on 9th June, 1965, to the detailed plans for the station.  The developers then appealed to me against the revocation.  Having considered the views of the objectors, the corporation and the developers, and the reports of the two oral hearings which had been held, I decided that adequate planning reasons did not exist for disapproving the detailed plans for the proposed development.  Accordingly, I made an order on 16th September, 1966, granting permission for the development, subject to conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware that Drogheda Corporation, including members of his Party, unanimously decided this was not a suitable development in this area?  Is he not aware that in addition to a scheme of new tenant purchase houses, there is <Col N="33" /> a school for mentally defective children beside the proposed site and does he not agree it was a shocking decision on his part to allow a petrol filling station to be set up in the middle of this area, with consequential danger to children from the housing scheme as well as from the school?  Is there not a danger that we shall have a second Aberfan if something goes wrong in the depot and does he not agree that he decided against giving permission, that he in fact had an order written to that effect which was subsequently revoked by him?  In the circumstances, will he not agree he should have a second look at this matter?</P>

The order made, with conditions attached, removes what was a prime objection to this development, the inclusion in the overall development of the site of provision for a fuel storage depot.  The order and conditions thereto on appeal exclude the use of the site for a fuel storage depot.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister think it is in order to allow the erection of a petrol filling station which must of necessity contain storage facilities for fuel if the filling station is to continue?  Is it not a shocking thing to grant permission for this sort of development in the area described by me?  Does the Minister not know that eventually, if he persists in his decision, there is bound to be sworn inquiry called for?  I hope that inquiry will be carried out and I can assure the Minister there will be some red faces as a result.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Gaeltacht (Mr. Faulkner) (for the Minister for Lands)</NameTxt>
      <P>Replies to the various parts of the question are as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  Apart from substantial areas of turbary and inferior quality land, the area of arable land on hands of the Land Commission in County Galway at present is 4,900 acres approximately;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  it is not the practice to keep a numerical record of applications for land.  Indeed, in itself, such a record might not accurately reflect the number of really qualified claimants inasmuch as all eligible persons within the <Col N="42" /> prescribed distance of acquired lands&mdash; irrespective of whether they have lodged a formal application or not&mdash; are automatically considered by the Land Commission for allotments;</P>
    <P>(c)  and (d) while every effort is being made to dispose of acquired lands with the minimum delay, it is not feasible to indicate precisely the date on which any particular property will be allocated; this depends on such factors as the extent to which rearrangement and enlargement of uneconomic holdings are involved, whether improvement works are necessary before the lands can be allotted and other considerations. However, the necessary local inquiries preliminary to allotment are being pushed forward as rapidly as circumstances permit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to repeat two paragraphs in relation to electricity in <Col N="72" /> order that Deputies may have a full comprehension of the position.</P>
      <P>The demand for electricity continues to increase.  During the year 1965-66 the total output at 3,546 million units was nearly 10 per cent higher than in the previous year.  The rate of growth in demand for electricity reflects the progress in the economic development of the country and the improvements in the living standards of our people, but some portion of the increase was inflationary in character. The peak demand on the ESB last winter was 815 mw; the previous winter's peak was 755 mw.  Generation from native sources in 1965-66 was almost 56 per cent of total output.</P>
      <P>The Board's long term programme of generating plant is related to an average annual increase in demand of nine per cent as envisaged in the Second Programme for Economic Expansion and which compares with the European average increase rate of about seven per cent.  Between now and 1970 the Board's plans provide for two new oil fired stations, each having two 60 mw units, at Great Island, County Wexford, and Tarbert, County Kerry. In 1970-71 the first of two 120 mw sets will be commissioned at the new Pigeon House &ldquo;B&rdquo; station and the second will be commissioned in the following year.  The implementation of these plans, together with 100 mw already commissioned since 31st March, will bring the Board's total installed capacity to 1,649.5 mw by 1971-72, as compared with 1,069.5 mw at 31st March, 1966.</P>
      <P>The Board has again had to incur substantial expenditure on the strengthening of the distribution system to meet increasing local peak loads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been some slowing down in the post-development work on rural electrification due to the need to augment and strengthen the network supplying existing customers and to the need to conserve capital finance.  Nevertheless, almost 10,000 new rural customers were connected during the year bringing the total to 321,000.  This represents 83.5 per cent of rural premises. The amount voted this year for repayment of the subsidy advanced <Col N="73" /> from the Central Fund for rural electrification is £627,700.</P>
    <P>Heavy rainfall during 1965-66 resulted in greatly increased output from the hydro-electric stations.  This, in conjunction with increased production from oil stations, led to a reduction in fuel costs and helped the Board to finish the year with a modest surplus of £243,000 on the profit and loss account.  Had normal weather conditions prevailed in 1965-66 the Board estimates that, instead of a surplus, the accounts would have shown a deficit of £800,000.  As Deputies are aware, costs of material and labour are mounting and because of these the Board has found that an increase in charges is necessary to enable it to fulfil its statutory obligation to balance its accounts.  In the circumstances, the Board applied to the Minister for Industry and Commerce under the Prices Acts for permission to increase prices by 7 per cent.  That Minister decided to establish a Prices Advisory Body under the Prices Acts, 1958 and 1965 to conduct a public inquiry into the proposed increases and in the meantime has permitted the ESB to bring the increase into force provisionally on the understanding that the new tariff rates will be subject to review if, on considering the report of the Prices Advisory Body, he decides that the increases were not justified.</P>
    <P>The Electricity (Supply) (Amendment) Act, 1965, raised to £225 million the borrowing powers of the ESB for general purposes.  The total amount to be invested in rural electrification was raised from £37 million to £42 million.  The total fixed capital invested by the Board at 31st March, 1966 was in the region of £165 million of which £38 million was in rural electrification. It is worthy of note that the ESB is to a great extent self-financing.  The self financing ratio for 1965-66 was 44 per cent.</P>
    <P>The ESB had a stock issue on 23rd February, 1966, for £6 million which was fully subscribed on the same day.</P>
    <P>The report of the joint committee, which the Minister of Commerce for Northern Ireland and I set up in March, 1965, to investigate the possibilities of co-operation between the <Col N="74" /> two electricity systems, was recently published.  The substance of the report is that interconnection of the electricity supply in the two areas is technically possible and economically desirable. In the early years of interconnection, the net saving on generating capacity would be £200,600 a year and it is estimated that there would be additional savings of £164,000 a year from the use of larger generating sets earlier than would otherwise be possible.</P>
    <P>The two Governments have invited the electricity undertakings on both sides of the Border to work out in detail how the technical and commercial recommendations in the report can be implemented.  When this has been done, the Northern Minister of Commerce and I will consider the resulting proposals.  I may say that I consider the report an excellent one and I would like to thank publicly Sir Josiah Eccles, the Chairman, and the members of the Committee for the expeditious manner in which they discharged their task.  The report reflects credit on them and it seems to me that many benefits could result from its implementation.</P>
    <P>There has been no significant development in the nuclear energy field from the point of view of the ESB.</P>
    <P>Matters concerning industrial relations in the ESB now come within the purview of the recently established Department of Labour.  As Deputies are aware, the Minister for Labour has informed the Irish Congress of Trade Unions that he is prepared to initiate discussions with the unions and the ESB on negotiating machinery whose effect will be to end the possibility of major strikes.</P>

      <P>Following the establishment of the Department of Labour I have been in touch with the Minister for Labour regarding labour relations in the ESB and I have made reference to the multiplicity of unions within the ESB and have pointed out that the Statutory Tribunals not only divide <Col N="75" /> the ESB staff into two groups, a practice which will tend to be more and more outdated, but are a cause of prolonged unrest since frequently their decisions on major questions of wages and salaries are not accepted.  As a result, appeals have been made in the Labour Court culminating in references back to the Tribunal.  In the new Trade Union Bill it is proposed to abolish the Tribunals, leaving the ESB to set up conciliation Courts for purely internal wage conditions negotiations. The proposal, with others in the Bill, is not final and has now been referred by the Minister for Labour to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.</P>
      <P>During the fitters' strike a number of Deputies without further inquiry implied that the Board of the ESB was showing a restrictive and&mdash;as stated by one Deputy&mdash;an arrogant attitude to the staff.  I have informed the Minister for Labour that remuneration paid to the engineering and allied staff, to the fitters and secretarial staffs as of June 1966 was in advance of remuneration in the British Electricity Authority.</P>
      <P>I would again remind Deputies that some time ago I asked the Board of the ESB to consider negotiations leading to some form of arbitration procedure which could eliminate the strike weapon.  There was no response at that time.  The Minister for Labour has now this matter under his general aegis.</P>
      <P>With reference to the allegation by Deputy M.P. Murphy that in West Cork the only people who can get electricity are the foreigners who are building houses because they can afford to pay the capital cost, the ESB report that, during the past year, 15 applicants obtained electricity in West Cork on payment of capital contributions. Of these three were Irish nationals and the remaining 12 were believed to be British.  During the same period the Board connected 13 chalets in West Cork, ten at Barley Cove and three at Red Strand, Clonakilty.  The applicants were all Irish nationals.  No capital contribution was called for in the case of these chalets because the costs of making the connections were small.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="76" /> It is expected that the rural post-development scheme will be completed in West Cork within the next three years and that all applicants will be given an opportunity of obtaining supply without being required to pay capital contributions.  Any capital contributions paid will be reviewed at the end of the post-development programme and may be then refunded in part or in whole.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should advert to the question of administrative efficiency within the ESB.  The ESB turnover of activities doubles every ten years while at the same time there are peak and valley periods.  Both these factors determine the character of staff organisation.  I have naturally repeated to the Board, as a monopoly, at every meeting, the need for work study and the most modern procedures for investigating costs at every level.  The ESB have a trained team of officers whose duty it is to increase productivity and efficiency.  In the last few years they have carried out surveys into the following matters:</P>
    <P>1.  Decentralisation of the ordering function for certain standard goods.</P>
    <P>2.  Introduction of new methods of determining economic order quantities of purchases.</P>
    <P>3.  Use of computer installation in continuous inventory control.</P>
    <P>4.  Re-design of paperwork and recording procedures.</P>
    <P>It is inevitable that weather conditions must be taken into account when turf production is considered.  All production operations of Bord na Móna depend fundamentally on natural drying caused by evaporation resulting from the effects of sunshine, drying winds and high temperature during the months from April to September.</P>
    <P>Bord na Móna, with the assistance of data supplied by the Meteorological Office of my Department, have compiled an index, known as Poulter's Index, which reflects the factors of sunshine, temperature and rainfall, at Birr, County Offaly, for the months April to September for each year back to 1880. This chart shows that the six-year period which ended in 1965 was the longest sustained period of below-average <Col N="77" /> weather in these relevant respects since 1880.  The previous worst was a succession of four below-average years from 1907 to 1910.  The chart indicates that the weather in the 1965 production season was not only the worst in the experience of Bord na Móna, it was the worst in any year since 1880 with two exceptions.</P>
    <P>The favourable years have also been of significance in the Board's production programme.  The chart shows that the summer weather during the decade 1940-49 was the best in the relevant respects for any ten-year period since 1880.  This was the period during which Bord na Móna experimented with milled peat production at Lullymore and it is clear that the high yields achieved in this abnormally favourable decade influenced the assessment of probable subsequent years.  Following on the experience in the 1960s, so far the Board's production targets have been set in accordance with a lower standard of drying weather.  This reduced standard is nearer to the mean conditions indicated in the chart. Acceptance of this lower standard means a lower yield of milled peat per acre.  The Board are bringing more bog areas into production in order to offset the reduction in yield.</P>
    <P>As a result of the bad weather in 1965 the harvest was late in starting and a great deal of production was also lost all through the season.  This applies particularly to milled peat, the harvest of which, at 1,379,143 tons, was less than 50 per cent of target. Even sod turf, which is normally not so vulnerable to adverse weather conditions, was, at 717,418 tons, only 81 per cent of target.  As a result of the shortage of milled peat and the claims of the milled peat fired electricity generating stations, briquette production for the year ended 31st March, 1966, was only 251,468 tons compared with 291,000 tons in 1964-65 which itself was anything but a good year. Production of moss peat was also below target but higher than the previous year by 13 per cent.  A new factory, completed during the year, will enable output to be doubled.  Moss peat production is not so vulnerable to weather conditions, but unfortunately, it represents <Col N="78" /> only a minor part of Bord na Móna's operations.</P>
    <P>Because of the disastrous weather, the losses of Bord na Móna for the year amounted to £1.6 million after allowing for payment of interest amounting to £1,083,993.  The results for 1966 are expected to show some improvement.  The estimate of milled peat production is 1,950,000 tons or 41 per cent higher than the 1965 figure, while sod peat is also expected to show a slight increase.  However, because of unfavourable weather at the start of the season the output will still be far short of the production target for the year.</P>
    <P>The succession of bad summers has caused the Board to give serious thought to methods of milled peat production which might be less affected by adverse weather conditions.  They are experimenting with a new system which involves the harvesting of the milled peat by a process of extrusion in small sods, four sq. inches in cross section.  These will dry rapidly and will reduce losses caused by wind and moisture absorption.  There are, of course, many problems to be solved before an appraisal can be made of the working of the new system but Bord na Móna consider that the results to date are encouraging.</P>
    <P>Consumption of coal in 1965 was approximately 1.4 million tons or about 10 per cent less than the previous year. Native production declined to about 160,000 tons, compared with 227,000 tons in 1964.  The decline in production was caused mainly by the difficulty experienced by the anthracite producers in the early part of the year in disposing of their output, due to accumulated stocks and to the closure for part of the year of the Castlecomer anthracite mines.</P>
    <P>The situation in regard to anthracite changed radically in the later part of the year, however.  Demand started to exceed supply and generally, the Irish anthracite producers had no difficulty in selling their full production of graded anthracite.  Nevertheless, to help to solve the long-term marketing problems of the anthracite producers, my Department, with the agreement of the <Col N="79" /> mineowners and representatives of the coal merchants, engaged consultants to carry out a preliminary investigation into the marketing of Irish anthracite. The report is at present being examined by my Department in consultation with the mineowners and coal merchants.</P>
    <P>With regard to semi-bituminous coal, my Department, with the aid of specialist consultants, has carried out a very full investigation over the last few years, into the technical and economic possibilities of utilising the reserves of &ldquo;crow&rdquo; coal in the Arigna area for the generation of electricity.  The disappointing results of the investigation clearly rule out the practicability of asking the ESB to undertake the erection of a new station to utilise these reserves of &ldquo;crow&rdquo; coal.</P>
    <P>It must not be overlooked that the existing generating station is absorbing about 50,000 tons of Arigna coal a year.  The average annual production in recent years has been about 65,000 tons.  In view of the disappointing outcome of the investigation, it would appear that the only way to improve the position of the Arigna mines would be to increase sales to consumers other than the ESB.  If sales to other consumers were to amount to even half the total sales to the ESB, a good level of regular employment could be maintained at the Arigna mines.</P>
    <P>A year ago, I set up a temporary committee to advise on the composition and function of a Nuclear Energy Board.  The committee have since reported to me.  The report is clearly the result of careful study of all aspects of the question and I am having it examined at present.  As the Deputies are aware, the United States authorities have brought to this country the very informative &ldquo;Atoms in Action&rdquo; Exhibition and I am confident that the House will wish to join with me in expressing thanks to the United States authorities.</P>
    <P>Total consumption of primary energy in terms of coal equivalent in 1966, is expected to be in the region of 7 million tons representing an increase of some 20 per cent in the past five years.  About one-third of our <Col N="80" /> energy requirements are supplied from native sources&mdash;turf, hydro power and native coal.  As we have virtually reached the limit of exploitation of our native energy sources, imported fuels&mdash; mainly oil&mdash;will supply a gradually increasing proportion of our growing energy needs in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>My Department operates a scheme which provides for payment of half the cost of fuel efficiency surveys carried out in Irish factories and hotels.  Considerable savings in costs of up to 20 per cent have been achieved especially by heavy fuel consumers, by improving the operation of their fuel consuming plant.  The object of the scheme is to encourage consumers to obtain expert advice on the efficient use of fuel which would benefit not only the firms concerned but also the national economy.  Technical courses for boiler operators are provided.  The number of grants sanctioned for such surveys up to the end of March, 1966 was 81, costing a total of £19,427.</P>
    <P>Before closing, I would refer Deputies to the long and detailed statements I have made in previous debates on the position of Ministers and the Oireachtas in regard to the State companies.  A few, and only a few, Deputies continually question the legislative enactments which govern the Ceann Comhairle's decisions in refusing to allow questions relating to day-to-day administration of State companies.  I will give one hypothetical example.  If questions were allowed on the fares charged by CIE, either for particular special trains or on special excursions, there would be no limit to the extension of such demands, accompanied by local and undesirable pressures of every kind.</P>
    <P>I have discussions with CIE on rail fare trends on a general basis.  I have criticised the management for not considering at an earlier date family fares. I have pressed for experiments in reduced fares in the off-peak season. I have made known any constructive criticism offered in the Dáil during debates.</P>
    <P>CIE have greatly increased the number of special trains carrying schoolchildren and trains hired by <Col N="81" /> organisations.  They have extended the general cheap week-end special excursion fares.</P>
    <P>I do refer to CIE individual criticism of their fare structure.  If there is not a reasonable explanation which would cover not one individual case but every application of a similar case I would ask for reconsideration.  CIE, as with other State companies, must be permitted to operate as a commercial company.</P>
    <P>The number of services run for purely social reasons indicates that CIE are alive to their general responsibilities for transport provision.</P>
    <P>The same observations apply to the other State companies.  This debate can, I hope, result in my referring to the companies, constructive criticisms of all kinds for consideration and this annual opportunity is useful and far better than deluges of questions of these companies, apart from the fact that the companies would certainly become inefficient and costly to the taxpayer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I formally move:</P>
      <P>That the Vote be referred back for reconsideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Each year when the Minister brings in his Estimate, he reminds me of an accountant bringing in a balance sheet at the end of the year.  He gives facts and figures but we have no way of investigating: we must take them as they are.  It is only when one brings a balance sheet to the inspector of taxes that he begins to find fault and flaws in it.  We have no way of querying the figures given by the Minister for the various companies for which he is responsible.  He told us at the very end of his speech that we should not come here and ask questions on the day to day management of the various companies for which he is responsible.  If he has no function in the day to day working of these companies, then it is time that some Minister got such power and it should be sought from the Oireachtas.  There should be power for Ministers to give directions to these companies for <Col N="82" /> which the Oireachtas provides funds and grants-in-aid.  It is time, if we decide that legislation is necessary, that it should be introduced.</P>
    <P>While we have no opportunity of querying the Minister's figures, others sometimes do.  Quite recently I read in one of the newspapers a letter querying Bord Fáilte on the breakdown of the £78.2 million income from tourism last year.  That was an open letter to the Board published in the Press but there has been no reply from the Board.  So far as 1965 is concerned, we were told that £78.2 million was the income.  We can break it down provided we have time.  If we go back to the Trade Journal, we find what the £78.2 million consists of.  A considerable amount of it comes from day trippers from Northern Ireland and day trippers via Northern Ireland.  Then we have visitors coming here to visit their own relatives who cannot be counted as tourists attracted by the money which the Oireachtas has voted for the attraction of tourists.  We have others who are merely birds of passage to and from other parts of Europe.  The Trade Journal breaks it down and states that the real tourist income for 1965 was £27.6 million and not £78.2 million as stated by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Have we ever considered what value we get for this money?  Far too much is spent on the entertainment of foreign tourist agents and on entertaining our own people when they go abroad promoting tourism.  Recently we had tourist agents from Sweden, Denmark and, above all places, Switzerland, brought on a conducted tour of this country, and entertained lavishly for three or four days.  A friend of mine had an opportunity of interviewing one of them last month and he asked: &ldquo;What do you think of Ireland?&rdquo; The answer was: &ldquo;As far as we are concerned, this is a gimmick.  For the past three or four years we have been invited to come and see your country. We have been putting it off, but, as this is a slack period, we are able to partake of your hospitality.&rdquo; My friend asked: &ldquo;Do you think there is any future for Irish tourism in your country of <Col N="83" /> Switzerland?&rdquo; He said: &ldquo;Are you mad?  In Switzerland, we have the very same climate as you have.&rdquo; The Dane butted in and said: &ldquo;We are in the same position.  Our tourists are now seeking sunshine.  They are not seeking the type of coastal resorts you have in Ireland and which we have ourselves.&rdquo; These people have been entertained, and entertained lavishly, here.</P>
    <P>Our Bord Fáilte representatives are going abroad to Hong Kong, New York, and even as far as the west coast of America.  What are they offering to potential tourists?  Is it a gimmick like Bunratty Castle?  I do not decry what is being done there, but it is merely a gimmick.  I have said here on many occasions on this Estimate that we have been looking west for far too long and not looking east half enough.  If we are to increase tourism, it is from the middle class of England and the Six Counties we must procure our tourists, not from the Americans.  We welcome them, but the American, other than the Irish-American, coming here to spend a holiday drops off to see a gimmick such as Bunratty or to see Killarney, and we are spending far too much money in trying to attract these people.  I often think we are merely trying to create an image for our civil servants or quasi-civil servants whom we send abroad on these trips.</P>
    <P>We are told that in 1965 the tourist industry brought in £78.2 million.  If we compare prices in 1965 with 1960 prices, we find it is £44 million.  It is price increases that have increased our returns from tourism, not the numbers of tourists and the money spent by them in the country.  It is only an imaginary inflation in the tourist industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister <Col N="84" /> said tourism brought in £78 million in 1965.  I ask him to compare the costs with those of 1962, and he will find the true increase in tourism.  That is the only way it can be done.  All this is codology and nothing else.  The Minister has told us Bord Fáilte has spent a considerable amount in promoting tourism.  Does he remember the amount that was spent in promoting An Tostal and what became of it? I remember the Taoiseach, then Minister for Industry and Commerce, coming in here and speaking at length on the advantages to be gained from the promotion of An Tostal.  The only money I ever saw spent on An Tostal was the money which the State spent in entertaining officials who came in here on the various festive occasions.</P>
      <P>An Tostal is now gone and forgotten, but we have other gimmicks coming up, particularly the sea angling festival.  I am a great believer in sea angling festivals.  These are functions which should be held to encourage anglers to come to our country to fish, but I do not believe in annual angling competitions on which State money is being spent or in which money is given by sponsors which becomes free from income tax.  In a town like Westport or Killybegs, this deep sea angling festival extends over two or three week-ends, but do we see any anglers coming in during the remainder of the year?  Is any effort made to cater for the angler who comes here in what I might call the off-festival time?  None whatever. This spending of money is merely a gimmick and a cheap way of promoting Ministerial propaganda on the western seaboard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This year the money for seaside resort development is one of the figures being cut back.  I wonder why. About two years ago, the Minister came to Bundoran on another festive occasion and announced that the Government were to spend £100,000 on the development of that magnificent seaside resort.  That was not the first occasion that had been promised.  It has been promised since 1957.  On every occasion on which there is a <Col N="85" /> general election, a Presidential election or a local election, Bundoran is told what money is to be spent on it. The only money spent on Bundoran for the past 15 years was the money given by the inter-Party Government for the development of the seafront there.  Not one penny has been spent since.</P>
    <P>As I said, two years ago, the Minister announced at a dinner of the Fianna Fáil Party in Bundoran that they were about to spend £100,000.  I remember exactly two years ago attending a meeting of the urban council and representatives of Bord Fáilte.  I was accompanied by two other Deputies from the constituency and we were there told that before 1st February the following year work on the development of Bundoran would commence, but not a thing has been done since.  Bord Fáilte acquired the railway station property from CIE on behalf of the Bundoran Urban District Council.  Plans were prepared by Bord Fáilte for the development of a site as a car park.  Bundoran Urban Council was to contribute one-fifth of the cost. The plans were sanctioned by the Department of Local Government for more than two years.  There were visits by Department officials and deputations from the Bundoran Urban Council.  The Bundoran Council were eventually informed this year by the Department that it was not the function of Bundoran Urban Council to provide a car park in Bundoran.  This property had been acquired by Bord Fáilte from CIE.  It was merely transferring money from one page to another.  This site in the centre of the town is now an eyesore.  The Minister and Bord Fáilte now have a monument in this derelict site.</P>
    <P>In relation to seafront development at Bundoran, plans were prepared, negotiations took place and in one case negotiations for the acquisition of a site went on for over five years.  The properties required for development have not so far been acquired although the actual sale price has been agreed and all the owners concerned are willing to sell.  Not one penny was spent until prior to the general election in 1965 when a prominent Fianna Fáil supporter was paid for one small plot. <Col N="86" /> Nobody can deny this.  I have visited Bord Fáilte many times but not a thing has been done about it.</P>
    <P>Again, prior to the Presidential election some short time ago, it was announced that deposits on the properties had been paid into the urban council offices by Bord Fáilte. Not one penny by way of deposit has been paid and not one penny will be paid until next summer when we have the local elections, if we have not a general election before then.</P>
    <P>It was suggested that there should be public toilets erected in Bundoran and there is a crying need for them in the town.  Plans were prepared by Bord Fáilte.  The work was to be carried out by the urban council by way of local government loan.  There were three years of negotiations and meetings.  For three years in succession, after the plans had been approved by the Department of Local Government, Bundoran Urban Council each year, out of the rates, made funds available to meet the loan charges but the loan has not yet been approved by the Department.</P>
    <P>I am referring to Bundoran because I have not an opportunity of knowing the unfulfilled promises made to other towns.  There was a West End scheme for Bundoran.  There was to be a new promenade and car park.  A grant from Donegal County Council was sanctioned of £7,500 from the Road Fund and there was a promised grant of £16,000 from Bord Fáilte on condition that other moneys would be forthcoming. The &ldquo;other moneys&rdquo; included a loan to be raised by Bundoran Urban District Council but that loan has not been sanctioned and there has been no progress for two years.</P>
    <P>Year after year we who vote money for the development of seaside and tourist resorts know the frustration of all this.  We know the frustration in procuring loans and additional money from the rates.  But, having incurred all this expense, we find that Bord Fáilte do nothing.  I do not know if any other Deputy has had the experience of approaching the Board seeking accommodation for the repair and renovation of hotel premises.  I know how frustrating it is and how often <Col N="87" /> one must visit Mount Street before a grant is sanctioned.  However, I do know of a case quite recently where a company were agreeable and willing to promote a 20 bedroom hotel in Donegal.  They were advised, and rightly so, that unless they were going into the luxury class they would not get the priority to which they were entitled and, eventually, a grant of £90,000 has been sanctioned on the basis of a local contribution of £20,000 to £24,000.  That is the sort of frustration that we all know as far as Bord Fáilte is concerned.</P>
    <P>The luxury hotels of Bord Fáilte are open for three or four months of the summer.  I wonder if the Minister or the Board have ever considered what is the greatest tourist attraction in this country.  After the war years it was the cost of living&mdash;the cost of holiday luxuries such as drink and cigarettes. How do we compare today with other countries in so far as the cost of these commodities is concerned?  We all know that the gimmick which brings tourists to the Channel Islands is the cheap rate of customs duty on cigarettes and tobacco.  There is very little more sunshine there than there is in the southern parts of this country.  We have priced ourselves out of the tourist trade by the deliberate action of the Government.  We are now trying to promote inland angling, whereas the Minister knows as well as I do that sea trout fishing, salmon and grilse fishing are gimmicks, that we have only one type of angling, namely, coarse fishing, and that we are not making the efforts which we should make to advertise it. If we want to attract the angler from the Continent, we must foster and encourage the coarse fishing industry.</P>
    <P>I have discussed this matter with Austrians recently who told me that when they were asked to come here and fish for sea trout and grilse, the first thing they did was to inquire the number of fish that had been killed.  Remember, our rivers are very short and remain in spate for a very short time. The killing of grilse and salmon is a gimmick in so far as the tourist industry is concerned and we need never try to advertise it.  If we could <Col N="88" /> concentrate on the magnificent coarse fishing lakes we have and if we could ensure that proper accommodation, whether by way of farmhouse, guesthouse or hotel, is provided, we would do much better in attracting anglers to the country.</P>
    <P>Only last night, a friend of mine who is President of the Irish Hotels Federation, Mr. Barry McDonnell, told Bord Fáilte in Dublin that they had overdeveloped the hotel industry.  I do not agree with Mr. McDonnell.  Certainly, it is overdeveloped in the city of Dublin.  If we had scattered throughout the country some of the luxury hotels which have been built here, the luxury hotels which we have throughout the country would very soon bring down their prices.  It is only in the city of Dublin that we have overcatered for these hotels.  When we find in County Donegal merely one hotel in one seaside resort, one hotel in one tourist attraction area it is time to inquire into the costings and see if we are really pricing ourselves out of the tourist trade.</P>
    <P>It is a most peculiar thing that, this year, the price of foodstuffs in hotels has not come down by one per cent whereas everybody knows, and any tourist knows, that the main outlay in the purchase of foodstuffs is in respect of beef, mutton and lamb.  We know that the price of beef cattle has fallen by a minimum of £20 per head.  Has the steak fallen by one-twentieth of a halfpenny?  No.  What have Bord Fáilte done to inquire into that?  It is time the Minister took these matters into account.  If he wishes to attract tourists to this country, he must be more realistic with regard to these matters.</P>
    <P>The Minister has told us that the only branch of CIE which loses money at the moment is the railways.  I am rather surprised to hear that, because we have so few railways left.  I thought the Minister had closed not only the uneconomic lines but also the economic lines and that we had a very short rail mileage left.  Has the Minister ever inquired why railways lose money such as CIE have suggested they do?  I remember one day standing at Enfield and seeing three vehicles <Col N="89" /> moving west, three vehicles competing with each other, all the property of one concern, CIE.  There was a barge passing through on the canal.  There were a bus and a lorry passing.  At the same time, there was the iron horse, the railway, running parallel. The three branches of CIE were competing against one another.  How could the system possibly pay?</P>
    <P>It is well known as a fact that when CIE wish to close any branch of the railway, they put on a bus and lorries and show a loss on the railway and then make a case for the closing of the railway.</P>
    <P>Unlike, possibly, many Deputies, I should like to pay tribute to Dr. Andrews.  I knew Dr. Andrews very well and I knew how sincere he was in endeavouring to make a go of CIE, but he never got a chance.  That is my candid opinion.  I am only afraid that his successor, Mr. T.P. Hogan, will find himself in the same position.  Once we decide to form a semi-State company, the first people we look for to run it are ex-civil servants or serving civil servants.  We never think of looking for a businessman.  If we looked less towards the civil servant and more towards the businessman or the man with business training, we would have less false economy so far as these matters are concerned.</P>
    <P>I remember endeavouring to assist the Minister two years ago when I suggested to him here that if he were serious about making the express bus service a paying concern, the first thing he should do was to ensure that proper buses were put on these long routes, for instance, the route from Donegal to Dublin.  I was assured by the Minister that no more luxurious bus could be put on than the one then running, which was nothing more than a bone-shaker.  I appealed that during the winter months the CIE tourist buses when not in use should be put on these routes.  Still nothing was done.  The result is that these long distance services are scarcely economic. People had to find alternative transport.  It is only now, when CIE find that alternative transport is being provided by others, they have done <Col N="90" /> what I asked them to do two years ago and put on a proper semi-luxury bus which encourages people to travel by it.  But they are a little late.  If this had been done long ago, people who made alternative arrangements possibly would not have continued to use such arrangements.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether I should refer at this particular time to the manner in which CIE have treated their ex-employees. Sometimes when we talk here about the subsidy the State pays towards CIE, I wonder do we get the true figures?  Take prior to the introduction of the contributory pension.  If an ex-CIE official was laid off at the age of 65 he was given a small sum of superannuation.  The maximum was £4 13s 9d and the minimum £3 2s 6d. He was told when laid off: &ldquo;We are laying you off because you are over 65. We are giving you a small superannuation but that does not prevent you going to the labour exchange where you can prove and sign a document you are available for work, that you are fit for work and that you are genuinely seeking work.&rdquo; How can the Minister reconcile the fact that his Board lay off a man and then expect him to go to the labour exchange and draw unemployment assistance?  However, that was done.  No person appeared to take any objection to it. These men were subsidised by the State by way of unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>When these men reached the age of 70 they became entitled to what was known in those days as a non-contributory old age pension.  But that non-contributory old age pension was based on a means test.  The Minister, again to draw from the State instead of drawing from CIE funds, reduced the superannuation to enable the ex-employee to qualify for the maximum amount of non-contributory old age pension.  Then we had the contributory pension reduced at a later date.  When an ex-employee became entitled to superannuation at 65 he had to sign an undertaking that he would agree to take a lesser sum when he reached 70 than he got at 65.  That was because at the age of 70 he also became entitled to a contributory pension, to which he <Col N="91" /> contributed, but as there was no means test then the Minister sought this method of reducing the superannuation and at the same time making the State pay the balance by way of contributory old age pension.  In that way we are again from State funds subsidising the superannuation of CIE officials.  I do not think that is fair to the officials or to the State, because we are not getting a true picture of the position as it happened.</P>
    <P>In 1965 the Government purchased the B &amp; I Company.  Actually, we took it over on 1st January, 1965.  In the year before, the B &amp; I made a profit of £57,184.  After running it for 12 months up to 31st December, 1965, we showed a loss of £87,752, despite the fact that in between the rates were increased by, I think, as much as seven to ten per cent.  Simply because one of our subsidiary bodies took it over, we lost £87,000 as compared with a gain of £57,000 in the year before.</P>
    <P>Then we have Irish Shipping.  The Minister tells us the only reason we should have Irish Shipping is to provide for times of emergency.  That statement I would agree with in 1938 or 1939.  But surely, with hovercraft, aircraft and all the alternative means of transport, we are not justified in keeping Irish Shipping for that reason and that reason only&mdash;to provide for the case of an emergency?  Irish Shipping could be made and should be made an economic concern.  Our ships could be much better employed than they are today.  I note that we purchased two large tankers and sold them at a loss. I do not think that is good business.  It is something the Minister should look into and, if necessary, seek legislation to amend.</P>
    <P>I do not know what to say about Bord na Móna at all.  Bord na Móna was established not only for the purpose of supplying fuel to State subsidised bodies such as CIE and the ESB but for other reasons.  In my own county, for instance, we could use a considerable amount of turf from Bord na Móna at Kilraine near Killybegs. We could give much more employment in a county where there is certainly under-employment.  We have a considerable <Col N="92" /> number of people seeking employment with Bord na Móna, but we are not able to provide the turf.  I do not know what is wrong.  Bord na Móna will not employ the men.  If they did, they would have more turf.</P>
    <P>We have now reached the stage that we have a quota for turf in County Donegal.  We were encouraged at one time to buy machine-won turf. Some of us switched over from handwon to machine-won turf.  We now find it is on a quota basis.  The same thing applies to briquettes.  I know one vendor of briquettes who had a quota of 600 tons per year.  This year he got 300 tons.  We can make allowances for bad weather.  If the weather is bad, if we have rain, then we need not depend on home fuels for our electricity.  So long as we have a fairly high standard of water in the rivers and lakes, surely we should have sufficient turf to supply the demands of Bord na Móna throughout the State: it should not be very much.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay a compliment to Aer Lingus and to Aer Rianta for the manner in which they carry out their services.  The efficient manner in which they operate and the courtesy they show to the public not only in this country but abroad are an example to all State bodies.  Great credit is due to them and I should like to take this opportunity of paying tribute to them.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the package holiday.  The package holiday will help Aer Lingus.  It will help the tourist trade.  It will help Irish Shipping. It is a matter to which more attention should be given.  I do not think, in catering for the all-in package holiday, that we should confine it to the hotel.  We should have the alternative of a holiday in a small farmhouse, a guesthouse at the seaside, a guesthouse inland where coarse fishing is available or a hotel.  If we are to do that, we must speed up the grants to these prospective guesthouse keepers.  I know a number of people who have applied to Bord Fáilte and to various Departments in respect of amenities to enable them to become <Col N="93" /> guesthouse proprietors and hoteliers, particularly during the off-season, during the coarse fishing season, and at other times, but the frustration experienced in regard to grants has held them up considerably.</P>
    <P>May I conclude by suggesting to the Minister that the leaflets and particularly the pictures which Bord Fáilte paint of this country are completely false?  There is nothing more frustrating than to see a beautiful postcard of a beautiful strand on the west coast of Ireland with the sun shining and everybody bathing.  We have not that attraction: nature has not given it to us.  However, we have many other attractions which, if known to the prospective tourist, would be equally attractive to him.  If we build up our tourist trade not for sun worshippers but for people who will come here for other reasons and who will be welcome, they will go home satisfied and recommend their friends to come here also.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. T. O'Donnell Mr. T. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very large Estimate covering many different fields but I suppose the best approach for any Deputy is perhaps to concentrate on those aspects of the Estimate in which he is particularly interested. I propose, therefore, to start midway in the Minister's speech and to say a few words about the Shannon Free Airport Development Company and Shannon Airport.  The Shannon Industrial Estate which was established some years ago has made reasonably good progress.  In the Minister's brief, I read that on 31st March, 1966, there were 16 manufacturing and 12 commercial firms operating there, employing a total of 3,163 people, of whom 1,699 were men.  I also note that five new industries were established during 1965-66 and that two firms ceased operations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To me, however&mdash;apart from the actual statistical information&mdash;the most significant information in the Minister's speech relating to the Shannon Free Airport Development Company&mdash; SFADCO&mdash;is that the Minister said he had given certain instructions to the <Col N="94" /> company on future development.  He says: &ldquo;I have told the Board of SFADCO that the general policy it should pursue should be as follows...&rdquo; and he mentions four main points.  The first point is that they should endeavour to seek industries and services likely to increase airfreight at Shannon.  Now, I have referred on every Estimate in recent years to the question of the success that has been achieved by the Shannon Industrial Estate in developing airfreight traffic at the airport.</P>
    <P>The Minister will agree that, when the Industrial Estate was established, one of its main objectives was to generate airfreight traffic to counteract what then seemed to be a permanent feature, namely, a continuous decline in passenger traffic at the airport.  When the Industrial Estate was established to generate airfreight traffic, among other things, the position in the early years and up to quite recently was that it was not remarkably successful in doing so.  I am glad to note that the Minister has now issued special instructions. Of course, I realise that surface traffic, and particularly containerised traffic, is being utilised in a very considerable way by some of the companies at the airport and that it is often very great competition to airfreight companies.  It is probably cheaper in the long run and the question of transport costs is a very important item with many of these industries at Shannon.</P>
    <P>I have often said here that one criterion in selecting an industry to operate at Shannon should be the suitability of its products for transport by air.  An industry in the Industrial Estate producing heavy goods, machinery and otherwise, might not, by reason of weight, volume and value, be suitable for transport by air.  On the other hand, industries such as the recently established synthetic diamond processing industry which manufacture products of very high value in very small amounts are ideally suited to air transport.  I would now go so far as to say that it should be laid down as a pre-condition for any industrialist contemplating establishing a factory at Shannon that certain guarantees <Col N="95" /> should be given that all or part of their products would be exported by air.</P>
    <P>I realise of course, as most people do, that airfreight is still in the transition stage and that the aircraft manufacturing company are doing considerable research into the development of aircraft suited to air transport. Hire charges, I understand, have been reduced in recent times and it has been established now that for certain types of products air transport can compare very favourably with surface transport.  I do hope, now that the Minister has issued this directive to the Shannon Free Airport Development Company, that we will see in the future the Shannon Industrial Estate making a far greater contribution to the generation of airfreight traffic.</P>
    <P>The second point in the Minister's advice to the company is that they should plan ahead for a total population of 6,000 persons and should provide the necessary ancillary services. That is a logical development following the development of an industrial estate.  We have to provide the houses and community services if it is agreed that an industrial estate is to be established.  It has been established and is an accomplished fact now. Therefore, it is logical that the community services, many of which have been provided, such as schools, and so on, must also be provided.  I am interested in the figure of 6,000 persons.  I presume the Minister has based this figure on information available to him following studies by experts at Shannon and in his Department.  I would be very interested to know how he has arrived at this figure of 6,000 people in the community at Shannon, whether this indicates that the Shannon Industrial Estate has now reached the limit of its development and whether any further industries are to be established there.</P>
    <P>On that point, I have noticed also that one of the firms at Shannon, which have been operating very successfully has now opened, or hopes to open, another plant in the west of Ireland, at Tuam.  This has raised <Col N="96" /> many questions.  One begins to wonder why is it necessary for this industry to have an auxiliary plant, or a subsidiary firm 100 miles away from the parent plant.  Surely from the point of view of economy, trained workers in the various skills and so on, it would be more logical and more economic to have any expansion of the existing industry taking place where the industries already are.  Why is it necessary? Is it because there is a scarcity of labour; is it because of difficulty in transporting workers long journeys, and so on?</P>
    <P>On that point also I have a grouse in this respect.  I am not at all happy about the movement of the Shannon Development Company in extending its development, not merely in industry but also in tourism, away up the west of Ireland.  I have explained to this House on many occasions, and it is my conviction, and the more I see things, the more convinced I am becoming, that there is now a very strong case for having Limerick city and Ennis brought in under the one development authority with Shannon.  It is a logical thing now and I certainly am not at all in agreement with this idea of firms already existing having to move a hundred miles away to expand.</P>
    <P>The third directive in the Minister's speech to the Shannon Development Company is that they should maintain a satisfactory proportion of male employees, while recognising that employment for females is an extremely important factor in rural economies. One of the complaints levelled at the Shannon Industrial Estate is that there is a large proportion of female employment there.  The position is not, in fact, quite so bad as people seem to think because, roughly on the figures the Minister has given for 31st March, 1966, an even balance exists as between male and female employees in the Industrial Estate.</P>
    <P>I represent an area which is vitally interested in the Shannon Industrial Estate by reason of the fact that perhaps 60 per cent or more of the working force at Shannon reside in Limerick city and in County Limerick.  I personally have always supported, and will continue to support, any plan <Col N="97" /> which will generate more employment at Shannon.  But, I will not support, and I certainly do not agree with, Shannon expanding by making leaps and bounds to other parts of the country.  Surely regional development is a regional thing, and the regional development embraces Limerick, Ennis and Limerick city.</P>
    <P>A further point made by the Minister is that the Shannon Development Company should co-operate with Bord Fáilte and make Shannon a gateway for tourists in Ireland.  He points out that the local Regional Tourist Board, the Shannonside, as we call it, has a very real responsibility in this matter. Tourism and in fact tourist development in the Shannon region is a tremendously important factor in so far as the continuation of Shannon air traffic is concerned.  The more tourist development that takes place in the Shannon region, and that includes the west and the south-west, the more passenger traffic there will be at the airport.</P>
    <P>I want to pay tribute, as I have done on a number of occasions, to the officials of the Shannon Development Company who are concerned with promoting tourism in this region.  They have done a colossal job.  In fact, the work of the Shannon Development Company in tourist promotion has made the job of the Shannonside Regional Tourist Organisation very simple.  The development of Bunratty Castle, whether we agree with it or not, has been a very great success. This year the company has included Dunguaire Castle linking the area up with Kinvara in County Galway.  Perhaps I am being parochially-minded in this but what I said about the Industrial Estate extending its activities far afield up the west applies here also. The Shannon Development Company seems to be concentrating on moving its development towards the west and north-west.  Of course my colleague and namesake who spoke before me will welcome that but while I have tremendous admiration for the work that has been done by the tourist officers of the development company, I suggest to the Minister that he should now issue a further directive to the <Col N="98" /> Shannon Development Company that in the field of tourist development, they should look towards the south and south-west.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>You will get four different opinions on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. T. O'Donnell Mr. T. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to point out that in Limerick city we have some very historic landmarks, notably King John's Castle.  Definite steps have not yet been taken to exploit this and develop it as a tourist attraction.  I hope that both the Shannon Development Company and the Shannonside Tourist Organisation in Limerick will go ahead with this.  I realise that local effort is necessary but I feel that a certain amount of prodding is necessary to get enthusiasm at local level.  In addition to that there are other places in County Limerick which I think should be included in the medieval tours.</P>
      <P>I am very pleased to say that Limerick County Council have recently had a survey made of a very well known and historic place, that is Lough Gur, which is not merely in my constituency but in my neighbourhood. A report has been issued within the past couple of weeks entitled <i>An Amenity and Tourism Survey of Lough Gur.</i> It was carried out by Nathaniel Lichfield and Associates under the direction of Limerick County Council. This is an excellent production.  It breaks new ground in many ways in the field of tourist development.  As far as I am aware, it is the first really scientific survey of a particular area. It has been carried out by experts using the most modern methods and techniques.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report of this survey leaves nobody in any doubt whatsoever that this place called Lough Gur has a tremendous potential as a tourist area. It is well known in the archaelogical world by reason of the fact that excavations were carried out by the late Professor Ó Ríordáin over several years.  There is a potential there for the development of angling, boating and one hundred and one other things.  All these have been dealt with in detail in this report.  I hope that the Shannon <Col N="99" /> Development Company, Bord Fáilte and the Minister will not allow this excellent report to be consigned to some locker in a back room in Baggot Street but that immediate steps will be taken along the lines recommended in it.</P>
    <P>This type of survey is one which could be carried out in many other parts of the country.  Very often a certain area will suggest itself for development. Local enthusiasm can be generated for the development of the locality, as I have experienced, but one finds that having taken steps to get the particular centre off the ground, so to speak, when professional advice is consulted, the area may or may not have the potential which local people and amateurs like myself think it has. I feel that Bord Fáilte and the Shannon Development Company and the regional development bodies will have to adopt a much more scientific approach to this question of selecting centres for development, suggesting lines of development and deciding the best type of development for a particular area.</P>
    <P>It would be remiss of me, when referring to this survey, not to pay tribute to one man who, perhaps more than any other, was responsible for having it carried out, our County Manager, Mr. O'Connor.  We are very fortunate in Limerick in having a farseeing official like him who is interested in all aspects of development.</P>
    <P>Within the context of the Shannon Development Company, I want to refer to the tourist development in the Limerick-Clare region.  It is very closely bound up with the work of the Shannon Development Company.  Tourism has played a very large part in keeping our airport viable and extending terminal traffic at the airport.  It is our desire to see this passenger traffic increased every year.  One of the ways of doing it is by attracting more tourists to the region.  I recommend to the Minister that he should suggest to the Shannon Development Company that they look towards Limerick, King John's Castle, River Shannon and Lough Gur which have a colossal potential for development.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="100" /> Two years ago I played a part in having a survey made of the stretch of the River Shannon from Limerick to O'Brien's Bridge with a view to assessing its potential for development as a centre for angling holidays.  The survey was carried out by two leading British angling experts under the direction of Bord Fáilte.  They found that the village of Castleconnell, a couple of miles up the Shannon from Limerick, was ideally suited to development as an angling centre.  Steps have been taken and brochures produced and there has been a reasonable influx up to now.  We hope that this will develop in the future.</P>
    <P>I feel that from the point of view of the Shannon Development Company's work in the field of tourist development, which, of course, has the ultimate aim of promoting greater passenger traffic to Shannon, they should concentrate on the development of King John's Castle and the angling facilities at Castleconnell and should put into effect the recommendations contained in this survey of Lough Gur.</P>
    <P>To sum up about the Shannon Development Company and its activities, the position on the whole is quite good.  Certainly the most recent annual report was the best ever and gives great grounds for hope that the future of Shannon, both as an airport and an industrial centre, is reasonably assured.  There are a number of other problems relating to the Industrial Estate and to the airport about which I could spend the next two hours talking but I shall not do so.</P>
    <P>It might be no harm to avail of the opportunity provided by this debate on the annual Estimate for Transport and Power to refer to what has become a very controversial subject, one which hits the headlines periodically but, unfortunately, has not done so for a while past.  It is the question of the granting of permission to the American airlines to utilise Dublin Airport.  This is a matter which causes grave concern, worry and anxiety in the Limerick-Clare area, and at Shannon, whenever it is mentioned. Unfortunately, every time it comes up, and when a Member of this House in <Col N="101" /> that region expresses his viewpoint on it, he is accused of playing politics.</P>
    <P>It is to be deplored that, when an announcement regarding Shannon Airport has to be made at Government level, the occasion chosen to deliver it is a meeting of the Fianna Fáil cumann in Limerick city.  Surely every Deputy in that region is entitled, and has a duty, to express his view?  If he, in conscience, feels inclined to do so or feels he has reasons for worrying about the future of the airport or any aspect of it, he is entitled to express his view.  Matters have now calmed down in this regard but we are continuously on the alert for any indication of a further move on the part of the Americans to get into Dublin.</P>
    <P>We are very concerned about this question.  We are determined to resist it by every means within our power, and we have gone into all aspects of the argument.  We try to have a commonsense viewpoint on it.  Surely, in this small country, one international airport is adequate?  Secondly, it is our conviction that if permission is granted to the American airlines to come into Dublin Airport, much of the work and a considerable amount of the expenditure on tourist development in the south-western region will have gone down the drain.  None of us wants to see that happening.</P>
    <P>There are other aspects of this problem also.  If permission is granted to the Americans to come into Dublin, it will raise very serious issues for our national airline because the question of continuation flights to the continent would then arise.  I appeal to the Minister, in the event of any renewal of the application by the Americans to come into Dublin Airport, to be as firm as he has been in the past, and to assure us that the answer will be an emphatic &ldquo;no&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The most recent move in this direction was made, when the American President asked the Civil Aeronautics Board to select one American airline to fly into Dublin.  Of course, one airline flying into Dublin will not do a whole lot of damage but we are as much worried about permission being granted to one airline as to two airlines <Col N="102" /> because, if permission is granted to, say, Airline X to come into Dublin, nobody will tell me that Airline Y will be satisfied to continue to come into Shannon.  Therefore, from the point of view of investment at Shannon Airport, investment in tourist development in the region and, last but by no means least, the fact that we are a small country, there is no ground whatsoever for granting permission to the American airlines to come into Dublin Airport.</P>
    <P>On the ground of hard economics, this would entail considerably more expenditure on the runways, etc, at Dublin Airport.  We have these facilities at Shannon Airport and Shannon enjoys an international prestige second to none.  I hope this question will not be raised any more but, if it is, I can assure the Minister that I and my colleagues, irrespective of our politics, will be up in arms and will resist any such attempt by every means in our power.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of Shannon Airport &mdash;and again I am distinguishing between the airport and the Industrial Estate&mdash;which has been a source of a considerable amount of revenue is the fact that Shannon has been chosen by a number of airlines as a training centre for familiarisation courses on new aircraft.  BEA and BOAC have been utilising the airport and, in the off season particularly this has been of immense value.  I hope this will continue and that perhaps our national airline will carry out all its training programme at Shannon in future.</P>
    <P>Quite recently an independent private company which operated an airline business at Shannon was taken over by Aer Lingus.  I refer to Shannon Repair Services, which is a servicing and maintenance outfit at Shannon. I asked the Minister by way of a question here recently if the trainee aircraft technicians at Shannon engaged by the SRS company would now come under the Aer Lingus training scheme for apprentices.  The Minister said &ldquo;no&rdquo;, as it was the intention of Aer Lingus to run this company at Shannon on an independent <Col N="103" /> basis.  My reason for asking the Minister that question was that the parents of some of the apprentices employed by SRS were not happy with the training these young men have been receiving.</P>
    <P>I urge on the Minister that he should indicate to Aer Lingus that if they intend to keep this company in operation at Shannon&mdash;and I sincerely hope they do&mdash;Aer Lingus should provide adequate work of a suitable nature in the servicing, maintenance and overhaul of aircraft.  To my knowledge, three of these young men have their leaving certificates and are anxious to secure their civil aeronautical licences in aircraft maintenance.  If these young men are not brought into the Aer Lingus training scheme, which is second to none, at least an interest should be taken in them to ensure that they receive the theoretical and practical training which will enable them to qualify as aircraft technicians.</P>
    <P>The Estimate we are dealing with deals with the period up to 31st March, 1966.  I understand that the season just past has been very satisfactory so far as Shannon is concerned. If a more aggressive approach is adopted by the people concerned with the development of Shannon, we can look forward to continued expansion in the future.</P>
    <P>I have referred to certain aspects of tourism arising from the activities of the Shannon Development Company. I want to look at this industry in a general way, but with particular reference to certain aspects of it.  The Minister said:</P>
    <P>One of the matters to which I gave particular attention on assuming responsibility for tourism was stimulation of increased local and regional effort.  Following discussions with Bord Fáilte and other tourism interests, a scheme was formulated for the establishment of eight regional tourism organisations.</P>
    <P>These companies have been in existence for a couple of years now.  They have made reasonable progress and, <Col N="104" /> so far as I am aware, all of them have justified their existence.  Again, I am speaking of one with which I am familar.  The Minister referred to the need for local effort, for community involvement, for community participation in tourist development, and to the need for local financial contributions.</P>
    <P>Looking at this regional development in the field of tourism, one thing is lacking, in my opinion.  The regional tourist companies have not paid sufficient attention to arousing local interest, generating local enthusiasm, and encouraging local contributions, financial and otherwise, in the development of particular centres.  There are not enough of what I call field or project officials.  The regional development companies operate information centres; they engage in the production of literature; and they do one hundred and one other valuable jobs.</P>
    <P>I want to get down to what I consider a very important aspect of this matter, that is, the method of selecting the centres.  I am not interested in the major resorts.  I am not interested in the development of angling centres or anything else.  I am interested in the selection of centres for development as tourist centres.  Generally the approach is that a local meeting is called and someone from Bord Fáilte or from the local regional development company is in attendance.  There is a lot of talk and discussion, and the local community are bombarded with facts, figures, statistics and practical knowledge.  The meeting ends after several resolutions have been passed.  Everyone is full of good intentions and the official returns to Bord Fáilte or whatever organisation he is attached to, and the local community are left on their own.</P>
    <P>I believe this is a vitally important factor in the further development of our tourist industry.  It is a vitally important factor from the point of view of the development of the rural areas.  I believe there is need for continuous advice, guidance and direction for at least 12 months, while a centre is being organised and developed, and while it is getting off the <Col N="105" /> ground.  At every meeting following the initial meeting, there should be a projects official, a man qualified to give technical advice on the many aspects of tourism.  I look upon this type of individual in the same light as I look on the local agricultural adviser, the horticultural adviser, the poultry instructress, or the domestic economy instructress.  If we are to develop tourism further and cater for the large market in Great Britain to which my colleague, Deputy P. O'Donnell, referred, we will have to develop these centres.  There are numerous places, many decaying towns and villages in rural Ireland, which are crying out for development as tourist centres.  The local people cannot be expected to have the technical know-how and knowledge to produce brochures for the market abroad.</P>
    <P>I would go so far as to advocate that there should be three, four or five &mdash;depending on the area&mdash;full-time field men attached to every regional tourist company, who will not be sitting behind a desk but will be out on the job, guiding and directing the local people, selecting areas and summoning meetings.  I regard this type of advisory service as absolutely essential.  Apart from the regional tourist groups, local voluntary organisations such as Muintir na Tíre and the Irish Countrywomen's Association can play a big part in tourist development work.  They cannot, however, provide the technical know-how, now that tourism is becoming a highly organised business.  I recommend strongly the appointment of these project officers who understand what the words &ldquo;community development&rdquo; mean and who would set the ball rolling and keep it in play until the final goal has been scored.</P>
    <P>There are other points in the Minister's speech relating to tourism, such as his reference to what he called a vast number of miscellaneous activities which have to be fostered if tourism is to grow and flourish.  Everybody will agree this is very definitely so.  The Minister's speech goes on to deal with examples.  The first one referred to is the growth of farmhouse and guesthouse <Col N="106" /> accommodation.  This is an integral part of the type of tourist development I have been speaking about during the past ten minutes&mdash;the development of local centres in rural areas.  The provision of adequate accommodation is a vital part of local tourist development.  This is where the technically qualified persons come into the picture.  I found to my amazement that certain guesthouses and perhaps farmhouses which may not come to the high standard required by Bord Fáilte are perfectly adequate for a certain type of tourist.  I have been advised on this by a number of people in the tourist business, particularly in relation to the large number of anglers who come here, especially the coarse fishermen. They are not interested in luxury accommodation: all they want is clean, comfortable, ordinary type accommodation.</P>
    <P>On the question of the growth of farmhouse and guesthouse accommodation, I asked the Minister questions on numerous occasions regarding the minimum amount of accommodation necessary to qualify for Bord Fáilte grants.  I asked a question as recently as a week ago and the Minister informed me that Bord Fáilte had now reduced the requirements as to number of rooms from ten to five.  Heretofore nobody could get a grant for the provision of tourist accommodation unless a minimum of ten rooms was provided. That has been reduced to five and I welcome it as being a necessary decision, but I think there is a case for going a step further in relation to the category known as farmhouse accommodation.</P>
    <P>Farmhouse holidays have become very popular and definitely have a potential but it would be very difficult to find in the average farmhouse five spare rooms that could be made available for tourist accommodation.  Therefore, I suggest to the Minister what I more or less implied in a recent question, that some type of financial assistance should be made available to people who are prepared to provide some farmhouse accommodation for tourists.  I do not want a golden handshake or free hand-outs but I submit <Col N="107" /> there is a case, if we are convinced there is a potential in farmhouse holiday accommodation, for providing special financial assistance.  Of course, we must lay down minimum standards.</P>
    <P>I came across another problem in relation to the provision of tourist accommodation.  I understand that when application is made to Bord Fáilte for a grant or financial assistance in some other form towards the provision of certain types of accommodation, the Board may and very often do say: &ldquo;In our opinion, there is adequate accommodation of the type you are about to provide in your locality and, therefore, we cannot allow you a grant.&rdquo; I had such a case recently and during the past 24 hours, I dispatched two pages of a stinker of a memorandum to Bord Fáilte on the question.  A certain individual engaged an architect and submitted plans to Bord Fáilte for the erection of a motel beside the Killarney road outside Limerick.  The place is a natural and obvious location for a motel.  The person has been informed that no financial assistance of any description can be provided for the project.</P>
    <P>When the Minister rises to reply to the debate, I should like him to inform the House on what grounds Bord Fáilte reached their decision, of the standard they adopted when saying: &ldquo;We consider there is adequate accommodation in your area of the type which you propose to provide and, therefore, we shall not give you a grant.&rdquo; In the case of the Limerick motel application, the decision is ridiculous, completely contradicting everything the Minister has said about the development of tourism in the south-west, everything I have said and everybody has said about the potential of the south-western region as a tourist area.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to certain other activities that will have to be fostered if tourism is to grow and flourish.  He lists 12.  I have only mentioned one and I would be here all night if I went into the others.  I do not intend to do so but I should like to mention the third on the Minister's list, <Col N="108" /> relating to the use of schools for student accommodation in some areas.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann draws attention to the fact that certain former employees of Córas Iompair Éireann have (a) pensions that lack uniformity, (b) pensions that have not increased in some instances when others have so increased, and (c) pensions wholly inadequate to meet the increasing cost of living, and calls upon the Government to take effective steps to remedy this situation.&mdash;(Deputy Lindsay.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I said on the last occasion, in the main, what I have to say in connection with a better deal for CIE pensioners.  I deplored the attitude of the Minister and the Department who have shown such little regard for the welfare of their employees in later years.  When considering a pension scheme they could only think in the miserly terms of £1 a week.  I compare the employee at factory level with the executive in CIE.  The latter could be retired with a gratuity of £8,000 and a pension of £3,500 per year, whereas the former was sent into retirement on a miserly pension of £1 per week.  Those are the anomalies which we seek to prevent.</P>
      <P>We live in times when good employers are seeking to secure greater productivity by better treatment of their employees.  Nowadays the emphasis is on what we term fringe benefits rather than on increases in the basic rates of pay.  High on the list of priorities in relation to fringe benefits are adequate pension schemes to ensure that workers who have given the best years of their lives to employers can live out their retirement happy and contented with a decent standard of living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are some of the sentiments we had to express.  I hope the Minister <Col N="109" /> will have regard to the substantial increase in the cost of living which has taken place and the inadequacy of those meagre pensions.  The majority of them are in the region of £1 per week.  I hope those rates will be increased proportionately.  When we took the Minister to task in the past on the inadequacy of the CIE pension rates he replied by giving us figures which were in excess of the amounts we had in mind.  When those higher amounts were analysed it transpired that the Minister was taking into account, and has been taking into account, social welfare rates of pension, especially the contributory old age pension.</P>
    <P>The Minister has associated these social welfare pensions with the CIE pensions.  He has bulked the two of them together, telling us then with great glee how well off those people were.  There is an obvious distinction between those pensions.  Social welfare benefits such as unemployment benefit, disability benefit and old age contributory pensions are enjoyed by all workers insured under the Social Welfare Acts.  Those workers contribute to the social welfare scheme over the full period of their working lives. They enjoy such pensions, benefits or emoluments not as a charity but as a right.</P>
    <P>There is, therefore, a distinction between industrial pensions and the social welfare benefits to which the working class people are obliged, by law, to contribute.  Therefore, the CIE pension must stand on its own.  It must stand the test on its own and in this situation, the Department must be indicted for the disgraceful way in which they have treated these employees and the disparity which they have allowed to exist between the various grades of workers in CIE.</P>
    <P>We know of no reason why one man should get a gratuity of £8,000 plus £3,500 a year pension while another man is given £1 per week, or even less.  It is not so long since those pensions were as low as 7/-per week.  We expect, in all the circumstances, that a State body, such as CIE, should show a headline to <Col N="110" /> the rest of the country, especially to industrial employees.  They should show that example, not merely by way of good conditions on the job and decent rates of wages but all the added fringe benefits by way of security in sickness, infirmity and old age.  The Minister is very largely responsible for the industrial unrest in CIE by reason of the complete lack of understanding, respect, care and appreciation which he ought to have had for the employees under his charge.</P>
    <P>The fact that CIE has been the most strike-ridden of our State and semi-State bodies in recent years is a clear indictment of the Minister for his lack of understanding of the human element in industry.  Irish workers, by and large, are responsible people.  They give a good return for a fair wage; they respect employers if they are shown respect.  There is something fundamentally wrong in the set-up, whether in a State concern or in private enterprise, where such unrest exists. In the final analysis, the responsibility can be placed on the doorstep of the employer because of his lack of progressive foresight and understanding of fairplay in these modern times.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that the motion we are now discussing is running, as it were, parallel with the Estimate for the Minister's Department and the sentiments we have to express with regard to the inadequacy of the pensions for CIE retired employees can be adverted to again in the course of the Estimate debate.  For that reason I shall not take up the time of the House any longer but, when the Minister is replying, I hope he will be able to give us good news of a better deal for the retired workers under his charge, particularly those in CIE.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I deal with the matters directly concerned with this debate, I want to say that I think I must not have been speaking sufficiently clearly the other day when I implied, in replying to Deputy Casey's allegations against the management of CIE, that I did not intend to reply <Col N="111" /> to such allegations.  The word left out was &ldquo;now&rdquo;; I wanted to wait until the occasion of this debate so that I would have the opportunity of getting the full information with which to refute the scandalous and completely untrue allegations made in regard to the action taken by the management of CIE in relation to the retirement of certain officials of the company.</P>
      <P>First of all, I should say that these kinds of allegations are not made by many Deputies.  They seem to be confined to very few Deputies.  An almost negligible number have made accusations against any of the major State companies of political corruption in the appointment, dismissal or retirement of staff.  State companies, under successive Governments, have had on the whole an excellent reputation in that regard and will, I hope, so continue to have.  But I will not allow decent men to be castigated here and slanderously attacked when they are not in a position to reply, unless I reply for them.</P>
      <P>Deputy Casey, in referring to the question of whether CIE can afford to pay more by way of pension to those who left the service before 1963, implied that there were funds that should have been available.  He went on to say:</P>
      <P>There is a certain category, a category I describe as the category of political pals, now in retirement. These were the people who, in the alleged re-organisation of CIE, were literally dug up and rapidly promoted. They were dug up out of all sorts of queer haunts and they were given wonderful titles: depot managers, area managers, local managers, personnel managers... The one qualification needed for this promotion was possession of a membership card of the Fianna Fáil organisation... Many Latter-Day Saints appeared overnight, able to produce their Fianna Fáil membership cards... These gentlemen were shot into executive positions in CIE, over which, of course, Dr. Andrews, of happy memory, was presiding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="112" /> He went on to refer to the fact that the majority had not done the hard grind on the railway he himself had done and, because they could not do their work and made such a mess of it, they had to be removed.  He said:</P>
    <P>Do you think they were put out like the 1,063 to whom Deputy O'Donnell referred?  Not at all.  They were festooned with pensions.  They got the benefit of early retirement, not on health grounds but on redundancy provisions.</P>
    <P>He continued in that vein.  The implication was that large numbers of persons had been corruptly promoted by CIE, despite the system of interview and boards which operates, and a large number of new people were appointed; these were found wanting and it was deliberately arranged, and scandalously, by the management that these would retire with redundancy payments under the redundancy legislation in the 1958 Act.</P>
    <P>There was, as everybody knows, a tremendous re-organisation taking place within CIE.  Area managers were appointed.  The whole system had to be dieselised and new methods adopted.  There were long-term studies by industrial consultants and, as a result, a large number of persons were appointed to the service, some from outside and some from inside by promotion. From 1958 to 1964, 201 new executive posts were filled, and that in a service employing some 21,000 people.  Of these 201, 75 were appointed from outside by interview.  The vast majority of these were professionally qualified engineers and accountants; 126 were appointed from within CIE. Of the 201 appointed from outside, 25 left the service before 31st March, 1964 and 11 between 1st April, 1964, and 31st October, 1966.  None received a pension of any kind, as was alleged by Deputy Casey.  Of those promoted from within CIE, that is to say, the 126, ten left the service before 31st March, 1964, and four between 1st April, 1964, and 31st October, 1966. Of the ten who left before 1964, three received compensation under the terms of the 1958 legislation.  One received a supplement to retirement pension.  In <Col N="113" /> addition, there were three other officers who were in the executive grade prior to August, 1958, who received promotion after that date.  They were subsequently declared redundant and retired on pension.  There was a total of some 81 executives who were not promoted during this period and who were retired.  With regard to the pensions festooning hack supporters of Fianna Fáil, these are the facts that emerge in reply to the scandalous statement implying that a huge number of people had been pushed up within CIE by political influence, found wanting, and retired on pension.</P>
    <P>So far as this debate is concerned, I have already spoken on a number of occasions on this matter and I do not think I need now go into any very great detail in relation to the present position of these pensioners.  There are 400 pensioners who retired before 1st April, 1963, who receive 51/3d a week. Six receive 33/6d and over 800 receive 22/6d a week.  Finally, there are some 900 who receive 20/- a week.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies asked about the lack of uniformity in the rates of pension. The rates vary because of the options open to pensioners at the time of retirement.  Since 1956, pensioners had the option of taking either a standard pension of 33/6d a week at 65 years of age for life or a pension of 51/3d a week reducing to 20/- at the age of 70.  An increase recently has brought this figure up from 20/- to 22/6d per week.  In fact, all but six of the existing pensioners opted for a pension of 51/3d a week, reducing to 20/- a week, now 22/6d a week.  This option was devised so that these pensioners could avail of the opportunity of getting the full rate of the non-contributory old age pension, as it was at the time, after 70 years of age.  That is the reason for the variation in the pensions.</P>
    <P>There have been, as I said, some increases, small and modest increases, in the pension rate, which cost CIE £40,000 a year.  The arrangement was made that pensioners who retired before 1956, and who had pensions on a differential basis, would all be <Col N="114" /> brought up to a uniform level of 20/-a week and at the same time, an <i>ex gratia</i> increase was given to pensioners who retired between 1956 and 1963.  The <i>ex gratia</i> increases ranged from 2/6 to 15/- a week, depending on the then existing rates of pensions, and subject to a minimum pension of 20/-and a maximum pension of 51/3 a week.  Therefore, there have been two <i>ex gratia</i> increases and I should add that the cost of this pension scheme to the Board is very heavy.  The Board contributes nearly £700,000 a year for all its pension schemes, including those for salaried officials as well as the wages grades groups.  In addition, the Board contributes £267,000 in respect of the Board's contribution under the Social Welfare Acts and £200,000 in respect of its own welfare scheme.  This sum amounts to £1.2 million, and in relation to the revenue of the Board, it is not an inconsiderable sum.  It cannot be regarded as a niggardly sum, this total contribution of CIE under all these headings, its contribution to its pension scheme, to the social welfare scheme and its payments under the medical welfare scheme.</P>
    <P>I suppose the main argument advanced in this debate, apart from references to the inadequacies of the pension itself, was the argument that the contributory old age pension should not have been taken into account in determining the level of retirement pension.  Not only I but the Government have to disagree with Deputies about this.  It was the stated opinion of the Government, through the Minister for Social Welfare, that the old age contributory pension is a national retirement pension and the Social Welfare (Amendment) Act, 1960 provided that these pensions would make it possible for other pension schemes to be modified in order to take account of the old age contributory pension.  I think this is a desirable provision because it enables the combining of income from both sources, both from the private or State-sponsored company and from the social welfare scheme, so as to improve the level of pensions at the most reasonable <Col N="115" /> cost to employees and employers. I should also make it clear that CIE workers who retired prior to 1963 were awarded the contributory old age pension, although they had made no contribution to its cost by way of increased deductions from their pay, and periodic increases in the contributory old age pension have been passed on to these pensioners even though they had not been asked to contribute to the cost.</P>
    <P>I am not saying that these people did not fully deserve the contributory old age pension, because undoubtedly their pensions are extremely modest and inadequate by themselves, but I deny that these men had worked for a lifetime in CIE and had actually earned the contributory pension.  In fact, under the Act, they and a number of other workers were quite rightly awarded the pension without having had to pay the contributions out of their wages during the time of their employment.  I am very glad that was the case.  As the House knows, these contributory old age pensions have been increasing.  In 1961, when the CIE pensioners first secured the contributory old age pension, the rate for a man with a wife was 68/6 and that has risen to 107/6, since 7th January this year, an increase of nearly £2 a week in the course of five years.  For the single man, the rate has gone up from 40/- a week to 60/- a week.  I have given these figures before but I think they should be recorded again in connection with this debate.  A married pensioner in CIE, who retired before April 1963, and whose weekly pension is now £1 2s 6d, will receive, at the age of 70, a total of £6 10s a week for himself and his wife.  An unmarried man will receive £4 2s 6d.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputies that the combined rate of CIE and social welfare pensions is extremely modest.  I hope that sometime in the future it will be possible to increase it.  It is true that CIE pensioners who retired since 1963 are receiving higher pensions than these, when the social welfare pensions are included, but it seems to me that <Col N="116" /> it must be recognised that there has been a very big improvement since the coming into force of the contributory old age pension.  If the contributory old age pension had not come into force, the position of these pre-1963 pensioners would have been deplorable. That was the purpose in having a national retirement pension scheme, to enable those who were receiving totally inadequate pensions to get something from the State, even though they had not earned the contributions in their lifetime.  A number of workers are included in the scheme who were able to take advantage of it.</P>
    <P>What we can do in the future will depend on the future economic position of CIE.  CIE can only give an additional pension to these men on an <i>ex gratia</i> basis.  Under the law, in the ordinary way, the pensions are devised on a contributory basis and there has already been an <i>ex gratia</i> increase.  I hope at some future date the economic position of CIE will improve and that it may be possible to do something about this.  I am certainly going to keep it under review.  As the House knows, <i>ex gratia</i> payments have been made on two occasions, the last being in 1964 and which, with the consent of the Government, I thought it right to ask CIE to give and which they did give.</P>
    <P>I hope the occasion may come again, but in the meantime I cannot commit the Government to any such course.  I can only point out the improvements that have taken place in the old age pension, the steady increases in the scheme which, in the case of the married man, was an increase of nearly £2 since 1961.  I hope by increasing, as rapidly as economic conditions permit, the State social welfare schemes we will be able to iron out some of the obvious deficiencies in private pension schemes and in State company schemes in this way and at the same time, if it becomes possible in addition, to suggest to CIE that they should give another <i>ex gratia</i> payment, I will be more than delighted to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened patiently to what the Minister has had to say and the only conclusion I can come to is that it is rather unfortunate <Col N="117" /> that a matter of this kind should be the subject of a parliamentary debate and involve the Minister being placed in the position of defending something to which he should have given attention a long time ago.  I am fully conscious of the fact that despite all that may be said from these benches and from the Fine Gael benches in connection with this matter, the Minister has already made up his mind that it does not matter and that he will resist the suggestions in the motion.</P>
      <P>To my mind, the Minister has not dealt with the motion.  He has not denied what is suggested in it but he has spent a lot of time defending the retirement of top officials of CIE.  When he sees fit to defend what has been doled out to top CIE officials, whom it was found necessary to retire, or who retired of their own volition, he should bear in mind the atmosphere created within and without CIE.  The Minister can say what he likes in defence of how people were treated but there is no denying that you cannot justify a situation in which a man who has worked all his life in CIE and struggled to build up the transport service, or even a man who was in the railway service before CIE and was taken over, can eventually find himself retired on a very meagre pension and is expected to stand idly by and say nothing about a top official of CIE being retired and given a pension of £60 a week.  Where are we going and what sort of thinking is this?  With whom do we think we are dealing when we bring about the kind of situation which is indefensible? I do not care who it is; I submit that no man who works in the interest of the nation is entitled to, or should ask for a pension of £60 a week when one considers that many others must be satisfied with £1 a week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is one of the things for which the Minister stands indicted.  It is all brought about because of the absence of interest in the running of CIE and because the Minister has left CIE to be run by a board and is content to say: &ldquo;This is a matter for the Board&rdquo;.  The Board should not, and must not be able to create a situation in which there is such glaring class distinction.  The <Col N="118" /> country is far too small and too poor for this.  It is time the Minister applied his mind to his responsibilities and gave serious consideration to the need to do something for these CIE pensioners.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke in terms of the offers that were made of lump sums or pensions but we have cases of top officials who were not only offered and given lump sums but were given pensions in addition.  The ordinary people who run CIE are not given the same treatment.  I am fully aware that were we to take away the £60 a week pension, it would be infinitesimal if spread over all the employees of CIE but an example should be set.  We cannot have a position where we give the impression in certain quarters that everything is grand and at the same time, be dependent on the people who do all the slogging, who must work in all sections of CIE day after day and expect them to be content.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not attempted&mdash; and I suggest he could not possibly attempt it&mdash;to describe how a CIE pensioner on 20/- a week, even with the old age pension, can make ends meet.  That would be an interesting exercise for this particular Minister because he is well known for talking in the clouds, for talking down to people and telling them how to behave. If he has so much time to lecture people&mdash;peculiarly, it is always the working class people he seeks to lecture&mdash;he should accept the responsibility of showing how a CIE pensioner with an old age pension can live.  I defy contradiction on this: the Minister will not be able to do it.  It is no use for him to say that old age pensions have increased.  The fact is that we are talking about the CIE pensions.  We are trying to prevail on the Minister as an employer to do what private employers have already done.  It is a sad state of affairs to find a Department of State not disposed to follow the example set by the ordinary employer.</P>
    <P>When the Minister refers to the Board of CIE, I wonder to what extent he sets about ensuring that the Board are in fact giving expression to the people's wishes.  I submit they do <Col N="119" /> not, particularly in matters of this kind.  When it comes to pensions, we have been led to believe that the Board decide the amount of the pension. Nothing is further from the truth.  I know of no trade union official who has ever had the pleasure or opportunity of talking to the Board of CIE in regard to rates of pay, working conditions or pensions of employees.  This is not done by the Board.  These things are decided in certain quarters and it is obvious to me that either the Minister is not sufficiently interested in what is happening in CIE or he has not yet had an opportunity of dealing with the matter.</P>
    <P>It is extremely unfortunate that this matter had to be raised in this way in this House because immediately it is brought up by the Opposition, it is killed stone dead.  Rights and wrongs do not enter into it: the attitude of the other side is that they must resist.  That is understandable but, hearing the Minister, it was plain that he did not indicate that he is disposed ever to put this matter right or ever to stop the practice of giving less and less to the have-nots and more and more to the haves.  I am not one to indulge in personalities, and I do not suggest for a moment that any of the top officials did not work when employed by CIE, but I earnestly suggest that, no matter who is concerned, nobody is worth a £60 a week pension.  If we create this sort of feeling in the people's minds, we cannot expect them to be content with £1 a week.</P>
    <P>This must be measured.  The Minister spoke about social welfare benefit but that applies only to the underdogs, those who must buy a pension and labour for it.  The top officials who go out on pension do not come within the scope of social welfare. What then is the Minister talking about?  I ask him to come down out of the clouds in dealing with a matter of this kind and give it serious consideration. Perhaps the first thing he should do, which he has certainly not yet done, is to have consultations with the trade unions who represent the <Col N="120" /> workers in CIE, get their views on pensions; have consultations with the Board and get their views on pensions; and then formulate opinion, not just catch the ball when it suits him and kick it away when he does not want it.</P>
    <P>It would be rather futile of me to entreat the Minister to change his mind and not to oppose this motion. That would be too much to ask.  I am convinced this is a righteous cause, but no matter how righteous it is, I know we shall not get an amenable answer from the Minister because it has now become a contentious matter.  Surely there is nothing wrong with this motion when it says:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann draws attention to the fact that certain former employees of Córas Iompair Éireann have (a) pensions that lack uniformity,</P>
    <P>This is a fact.  It is either a fact or it is not.  The Minister in his contribution to this debate did not attempt to deny it was a fact.</P>
    <P>(b)  pensions that have not increased in some instances when others have so increased,</P>
    <P>The Minister has not denied that either.</P>
    <P>and (c) pensions wholly inadequate to meet the increasing cost of living, and calls upon the Government to take effective steps to remedy this situation.</P>
    <P>I have already challenged the Minister or any of his colleagues to produce a budget which will show how the old age pensioners, to whom my colleagues and I have been referring, can possibly exist on the meagre pensions which they are getting from CIE.  Such a situation is indefensible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support this motion, and in doing so, I feel it is worthy of mention that there is no body of workers from the days of the old Great Southern Railway Company so dedicated and so loyal as the old-time workers of CIE.  Many of those who were in the service of the Great Southern Railway Company have, as has been pointed out, retired <Col N="121" /> and, having given their loyal and faithful service, have been given pensions which fall far short of what one would like to see given as recognition of the valuable services rendered by all those hard-working men, including employees of the permanent way section of the company, engine drivers, porters, and so on.</P>
      <P>It is about time the Minister realised that this was a problem to be tackled. I agree with the last speaker who said it is unfortunate that this matter should have to be the subject of a debate in this House.  We all know the CIE rates of pension are ridiculously low.  We have clear and ample evidence of the very great hardship endured by the retired workers of CIE, mainly those who are between the ages of 65 and 70.  I raised this matter in the House on 21st June last and in reply to a Parliamentary Question, I was told that the number of CIE pensioners now in receipt of CIE pensions of 30/- per week and less is 1,914.  Here you have almost 2,000 people who have given good, faithful service to CIE and when it comes to their retirement, this company gives them less than 30/- per week on which to live for the rest of their days.</P>
      <P>This is setting a very bad headline for private companies.  There are private concerns that deserve our appreciation and our congratulations for having, in conjunction with the trade unions, worked out some very good pension schemes.  However, if private concerns can work out good pension schemes for their workers when they go into retirement, the least we could expect is that a company like CIE would give a lead and treat their pensioners with some degree of respect.  The rates of CIE pensions are disgracefully low and bear no relation to the valuable service these workers have given over the years to the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is only right that the Minister should be constantly reminded that this situation has been considerably aggravated by the fact that special treatment has been given to Dr. Andrews in his <Col N="122" /> pension of £60 per week.  I fail to understand why the Board of CIE singled out certain people to be given the real plums of pensions while those engaged in the actual operation of CIE, namely, the workers, seem to get the rough end of the stick all the time, many of them having to live on 30/- a week or less.</P>
    <P>If the Minister wishes to display any serious interest in this matter, he should enter into consultations with the Board and get the Board to discuss this matter with the trade unions in order to have a pension scheme implemented which would yield a reasonable pension for those employees of CIE who will be going into retirement.  I venture to say that if on the occasion of the next Budget or at any other time the Minister were to ask this House to vote money for CIE pensioners, particularly those who are put to the pin of their collar to exist on the low rates of pension they are now receiving, his appeal would meet with the approval of every Deputy.  I would seriously appeal to him to try to remedy the great injustice being done to these pensioners by seeking in this House whatever financial accommodation is required to do justice to these men who have given such a good and loyal service to the company.</P>
    <P>It is confusing the issue for the Minister to refer to social welfare contributory pensions in this connection. The motion deals with the pensions that have been provided for CIE employees.  The House is given an opportunity to express disapproval of these pensions.  It is quite wrong for the Minister to paint the picture by introducing the question of contributory old age pensions payable to CIE pensioners. We are mainly concerned with the principle of a profitable pensions scheme for CIE workers irrespective of any other pension, contributory or non-contributory, payable by the State and administered by the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>I want to express disapproval of the complete disregard and disinterest shown by the Minister for Transport and Power and of his failure to take the necessary steps to ensure that CIE pensioners were granted pensions <Col N="123" /> which would enable them to enjoy a decent standard at the end of their days.  There are many CIE pensioners in my own constituency who are in very poor circumstances.  They are men who certainly did not fail the company down through the years but who now find that the Board has failed them.</P>
    <P>There is a responsibility on the Minister for Transport and Power in regard to CIE pensioners.  These men are not seeking mercy.  They are looking for justice and fair play.  The Minister has a duty to ensure that the grievances that exist in regard to CIE pensions are resolved.  His statement in the House this evening would not convey that he will take any practical steps towards that end.  The Minister is displaying complete disregard for these pensioners and an opportunity is now presented to the House to express disapproval of his conduct.</P>
    <P>I want to make a serious and genuine appeal to the new Chairman of CIE, who is a man of outstanding intelligence and great common sense. The regrettable feature is that he was not Chairman of CIE for the past 15 years.  If he had been, the company might not be in the deplorable mess that it is in today.  I would appeal to the Chairman of the Board to consider the plight of these pensioners.  I am sure that there is no one more qualified than the present part-time Chairman to express an opinion on the low rates of pension being meted out to men who have given good and faithful service.  I hope and trust that something practical will be done so that the grievance which exists can be eliminated. The grievance will remain until such time as the Minister and the Board enter into discussions with a view to providing these pensioners with improved rates of pension so that they can say that, in some small way, they were compensated for the hard work they undertook on behalf of the company in a lifetime of service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>To conclude the debate on the motion is made rather painful by the contribution that we have heard this evening from the Minister <Col N="124" /> for Transport and Power.  The Minister concedes, in a voice very much affected, that the pensions being paid to CIE pensioners are extremely modest indeed.  Such lip-service to a cause is not enough.  The Minister has the power and the means to direct the policy of CIE in this regard in such a manner that these pensioners can be assisted, their plight considerably improved, their pensions made uniform and, in addition, made to measure up in some way to the demands being made upon them by an ever-increasing cost of living.</P>
      <P>We are living in times when great emphasis is being laid upon the position of the aged, particularly those who live alone.  Not alone is that true of national politics but, internationally, at the present time there are appeals through the United Nations and its subsidiary agencies to all nations to assist in a freedom from hunger campaign. Indeed, within the last week the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, one of the principal contenders in the race to be the Taoiseach of this country, said that if a man could be thrown up who would assist materially in this freedom from hunger campaign, his place in history would be secure.  We do not ask the Minister through this motion to do anything that would secure him a place in history.  We want him to do something that will secure him a place in the hearts of these men who have retired from CIE and whose pensions are so lamentably low.  To say they are extremely modest is not enough.  Something must be done to improve this position.  It is very difficult to blame people in receipt of such poor pensions in such difficult times for feeling aggrieved when they find people with five or six years' service with the same company getting almost as much per week as these unfortunate men get from the company for a whole year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reply to Parliamentary questions addressed to him today, the Minister gave Deputy Ryan, Deputy T. O'Donnell and myself some interesting information.  Some of it is this: that the value of the CIE Wages Grade Pension <Col N="125" /> Fund at 31st December, 1965, was £4,583,559.  The revenue of the Fund in the same year amounted to £790,390. This sum was made up as follows: dividends, £209,594; contributions from employees, £178,860; and contributions by the Board, £401,936.  He also told us that the present number of CIE wages grade pensioners is 3,576 and that the current annual value of the CIE pensions paid to them is £316,606. Unless my arithmetic is hopelessly out of date.  I make from that that the average annual pension of a wages grade pensioner from CIE, to the nearest penny, is per annum £88 10s 9d, which is&mdash;again to the nearest penny&mdash; 34/- a week.</P>
    <P>No wonder the Minister describes these pensions as &ldquo;extremely modest&rdquo;. &ldquo;Modest&rdquo; is not the word.  They are shameful; they are disgraceful; and they are impudent in the face of the conditions in which these men have to live and in face of the further fact that these are the amounts offered to men in these times who have upwards of 40 years' service.  It is outrageous in the year 1966 that people should be asked to live upon them.  What the Minister says, of course, is true, that these people are in receipt, in the varying amounts to which they are entitled, of contributory pensions.  But this business of reducing the pension from CIE by an amount relative to that pension did not start at the time of contributory pensions. It started at a time when only old age non-contributory pensions were in operation.  Therefore, what happened in effect was&mdash;I know CIE and the Minister will call it an option but my information is that these men had no option&mdash;that they were presented with a scheme and had to sign up or else.</P>
    <P>Are CIE not getting a sufficiently adequate subsidy from this State by way of direct contribution without having to receive another portion of hidden subsidy through the Department of Social Welfare now that the Department of Social Welfare under contributory pensions, and formerly old age pensions, are contributing to the CIE pension fund?  That is a situation of which not alone the company but the Minister responsible for it should be ashamed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="126" /> I thought when contributory pensions were introduced they were not to be subject to a means test.  Here CIE in practice are taking contributory pensions into account as a means test in relation to their own pensions. They may not say so.  They may not agree that is what they are doing, but that is in effect the result of the practice. CIE pensioners lose a lot more by reason of retirement.  Before retirement these men enjoyed the advantages of the medical services provided by the company.  They also enjoyed free passes on the company's transport. When they retired this free pass was withdrawn, as also were the medical services of the company.  Again, they are thrown on to the benefit of the Health Acts&mdash;another subsidy from another source for CIE.  Is it not a dreadful state of affairs when bus drivers and bus conductors, who have spent their whole working lives in these specialist positions, are forced at the age of 65 to sign at the local labour exchange and keep on so signing until they are 70 years of age?  The situation does not bear any kind of analysis, and certainly does not bear any sort of test that social standards would necessarily apply to it.</P>
    <P>This motion is put down specifically for the purpose of drawing the Minister's attention to the position, drawing the attention of the House to it, drawing the attention of the country to the manner in which a company, subsidised openly to the extent of £2 million per annum by the Irish taxpayer, treats these faithful servants, who, as I said, receive on average £88 10s 9d a year.  Some may get more and some less: that is the average.  If you want to bring it down to more workable and understandable terms, it works out, in 1966, at 34/- a week. No wonder they feel aggrieved.  They have every right to be.  Of course the Minister has every right to concede that it is an extremely modest pension. I do not see why the pension could not be increased, even from the existing pension fund.</P>
    <P>Let nobody mind these actuarial figures of future commitments.  The present is the important thing.  In the present, no pensioner should have to <Col N="127" /> suffer through lack of money, inadequate food or inadequate clothing. Within the past week, some of my colleagues and I met these men.  To hear their tale of woe which is true, on the figures, is heartrending in itself. Through this motion, we want not alone to protest but to show our appreciation of these men's service.  We want to demonstrate to the House and to the country that this condition of affairs cannot continue too long.  These are an organised body but they are a small body and, because of their smallness, they are defenceless, but that is no reason why advantage should be taken of them.</P>
    <P>I think the company, wittingly or unwittingly, is taking advantage of them.  It took advantage of them when it made them opt for lower pension after five years.  It takes advantage of them by taking into account the contributory old age pension as a <Col N="128" /> means test, because that is what it is. Whatever the Minister says about a national retirement pension and the policy underlying it, the practice is that the means test is applied here to the detriment of the CIE pensioners. Deputy O. J. Flanagan talked about the unrest, concern, and so on, these men must feel when they think of what happens not alone in other spheres but right on their own doorstep.</P>
    <P>I do not want to engage in any kind of altercation with the Minister or to use any language that might be calculated to hurt anybody, but it is only fair to say that these men's minds must forever be struggling, within the framework of their social conscience, to try to reconcile how they, after 40 years, can average only £88 10s 9d a year while somebody, after a short period of five years with the company, can get £60 a week.</P>

    <Title>Committee on Finance. - Vote 41&mdash;Transport and Power (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That the Vote be referred back for reconsideration.&mdash;(Deputy P. O'Donnell.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. T. O'Donnell Mr. T. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Before Private Members' Business was taken, I was referring to the various parts of the Minister's speech in which he enumerated and underlined the activities which could be followed.  I was about to deal with the use of schools for student accommodation in some areas. I have no doubt whatsoever that this type of student holiday is very backward. Certain progress has been made to date but much more remains to be done.</P>
      <P>The fourth point in the Minister's speech is, perhaps, one of the most important aspects of a good tourist industry, that is, the extension of the season.  I am pleased to learn that a scheme was initiated this year by Aer Lingus, Aerlínte and CIE, with the co-operation of Bord Fáilte, for a low cost package holiday scheme under which tourists get unlimited travel on our national transport system over a certain period.  I understand that the initial experiment has been very successful and I hope this type of scheme will be developed with much greater intensity in the coming season.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of saturation at peak point and then an off-season is a very difficult problem.  There are a number of lines of tourist development which offer possibilities for extending the tourist season, particularly angling and hunting holidays, and perhaps shooting holidays.  Hunting holidays are proving very popular.  There are certain problems involved in the development of this holiday&mdash;the availability of suitable horses and so forth&mdash;but a number of people have gone into this <Col N="131" /> business and farmers, in particular, have developed a nice sideline in this for the winter by hiring out horses for the hunting season.  There are other possibilities too.</P>
    <P>The Minister dealt with the question of indoor entertainment and beach facilities for young people at many seaside resorts.  I will not go into that; these are obvious things.</P>
    <P>He tells us of the further development of sea angling facilities, a local committee, plus provision of boats.  I am disappointed that he did not refer to inland angling.  I appreciate the importance of sea angling which, I realise, offers very great scope.  The survey carried out in Limerick two years ago included not merely a survey of the facilities on the rivers and lakes in the Limerick area but also sea angling facilities on the west Clare coast.  It would be much better if the overall thing were taken, and not merely single out one aspect of it, that is, sea angling.  There is colossal interest in Britain in angling.  One thing that is very striking is the number of people in Britain who are interested in coarse fishing.  We have many lakes and rivers and centres which could, if developed, provide the requisite accommodation.  I hope the Minister's statement does not mean that further angling development will be confined solely to sea angling.  I hope that the work of the Inland Fisheries Trust will continue.  I referred in previous debates to the need for co-ordination between the Trust and the Fisheries Section of Bord Fáilte.  This co-ordination and close co-operation have not existed in the past.  I hope that there will be some co-ordinated effort in the matter of development, stocking and marketing.</P>
    <P>It is reckoned that there are well over one million registered anglers in Britain.  A big advantage in developing our tourist trade on this line is that a high percentage of these English fishermen are interested merely in coarse angling.  As far as I am aware, 70 per cent of British anglers are interested <Col N="132" /> in coarse fishing, about 20 per cent in game fishing and ten per cent in sea fishing.  If my memory serves me aright, those are the figures. There is a market across the water. I believe that we have the facilities here.  The centres catering for this type of tourist have proved conclusively that this is a particular line of development we can pursue.  I am not satisfied with the progress made.  Much greater progress could be made.</P>
    <P>I am glad to note that, despite the difficulty in the earlier half of this year brought about by the shipping strike, the overall loss will not be as great as many people expected.  I think the Minister mentioned that there will be a reduction of about five per cent in the number of visitors this year.  Possibly the extra effort put into attracting tourists here in September and October has paid dividends.  Perhaps with the concentration of effort on the latter half of the tourist season, certain guide lines may now emerge which will help to develop in the next season what we call late holidays.</P>
    <P>On the question of airports and our national airline, the position is that Aer Lingus did not seem to fare too well financially, at any rate, whereas Aerlínte had a very successful year. The international organisation catering for the financial returns of the various airlines in a recent report states that the average operating surplus of the various international airlines for 1965 was 9.5 per cent.  On that basis Aerlínte certainly acquitted itself very well indeed. On the question of Aer Lingus, there is something which the Minister has not referred to in his speech.  It may be that at the time it was being compiled this had not been finalised, but I want to express my pleasure at learning that Aer Lingus has successfully concluded with the various unions catering for the workers a very satisfactory arrangement.  I compliment Aer Lingus on this new development in the field of industrial relations, one which could perhaps set a headline for various other State companies.</P>
    <P>Future aviation development will create very serious problems for our national airline, with the emergence of <Col N="133" /> the larger jets, subsonic and, ultimately, supersonic aircraft.  The problem of a small country and a comparatively small airline in meeting the financial commitment involved in equipping itself with the latest type of aircraft is a very big one.  However, I have confidence in the management of Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta and that these hurdles will be tackled as they come, and tackled successfully.</P>
    <P>There remains under the heading of transport our national transport system, CIE.  Up to now in my speech I have not been critical but I regret very much that the Minister has been weeping and moaning in his speech about the question of staff relations.  He stated that the problems of CIE did not arise at management or executive level.  He goes on then to make suggestions, bemoaning the fact that certain strikes took place and so on.  The Minister may not realise it but I am convinced that all this moaning the Minister has been doing in recent times about staff relations in CIE and about the attitude of the ordinary transport worker has been responsible more than anything else for the bad morale which exists.  The Minister should refrain in future from criticising&mdash;perhaps not directly but certainly by implication&mdash; the workers of CIE because there is no finer body of workers in this country. Our transport workers are as good as and compare very favourably with transport workers in any country in the world.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the Fine Gael call during the Recess for a sworn inquiry into the affairs of CIE. During the past year, since the last Estimate was discussed, we had a motion here in Private Members' Time calling for an investigation into the affairs of CIE.  There is more codology and uninformed talk about CIE than there is about any other single company or any other single matter in this country.  Unfortunately, partly as a result of the way the Minister has approached the matter, people tend to take a very narrow view on this question of the annual subsidy to our national transport system.  There are grounds for stating that this subsidy <Col N="134" /> of £2 million can be justified.  Apart from the economic argument, we must remember, for democratic reasons and the fact that many parts of this country are sparsely populated, that the national transport system is providing a service for the people and, in particular, a service which enables children in rural areas to avail of post-primary educational facilities in the towns and cities.  It would be a very interesting exercise to ascertain what proportion of the total number of passengers carried by CIE, particularly on the buses in provincial areas, are schoolchildren travelling on what we call school fares.  This proposal by Fine Gael for a sworn inquiry into the affairs of CIE would, if implemented, clear the air, would inform public opinion as to what are the exact problems and I think there would be less criticism levelled at CIE as a result.</P>
    <P>In passing, I regret also the attitude of the Minister when he spoke in the debate on the motion just concluded regarding the CIE pensioners.  Before I conclude, I want to make one final appeal for those men&mdash;and there is no great problem in giving them some increase.  The Minister said they got an increase in 1964, and various other increases.  They did; they got an increase from 12/- to £1 and, in another category, from £1 to £1 2s 6d.  Surely this is very meagre and it should be possible to give these men a reasonable increase?  I think I have covered most of the points in this Estimate in which I am interested.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>No matter whether or not we agree with the Minister's statement, we must admit it is a very comprehensive one, covering practically every aspect of the Department for which he is responsible. On that I compliment him.  It is a pity, during Question Time in the House over the year, that we were not able to get some of the information given so freely in this document.  Had it been available, perhaps the Minister and we might have got on a lot better&mdash;it might be an example of good public relations. The Minister has gone into great detail, giving facts and figures to <Col N="135" /> prove the attitude he has on various matters, and has covered practically every aspect of his Department. Deputy T. O'Donnell went through the Minister's speech sentence by sentence and word by word: I do not propose to do that.  What I propose to do is to touch on the matters about which I know a considerable amount and to ask some questions of the Minister.  I can assure the House I will not be two and a half hours doing so.</P>
      <P>I shall start off with the ESB and the present policy of the Minister's Department with regard to the connection of ESB services throughout the country.  Again and again the Minister has referred to the fact that the percentage of houses connected in the country is very high.  Though he did not say it today in reply to a question, he did, on several occasions, make the statement that practically all houses, except those in outlying areas&mdash;and I assumed he meant islands and mountains &mdash; were now getting ESB current.  Of course, nothing could be further from the truth. I am not saying the Minister is trying deliberately to mislead the House but what I am saying is that the full facts of the ESB situation are not brought before the Minister.  I know he is a great man for statistics and statistics can prove anything you want them to prove, providing you use them in the way you want to use them.  Statistics or no statistics, the facts are that we could show the Minister dozens of houses beside towns and villages in the midlands, where there are no mountains or islands, which have not yet got the ESB service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I referred before to the system which the ESB adopted when starting rural electrification.  They took a central point and serviced a circle around that point, with the result that when four such circles had been drawn, there were pockets left without electrification. Some of those pockets have never been connected.  It appears rather stupid than an area in close proximity to a town, within a few <Col N="136" /> hundred yards of a developed area, should not be provided with current. Not alone do dwellinghouses require connection but modern farms need current.  These pockets are not connected simply because they were left out at the initial stage.</P>
    <P>There are quite a number of houses where old people lived when rural electrification was being started.  They refused to take the current.  Now those old people have passed on and their children or others having got possession of the houses, the ESB are still making a song and a dance about giving them the connection, even though the line from which they could be serviced may be on the same side of the road.  That does not make sense. The matter is getting very much worse now.  I am aware of an area in which two years ago the owners of 19 houses applied for connection and were promised it on payment of a small extra charge and on condition that they would have the forms completed and in the ESB office on 14th October. For some reason, while some of the forms were sent direct to the head office in Dundalk, others were sent to the local office in Navan, and the ESB subsequently said that because they were not all in Dundalk on 14th October, they would not give the connection.</P>
    <P>On my advice, those people went to considerable expense in wiring their houses.  Since then on numerous occasions, I have had to try to explain why even now two years later the ESB still find excuses not to connect them.  The ESB recently thought up the corny story that it was because of the fact that money was so scarce that they could not do everything they wanted to do.  Before that, they referred to the fact that they were going to develop the Tara area and could not do this area until the development of the whole area was taking place, and until they had canvassed the whole area.  In reply to a Parliamentary Question, the Minister said it would cost too much to do it any other way and that this was the most economical way.</P>
    <P>I have no objection to the ESB doing <Col N="137" /> their work in the most economical way, but I have a grave objection to the ESB telling me or anyone else that they cannot connect houses they promised in writing two years ago they would connect, on the ground that someone else four or five miles away is not in a position to take the current.  In two instances in Meath, the houses were wired after a promise by the ESB, but they are still left without current.  I was glad to hear the Minister say at Question Time that all the houses which were wired would be connected before the end of the financial year.  I hope I am not misquoting him, but I think that is what he said.  If that is so, it is good news for all the people who went to such expense and trouble to have their houses wired in time.</P>
    <P>A new element has now entered into it, that is, the advances of money which the ESB are asking for before they will give a connection.  The story was trotted out that it was not possible to give these connections on the ground that the money was not available to do so.  I want to quote a letter I have.  It is dated 18th October and reads:</P>
    <P>Re: Supply to house at Colliers-land, Dunboyne.  Re: above the cost of the extension to your new house is £36.  In order to gain almost immediate connection you are required to pay this amount to the ESB.  A refund of the full amount would be considered when the capital assets allow it.</P>
    <P>That is only one of a number of letters I have, with figures ranging from around £30 to several hundreds of pounds.  I heard Deputy Fitzpatrick alleging that there was a suggestion that £1,000 should be paid before the connection would be made.</P>
    <P>If the ESB want to borrow money, I suggest they borrow it in the normal way.  If they want people to pay for connection, they should give a firm promise that on a certain date the money will be refunded.  If anyone could tell me any more vague phrase than the one used in this letter that &ldquo;a refund of the full amount would be considered when the capital assets allow it&rdquo;, I should like to hear it. Apparently they want to be so cagey <Col N="138" /> that no one can say they promised to refund the money because according to this phraseology they would consider it &ldquo;when the capital assets allow it&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That brings me to another point.  In answer to a question in the House, it was revealed that of the £6 million loan obtained by the ESB last year&mdash;and it was oversubscribed&mdash;the Government borrowed £5 million.  Subsequently half of that was paid back to the ESB, but, according to the reply given in the House, the Government appear to have £2½ million which belongs to the ESB. While the ESB were saying they had not got the money to do the work they are supposed to do, they could still lend the Government £2½ million.  That seems to me to be the most extraordinary system of accountancy I ever heard of in my life, and I should like to know what is the justification for it.</P>
    <P>More recently still we had the situation in which the ESB decided to increase their charges.  We had a song and dance last year when we were discussing a Bill to prevent prices from rising.  There was a suggestion that if there were a proposal to increase prices, a prices inquiry board could be set up to investigate the proposal.  In this case the ESB apparently asked the Minister for permission to increase their charges by seven per cent.  The Minister agreed and said: &ldquo;This is only temporary.  I will set up a board to investigate it, and if it should find that you were not entitled to the increased charge, it will be cancelled&rdquo;&mdash; or is one to assume that a refund will be made?</P>
    <P>Could the Minister not say if there is any justification whatever for the seven per cent increase the Board are seeking?  Does he appreciate that if he allows this and if a recommendation comes from the inquiring body for an increase of seven per cent, it will substantially increase not alone living costs but production costs in practically every field?  Surely, before any application to increase charges was approved by the Minister, he should have insisted on an investigation being carried out?</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister what were the facts put before him by <Col N="139" /> the ESB in order to justify an increase in charges.  We know it is not this Minister who is responsible for giving sanction but surely he could find out from his colleague why the increase was allowed?  He is the person who deals with the ESB and therefore he is the person from whom we must ask these questions.  The Labour Party have a motion which will be discussed in due course covering these points.  I am quite sure that the decision to allow the charges to domestic consumers to be increased by seven per cent was not a right one and I am equally sure that will be proved when the report of the inquiring body is brought in here, if that body do their duty properly.</P>
    <P>This brings us back to the powers of the Minister and to his function. Apparently it has now become the popular thing for the Government, when trouble arises, to blame some sort of labour disputes.  The fact that there was a labour dispute this year has been blamed for certain things but the Minister must remember that the labour dispute was caused by the failure of the ESB to do their duty.  No matter how they try to wriggle out of it, I do not think the Board can get out of that one.  There was the scandalous situation here when the current was cut off on the Monday morning because, it was said, there was a danger of power running down.</P>
    <P>The extraordinary thing was that in certain areas in the city the power was cut off ten minutes before certain workers refused to pass the pickets.  It is obvious that there was a serious mishandling of the situation and if ever there was necessity for a sworn inquiry, it is into what happened that morning. I am satisfied from discussions I have had with people who know all about these matters that the Board had no justification, good, bad or indifferent, for taking the action they took.  They may have had one&mdash;to be able to put the screw on the workers, to be able to blame them for the thousands who were thrown out of work throughout the country and the millions of pounds lost and the danger to life created in <Col N="140" /> hospitals and other institutions.  It was a scandalous situation which should not be passed over lightly.  If this matter is fully investigated by an impartial tribunal, it will be settled once and for all that the Board were at fault, that the Board blackmailed the people responsible by taking the action they took.  I do not think any State or semi-State body should be able to get away with it.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to service charges, to the circumstances in which the ESB will provide current only on condition that the potential consumer will pay abnormal service charges.  I do not know if the present system is to continue, under which consumers must pay meter rents in respect of meters owned by the ESB on top of charges for the current used by people living in awkward places.  I can instance the case of a man living 100 yards outside Gormanston Camp in County Meath. Because his house was near the military airport, the only way he could get a connection, he was told, was by underground cable.  The Board agreed to give it to him on condition that he paid a special service charge of £12 per two months in addition to meter rent and current charges.  Naturally that man, a builder's labourer, was not in a position to pay that charge.</P>
    <P>There was a lot of correspondence between the Minister and me.  The military authorities stated that there was a danger in the extension of supply to that man by overhead cable because there were overhead wires around the camp and the wires supplying that man would be erected at the same level. Eventually it was agreed that overhead wires could be used and the ESB said he could have current at the reduced service charge of £4 per two months.  I think the thing is plain stupidity.  There was not a reason in the world why that man should not be supplied with electricity in the normal way, except that the military authorities and the ESB decided there should be a very high service charge and those petty people do not want to climb down from that stupid decision.  I ask the Minister, a <Col N="141" /> reasonable man, to try to teach the Board some sense, to persuade them how darn stupid they are to require £4 per two month period for the erection of one pole so that a man, his wife and young children, can have electric light in the normal way.</P>
    <P>We have had quite a lot of discussion, and shall have before the debate ends, on CIE.  It is a subject on which one could talk for three solid hours and still not exhaust it.  I intend to make only a few short remarks on it. The Minister referred to the number of cars it takes to bring people into the city and the congestion that would be avoided if those people used the bus services.  Is it not time that those responsible for the expensive advertisements being used by Telefís Éireann plugging that line of thought grew up? If I am to go from my constituency to Dublin and I have two or three places to call at, perhaps outside Dublin, is it suggested I should leave my car in Drumcondra, wait half an hour for a bus and see five or six buses passing which are not going in my direction?  Is it suggested that everybody who uses a car would find it convenient to use the bus services? The Minister, I am sure, is one person who would not agree he should leave his State car behind at one side of the city and use buses from one place to another.</P>
    <P>The second point in relation to CIE to which I should like to refer is the recent change in the destination scrolls on the front of buses.  They have been changed from English to Irish.  I can speak Irish; I have as good a knowledge of it as most people in the House, but I find it impossible to understand or decipher the destination names on some buses, and I suggest to the Minister that if he were standing waiting for a bus to come along, many of them would pass him by and he would not be able to recognise where they were going.  He would miss a good many buses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>He would miss them all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know to <Col N="142" /> whom CIE were playing up.  The whole arrangement is ridiculous, and the fact that the scrolls were printed in England makes the whole thing ludicrous.  As well, the cost must have been substantial.  Even so, if there were any way in which the scrolls could be identified, one could see the point of it.  It makes the whole thing look foolish when you put on the front of a bus the name of a destination in Irish and nobody knows the exact destination to which the bus is going.  It is quite possible that the people using buses every day may, because they know the number of the bus, look at the destination scroll and recognise where it is going.  If the idea of putting the destination scroll in Irish on buses is to continue, something will have to be done about this.  The English destination will have to be put alongside it so that people will know exactly where the bus is going.</P>
      <P>Recently I came across a constituent of mine who was waiting for a bus outside Dublin Airport.  The bus passed by because he did not know Irish and did not know the destination of the bus.  He said when he left the primary school he had to go to England for work.  Recently he got a job at home close to the main road.  His bus passed by because the destination scroll was in Irish and he did not know where it was going. Luckily for him, I picked him up and gave him a lift home.  If it were not for that, that man would have to stand much longer in the rain, just because some crackpot decided that the scrolls on the buses should be in Irish.</P>

      <P>The Minister, in quite substantial detail, earlier to-night, commented on the CIE pension scheme.  I do not propose to travel that line, except to say it is just too bad in this year of Our Lord, 1966, that we find poor old people who have been employed all their lives by CIE, or by the GNR, which transferred subsequently to CIE, who are expected to try to live on the miserable pittance given to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="143" /> It is all right to say that CIE are not paying their way and more money cannot be given.  I would like to say this and I believe eventually that it will be the solution: the sooner CIE workers, who are at present working with this body, realise that the workers of today are the pensioners of tomorrow and that the pensioners of today were working a very short time ago and that they must ensure, while they are working, that decent arrangements are made for their pensions, the sooner we will have an end to this parsimonious treatment which is doled out to people who have worked in State or semi-State bodies.  People who have worked in CIE for a great number of years are entitled to a pension suitable in amount to compensate them for the number of years they worked in CIE. They often find that people with less service get the same pensions as they get.</P>
    <P>With regard to fares, we have had the question raised as to whether or not CIE were charging the correct amount in fares.  It is true to say that in some of the country districts fares seem to be going up higher and higher.  I live in Laytown, County Meath, six miles from Drogheda.  The single fare on the bus from Laytown to Drogheda is 2/10d.  That is fairly expensive travelling for somebody who wants to go in to do the week's shopping.  That person has to pay that fare into Drogheda and also on the return journey.  I suggest it would not do any harm at all when CIE are fixing charges, if they took into consideration the fact that six miles there are no longer than six miles across Dublin.  I know the number of passengers using that service may be far less, but at the same time, there must be some sort of comparison between the two services.  It would not do any harm at all if this were taken into consideration when fares are being fixed.</P>
    <P>Train services have also been mentioned. I am told that on the main line train service between Dublin and Drogheda, the heating arrangements <Col N="144" /> are still very primitive on the early morning and late evening services. If you are lucky enough to get the carriage behind the engine, you may have some heat but if you are unfortunate enough to be in a carriage down the train, the heating does not reach it at all.  This may seem a small matter to raise in this debate but it is something that should be dealt with.</P>
    <P>There should be some arrangement whereby bus and train services are synchronised.  The station at Laytown services passengers who travel, not alone to Laytown village, but to Bettystown, Mornington and many other areas around there.  A bus travels from Laytown station to Drogheda&mdash;this is not a question of hearsay&mdash;and time and again the bus at the station waited until the train pulled into the station and then travelled on.  Sometimes nobody at all was in the bus and at other times maybe a few passengers were in it. The half-dozen passengers who got off the train had to walk a half-mile or more because the bus had left.  The driver did not want to move off but because the timetable said the bus must leave at a certain time, he had to leave.</P>
    <P>I am not raising this here without first putting the matter to the local officials.  I pointed out on one occasion the case of a train which usually pulled in at 8.30, the bus being due to leave at 8.30.  It takes only a few minutes for the changeover from train to bus.  The official had the departure time of the bus changed to 8.25 so that when the train arrived, the bus had actually left.  This satisfied the official and his superiors but it was very little satisfaction to the people who had to walk.  It is not too much to ask that an effort should be made to synchronise these services.</P>
    <P>I understand that what happens in Laytown happens all over the country. It happens because some people who are paid to do a certain job will not take the trouble to ensure that there is a connection.  If a train is five minutes late from time to time, the bus can <Col N="145" /> afford to wait and make that five minutes up on a long run.  It may be said that this is a trivial matter but I want to say it is not a trivial matter for some of those people who have to walk.  I am not blaming the drivers or conductors.  They are not at fault. They have their timetables and are given their instructions.  They are not to wait for the train passengers unless the train has arrived before they leave. I do not want to go any further on that.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made some comment on the B &amp; I Company.  I raised Questions on this matter earlier this year.  On one occasion the Minister made a different statement from that which I thought he made.  I understood with regard to the two B &amp; I boats laid off that the people working on them were to be given alternative employment within the service.  The Minister today, in answer to a question, said that some of them were found alternative employment, that most of them were casual and were not taken on by the company, that some of them were non-nationals and in fact some of them were people who signed on from one trip to the next and therefore could be called very casual workers.  There are two points I would like to make in regard to this. In view of the fact that the Government find it necessary to sell two B &amp; I boats very shortly after buying them, would the Minister like to explain why they were purchased in the first place? Was it known when they were purchased that they were unsuitable?  If it was known, what way were they dealt with with regard to actual cash dealing when they were bought?</P>
    <P>I believe nine boats were purchased. It seems as if somebody made a very bad deal when you find that two boats have to be sold within a very short time.  In addition to that, two other boats have been chartered. I would like to know what they are costing to run?  Are they paying their way or are they an added expense on the B &amp; I Company?  Reference was made to the fact that the position is improving but I would like a reply to those questions.  I know two foreign boats were bought and that the <Col N="146" /> people manning the boats were also foreigners.  I do not like to see Irish sailors laid off work for any reason and their jobs taken by the nationals of another country.  That is, in fact, what has happened as a result of the dealing by the Minister and the B &amp; I Company in this particular case.</P>
    <P>Deputy Donegan had a question the other day about the development of Drogheda harbour and, as Deputy Donegan was not here, I asked a couple of supplementaries.  I got a few rather interesting replies.  Now I should like to get some more information. It is many years now since Drogheda Harbour Commissioners were preparing a scheme for the dredging of the harbour and doing necessary work there.  Somebody was employed to draw up a scheme&mdash; experts who cost what experts usually cost to do this kind of job, and they have been almost continuously employed there since.  Would the Minister care to say how many plans have been submitted?  How many times have the plans been changed?  How much money was actually spent on mapping?  How much money was paid to a small group of people who did nothing concrete, good, bad, or indifferent, with regard to that harbour?  Does the Minister know, when he says it is proposed to sink a bar of five feet, that it does not matter what he does unless he builds the retaining walls which all who live in the area know are necessary to keep the bar secure?  It is a waste of time lowering the level of the bar because within two tides, 24 hours, it will be back again where it was.  Has the Minister any information whatever about what it is proposed to do with regard to these walls?  Is the Minister aware that the money to which he recently referred as having being spent on the quays was spent, first of all, on packing piles with sand and tarmacadam?  This was not allowed to settle, with the result that the job has to be partially redone now.  Is the Minister aware that this is the sort of nonsense that is going on?  All this time not pounds, or hundreds of pounds, but thousands of pounds are spent every year and there <Col N="147" /> is still very little to show for the expenditure.</P>
    <P>Drogheda was one of the best harbours in the country.  At one time the turnover for boats was twice as fast in Drogheda as it was in any other port in the country.  The position now is that they have got one fairly usable crane.  They have another second-hand crane, disposed of by another harbour commission because it was dangerous. It fell into the river, being top heavy. This is what is given to the workmen in Drogheda.  And they are asked to compete.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister aware that an old dredger there for many years, which was barely kept afloat, was doing far better work than the new boat bought in Holland, which can be used only in a limited way, and which is hired out to other harbours because it can do good work in a certain type of bottom, but cannot do it in Drogheda where the bottom is different from that in very many other areas?  Would the Minister consider having an investigation by one of his senior officials into what is happening?</P>
    <P>The Minister must be aware that the harbour master is no longer there.  He was promoted and has gone elsewhere. Does he consider a harbour master necessary?  There is a very efficient secretary there.  Would a berthing master be better?  Would the Minister consider appointing someone who knows the area because, if he does not do something pretty quickly, Drogheda as a seaport will disappear off the map?  Is the Minister aware that very many people who should bring their goods through Drogheda do not do so? They bring them in through Dublin and then by lorry to Drogheda and the surrounding district.  There must be some reason why that is done.  Fertilisers, which could be brought straight into Drogheda, are being brought by road.  Apart from adding to the congestion on the roads, this also adds to the cost of the fertiliser.  Why cannot this be channelled through Drogheda?  Why cannot some depot be erected to allow this to be done?  I am not blaming the Minister personally for this, but I <Col N="148" /> assure him the situation is anything but healthy.  Something must be done about it.  There are harbour commissioners there and I am sure they are doing their best.</P>

      <P>I am not prepared to agree because, if there is someone directly under a Minister who is not doing his job, then it is the Minister's business to see to it that the job is done.  So long as they are allowed to carry on and not do their job, either because they do not know it or because they do not want to&mdash;it is one of two reasons&mdash;it is the Minister who must do something about it.</P>
      <P>It must be ten years, possibly 11, since there was a £256,000 job proposed there.  Meath County Council were asked to guarantee a loan of £20,000.  Louth County Council were to give some more and Drogheda Corporation some more.  The Minister told me, I think, that £83,000 had been spent.  All there is to show is a quay wall on which piles were erected, with some packing put at the back.  That has not been effective because it was not allowed to settle and it has now to be repaired once more.</P>
      <P>There is just one other matter in relation to Drogheda Harbour Commissioners which might interest the Minister.  In 1948 a local government superannuation scheme was introduced. Practically every local authority is operating that scheme. Drogheda Harbour Commissioners are not.  I suggest they should be asked why not because there are a great number of people, some of them getting on in years, who have no pension rights, not because they cannot be given a pension but because they will not be given one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a dump belonging to Drogheda Corporation beside the river.  The Corporation have been making a fair attempt to keep that dump in good order.  When a high tide comes, all sort of bottles, cans and boxes are carried down the river <Col N="149" /> and out along the beaches on both sides.  Someone should tell the commissioners they should erect a suitable fence to prevent this happening.  Two or three years ago they put a little bit of wire netting across and the first high tide took wire netting, bottles, boxes and all away.  It seems to me to be a simple matter to remedy this situation.  It is one that could be dealt with easily.</P>
    <P>The Minister dealt in detail with tourism.  It is a very big industry. Down through the years there have been various complaints about hotel charges and charges for meals in cafes.  The good name of the country was affected.  Indifferent meals were also a matter of complaint.  The situation does not seem to have improved very much.  It is not necessary to have a foreign accent going into some of these hotels and cafes to be charged a little extra; if you have an accent which is not of the district, that is considered good reason by some people to charge you much more than what is normally charged, and certainly a greal deal more than it is worth.  Hotel charges are pretty high. It has been said that they compare fairly well with continental charges. That may be, but, if we take the cost of living in other countries and compare it with the cost of living here, then our hotel charges are, I think, one of the dearest items.  This is something on which Bord Fáilte should keep a very close eye; otherwise, people will stop coming here because they will not pay exorbitant charges for indifferent food.</P>
    <P>I am a pioneer and this does not affect me very much but I know that if one goes into an hotel, even a bottle of Seven-Up costs more than in a publichouse and the same applies to beers and spirits, just because the hotels have a carpet.  The sky appears to be the limit in relation to some of their prices and they seem to think that they must get back the cost of the extra fittings every night.  This is something that requires attention.</P>
    <P>In recent months attention has been paid to the finding of accommodation throughout the villages and small towns <Col N="150" /> in regard to what are called farmhouse holidays, where bed and breakfast are available and which most people travelling around the country require.  I notice that in the West this seems to be a big thing and it is to be welcomed because bed and breakfast can be obtained at a modest price in most of these places.  The Minister might consider giving some assistance to those who are attempting to put their houses in order in this regard, particularly in the seaside resorts, so that they may be able to accommodate visitors during the summer.  At present, certain qualifications are laid down before an hotel can be called such, and to be recognised as a guesthouse a place must have nine bedrooms, but there are quite a number of people in seaside districts who have one or two bedrooms available and who are prepared to provide accommodation for visitors. Many people would prefer to stay in these places if they could and if some encouragement were given to owners of such premises it would be a step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>The great trouble about tourism is the way in which the grants are made available.  This morning on the radio I heard a report to the effect that Salthill would soon have the biggest promenade in the country.  We are all glad that Salthill has done so well but somebody should point out to the people in authority that there are more tourist resorts than Salthill.  I would make a particular plea for the small resorts which seem to be completely neglected.  I live in a seaside resort where we claim, and nobody can contradict this, to have seven miles of the finest beach in the country.  We get very little from the Tourist Board.  We have a very good development association and we had a visit from one of the officials of the Tourist Board towards the end of the season.  He promised to help us and before he left us he gave us some brochures.  When we looked at the brochures we found that while certain places on the east coast were shown, such as Drogheda, Balbriggan and Skerries, the people who had produced the map had never heard of Gormanston, Laytown, Bettystown or <Col N="151" /> Mornington.  They just did not appear. Yet we offer very safe bathing and a very safe beach.  Bettystown has one of the finest golf links in the country.  Unfortunately, the clubhouse there was burned down a few years ago and they set about rebuilding it.  They applied for a grant for the new one and they received a query to know if it would encourage tourists in the area.  In reply it was pointed out that many tourists used the golf links but apparently the powers that be decided that that was not enough and they received no grant. I am sure that if this had been in Lahinch or Salthill a substantial grant would have been made available.  The whole thing would probably have been built for them.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech referred to the local authorities and the amount they provide for tourism from the rates. I should like to remind the Minister that in Meath&mdash;and the same happens elsewhere&mdash;we had to spend £15,000 from the rates to build a park and a road to it and two tennis courts.  We could only get something in the region of £600 from Bord Fáilte.  When the Minister talks about the amount of money spent on tourism from the rates, he might remember that what is paid to the Tourist Board is not all that is spent on tourism.  Good money is being spent by the local authorities in the same way as if they gave it to Bord Fáilte.  There is no use saying that the local authorities are mean and that they do not give enough.</P>
    <P>I am sure that if the Minister were to visit any of the areas about which I have been talking he would agree with me that money could be usefully spent there.  He would also agree with me that in view of the fact that places like Salthill are packed to capacity, that they have as many as they can take, it would be a good idea if some effort were made to popularise some of the areas which do not get as many tourists.  He might be persuaded to do something about areas which are adjacent to big towns.  Laytown, Bettystown and Mornington are beside Drogheda, which has a population of about 20,000, and covers a hinterland <Col N="152" /> of nearly 100,000 people who must use that area.  However, apart from the beach, the golf club and now the tennis courts we have very little to offer tourists.  If the Minister would consider spreading the money around it might be one way of attracting tourists rather than putting all the eggs in one basket.</P>
    <P>I have been talking about seaside resorts but in my constituency there are quite a number of tourist attractions which might possibly get more attention from the Minister's boards. One of them, of course, is Tara.  We have been blowing hot and cold about Tara for as long as I can remember. The last official report I heard about it was that the Board of Works proposed to purchase the Hill and make it a national monument.  There was a proposal that Bord Fáilte would erect some kind of museum there and do other things.  This has been talked about for 12 or 15 years in my memory, and probably for another 30 or more years outside my memory, but we do not seem to be getting any further with it.  As far as I know, the decision announced by the Minister for Education, when he was in the Board of Works, and that was quite some time ago, that it was proposed to take over Tara, does not seem to have been followed up.  It is still in private ownership and perhaps some day we will wake up to find that a German or somebody else has purchased it and will erect a plastic palace on it and start collecting dollars from people visiting it.</P>
    <P>Tara is a national monument and Bord Fáilte or the Government do not have to declare it to be such to protect it.  It is a national monument and it should be preserved for and by the nation.  Would the Minister try to do something about it because everybody is tired of hearing about this rush to do something about it and then hearing nothing further until somebody tries to raise the matter once more? We have more than our share of ruins in my constituency, all of them of great historical interest, and it was suggested that one of the old castles might be used in much the same way as Bunratty is used.  If it were in Clare or in <Col N="153" /> Galway, that would be done, but as it is, the suggestion seems to have died very quickly.</P>
    <P>In Kells and Navan, we have many old monuments which are well worthwhile visiting.  We do not seem to get very much publicity.  The monthly issue of the periodical by Bord Fáilte is quite a good effort with good pictures but again it appears as if County Meath is included only very rarely. I ask the Minister to do something to have County Meath publicised.  We also have the Boyne Valley.  When the regional tourist boards were being set up there was great blowing of trumpets about the wonderful things they would do.  I am sure those appointed to run the boards and the members are doing what they think best in the interests of tourism but I suggest that, as far as I can see, they do not seem to have been very successful.  I also suggest that it requires something out of the ordinary to get some use out of the boards and this is something to which the Minister might give a little attention.</P>
    <P>The number of people coming to the country is increasing; the number spending money here is increasing but it is not increasing fast enough mainly because the Minister is too conservative and the boards under him are sticking too much to conventional ways of doing things.  I believe he could do a lot for tourism if he got those responsible to give more attention to the matters to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>I also wonder whether or not the Minister has ever considered trying to publicise winter holidays here. Despite what people say about very severe winters we do not get them here and those who live in countries where winters are really severe might be tempted to come here if our attractions were publicised.  Near where I live there is a holiday camp that for 16 or 17 weeks takes up to 4,500 people a week, many from Ireland but very many also from across the water, from various parts of Europe and America.  I have noticed that people who come from abroad are not the wealthy people&mdash;they are very few <Col N="154" />&mdash;but are usually ordinary, working people.  I suggest these people are the people we should cater for.</P>
    <P>That brings me to my final point. We have been building hotels for millionaires and either they have not heard about them or are not too anxious to try them out.  The Minister could very well see to it that if money is to be spent providing hotel accommodation it should be spent on middle class hotels as that is the type the ordinary tourists want to use whether they are our people coming home on holidays or some of the thousands who left here for good, mainly for economic reasons, but who like to come back occasionally.  They do not go to super hotels but to middle class hotels.  I sincerely believe that we have not enough of that type of accommodation and that the business of expecting people to stay in hotels which would probably cost them as much for one night as they would earn in a week, is not working out.  I know that some people who come here, for status reasons, particularly if they are on expense accounts, like to stay in a top-class hotel.  That will continue but so many come who have just whatever they save for their holidays and they should be entitled to comfortable accommodation and good food.  That can be provided in abundance, but if we are going to do it we must make far more arrangements than we have at present to cater for that type of tourist.</P>

      <P>It is obvious that there is money in tourism for the areas with a tradition in this respect and partcularly for the areas that got in early.  Unfortunately, places that started later, mainly the inland areas, do not see the benefits of tourism to the same extent.  I live in an inland area that suffers in this respect and I feel that Bord Fáilte should turn their attention still further to such areas.  The establishment of regional councils and the appointment of officers to them were very definite steps in that direction and even at this stage have benefited these areas to <Col N="155" /> some extent and I think will continue to benefit them further.</P>
      <P>Our main tourist attraction is the River Shannon.  This, we hope, will continue to become an even greater attraction as time goes on.  Bord Fáilte have taken an interest in the river and the result of their work is to be seen at Rooskey and Carrick-on-Shannon. It is to be hoped that other smaller places on the river will, in the near future, receive the necessary attention which will establish them as landing places from the river for the villages along the Shannon.  We are anxious that the part of the area which is marked out for the Rockingham Estate should be developed soon and I should like to know from the Minister what stage of development has now been reached and when it is likely that work will begin on it because it is felt in the area that until this part of it is fully developed the area will not be able to exert its full attraction for visitors around the lake.</P>
      <P>Before leaving the Shannon I should mention the Grand Canal.  This, it appears, will be a source of controversy for a long time to come unless something definite is done about it.  The views put forward to me are that, as I understand it, until people cease to use the canal it cannot be closed.  My informants say this is a national problem and an Act of Parliament may change that at any time if we so desire. They want, if at all possible, to have it decided that the canal will not be closed.  If that were done it would mean that those interested in having both the canal and the Shannon would be prepared to spend more money on developing both.  In this way the amenities of the area would be extended still further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ours is an inland area not very well known to tourists and to date it has to depend more or less on passing traffic moving from one point to another in the country.  Until such time as it is brought to the notice of tourists, it cannot get the full value of tourism. To get it established, it must have signposts and signposts seem to be a <Col N="156" /> difficult problem.  Naturally, many people are seeking signposts in their own areas throughout the country and it seems that we have been left to the last.  Bord Fáilte state that they have not the necessary money.  This is understandable but I also understand that the county council is mixed up with the allocations of signposts and, all in all, it seems to be a cumbersome procedure to get even one or two signposts.  Signposts are vital to areas that have no tradition of tourism behind them and until those signposts are put up, passing tourists will be unaware of the attractions of the area.  I would ask the Minister to direct the attention of Bord Fáilte to this and to request them to look into these areas that seem to have been left behind.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of tourism to which I should like to refer.  In the West, the small farmers or the middle sized farmers must, in some way, supplement their income and tourism is one way of doing it.  The two counties which I represent can be helped to further development by means of tourism.  The further development I would suggest is the development of coarse fishing.  We have numerous lakes in Leitrim and Roscommon and if these were more intensely developed, it could mean more visitors and the people in those areas could go on developing the guesthouses and farmhouses for this purpose.</P>
    <P>Deputy T. O'Donnell this evening covered the question of guesthouses and farmhouses adequately and I do not intend to repeat what he has said. However, as regards five-roomed guesthouses, I would say that in virgin areas where there is no experience of tourism, five rooms is too much for a start.  These people may never have seen tourists around them and in these virgin areas, as I call them, there should be a different approach.</P>
    <P>In regard to the coal mining situation in Arigna, once more we have heard it has been decided that no further development of the coal in Arigna can be done by the ESB. That is disappointing.  The figures shown to us certainly suggest that no further development is possible, but I hope this is not a final answer to our <Col N="157" /> question down there.  I hope the situation changes and that there will be a change of outlook in this matter. It was one of the industries which meant a lot to north Roscommon and part of Leitrim.  If it could be further developed, it would be one way of helping us in an area of falling population.</P>

      <P>The annual Estimate for the Department of Transport and Power gives this House an opportunity of covering a very wide field.  If there is any Minister who could present this House with what could be a great record of achievements and advancements, it is the Minister for Transport and Power.  This Department covers the entire field in relation to CIE, harbours, shipping, the air companies, the Shannon Free Airport Development Company, Bord Fáilte, the ESB and Bord na Móna.  The Minister who is responsible for the activities of these Boards can, by taking a keener interest and by asking these Boards to conform with the wishes expressed in this House by public representatives, do a very valuable job of work.  The Minister is seemingly content to leave as day to day matters of the boards matters which we in this House consider to be of very great importance.  In order to cultivate a greater spirit of friendship between Members of this House and these boards, the Minister should endeavour to give the House more information in reply to Parliamentary Questions than he has given in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to make reference, and I do so with very great pride, to the Shannon Free Airport Development Company.  I have spoken on the activities of this company in this House on numerous occasions.  On every possible occasion, I have expressed the opinion that here we have clear and ample evidence of a company making great strides and showing progress.  If I am asked what is meant by progress, I have to say I measure progress by what I see.  As a result of the activities of the Shannon Free Airport Development <Col N="158" /> Company, I have seen buildings; I have seen factories; I have seen workers working; and I have seen good pay packets.  To me that is progress.</P>
    <P>I am also impressed by the fact that in 1960 there were fewer than 500 people employed at Shannon in these industries; in 1961, there were close on 500; in 1962, over 1,000; in 1963, 1,500; in 1964, slightly over 2,000; in 1965, just 3,000; in 1966, almost 3,500. This company are responsible for giving employment in the industrial estate and the warehouse area to a total of 4,000 people.  They have a very fine record in relation to industrial development. Córas Tráchtála has estimated exports from the Shannon Industrial Estate at over £22 million for the year ending 31st January, 1965, and that figure of £22 million has, I understand, every prospect of increasing substantially. That figure of £22¼ million for the year ended 31st January, 1965, is equivalent to 28 per cent of the total of Irish manufactured exports.</P>
    <P>It is no harm to mention that the Shannon industrial area has been the subject of criticism from time to time. It is unreasonable for any section of the community to offer unwarranted criticism of the activities at Shannon Airport.  We have witnessed here real advancement and real progress and I want to pay tribute to the members of the Board.  It is no harm to give a clap on the back to those responsible for the progress at Shannon.  That progress is something of which we can be proud. We can be proud of the extensive, progressive, well-designed, beautifully laid-out factories and all the facilities that go with them.  When I see clear and ample evidence of progress, I want to praise it.  So far as I am concerned, any encouragement or help I can give towards the further development of Shannon as an industrial area I will gladly and readily give.  That industrial estate is one of our showpieces.  There we have something practical to show; there we have workers at work.</P>
    <P>People may say that the names of the industrialists cannot be described as being all too Irish.  I do not mind what name goes up over a factory, so <Col N="159" /> long as it is employing Irish workers at home in their own country.  I would much prefer to see foreign industrialists coming to this country and setting up at Shannon, where facilities are available and where they will receive help and co-operation, and to see Irish boys and girls being employed there than to see our people emigrating and working in factories elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I trust that the Department of Transport and Power will give every support and every assistance to the Board who, in my opinion, have produced a fine record.  I am sure that the Board are actively engaged in making new contacts with industrialists. I do not know what effect the Anglo-Irish Trade Agreement will have on Shannon, whether beneficial or otherwise.  I hope the Minister has been in touch with his colleagues in regard to this matter to ensure that the Agreement will be beneficial to Shannon.</P>
    <P>Competition for the establishment of industries is becoming increasingly keener.  At present, Northern Ireland is offering a far greater degree of encouragement for the establishment of industries in the north of Ireland than we in the Republic are offering. Therefore, I hope that the Government will put the Shannon Development Company in a position to be able to compete with Northern Ireland or any other competitor in attracting foreign industrialists.  I hope that promotional efforts are increasing, that the good record at Shannon will continue and that the company will have an even greater degree of sucess.</P>
    <P>The Minister is probably more aware than any of us of the valuable and useful national work that has been undertaken by the Shannon Free Airport Development Company Limited.  I venture to say that no company set up under any State Department can show the same record of success and achievement as that company.  I am sure the Minister will agree with me on that.  When Deputies see progress of that kind, they should <Col N="160" /> pay the tribute that is so well deserved.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the Minister, if it were necessary, to take a very special interest in the activities of this development company.  If the Board make recommendations to him, I trust they will be considered favourably and sympathetically.  I cannot say what plans the company may have for increasing the number employed at Shannon but, as a member of the Opposition, I may say that what I saw there impressed me.  The achievements of the company impressed me as being greater than those of any other body set up since the State was founded.  I hope their efforts will continue to be crowned with success.</P>
    <P>I am not too happy about the activities of the ESB in relation to rural electrification.  Deputy James Tully referred to this matter tonight.  There are many pockets in rural Ireland where the people are anxious to avail of light and power but cannot do so because the cost is prohibitive.  The ESB was originally designed to provide a full service.  There is no use saying it is doing so when the people cannot afford to meet what are considered excessive charges.  There are many parts of my own constituency, as well as places the length and breadth of the country, where there is no hope of light and power reaching the poor people there who are not in a position to pay these excessive charges.  I would ask the Minister to enter into consultation with the ESB to take steps to solve this problem.  The demand is there.  All that is preventing these people getting supply is the fact that they cannot pay excessive charges. This problem must be tackled, even if the State has to provide a very substantial subsidy.</P>
    <P>I should like to know from the Minister what has happened to the additional briquette factory that was to be established near Shannonbridge in Offaly.  Some time ago arrangements were made for the erection of another briquette factory.  The technical people from the Department, the ESB and Bord na Móna carried out a thorough investigation of the area and a suitable <Col N="161" /> site was decided on for the erection of the new factory.  I tabled a number of questions to the Minister from time to time.  I have refrained from asking any questions of late on this matter.  I was presuming it might have been the credit squeeze or other reasons which were preventing the Government going ahead with the briquette factory.  I would ask the Minister in all seriousness to proceed with the erection of the new factory.  There is a growing demand for briquettes.  They are a cheap fuel and the percentage of heat they give cannot be equalled.  The demand for briquettes is far greater than the present supply.  I would ask the Minister to make arrangements during the coming financial year for the placing of the contract and the commencement of the construction of the new briquette factory on the site selected at Shannonbridge.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to harbours. I think the Department could do much more than they are doing in regard to harbours.  I could not agree more with any Deputy than I agree with Deputy James Tully in his remarks concerning Drogheda harbour.  It is one of the finest harbours in this country. I could never understand why people from parts of County Louth, particularly Dundalk, and parts of Monaghan, bring in their goods to the North Wall in Dublin and transport them by road from Dublin to various parts of Louth, Cavan and Monaghan.  Because of the high volume of traffic on the roads, an effort should be made to divert as much of this traffic as possible to Drogheda.  I believe it would be possible to divert a good deal of the traffic coming to Dublin to Drogheda port.  The harbour in Drogheda is, without doubt, one of the finest harbours on the east coast.  It is a pity the equipment there is not better and that the port is not developed as one of the most modern in the country. The only other harbour I have knowledge about is Waterford harbour. Waterford harbour has the appearance of business and development.  Yet I feel more business from the south of <Col N="162" /> Ireland and parts of the south-east could be directed to it.</P>
    <P>There was also a reference to the activities of Bord Fáilte.  Everybody seems to ask that some area in their constituency be singled out for special attention by Bord Fáilte.  I want to refer again to Clonmacnoise, probably the most historic and most ancient national monument we have.  It is the resting place of saints and bishops, of kings and princes.  Yet, if one goes to the offices of Bord Fáilte, and asks for photographs of Clonmacnoise, I do not believe they are available.  In the brochures published by Bord Fáilte Clonmacnoise is mentioned just as another place and no more.  It simply gets a mention on the signposts as convenient to Moate.  Every tourist coming to Ireland should get an opportunity of visiting Clonmacnoise.  There is real history there.  There the tourist has something to see and something to learn.  No national monument in this country today has the historic background of Clonmacnoise; yet Bord Fáilte have never given it the publicity it deserves.  I make a genuine appeal to the Minister to direct the attention of Bord Fáilte to the need for further publicity for Clonmacnoise.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to hotel charges and to other complaints which have been registered by tourists in this country from time to time.  I cannot speak of these complaints as I have no personal knowledge of them.  When I have no personal knowledge of them, I make no reference to them.  I feel that the Minister would be well advised, if he has large sums of money to spend on seaside resorts, not to put all his eggs in one basket but to spend sums on smaller seaside resorts.  I could never understand, with the money spent on Tramore from time to time, how Tramore has not developed to a greater extent.  I cannot say whether or not the Minister visits Tramore but I wonder if he is satisfied, because of the amount of money that has been spent on Tramore, that sufficient development has taken place there.  There is room for considerable development and expansion, and for considerably <Col N="163" /> greater expenditure, in Tramore.</P>
    <P>It is all the same to the people who live in the midlands of Ireland whether they go to Salthill, Tramore, Laytown or Bettystown; they are the same distance away.  I really feel the time has come when the Minister should ask Bord Fáilte to present him with proposals for the development, on a long term basis, of the smaller seaside resorts along our coasts.  In selecting an area for holidays, people are now commencing to select the less overcrowded districts.  That is why the smaller areas by the seaside which have not been developed to any great extent should now be developed.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte should present the Minister with a five-year or a ten-year plan for the development of smaller seaside resorts.  There are many areas now in which holidaymakers do not seem to enjoy their stay because of overcrowding. For that reason, I think the development of the smaller areas might ease the pressure on the more highly developed areas.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear Deputy James Tully make reference here tonight to the holiday camp in his constituency. It might be wise if the Bord Fáilte people took a leaf out of the book of the very excellent service rendered to this country by Butlin's Holiday Camp. Here we have a holiday camp on the east coast, under strict supervision, of the highest possible standards, with excellent organisation, well known for courtesy, kindliness, welcome and hospitality. If there is any reason why the holiday camp at Mosney has been such a success, it is good supervision, courtesy, kindliness, good service, good value and welcome to those who frequent it.  If the same hospitality, courtesy, kindliness and welcome were extended in other areas, there would be less criticism.  One thing is that, no matter whom you meet who has had the privilege of a holiday at Butlin's, there is the assurance of having received value for money.  I never had a holiday there, lest people might think I had any experience of it.  I have been there as a visitor from time to time. I have met people of all ages who say that they enjoyed their holiday in the <Col N="164" /> holiday camp.  On an occasion such as this, I think that we here in Parliament ought to express our appreciation to Sir William Butlin and to those responsible for the administration of such a fine holiday camp that gives enjoyment and pleasure, good value and good service to those seeking that type of holiday in this country.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister what plans Bord na Móna have for future development.  My constituency is primarily concerned with the activities of Bord na Móna.  There seems to be a falling-off of employment in Bord na Móna.  The general opinion amongst those who have been associated with Bord na Móna in employment over the years is that things are tightening up there and that the same amount of employment in the future will not be given as is given now and as has been given in the past.  It would be most regrettable if we did not continue, as far as possible, to develop our bogs to the fullest extent.  Again, as in the case of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company, I should be wrong if I did not pay a tribute to the manner in which Bord na Móna have developed the bogs in my constituency.  It is something of which we are very proud.  The development of the bogs in County Offaly has transformed the appearance of the county.  Where there was once the appearance of poverty, it is now a hive of activity.  We are glad to be associated with that and we want that degree of activity to continue and, in so far as it is possible, we desire that all the workers employed by Bord na Móna will be retained.</P>
    <P>I often wondered if the Minister ever arranged with the Forestry Branch to have some scheme whereby the Forestry Branch would prepare and plant cutaway bogs in the season when Bord na Móna workers are slack.  In that way, Bord na Móna workers could be transferred without delay to the Forestry Branch for the preparation and planting of cutaway bogs for forestry purposes.  I suggested some years ago to the Minister that he should get into consultation in this connection with the Forestry Branch.  I recall raising the matter on the Estimate for the Department of Lands.  I do not know <Col N="165" /> if anything was ever done about it but I think it is quite possible that there could be a dovetailing of activities between the Forestry Branch and Bord na Móna in relation to the preparation and planting of cutaway bogs by Bord na Móna workers during their slack period of the year.</P>
    <P>The Department of Transport and Power should also consider the possibility of the erection of coal-burning power stations, if such a thing is possible. We have in my constituency a number of turf-burning stations at Rhode, Shannonbridge and Portarlington. I think Deputy Gibbons made a slightly similar reference.  I would like to see in the Doonane, Crettyard, Wolfhill area, which is my area, a power station erected to utilise the coke and anthracite produced in the Doonane area.  In this district of Doonane in Laois, which is not too far away from Castlecomer, there are a large number of unemployed people, with no prospect of employment.  The development of the local coalmines does not look too good.  Nobody wants to invest large sums of private money in the development of coalmines today. The amount of money required is too great.  When speaking of developing coalmines, one must speak in millions, not thousands.  I think, just as Bord na Móna stepped in in the case of the development of our native fuel, and may I say, with credit and success, Bord na Móna would be well advised to take whatever steps either they or the ESB could take in an area where we have prospects of developing the use of anthracite or coal.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gibbons referred to the Arigna, County Leitrim, area of his constituency.  I make similar reference in regard to the Wolfhill, Doonane and Mayo areas of County Laois.  That is south of the county, convenient to Carlow and convenient to north County Kilkenny.  It is a depressed area for employment.  Because of the quality of the land, people are in poor circumstances, and again, it is mainly a mining district.  It is an area in which there is a good mining tradition.</P>
    <P>Most of the miners from around that area have in recent times emigrated to mines in Wales and in England.  That <Col N="166" /> is a great pity, because mining has been a tradition of the area.  Generations have been engaged in mining and it would be a pity if these mines should have to close down, or remain as they are, and if we have to face a time of no prospect of development. Would the Minister arrange that either Bord na Móna or the ESB examine the possibility of the utilisation of anthracite for power?  I feel that something can, and should, be done about it.  I am not too happy that it has not been very fully explored.</P>
    <P>It is too bad, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, that the Taoiseach will soon be retiring.  It is also too bad that, despite the record of industrial achievements for which he may take credit, what we can describe as a masterful blunder on his part was the creation and establishment of CIE in the first instance.  I was a member of this House in 1944 when the Taoiseach, then Minister for Industry and Commerce, announced his intention of bringing in his Transport Act at that time, and announced the birth of CIE.  He had great hopes for the company at that time.  As a matter of fact, we all had great hopes at that time because he was so convincing in his argument that he did succeed in convincing the country in 1944 and succeeded in convincing this House that there was really something in the establishment of CIE.</P>
    <P>In 1944, during the general election campaign, the Taoiseach spoke in Carlow in reference to the establishment of CIE and it is very interesting to recall what he said.  He said:</P>
    <P>The Government proposes the establishment of a national transport organisation, operating under Government supervision, charged with the reorganisation of transport services so as to ensure that cheap and adequate facilities will be available in every area.</P>
    <P>The new company will be constituted from the amalgamation of the Great Southern Railways and the Dublin United Tramways Company.</P>
    <P>The economies resulting from the scheme will mean cheaper rates for transport, better services, and will <Col N="167" /> give transport workers better security of employment and remuneration which they can never have unless such a reorganisation is effected.</P>
    <P>The Government believes that a really efficient national transport organisation, with up-to-date equipment, can give private traders a better and a cheaper service than they can give themselves in normal circumstances.</P>

      <P>Mr. Lemass, addressing a meeting in Carlow on 6th May, 1944, published in a reprint in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> of 16th January, 1966.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach is a much wiser man today.  What is the present situation in so far as CIE is concerned?  Has it not been that we have had no cheap transport, no security for workers, railway stations sold, railway lines torn up, hundreds of miles of railway abandoned altogether, traders not getting as good a service as they were getting and road freight charges completely out of the reach of the people?</P>
      <P>There was to be cheap transport for everybody when CIE was established. Not alone were we to have cheap transport, but we were to have efficient transport.  It was going to be one and the other&mdash;cheap and efficient. Is it not correct to say that the subsidies this House had to vote for CIE have been enormous and that CIE was a complete failure?  Let us make up our minds on that&mdash;a failure. CIE was established, the Taoiseach tells us, to provide cheap and efficient transport, and it did neither.  It did not provide cheap transport and most certainly it did not provide efficient transport.</P>
      <P>On the subject of cheap fares, it is interesting to read what the Taoiseach said in the Dáil in September, 1944:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is obvious that Dublin transport facilities will be substantially expanded and cheapened.  Cheap fares to housing districts and to suburban <Col N="168" /> dwellings generally will be the function of the new company.</P>
    <P>That is what the Taoiseach said in 1944: cheap fares to all the housing districts around Dublin.  Not alone were they to be cheap and efficient but these new services were being provided by CIE.  The only conclusion we can come to is that all this talk was complete nonsense.  It was most regrettable that private enterprise was interfered with.  CIE has cost this State fabulous sums of taxpayers' money and its general conduct has not been too creditable or too good.</P>
    <P>Personally, I have had no confidence in the Board of CIE, more particularly when I read a cutting from the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 13th January, 1966, dealing with a Labour Court hearing of a claim on behalf of the Transport Salaried Staffs Association.  Evidence was being given before the Labour Court and there was a staff relations officer, a Mr. Redmond, giving evidence on behalf of CIE.  He said that the company felt that it would be wrong to hold open competitions for the recruitment of young men to clerical positions when the company was not in a position to give even a reasonable guarantee as to their future in the organisation.  Because of the problem concerning uncertainty, the company recruited temporary clerks to fill all permanent vacancies.  That is not a very good position in any company.</P>

      <P>Reference was made earlier tonight on the Private Members' motion to CIE pensioners.  Enough has been said about that.  There is no need to bring it into this Estimate but I want to avail myself of the opportunity to say here and now, with full responsibility as a Member of this House, that it was disgraceful that Dr. Andrews should have got the pension he did get out of CIE after five years.  To give one man £60 a week pension was nothing short of a national disgrace, having regard to the fact that in order to keep CIE going, the taxpayers of this country had to have their moneys voted by this House and when we see so many engine drivers, bus drivers, bus conductors, railway porters and men of the permanent way staff of CIE, almost 2,000 of them, with less than 30/- per week pension after doing the practical work in the company. Here we have a man who walked in from Bord na Móna and he gets a pension of £60 a week and on his birthday takes over another job as Chairman of Teleís Éireann.</P>

      <P>Two wrongs do not make a right.  To give a man £60 a week pension from CIE, the huge lump sum he got and a job on <Col N="170" /> his birthday is a little too much for us to stomach.  I think it was rotten and I hope that at the right time it will be very suitably exposed&mdash;at the next general election.  I think it is bad.</P>
      <P>I want to ask this: what are the prospects for CIE?  I wonder are the prospects any better now that Dr. Andrews is gone?  I have always felt that Dr. Andrews was a hindrance to the progress of CIE.  Now that he is gone, what are the prospects for the future?  The present part-time Chairman is a member of the Board of CIE, and is, in my opinion, one of the most highly qualified men in Ireland today for that position.  I do not want to set myself up as a prophet in the House but I want to say this much.  If, for the period Dr. Andrews was Chairman of CIE, Mr. Thomas Hogan had been Chairman, the many and several blunders made by the company would not have been made.  I regard Mr. Hogan as an expert and a man of commonsense.</P>

      <P>The Chairman of CIE.  The Minister for Transport and Power has made an appointment of a part-time Chairman of CIE and I want to say that, in my opinion, the Minister was quite right in appointing the part-time Chairman he did appoint. The only thing I see wrong is this: why a part-time Chairman now, and when Dr. Andrews was there, a fulltime Chairman?  There never has been a satisfactory explanation of that. It is only right that the Minister should explain what was the change in policy of CIE in relation to the Chairman. Was it so that when Dr. Andrews was there, all powers were vested in the Chairman, and when Dr. Andrews went to Telefís Éireann, there was only a part-time Chairman who was a member of the Board appointed?  Would the Minister go fully, word for word, into the circumstances in relation to the replacement of Dr. Andrews on the Board of CIE?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="171" /> I must repeat for the record that the present Chairman is, in my opinion, competent, suitable and a practical man.  Is it not a great pity that all around him he should not have a commonsense, intelligent, reasonable and practical Board?  I do not think he has that.  The time has come when a new look should be taken at CIE. There should be a general reorganisation, a complete overhaul, a spring-cleaning which is long overdue in CIE. The only time we can debate that is here on the occasion of the Minister's Estimate.  When the Minister is replying to this debate, I hope he will give us a little more information, or is he aware of the general dissatisfaction which exists throughout the country in regard to CIE services, in regard to the charges and the staff of CIE?  Is he aware of all the overloading and the wasteful expenditure on staff cars, the necessity for so many staff cars, and the failure of high officers of CIE themselves to use CIE?</P>
    <P>I want to make reference to the plea made here by the Fine Gael Party for a full public sworn inquiry into the affairs of CIE.  If the Minister for Transport and Power had nothing to hide, would he not allow an inquiry into the conduct, a full investigation into the workings, methods, expenditure and general administration of CIE?  But the position is that the Minister is afraid of a public inquiry into this company.  I venture to use the word &ldquo;fear&rdquo;.  If there were a public inquiry into CIE, I feel it would not turn out too well.  There is nothing like renewing a sincere appeal.</P>
    <P>I want to renew the appeal from this side of the House for a full public inquiry into the affairs of CIE.  They are bad, wrong and distasteful.  There is a very strong smell from them and, for that reason, I think the Minister is cloaking up something, has something to hide or has people to hide.  There must be some reason for refusing a plea which has been made by the principal Opposition Party.  If this were a plea by an individual or group of individuals, one could understand the Minister saying they did not carry very much weight but here you have the <Col N="172" /> principal Opposition Party throwing out a challenge, making a charge and demanding a public inquiry into the administration of CIE, and the Minister holding back in fear and dread of such an inquiry.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister&mdash; since he is smiling&mdash;what has he to be afraid of, if everything is above-board, if everything is right, if there is nothing to be ashamed of?  If the inquiry reveals nothing, well and good: it will clear the air for everybody and everybody will be satisfied and happy.  But it leaves it more open to comments from the suspicious minds of this country when one hears the Minister saying he must refuse the principal Opposition Party an inquiry into CIE.  I respectfully say he is afraid of the inquiry.</P>

      <P>That is ridiculous. If I do not think it is necessary, I do not have to have an inquiry.  If the Government do not think it necessary, we do not have to have an inquiry, simply because the Opposition demand it.  The same thing would apply if this Party were on the other side of the House.  The Deputy is being absurd.  Because you refuse an inquiry does not mean you are hiding something; I am not hiding anything.</P>

I have just pointed out&mdash; and here and now repeat&mdash;that the Minister, speaking on behalf of the Government as he says he does now, sees fit to say there is no need for this inquiry.  I say that both the Minister and the Government are hiding something: they are afraid to allow a public inquiry into the administration of CIE over some years past, particularly the huge sums of money by way of subsidies voted in this House and the manner in which they have been spent.</P>
      <P>I do not propose to detain the House any longer.  I shall wind up most seriously by inviting the Minister to give us the inquiry into the activities of CIE which he has denied us.</P>

      <P>I am always kind to old warriors like Deputy Corry. I noticed in the course of this debate earlier to-night that the House was even more attenuated than it is now. There were, I think, no more than about four Members in the House altogether.  There was no one at all backing the Minister, absolutely no one.  I can only assume that the canvassing was very active and intense, and engaging the attention of the entire Party in the corridors, and that it is still going on.  However, that is a matter about which we will have more to say when the opportunity offers.</P>
      <P>The debate on the Estimate of the Minister for Transport and Power without responsibility is the only occasion given to us on which we can put questions in connection with the running of his Department.

      <P>In any event, the position in which I as an ordinary journeyman Deputy have found myself is that on many occasions I have had representations, as we call it in parliamentary parlance, from constituents concerning their vital and immediate problems.  These problems have come within the competence of the Department of Transport and Power without responsibility on innumerable occasions and invariably&mdash;I want to say this in my own defence and in defence of other Members to whom it has happened&mdash;when I put down Dáil Questions, as we are alleged to be entitled to do on any aspect of the Department's activities, I have been frustrated and denied that opportunity.  This is something which is of a very serious and fundamental nature because, in my view, it amounts to the gagging of the elected representatives of the people on matters of interest and importance to those whom we represent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is necessary to say this here because we cannot afford to write to everyone in our constituencies a letter setting out what purports to be the legal position and explaining why letters which they may write to us concerning this Department cannot be translated into questions on the Order Paper.  It is necessary that I should say this to have it on record, and I say it in the hope that it will reach a wider audience so that those who send us here will know the obstacles with which we have to grapple once we reach this House.  Many are of the opinion that membership of the Dáil &mdash;and they have been encouraged in this opinion&mdash;gives a Deputy the right to question or challenge any activity <Col N="176" /> of the Government.  That is not so. Many are of the opinion that this is a completely free and democratic assembly.  That is not so.  The point I am making is exemplified with the utmost clarity by the attitude of the Minister for Transport and Power without responsibility who stands over this complete and blanket refusal to answer questions of the nature of which I speak, which Deputies endeavour to put down on the Order Paper.</P>
    <P>The time will come, I hope, when it will be possible to alter this situation, and by the look of things, that time and that opportunity may not be long delayed, but until that time does arrive, I intend to avail of every opportunity open to me to explain to the public the manner in which we are handicapped and spancelled by the attitude of the present incumbent of this office.</P>
    <P>There has been reference to CIE.  I remember the occasion of the founding of Córas Iompair Éireann.  I recall the election in that year and the year before.  I remember sharing the views of many who at the time felt this might well be a progressive move, that there was, in fact, a need for rationalisation of our transport industry and that in line with other progressive countries the thing to do was to amalgamate such services as existed to render them more efficient, to reduce running costs and to bring into existence for the benefit of those who worked on the railways and buses an equitable set of labour relations.</P>
    <P>I remain convinced that, properly handled, this would and should have been possible.  I am satisfied in my own mind, from my experience and from such examination as it has been possible for me to make of the workers of CIE in my contacts with them on the shop floors of CIE, that this concern has reached its present condition of economic debility as a result of mismanagement of a very low order. Great praise has been lavished on the former Chairman of CIE; not alone praise, indeed, but worldly goods as well and scholastic and academic <Col N="177" /> rewards.  In my view, the running of CIE has been a classic example of how not to operate a national transport company.</P>
    <P>In so far as the workers there are concerned there has been a long and unhappy history of strikes and stoppages. The Minister, in the course of his very lengthy introductory statement consisting of 48 typescript pages, endeavoured by inference to place the blame for the deficit incurred during the last financial year on the shoulders of the workers employed by CIE.  I want to confute that as energetically and positively as I can.  There was introduced into CIE a form of management which could not have any other result than to provoke labour unrest and there was brought to labour problems an attitude of mind that more <Col N="178" /> properly belonged in a military barracks. Little or no thought, apparently, was given in those days at the beginning of CIE or during the years since to the most important element in any business&mdash;human relations; and as a result we have had from time to time stoppages which were unpleasant to us all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>Today at Question Time, I asked the Minister for Finance questions related to employees in his Department and employees of the Commissioners for Public Works concerning the number of employees in the Office of Public Works and the numbers employed in the Dublin area who are eligible for sick pay.  The reply stated that the following classes were not covered for sick pay&mdash;and for something else which at the moment is unmentionable&mdash; tradesmen, labourers (architectural districts, furniture branch and engineering), Labourers (park and garden), etc. to a total of 1,715.  There was a total, also, of 462 in various grades&mdash;temporary clerical assistants, trainee engineer technicians, etc., etc. covered only for sick pay.  I also sought information about the average service of employees of the Commissioners of Public Works in the Dublin area who are not covered for sick pay or covered elsewhere.  To my amazement, and possibly to the amazement of most other Deputies, I was informed that of the number concerned, 393, the average was 13 years service.  I submit that this is a very serious matter for this House.  These workers are doing work of public importance and it is no <Col N="183" /> secret that quite a large proportion of them have served their country.  I am sure many of them secured their appointment because of prior service in former years.  In an age when commercial undertakings, operated on the basis of making profits, provide sick pay and other benefits for their employees, it is rather strange that the Government permit this situation to continue.</P>
      <P>Not only are sick pay and other fringe benefits, such as pensions, made available to workers in such concerns as Guinness's, the oil companies and gas companies but in the ESB and in the local authorities, many of which have no great record as far as looking after their workers is concerned.  A worker with possibly only a year's service employed by a commercial undertaking which wishes to make profits for its shareholders, will receive sick pay and fringe benefits and it is rather extraordinary that the Commissioners of Public Works, for whom the Minister for Finance is responsible, allow this situation in Dublin area and throughout the country.  I could give the House list after list of private employers, large, small and medium, who not for one moment would think of exposing their employees to this type of problem.</P>
      <P>What is the problem?  If such men fall ill, they have to rely entirely on social welfare benefits.  They may be working in wet weather conditions, or working in dirty conditions.  Most of them are married men with families and if they fall ill, they have the choice &mdash;unless the illness is such that they are incapable of working&mdash;of deciding whether they will try to continue at work or remain out and suffer the subsequent substantial loss of income. In many instances these workers do go in to work when in fact it would be to the benefit of their health to remain at home and receive proper attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ESB with all its faults provides sick benefit.  CIE provides a certain measure of sick benefit and local authorities in this and other cities have a little more understanding of this problem, but yet we have the Government setting this very bad example, in <Col N="184" /> fact, a rotten example, to employers, both public and private, in relation to their treatment of their employees.  Of course, not all the employees are affected in this way.  Senior officers are not forced to go in to work because if they remained out they would be at a serious economic loss.  No; they receive sick pay.  Clerical staff have their sick pay and the engineering and administrative staffs receive sick pay.  One wonders if the consideration of the Minister for Finance and his Parliamentary Secretary is purely a consideration related to the classes of people concerned.</P>
    <P>Let me refer again to the people who are not covered for sick pay and superannuation.  In this matter I take the whole country and we find that tradesmen, labourers (architectural districts, furniture branch and engineering); labourers (park and garden); classes allied to labourers (chargehands, drivers, machine operators, etc.); park and harbour constables and gatekeepers; arterial drainage workers; harbour and marine workers; park workers (Bourn Vincent Memorial Park and Garnish Island) and Shannon Navigation employees are not covered for sick pay or superannuation. Why should this Department worry about these people, some of whom work at times in the most inclement weather?  Yet, if they fall ill, they must rely on the Department of Social Welfare because there will be no money from the Board of Works. Everybody knows that harbour and marine workers are exposed to the most inclement weather and that their occupation is most dangerous to health.  These classes have no sick pay but the people who have the sick pay are: temporary clerical assistants, the Director (Archaeological Survey)&mdash; naturally, he will have sick pay; investigators (Archaeological Survey), engineers (grade III), architectural assistants and trainee engineering technicians. Surely, in this day and age, tradesmen are technicians but the tradesmen have no sick pay.  Clerks of works, inspectors and foremen also get sick pay.</P>
    <P>This sick pay problem in respect of these workers has been pressed on <Col N="185" /> their behalf for many years.  The Parliamentary Secretary is in a long line of Parliamentary Secretaries who gave half promises but no results.  His predecessor, now Minister for Education and recently Minister for Health, indicated nearly two years ago that he was recommending that a sick pay scheme should be introduced for these workers without delay.  He even indicated that, in his view, it should be based on sick pay for 13 weeks.  The Minister for Finance, up to now, has not passed such a recommendation. The previous Parliamentary Secretary also made promises to these people. Not only are people in private employment covered by sick pay schemes but they also receive other fringe benefits. It is a poor Government who cannot even follow the example set by good employers in ensuring that employees, if they fall sick, will get sick pay while they are out and that when they retire, adequate provision will be made for them.</P>
    <P>These figures are appalling.  We have people with 13 years service employed in the Dublin area&mdash;and there may be people with just as long service in various parts of the country with the Board of Works in the same position &mdash;not getting sick pay when they are out ill.  Other organisations that do harbour work, the Dublin Port and Docks Board, and the Cork Harbour Commissioners, whose employees might be said to come into this class, are covered by sick pay and pension schemes.  Without making any reflection on those concerned, it may well be that it is much more in the interests of the Government to look after people in high salary brackets.  Some months ago there was reference to certain people retiring with very handsome lump sums.  The workers to whom I have referred get no sick pay.  Many of them get only a miserable gratuity &mdash;one week for each year of service, with certain qualifications&mdash;and yet the Parliamentary Secretary, when I asked a question today, did not even at this stage indicate that there was any immediate programme to provide sick pay for these people.</P>
    <P>It is not good enough to say that we <Col N="186" /> cannot do anything unless all those employed in the Government service in a similar capacity get the same benefit. The Parliamentary Secretary is responsible; the Minister for Finance is responsible for certain classes.  The Minister could tell us, that in respect of the employees of his Department, they all qualify for sick pay, with the exception of a handful.  The Minister for Local Government could tell us that all his employees are covered for sick pay.  What is the difference?  Are the people to whom I refer different human beings?  Do they suffer illness less often?  Are they less in need of payment of wages when they are ill? Are they less exposed to inclement weather and to illness?  I submit that the people on whose behalf I have raised this matter are in many cases much more exposed to illness and inclement weather and to hardship than many of the sections that are covered for sick pay at present.  I now call on the Parliamentary Secretary to tell us that this situation will be remedied without any further delay.</P>

      <P>I understood that the matter under discussion tonight was the subject matter of Question No. 29.  I am sure the Deputy will not mind if I point out that he expanded very considerably on that.  He dwelt for a considerable time on matters raised on other questions, apart from the one we are talking about now, No. 29.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>His speech dealt with sick pay and he appeared to me to suggest that there was a failure on the part of the Minister for Finance or on my part, or on the part of the Office of Public Works to recognise the value of a sick pay scheme and I think there was an implied allegation that there was some lack of sympathy on our part in that regard.  That is not the case and the Deputy knows it is not the case.  I think he also knows that it has always been the practice of the Office of Public Works to follow the example of good employers and to follow their practices in regard to the amelioration of workers' conditions when these practices are adopted in industry generally. <Col N="187" /> I am sure Deputy Larkin knows this is the case now and has been the case.</P>
    <P>I do not think it necessary either for me to remind him that at the present time negotiations are in train between the unions and the building industry, and I do not think it is over-sanguine to expect satisfactory solution of the sick pay problem will be evolved in the near future.  Deputy Larkin will forgive me if it occurs to me that it is in anticipation of a satisfactory result in this regard and in the fairly certain knowledge that when this eventuates, the Office of Public Works will certainly follow, he raises this question at all.  As I have said, it has been the practice, is the practice and, I hope, will continue to be the practice of the Office of Public Works to follow the conduct of good employers in this connection.</P>

No other new construction is projected by <Col N="52" /> the company at present.  No new construction is at present projected by the B &amp; I Steam Packet Company.</P>
      <P>As indicated in the Second Programme for Economic Expansion a dry cargo fleet of approximately 150,000 tons deadweight would be adequate to meet essential emergency requirements and it is intended that the fleet of Irish Shipping Limited should be maintained at approximately this level. Expansion of the fleet beyond this level would be considered in the light of commercial considerations.</P>

      <P>The acquisition of vessels by the B &amp; I Company is primarily the concern of the Board of the company.  Considerable progress has been made by the company in planning its equipment and vessel needs but final decisions have not yet been reached.</P>
      <P>To cope with the expansion of the unit load business, two German vessels have been chartered on a two-year basis.  The company expects that operation of these vessels will give the necessary experience for future decisions regarding ships.  Chartering of these two vessels is, therefore, a short term expedient.</P>

      <P>A state grant of 50 per cent subject to a maximum of £175,000 was authorised in 1960 towards the cost of a comprehensive harbour improvement scheme at Drogheda.  Pending the results of a hydraulic model investigation to determine the best means of solving the dredging problem, plans and cost of the scheme cannot be finalised. A sum of £83,200 has been paid from the grant towards the cost of portion of the scheme including a contribution towards the cost of the port dredger and certain reconstruction work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power what plans, if any, exist for improving facilities for training (i) deck and engineering officers for Irish ships and (ii) seamen, engine room and catering staff.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of training facilities for sea-going personnel is primarily a matter for the shipping companies in conjunction with certain vocational school authorities which provide special courses of instruction.  My Department, as the examining authority, specifies the standards which must be reached by candidates for certificates in the various categories and grades but does not directly undertake the training of personnel. Irish Shipping Ltd. and the British and Irish Steam Packet Co. Ltd. co-operate with the vocational education authorities about training requirements and these interests maintain liaison with the examining officers of my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish Nautical College, Dún Laoghaire, which provides courses for deck officer personnel, is at present being extended, and the additional space and better facilities will enable improved training to be provided including pre-sea courses and mid-apprenticeship release courses. Arrangements are also being made for the provision of improved equipment for radar training.  Irish Shipping Ltd. have informed me that they are establishing work study appreciation courses and management conferences <Col N="57" /> for their personnel.  The company are also encouraging certain younger ratings to study for their officer certificates and eight boys are at present receiving assistance from the company to this end.</P>
    <P>In the sphere of marine engineer training, Irish Shipping Ltd. are revising their scheme to bring it into line with modern developments and the facilities available at the Crawford Municipal Institute, Cork are being expanded for that purpose.  The Institute also provides courses in welding and work study methods.  In addition to the normal training scheme for marine engineers, Irish Shipping Ltd. are arranging pre-sea courses for young engineers who have served apprenticeships in general engineering, together with promotional and senior advanced courses for serving engineer and electrical officers.</P>
    <P>Irish Shipping Ltd. arranged within the last few months for the attendance of 25 boys at a two-week confectionery and baking course and have sent a number of cooks and chief stewards to advanced courses.  The company are examining the possibility of arranging further training in other catering skills in co-operation with the Council for Education, Recruitment and Training for the Hotel Industry (CERT).  The B &amp; I Company are also making arrangements to send their catering personnel to special courses in ships' catering.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the shipping companies and the vocational education interests concerned keep their arrangements under review and maintain liaison with corresponding interests in Britain to ensure that training facilities in Ireland keep abreast of developments abroad and are adapted as necessary to meet changing needs in nautical education.</P>
