    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I said most of what I wanted to say with regard to the White Paper last night, but there is one matter on which I should like to ask the Minister for further information. It is in relation to the Government proposals for financing the proposals in the White Paper.  I should like to urge the Minister to consider again adopting the insurance principle.  It is a sound principle, even on grounds other than the purely financial one.  It enables the State to do what the State should do in matters of health: it enables it to supplement rather than supplant the rights of individuals. If the insurance principle is adopted, the rights and responsibilities of individuals in relation to matters of health will be preserved.</P>
      <P>In connection with the White Paper, the Minister indicated that one of the matters causing general concern at the moment&mdash;it has also caused fairly widespread criticism of the present health services&mdash;is the question of deciding who is and who is not eligible for a medical card and the Minister proposes to deal with this difficulty by defining by regulation the classes of persons who will be eligible to participate in the services in future.  I think the Minister should tread just a little bit warily here.  So far as I am concerned, I dislike the present system.  It gives rise to all sorts of misunderstandings and all sorts of confusion.  A person living in one health authority area in particular circumstances with regard to family and income is entitled to a medical card covering himself and his family.  If, however, he moves into another health authority area, he may find that, with the same income and the same family circumstances, he is excluded from getting a health card.  That is certainly an undesirable situation and, generally speaking, I agree it is better that people should know where they stand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Probably the Minister's idea, which appears in paragraph 51 of the White Paper of defining these categories by classes would be an improvement on the existing position, but I want to suggest to the Minister that, in drafting his regulations, he should ensure <Col N="424" /> that any definition he gives should not be too rigid.  There should be an element of discretion left to the health authority because, in any dividing of people into groups, classes and categories, there are bound to be a certain number of hard cases.  There are bound to be the borderline cases where, if the regulation is interpreted too rigidly, a person who most people would agree should be entitled to the concession will not get it.  To my mind, what the Minister is doing now should improve the position and I would like to appeal to him to leave the element of discretion to the health authority in order to deal with the borderline case and the hard case.</P>
    <P>The White Paper deals also with the dental, ophthalmic and aural services. With regard to these I think there is no justification for any further delay on the part of the Government.  It is pointed out in the White Paper and well known to Deputies that provision for these services was made as far back as 1953.  Section 21 of the 1953 Act made provision for these services and all that is necessary to put them into operation is that a regulation be made by the Minister.  The introductory part of the White Paper sets out the difficulties the Minister sees in implementing these proposals speedily.  The plea is made that the changes proposed are complex and fairly costly and that their complexity rules out any chance of their introduction in the immediate future.</P>
    <P>That does not apply to the dental, ophthalmic and aural services.  The legislation is enacted and the necessary provision contained in section 21 of the Health Act of 1953.  That was enacted 13 years ago but the regulations are not yet made.  If the Minister wants to do anything quickly, there need not be any more delay with regard to these services.  All he has to do is to make the regulations.</P>
    <P>The final matter to which I wish to direct the Minister's attention is a constituency one.  The Minister is aware, because he has correspondence from the Rathdrum Development Association, that there is a need and a desire for a doctor's residence in the town of Rathdrum.  The association <Col N="425" /> wrote to the Minister last month with regard to this problem and in the course of their letter pointed out that they had been in constant correspondence with the county council on the subject and had written to the Minister on 30th July, 1964.  Their letter to the Minister points out that the attitude of the county council had been that the lack of a house in the town had little to do with the difficulty of getting doctors to stay in the town.  Later that attitude changed and a site was obtained.</P>
    <P>They point out that in a recent letter which they had received from the county council they were informed that in view of impending changes in the health legislation, the council, at the advice of the Department, had decided not to proceed with the acquisition for the time being.  I want to ask the Minister to reconsider his Department's decision in this matter.  It seems most unfortunate that proposed changes in the law which have no prospect of being made in the immediate future should be used as a justification for postponing the building of a doctor's residence in Rathdrum or for any other improvement in the general health services in the country.</P>
    <P>It would be a different matter if the Minister's position were that he was coming to the House and saying that he proposes as quickly as possible to introduce the necessary legislation. That is not his attitude.  His attitude is that he sees no prospect of these changes coming into operation in the immediate future.  I would strongly urge on him not to allow any delaying tactics to be attempted where the question of improvement, even in a small matter, is proposed.</P>
    <P>Our attitude to the Minister's proposals is that we want to encourage the Minister to go ahead as quickly as possible.  I believe that in 1961 when concrete and comprehensive proposals were suggested by this Party, some of which are now being adopted by the Minister in this White Paper, it should have been possible for the Government of the day to come in with a White Paper of this sort and have the necessary discussion at that stage and have <Col N="426" /> the decisions taken at that stage.  Five years have been wasted.  We do not want the Government to waste any more time and the sooner they get on with the job the better.  A few years ago they had an election poster which asked the people to let them get cracking. Let them get cracking now as far as the health services are concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been very interesting to hear and read the various speeches as to what brought about this White Paper.  There is no doubt whatever that the Labour Party can claim tremendous credit for it.  We have only to read the various statements of policy issued by the Labour Party years ago to see that, and if we put these statements of policy beside the White Paper and compare them, we will understand the part that the Labour Party have played in this matter.  The only thing I can say in relation to the introduction of the White Paper is that it is very fortunate for the people that the Government changed their Minister for Health.  There was no indication of any kind prior to the last general election that such a thing was coming about.</P>
      <P>We can also pay tribute to the people who issued a mandate to the incoming Government to do something about the health service.  And I am not forgetting the manner in which the present Minister set about his task but I am wondering how much support he will obtain in bringing about the improvements suggested in the White Paper.</P>
      <P>The Minister saw fit in his speech on the Budget to refer to the absence of Labour Deputies when he was making his speech on the White Paper.  If the Minister reflects, he will realise that there were more Labour Deputies present than the number he mentioned and that the Labour Party contribution to this White Paper has been quite good. If he wishes to reprimand any Party for their lack of attention to this White Paper, the reprimand should be given to the Deputies of his own Party.  Last night there were only two Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party in the House, the Minister and one other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a few points I should like <Col N="427" /> to make in connection with the White Paper.  We welcome its introduction but it does not go far enough.  I should like the Minister to indicate whether there is any truth in the allegations about a choice of patient for the medical profession.  It is a matter that should be cleared up.</P>
    <P>In his opening statement, the Minister says it is hoped to have a choice of chemist.  Can he not be more definite and say that the people who come within the ambit of this scheme will have a choice of chemist, just the same as he intends, some time, to give them a choice of doctor?</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated that plans have been in existence for about ten years for St. Laurence's Hospital in Cabra.  Surely it is not impertinent at this stage to ask when we shall have the new hospital in Cabra?</P>
    <P>I notice that there is to be a new general hospital and a new dental hospital in Cork.  I was surprised to learn that an international architectural competition will take place for a suitable design.  Surely an international architectural competition for a design for the hospital is not necessary? Surely we have a sufficient number of competent Irish architects who can provide us with a suitable design?</P>
    <P>Everybody who knows or is interested in the operation of dispensaries will welcome the statement that it is intended to do away with them.  The Minister did not indicate any positive change in the hospital dispensary system.  In some hospitals, the dispensary position can be every bit as bad as in some local ramshackle dispensaries.  He should take steps to ensure that people who are obligated to avail of the hospital dispensary should receive proper and courteous treatment.  I have known of many cases and I have had experience myself. When they discovered that I was a member of the Dáil, they suddenly began to run around and look after me, but, before they found out, I had been there almost two hours awaiting treatment for a fractured ankle and, because it was a messy job, I had to wait.  This happens daily in some of <Col N="428" /> the hospitals in Dublin and something should be done about it.</P>
    <P>On page 44 of the White Paper, the Minister deals with the situation with regard to the mentally handicapped. When does he consider he will be able to give effect to what is envisaged for these people?</P>
    <P>I subscribe to the remarks by some other speakers in this debate that we should make every attempt to keep health administration out of the hands of politicians, irrespective of Party. I now ask the Minister to give consideration to representation on those boards to representatives of the trade union movement or the local members employed in the various areas. Such people are in very close contact with the community and could play a very useful part in ensuring that the boards could operate in the manner desired.</P>
    <P>The Minister has indicated his concern, and rightly so, for the comfort and welfare of patients.  On occasions outside this House, he has mentioned his concern for the welfare of the nursing profession.  What does he propose to do about the comforts and welfare of the non-nursing personnel, this army of people who undoubtedly are the Cinderellas of the hospital services? In saying that, I am not suggesting for one moment that the situation as it applies to the nursing profession is anything but unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>I notice that the Minister talks about what will be done.  For example, he mentions that in Sligo County Hospital, there will be a new major expansion of 100 beds.  There is no mention of the other things that were promised to be done in this hospital that would affect the employees, such as the boilerhouse, a new chimney, a new kitchen and so on.</P>
    <P>The Minister intends to do something about the Enniscorthy Mental Hospital.  There is no mention of what will be done in the matter of accommodation for staff living in, which is so very necessary and about which the staff have made repeated complaints but without success.</P>
    <P>In his reference to Portrane Mental <Col N="429" /> Hospital, the Minister mentions that a new nurses' home will be provided there.  Naturally, we should like to know when he envisages that the new nurses' home will be available for occupation.  For many years past, having regard to the need for a new nurses' home, the suggestion was made that chalets for nurses and other staff be provided in St. Ita's Hospital.  Some of the conditions under which the nurses have to operate in that hospital are archaic in the extreme.  I entreat the Minister to arrange to have the matter of the observation rooms in this hospital looked into.  It is vitally necessary because some of the conditions under which the hospital staff have to work there are beyond imagination.  When people talk about the White Paper, or on the Estimates, they say that the welfare and comfort of the patients should be uppermost in mind, and while that is so, I submit we must not underrate the importance of looking after the staffs.  A dissatisfied, badly-treated staff in any concern can result in the concern being completely unsuccessful.</P>
    <P>A good number of statements have been made recently, coming from the Taoiseach down, in connection with lowly-paid workers.  In this morning's papers, it is reported that a Fianna Fáil Deputy speaking on the Budget indicated that there were female workers in his constituency getting £2 and £3 a week in wages.  This is not uncommon among hospital workers.  I submit there is no use in talking about it.  The people who are talking, the Taoiseach and Ministers, are in a position to do something about it.  It is most frustrating to find that up to the present there is still passive resistance on the part of those controlling hospitals to any request to bring about a reasonable wage structure.  We are told the wages and conditions of lowlypaid workers will be examined.  It is true that a considerable number of married men working in hospitals are receiving £7 10s. 0d., £8 or £9 a week.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lindsay last night in speaking of the administration of the health services indicated that because certain persons had the ear of the county <Col N="430" /> manager, they succeeded in having a bill of over £100 paid, despite the fact that they had plenty of means and that when one patient died, he left thousands of pounds.  I do not know whether this is correct or not but I am very conscious of the number of struggling families who have been denied benefits and if such a case has occurred, it should be exposed.  I seriously suggest it is Deputy Lindsay's duty to submit such information to the Minister.</P>
    <P>Going back to conditions of hospital workers, few people realise that among the non-nursing personnel, there is a system of payment which is sometimes fortnightly and in other cases twice monthly.  There is a difference.  This is not uncommon; indeed it is very prevalent among hospital workers, that they go on holidays and are not paid for the holidays until they come back. Surely this needs examination?  In many hospitals also no pay slips are issued to the staff who get no account of deductions, despite the fact that with the pay-as-you-earn system in operation, this is surely possible.  It is also true that a number of hospitals pay absolutely no overtime to any of their workers.</P>
    <P>We seem to forget that hospital workers from the nurses down are working when most other people are enjoying themselves.  They get no extra pay for working on Saturday afternoons and all day on Sundays. That being so, a case could be made for better treatment of them and in any case the least that should be given is due consideration on the part of the people responsible for the hospitals who should be prepared to sit down with representatives of the workers and try to reach an understanding with them.</P>
    <P>I have had occasion to approach the Minister, and the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Local Government, in regard to the attitude adopted by people in control of voluntary hospitals, the attitude of not being prepared to sit down with the workers' representatives and attempt to produce a reasonable charter prescribing minimum rates of pay and conditions for non-nursing personnel. Despite all our efforts, such an arrangement <Col N="431" /> has not come about.  Those who control voluntary hospitals are in a position to adopt a dictatorial attitude and when this White Paper is implemented, I hope they will not have any say in its administration.  It is about time that they were obliged to sit down and discuss decent increases in pay for the people for whom they are responsible.</P>
    <P>I note that the Minister said the coming years are bound to bring to light other needs.  All this points to the necessity to establish priorities and concentrate available resources on the achievement of the more urgent objectives.  Everybody agrees with that, but I thought it rather strange that the Minister did not set out his considered order of priorities in respect of this White Paper.  If he had done so, it would be an indication that this is not only something on paper to be shelved for a long time.  Many people have put material on paper but it is another thing to put it into operation. It is now 50 years since the 1916 Proclamation but it has yet to be put into operation.  I earnestly hope it will not be 50 years before this White Paper is implemented so far as the Fianna Fáil Party are concerned.  Certainly, if there is a change of Government and the Labour Party take over, they will give effect to proposals going beyond the White Paper, because, as I said earlier, the Labour Party advocated everything in this White Paper many years ago.</P>
    <P>Seeing that everybody who spoke about the matter was of opinion that health should be taken out of the realm of politics, I hope the Minister will not wait for the next local elections to introduce a Bill giving effect to the White Paper and then allow another few years, perhaps five or even ten, to elapse before putting it into effect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GusHealy" hpid="Mr. Healy Mr. Healy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>My contribution is more of an intervention than a speech.  Much has been said about the White Paper and its proposals and it is generally recognised, I think, even by the Minister, that it will be some years before the intentions contained in it can be <Col N="432" /> implemented.  There is one thing we could do immediately and which would be necessary no matter how perfect a Health Bill may be, that is, we should appeal for more voluntary organisations and more voluntary help. Anybody with experience realises that in this country there is a tremendous fund of sympathy and goodwill towards those of the population who are either mentally or physically handicapped. The voluntary worker can do a tremendous amount to help that section of the community on which so much attention is now being focussed, the aged.  The voluntary worker can go into the homes of aged persons, read to them, take them for walks, cook meals and help in various other ways, in a much more practical and better way than can be done by a State or local government service.  There is a tremendous fund of goodwill and a great number of workers willing to help if they can be organised, as has been done in some parts of the country, and shown how they can help.</P>
      <P>I am saying all this because I feel that, whatever delay there may be in the implementation of the services provided for in the White Paper, there should be no delay in carrying out my suggestions.  I am perfectly certain, knowing the Minister as I do, that his heart is in the right place.  I welcome his suggestions.  I know he has the best intentions in the world.  I am sure that eventually he will bring in a Bill which will be a credit to the country. In the meantime, he should appeal for help from those who are so willing to give it and who want nothing better than to feel that they are helping their less well-off brethren.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of my reply, I shall try to deal as far as possible with most of the important points raised by the Deputies on different sides of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Naturally, I suppose, little reference was made by the Fine Gael speakers to the considerable relief to the rates granted already and proposed in the White Paper.  The Fine Gael Party, for reasons best known to themselves, have been very reticent as to how their <Col N="433" /> proposals would alleviate the rates in any way.  It now appears that they make no provision whatsoever in their proposals to take the ever-increasing burden of the health demand from local taxation and, as far as they are concerned, year in year out, local rates will rise according as the demand for services increases and/or as costs of wages and salaries increase.</P>
    <P>I think I should draw attention to the fact that the White Paper states specifically that it is the Government's intention that no part of the cost of the extension of the services should fall on the rates and, further, that the Estimate before the House contains provision to ensure that in effect, subject to adjustment in respect of balances from previous years, the cost to the rates of the health services next year will not exceed the cost attributable to the present year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I have no intention of interrupting the Minister but I should like him to clarify that.  Does that mean for this year or does it cover all future years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The position, as I have said, is that the Government's decision was that the demand for health on local rates in the year 1966-67 will not exceed the actual cost incurred in 1965-66.  In addition to that, the Government have decided that an extension of existing services or the coming into operation of new services will be borne by a source other than local taxation to the order of 100 per cent.</P>
      <P>I do not know if Deputies generally appreciate the impact of this decision about the rates concession in their own areas.  To take a few examples would not be out of place.  There are 32 local authorities involved altogether and in the case of one of these, the relief will exceed 2/6d in the £; in the case of seven others, it will be between 2/-and 2/6d; in the case of five others, between 1/6d and 2/- and in the case of a further 14, it will be between 1/-and 1/6d.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Hara will appreciate more than many people the fact that there is this very important provision in the <Col N="434" /> White Paper whereby I shall have discussions&mdash;indeed, they have started&mdash; with the Minister for Local Government in order to find some method whereby there might be an equitable distribution of the burden of health charges on various local authorities. As we know only too well, some counties down the years have been carrying a burden out of all proportion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>We hope to try to come up with a solution.  It is not an easy thing.  Therefore, I think the Government's decision is a tremendous step forward.  People may say that it is all right to be preparing White Papers but when will these things come into operation.  In actual fact, I think the provision in the Estimate for the concession towards the rate in this time of year alone is £330,000.  Then, of course where the burden of local taxation is really intolerable in many instances, it is terribly important for people to know and to have some consolation in knowing, that the new services which will be proposed or extensions of existing services under the White Paper will not put another 10/-or 17/- on to the rates.  Otherwise they might say that it is grand to have new services but where will it end as far as local taxation is concerned.</P>

Practically every Fine Gael Deputy who spoke claimed that the White Paper policy is part of his Party policy for the health services. Deputy T.F. O'Higgins, in fact, went so far a few weeks ago as to claim that he wrote the White Paper. His comments in the present debate did not show that he had any great pride in its authorship.  This does not worry me, of course.  On the other hand, Deputy Kyne, speaking for the Labour Party, repeated a claim which Deputy Corish made at a Press conference shortly after the publication of <Col N="435" /> the White Paper that it was based on a scheme issued by them in 1958.  All this is rather like an inverted paternity suit.  Generally, when the issue of paternity is being decided in the courts, the object of the contestant is to disclaim paternity but here we have the other two Parties vying for the credit of having fathered the scheme in the White Paper.</P>
      <P>I, of course, naturally, read several documents published by the other Parties in relation to health policy.  I do not recognise any of them as being the father of my proposals, but, then, so much has been said by so many in this country about health policy in the past seven or eight years that it would be an ingenious person who could produce a health scheme which had no feature of any other Party's policy in it.</P>
      <P>Some at least of the Fine Gael Deputies must be familiar with the 1958 Labour Plan for the health services and I would ask them to bear with me while I say a few words in relation to it for the benefit of the rest of the House.  The main proposals in this plan, which was issued in September, 1958, are contained in paragraph (6) and I will quote it:</P>
      <P>Briefly, we propose that a new health scheme should be introduced which would cover general practitioner service, hospital treatment, specialist services, dental services, ophthalmic services and pharmaceutical services.  There will be no direct charge for general practitioner services, hospital treatment or specialist services.  There would be partial charges to some persons for the remaining services (dental, eye and pharmaceutical) but these services would be without direct charges to certain categories of persons.  The dispensary service in its present form would be abolished and all persons covered by the scheme would have a free choice of doctor. The present charges for hospital treatment would be abolished.</P>
      <P>Paragraph (9) goes on to say:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are administrative difficulties in bringing in literally everybody <Col N="436" /> within an insurance scheme. The Labour scheme would, however, embrace the vast majority of the community.  It would cover all employees irrespective of income, as well as farmers and certain other self-employed persons.  Old age pensioners and others in receipt of social welfare benefits would be automatically regarded as insured persons for the purpose of the scheme.  Insurance would be compulsory for all employees and for farmers with holdings having valuations below say £100.  It would also be compulsory for other self-employed persons below a specified income limit, say, £1,000.</P>
    <P>It was mentioned in the plan that the insurance would cover health services for dependants as well as the insured person.  It was proposed that insurance contributions from employees would be collected by means of a weekly stamp, through a link with the existing social welfare scheme, and that farmers' contributions would be collected in conjunction with their rates payments and other self-employed persons would make contributions by means of stamps.  The suggested rates for contributions were 1/3d a week from employees and a like amount from employers, 1/6d a week from farmers and 2/- a week from other self-employed persons.  The plan stated that all persons covered by the scheme would be entitled to general practitioner service with choice of doctor, the remuneration of the doctor being on a capitation basis.</P>
    <P>Deputies might wonder why I am going into great detail on the different plans of the political Parties.  I think it is a good thing.  We will see, particularly new members on both sides, where we differ, if we do differ, as far as health services are concerned.  It will be brought up to date on the record of the House.  Of course, if I have made any incorrect statements, and I do not think I have, I shall be quite willing to have them corrected. The scheme also proposed the abolition of charges for hospital services and the development of the dental services with priority for children and <Col N="437" /> the provision of drugs and medicines free for the lower income group and with some charge to others covered by the insurance.</P>
    <P>I would remind Deputies that the plan I have been quoting is that of the Labour Party which was published in 1958.  However, how easy it would be to think that it was the Fine Gael scheme I am talking about.  It will be clear to anyone who compares it with the scheme prepared by Deputy T.F. O'Higgins in 1961 that his is, in fact, a rehash of the Labour plan, heated up here and there and served with a lot of sauce, but it is a rehash of the Labour plan, and a direct &ldquo;cog&rdquo;.  Deputy T.F. O'Higgins snatched that and tried to pass it off as his own and as a new proposal of his own.  I want to put that on the record and if Deputy Fitzpatrick, the Fine Gael spokesman, wishes to contradict me, I am inviting him to do so.  He does not wish to do so?</P>

There is even the idea of collecting insurance contributions from farmers in conjunction with their rates.  Yet we have Deputy O'Higgins speaking on the White Paper and criticising us for, as he suggested, filching some part of his Party's policy and for having closed minds.

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the point raised by Deputy O'Hara, when Dr. Ryan was going around telling the local authorities about the 1953 Act, he said the proposals would not cost more than 2/6d in the £, or words to that effect.  He said that they might cost a little more in some instances but that, by and large, this was the expectation.  He has not been very far out.  You might be appalled at that and say: &ldquo;But are some local authorities not paying 32/- in the £?&rdquo;  This is not the point.  Even before the 1953 Act a considerable sum of money had to be obtained under the Health Vote from local authorities.  Of course, the figure of 2/6d has been exceeded.  It has been <Col N="440" /> exceeded because down the year there have been increases in wages and salaries, extensions of existing services and very many new services.  Provision has to be made in the Estimates to pay back moneys raised by way of loan.  I went to the trouble of asking the city treasurer in one local authority and he bore out what I have just said.</P>
      <P>Since 1961, Deputy T.F. O'Higgins's mind has been closed to any suggestion there is any fault in the basic reasoning behind the policy contained in what we will describe by courtesy of the Labour Party as the Fine Gael scheme. There is one basic issue which I think Deputy T.F. O'Higgins has not faced up to in connection with his Party's scheme, that is, whether the State is justified in stepping in to make compulsory arrangements for the provision of a service which can adequately be arranged privately.  Of course, I am referring here to the general practitioner service.  The Labour scheme and the Fine Gael scheme both jump to the conclusion that it is justifiable for the State to intervene financially between the doctor and the patient in arranging payment for these services for the entire population, or for the greater majority of it.</P>
      <P>It is here that the essential difference lies between the other Parties and the Government.  As I said in the White Paper, we base our health policy on the principle that the State should step in to organise services only where the need for them is clearly demonstrated. We are satisfied it is not demonstrated in the case of the general practitioner service for most of the population. This was the general tenor of evidence before the Select Committee.  I think commonsense will tell any Deputy that the fees payable to family doctors are not an excessively large item in the household budgets of most middle-income group people.  The big cost is not the cost of doctors' fees but the cost of drugs and medicines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This conclusion is borne out by an inquiry carried out by the Voluntary Health Insurance Board in 1964 when they made a survey of the expenses of their members on various items of medical care.  They have been kind <Col N="441" /> enough to give me some information concerning it.  The survey covered 16,419 persons.  With regard to the general practitioner services, the average cost per year for each person covered by the survey amounted to 36/-.  This, of course, was an average which covered those who did not find it necessary to attend the family doctor at all.  The average cost per person for those who had to attend the family doctor was as low as £3 16s.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">

      <P>Those big words will upset you.  We will be talking about overflying Shannon next.  The average cost for those who had to attend the family doctor was as low as £3.16 per year.  These figures are related to contributors to the Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme who are mainly in the higher-income group.  Accordingly, there can be no suggestion that expenditure on the family doctor was kept down through inability to pay. The result of this survey confirms the impression that any reasonable and sensible person has&mdash;that for a large percentage of the population, the State can well leave the financial arrangements for general practitioner services as an entirely private matter between doctor and patient.</P>

It looked from this as though the Labour Party were going to father another health scheme for Fine Gael, but this was abortive.  In <Col N="445" /> the present debate, we find Fine Gael are back again to the scheme which they advocated in 1961 and which they advocated at the last general election in their &ldquo;Towards a Just Society&rdquo;.  There are several means tests in this document &ldquo;Towards a Just Society&rdquo;.  They pieced it together just before the last general election, as Deputies will remember; then they had a press conference and had only one copy available for everyone, a well-thumbed copy.</P>

      <P>Deputy Hogan did not vote with Deputy Fitzpatrick.</P>
      <P>I should like now to refer to the Fine Gael arguments on the means test.  The criticism levelled by Fine Gael speakers at the proposals in the White Paper is that they retain a form of means test.  I never thought I should see the day when Fine Gael would be appalled at the idea of a means test.  I suppose there is no means test where social welfare benefits are concerned, and no means test for old age pensions? I did not hear Fine Gael advocate anything about that but they object to my including in the White Paper a form of means test.  Deputy Dr. Gibbons in a very able and constructive speech&mdash;we have had constructive speeches from both sides of the House&mdash;pointed out that the Fine Gael scheme had at least two means tests implicit in it, in that it would be necessary to test means in order to find who was over the income and the valuation fixed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not talking about inquisitions; I am talking about means tests.  Deputy Fitzpatrick is talking about a comprehensive-no-means-test. That does not exist.  It would be necessary to have a means test in the Fine Gael scheme to find out who was over the income and valuation limits mentioned.  It would be necessary to have a means test to decide who would be exempt from paying the proposed insurance contribution.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> That is quite clear.  There is no means test there at all.  Groups of people are absolved from paying the contribution &mdash;farmers under £15 valuation, those in receipt of unemployment benefit, or social welfare benefit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>But there will have to be a calculation.  The statement was that 85 per cent would benefit.  Under the regulations which will come into force tomorrow, over 90 per cent will <Col N="447" /> be entitled to some benefits under the Health Act.  Surely, in order to arrive at the 85 per cent under the Fine Gael scheme there must be a means test? Surely there must be an upper income limit?  The Fine Gael Party are obviously confused.  The trouble is they do not know what they want and, when they are in doubt, they run along and have another &ldquo;cog&rdquo; at someone else's policy.</P>

      <P>Deputy Clinton was very naïve.  On the question of who would be exempt from paying insurance contributions, he said the 15 per cent included themselves because they were not obliged to make a contribution and they were people who were so obviously in the upper income group that it was easy enough to recognise them.  That statement will be found in the Official Report of 3rd March at column 983.  Was there ever a more stupid statement made in this House?  In the ordinary course of events, Deputy Clinton is a most conscientious Deputy.  He has put forward here on occasion very constructive proposals.  How he could suggest there is no means test in the Fine Gael scheme passes my comprehension.  Presumably some official sits down in a front room and watches the people passing up and down the street and picks out those who are eligible and those who are not.</P>

      <P>We are facing up to the issues.  With regard to insurance contributions, I do not agree with Deputy T.F. O'Higgins, Deputy M.J. O'Higgins and the others who spoke in the general tenor that financing on a social insurance basis was fundamental to the development of our health services.  As I said in my opening statement, the Government are prepared to examine the question of introducing such types of contribution as an aid to general taxation in financing the services.  Insurance contributions could be no more than an aid.  No one has suggested that the entire cost of the health services could be met from insurance contributions.</P>
      <P>I do not intend to approach this issue of insurance contributions with the same mystical fervour as Deputy O'Higgins.  When I consider it, I will be mainly concerned with any practical advantages it may have as against any other source of income because, when the State compels a person to make a payment to meet the cost of a public service, it matters little to that person whether the cost is described as an insurance contribution or a tax and, therefore, it is as a form of taxation that we must consider these contributions.</P>
      <P>Deputy T.F. O'Higgins referred to his proposed weekly contributions as the equivalent of the price of ten cigarettes.  If I thought a man would save the money to pay his insurance contributions by cutting down on his smoking, that would be a big factor in helping me to appreciate the merits of such contributions.  Deputies know well that 2/- a week, or whatever larger sum may be required, would not always come through cutting down on luxuries.  It would be a weekly tax on each worker and each farmer within the prescribed limits, payable, generally speaking, at a flat rate, irrespective of income.  This is the kind of insurance contribution they have for the British health services.  There it is at the rate of 3/4 per week and as a form of taxation, it does not seem to be very well liked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 7th February, 1961, and I think I mentioned this quotation before, the then Minister&mdash;he was a Conservative <Col N="449" />&mdash;speaking on a proposal to increase the rates by 1/- per week, said that this contribution, like any other flat rate contribution, was in the nature of a poll tax, irrespective of the earnings of the person by whom it is paid. The Labour Party in Britain did not think much of this contribution.  I am quoting Miss Jenny Lee who spoke on 18th May, 1963, and said that there was no justification whatever for imposing a poll tax of 3/4d per week on every man and woman who happened to be an insured person.  She said:</P>
    <P>We want it to be well known that a future Labour Government will end this totally unfair practice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasOHara" hpid="Mr. O'Hara Mr. O'Hara">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>From what is the Minister quoting?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quoting from <i>Hansard</i>, volume 677, column 467.  An Irish Labour Party speaker said, and I quote:</P>
      <P>The health services are available free to every one in Britain.  They are paid for by the Exchequer.  The more you have the more you pay. That is the way it should be.  That is what we mean by a comprehensive health service.  We do not think insurance contributions could pay for it.  The Labour Party would never agree that insurance contribution should pay for such a service. We believe it should be a charge on the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>That was Deputy Dr. O'Connell speaking here on 24th November last on the Health and Mental Treatment (Amendment) Bill and it is to be found in column 320 of the Dáil Debates of that day.  The House will also note that on 17th November last I quoted the views of the two major Parties in Britain as I have quoted them above. In doing this, I seemed to be able to influence the policy of our Labour Party here in Ireland to some extent, whatever about them influencing our policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have dwelt on this matter at some length and my purpose in doing so is to convince the House that in considering insurance contributions as a source <Col N="450" /> of revenue, we must not take a completely one-sided view.  These insurance contributions have their disadvantages as well as their advantages.  Perhaps when I have completed my technical examination of them as a source of finance, we could approach a further consideration of this issue.  My purpose and intention is to implement everything in this White Paper as speedily as possible.  It is my intention to bring into the House next November a Health Bill whereby the proposals in the White Paper can be implemented.</P>
    <P>If, at the time, it is necessary to make the financial arrangements whereby some contributions will be necessary, then I think I would be quite agreeable to recommend to the Government that such contributions should be utilised.  There is no point in approaching this question of these contributions in a one-sided manner. The whole question is a problem.  I have discussed this with my colleague, Deputy Boland, the Minister for Social Welfare, and I can see that I could not be cluttering up his social service stamps and the contributions from the workers.  He has his priorities.  The old age pensioners, the widows, the blind and other social service classes are low enough as it is.</P>
    <P>We have to be realistic about this. Do not be under any illusions about this.  The proposals in this White Paper are going to cost the country a lot of money and might cost a lot more than I have set down here.  In May I am bringing out a White Paper on mental handicap.  This is a tremendous problem and I have not yet got the report of the Commission on Mental Illness.  The care of the aged, the care of the mentally ill&mdash;all this is going to cost an awful lot of money, capital expenditure, the funding of that, the provision of accommodation and the finding and maintenance of staff.</P>

      <P>When does the Minister expect the report on mental illness?</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>About June.  I believe we should not be clashing on the question of insurance contributions. I want to get this thing off the ground <Col N="451" /> and I am going to see it gets off the ground.  If I find difficulty and if I have to do certain things, I will do them, but insurance contributions are not the answer to the problem.  I cannot be cluttering up the impositions on the insured workers.  It could become an intolerable burden.  If it seems to the Government that it would be advantageous to introduce such contributions, then we will not hesitate to propose them to this House.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, I want to make the point that I do not think the solution of this issue is fundamental to the further development of our health services as proposed in the White Paper.  The discussion as to the method of financing it is, to a great extent, academic.  My main anxiety at the moment is to get the document into the form of legislative proposals and bring it in here so that proposals for remedying all the anomalies and shortcomings will be brought before the House for discussion.</P>
      <P>I should just like to say this about insurance contributions, too.  It will be very tough if a person relying on medical attention and medical services has to worry about how many stamps he or she has.  The Fine Gael Party will exempt certain categories.  They say that the old age pensioner will not have to pay any contribution, that he will automatically be free, that he will not be required to make any contribution whatsoever, and likewise categories of £15 valuation and under.  This is totally unrealistic.  I have not brought out my scales of eligibility so far but my personal opinion is this.  Why should a man with £8, £9 or £10 a week and three or four children pay a contribution, pay anything, for drugs and medicines or for hospital services? I would charge him nothing&mdash;nothing &mdash;not the old age pensioner alone, not the widow alone, not the unemployed alone.  I could not consider that a man with a wage of that amount, £8 or £9 a week, and three or four children, and paying rent for a house, could make any contribution whatsoever towards drugs and medicines or towards his hospital charges.</P>

If Deputy Fitzpatrick tells me that a man with £9 a week, three or four children, and paying rent for his house, who goes into hospital, can contribute to his hospital charges or, if he does not go into hospital, gets a prescription and has to go to the chemist, could pay for those drugs and medicines, my belief is that he just could not do that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to give a breakdown of the £4¼ million the White Paper will cost.  I have mentioned £330,000 already incurred.  My Health and Mental Treatment Act comes into operation tomorrow, 1st April; that is costing £650,000.  There is £1 million of the £4¼ million in actual fact already being expended. That leaves approximately £3¼ million for the White Paper.  Under the new arrangement, the Department of Health will take over certain liabilities for ophthalmic and dental health benefits which were hitherto borne on the Vote for the Department of Social Welfare: that is £500,000.  That amounts, now, to about £1,500,000 out of a £4¼ million.  Supposing that leaves £2½ million or £2¾ million.  The Deputy asks me where I am to get the money. I will tell him this.  I do not think it will be too difficult to do so.</P>
      <P>I discussed this the other night with the Taoiseach.  Now, we are not like Fine Gael.  I do not mind saying that I discussed a matter with the Minister for Social Welfare or with the Taoiseach. All right; I discussed this.  We do not think it will be that tremendously difficult to provide the money. You see, this is a thing we have to do. It is all right to talk about a shortage of money for expenditure here or capital expenditure there.  We are going through a temporary period of shortage.  We all know that.  We hope that, towards the end of this year, about November or December, it will be all right again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from that, Deputy Fitzpatrick does not realise that this is not an &ldquo;if&rdquo; or a &ldquo;but&rdquo;: this is a priority. It is the method whereby we have to provide money for this purpose that is in question.  I know that if there should be financial stringencies of a very serious nature at the time, that we cannot anticipate now, we should have to accept that fact: God knows what might happen.  But, taking things by and large, we should be faced with the problem of finding, say, £3 million.  I still think that, when we get this White <Col N="454" /> Paper working, it will cost a lot of money&mdash;more than that.</P>
    <P>To answer the Deputy's question finally, therefore, I am saying that if the Exchequer, so to speak, could pay for these extensions <i>in toto</i>, this would appeal to me far more than putting an insurance contribution on the worker, the same insurance contribution on the man earning £7 a week as on the person with £15 a week.  However, I do think that we shall have to get some contribution from the stamp.  I think this is what I shall have to recommend to the Government.  I shall have to be realistic in this.</P>

      <P>Deputy T.F. O'Higgins and other speakers suggested that if we were to enter the Common Market, it would be necessary to develop our health services on similar lines to the health services of the Common Market countries.  I am not aware of any requirements in the Treaty of Rome whereby Ireland would, on entry to the Common Market, have to model her health services on those of other Member States.  The relevant position of the Treaty referred to is &ldquo;Close collaboration between Member States in the social field...&rdquo;  It seems clear to me both from the text of this part <Col N="456" /> of the Treaty and from policy statements from the European Economic Community that uniformity in social services is not aimed at or required. For example, the EEC Commission in its &ldquo;Exposé sur l'Evolution de la Situation Sociale dans la Communauté en 1961&rdquo; said:</P>
      <P>The Commission view this harmonisation of social systems not as an effort towards uniformity nor as an alignment pure and simple of the different laws and practices towards those of such one of of the Six as may as may appear to be the best developed...</P>
      <P>When the White Paper is implemented, we should have a health service meeting in the main the needs of this country and we need not be ashamed of comparison between it and that of other countries.  It is a wise thing for EEC to agree that there would not be common policy for all member countries because each country has problems peculiar to itself.  We even differ greatly from Great Britain in regard to the requirements of our people.  Certainly, there would be certain basic differences between ourselves and, say, Italy or France.  I should not like the House to think that I was of opinion, however, that we cannot learn anything from other countries or profit from their experience. This does not mean that in developing our health policy, we should uncritically adopt health concepts formed in an entirely different background.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kyne, comparing the cost of our services with those in Northern Ireland, seemed to envisage that if his Party's policy were adopted, we would be spending about £50 million on health services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>It is £25 million in Northern Ireland and we are roughly double in population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>That matter is gone into in more detail in the debate of 1st March.  The Deputy conceded that was a pretty big figure but it seems the Labour Party would be willing to face up to spending it and, more important, to raising it.  He says this would mean <Col N="457" /> increased taxation in some cases but he thinks a considerable part, from £5 million to £10 million, could be met by insurance contributions.  Even if this could be arranged, the Labour Party's scheme would still involve a big increase in taxation, and I find it very difficult to reconcile what Deputy Kyne said with what the Leader of the Labour Party said at the news conference on 26th January last in connection with the White Paper.  Deputy Corish then said:</P>
      <P>The Labour Party was opposed to any type of extra taxation including turnover tax being imposed on people who were supposed to benefit by the proposals in the White Paper.</P>
      <P>Several Deputies, including Deputies Fitzpatrick, Mrs. Desmond and O'Hara, referred to the question of district medical officers and suggested it was time to make it clear to the holders of existing dispensary posts that they would not suffer any loss of income as a result of the introduction of the revised scheme.  I should like to remind Deputies that in my opening speech I said:</P>
      <P>These radical changes in this service will pose a number of problems. The most outstanding of these is, of course, the fact that at present we have permanent salaried district medical officers in about 550 dispensary districts throughout the country. One of the big problems in bringing in this scheme for choice of doctors will arise from the arrangements which will have to be made to fit these into it&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>In other words the existing men&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In some areas, particularly in the West, the dispensary doctors will have to be retained on a salaried basis because, in practice, there will be no choice of doctor.  However, in most of the country, we must look forward to the eventual abolition of the post of dispensary doctor, and existing holders must be fitted into the new scheme with due regard to their present position and pension rights.  I cannot say now what the exact answer to this problem will be and indeed there may be a number <Col N="458" /> of answers varying from area to area.  I have, however, promised the Irish Medical Association, when they sought clarification of my intentions in this regard, that I will attempt to ensure that permanent and pensionable district medical officers who continue to provide, in their present areas, services on the scale on which they provide them at present will not suffer any decrease in remuneration from public funds as a result of the change in the service...</P>
    <P>The end of my remarks on that occasion was:</P>
    <P>and I expect that, in the event, the present dispensary doctors will be satisfactorily fitted into the new service.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick said, in effect, that there was no problem involved. The doctors, he said, had a contract with their health authorities and they must receive a guarantee that they will not suffer any loss of income.  I cannot go further than what I said in my opening statement which I have just quoted but the Deputy would hardly expect that the governing authority, whatever it will be in future, would continue to pay to the age of 70 the full salary of a dispensary doctor who decides himself when the new scheme comes in that he will accept only private patients and so would give no service for his salary.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid Deputy Fitzpatrick is not conversant with that problem.  It is a very long story and we do not want to go over it.  My predecessor, Deputy MacEntee, is a man of great principle and in this instance, against very adverse criticism, he stuck to those principles.</P>
      <P>Deputy Hogan of Tipperary spoke about the method of payment of doctors. He devoted most of his speech to a jet propelled tour of western Europe and the Antipodes.  He described the way in which doctors are paid under health services in the various countries.  I know the book he read to describe these payments. That book is not very reliable, I am advised.  I know there is a great number of variations in the basic ways of paying doctors under health services. The ways of paying doctors and, indeed, of paying for the services as a whole, have evolved in each case in the circumstances peculiar to the country concerned, and we in this country would be very slow to reach a conclusion that because a particular country favours a particular way of paying its doctors, this is what should be adopted here.  We are always hearing experts in medicine saying that this is what they do in Australia or Norway or Sweden, and why we cannot do it here.</P>
      <P>Deputy Hogan, in the end, seemed to come down in favour of the fee per service item method of paying the doctors.  I do not know that this method of paying the doctors seems to work in many countries.  However, the capitation system also works in other countries.  There is no black and white comparison between the two methods.  Deputy Esmonde made a reference to this matter also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we consider the type of service which is proposed by the White Paper, a general medical service limited to that proportion of the population which cannot afford to arrange it privately, there are certain features of the fee for service system which we have to look at specially.  I <Col N="460" /> think I am right in saying that whereever this system of payment is used, there is always a requirement on the patient to pay some fee to the doctor, the object being, of course, to prevent abuse of the service.</P>
    <P>New Zealand was referred to on several occasions.  Let us be clear as to what happens there instead of trotting out suggestions without giving the facts.  In New Zealand the doctor charges the patient 5/- or 7/6d for a visit, in addition to the benefit of 7/6d per visit which he receives from public funds.  In Norway, the patient pays at least one-fourth of the doctor's fee from his own pocket, and in some cases more.  We could not have that here in our conditions.  A man with a wife and a large family might not have the money.  We must remember that a high proportion of the people who will be eligible in this country for general medical services will not be able to make any payment to the doctor and, in any event, I do not think this House would favour the introduction of charges on eligible persons for these services.</P>
    <P>In a fee for service system for which the public authorities pay the full charge to the doctor, it would be necessary to have very stringent controls to prevent abuse.  This might involve interference with professional freedom and it is one of the reasons I am not inclined to regard this as the best system of payment in our circumstances.</P>
    <P>However, I would stress that all we said in the White Paper was that the capitation system seems the most practicable.  These are the words used there.  I have not nailed my colours to the mast on this and I am quite willing to listen to any arguments put forward by the medical profession in favour of any other system of payment. However, I hope the profession on their part will appreciate that I am <i>prima facie</i> inclined to favour capitation because I think it would suit their interests as much as that of the administrators.</P>
    <P>The capitation system is, of course used now under the National Health Service in Great Britain and the Six <Col N="461" /> Counties and I have heard criticisms from some of our doctors of its operation there.  I should point out to the House that in the last year or so there has been a very detailed review of the whole system of paying general practitioners in Great Britain and the Six Counties under the service and I should like to have on record for the benefit of Deputies some of the conclusions which have been reached.</P>
    <P>Every Deputy is going to have to listen to arguments on television, radio, from doctor friends and at official level as to the method of payment when the dispensary system goes. In the supplement to the <i>British Medical Journal</i> of 13th January last year, there was published a report of a working party set up by the British Medical Association on general practice under the National Health Service.  This report is based on opinions which were sought from all the various regions in Great Britain and, in brief, its conclusions on the method of remuneration of doctors under the service were in favour of the capitation system.  The report states that most of the regions consulted stated that:</P>
    <P>if the capitation fee were sufficient, much of the present discontent with the method of payment would disappear.</P>
    <P>And then:</P>
    <P>A careful study of the reports of the regional meetings indicates that the capitation system is still preferred by the majority of family doctors.</P>
    <P>On the fee for service system, the report states: &ldquo;There was some but not much support for such a scheme&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This is important because from documents I have seen from the medical representative bodies, they are evidently going all out and mounting a campaign for a fee for service payment and I am going to come under heavy fire.  Obviously all the Deputies have been lobbied and have got documents in the post from bodies representing, to some extent, the medical profession and they are going all out for this fee for service system. This could become very serious.  I know what I am saying when I say <Col N="462" /> this.  This could snowball.  All I can say is that before people get hot and bothered, they should study the implications. There are hotheads in every organisation.  There are hotheads in the IMA and in the IMU. This is not all confined to the &ldquo;wildcatters&rdquo; who it is suggested from time to time are responsible for industrial disturbances.  They are in the professional bodies as well.  Do not have any doubt about that.</P>
    <P>However, I am satisfied that when dealing with reasonable men, a solution can be worked out in regard to the method of paying doctors.  But I am a layman as are most people in the House.  When a reasonable body like the British Medical Association sets up working parties and goes to the different regions in Great Britain and then comes up with this report &mdash;well, I do not know.  As I said before, the report says that &ldquo;there was some but not much support for such a scheme.&rdquo;  Careful study of the reports from these regions shows that the capitation system is still preferred by the majority of family doctors.  I should say that when this report was prepared, there were negotiations between the British Ministry of Health and the doctors on a new contract for general practitioners.  A variation of the capitation system of payment was negotiated and seems acceptable to the profession in Britain.  This variation caters for special payments for duties outside normal working hours and a few other improvements like that.</P>
    <P>It was suggested to me that a fee per item of service method of payment would help to keep patients out of hospital by encouraging doctors to look after the patients at home.  If this were to be the case, it would be a strong point in favour of the system because the more people we can keep out of hospital, even though we have to pay for medical attention for them in their homes&mdash;and this is a good deal, particularly when one considers that some of the weekly charges in hospital are up to £30 a week&mdash;the better.  This country which the medical profession are citing, New Zealand, does not confirm this.  It has a comprehensive <Col N="463" /> general practitioner service for the entire population, the doctors generally being paid on a fee for service system.  The patients pay so much, as set out earlier, but their hospital admission rate is higher than ours.</P>
    <P>My natural reaction when I heard people quoting these different health services was to get a report on them for the Members of the House and for my own benefit.  According to the report which we got from the New Zealand Department of Health for the year ending 31st March, 1963, the latest available report, the hospital admission rate for 1961-62 was 10.81 per 100 of the population and our figure at the same time was 9.42 per 100.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It includes, to use the awful word they use in America, all hospitalisation, but not out-patients. Deputy Kyne suggested that we have a high hospitalisation rate because our general medical services are not comprehensive. Deputy Fitzpatrick stated that at the moment nobody qualified for a medical card unless he or she was in dire need.  The eligibility for general medical services is defined in section 14 of the 1953 Act&mdash;persons <Col N="464" /> unable to provide by their own industry or other lawful means the necessary services for themselves or their dependants. There is no provision whereby a person must be in dire need and no rigid standards are laid down.  Without going over it again, we know that there are variations from county to county in the manner and method in which different county managers or the delegated officers interpret &ldquo;lawful means&rdquo;.  However, we are agreed that the method is unjust, subject to harsh interpretation and that there is a lack of uniformity.  The percentage of the population in hospital which is confusing Deputy Dillon would include people who went in for a day or a day and a half.</P>

      <P>Before Deputy Dillon came in, I was saying that the emphasis must be on preventive medicine, to keep people out of hospital. Apart altogether from the humanitarian aspect, if we can keep people, particularly old people, in their own homes, I think it is a good deal because at present it costs up to £30 to keep them in hospital.  This is a personal opinion of mine which I am trying to plug.  I do not know whether I will succeed or not.  Take the case of an old age pensioner who is kept out of the county home and treated in her own home.  It is not drugs or medicines that poor woman needs but attention such as nourishment and chiropody.</P>

      <P>Very often such people suffer from loneliness and lack of nourishment.  On one occasion, seeing £75 worth of medicines, I said to a public health nurse: &ldquo;What are all those bottles for?&rdquo; and she replied &ldquo;It is me this woman wants.&rdquo;  Our aim should be to try to get these people treated and looked after at home with the assistance of the public health nurse and to provide such things as extra nourishment and chiropody.  In addition, while most of these people would be in receipt of the old age pension, I would be most anxious to try to channel through the appropriate doctor or nurse some little cash payment for them so they may have extras such as food and even books.  After all, magazines and books are just as much medicine and an aid to recovery, I suppose, as tablets and medicines.</P>

      <P>Deputy Tully referred to the undesirable procedure followed by some health authorities in checking on the incomes of applicants for medical cards.  I agree with him fully.  As he knows, on 28th January I sent a circular to the health authorities drawing attention to this matter.  I stated that I considered the certificate forms issued by health authorities to applicants or employers to be completed by the employers should not bear the name of the health authority or indicate that the person concerned was an applicant for health services.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kyne referred to the discrepancies which exist at present between decisions in relation to eligibility for medical cards.  He suggested I should issue a direction to county managers to indicate some limit of eligibility so that the people would know where they stood.  The only means of achieving basic improvements is an amendment of the law, which is what is proposed in the White Paper. This will take time.  In the meantime, I have urged health authorities to examine critically their methods of assessment for eligibility.</P>
      <P>It is only fair to point out that in accordance with the White Paper the future law will make it clear that only a person's means and that of his wife will be taken into account when assessing eligibility for the general medical services.  The means of other members of the family will be ignored.  This will follow the precedent recently set by the Health and Mental Treatment Act, 1966, which comes into operation tomorrow for hospital and specialist services and maternity services.</P>
      <P>Deputy Esmonde asked if in advance of the implementation of the proposals in the White Paper, steps would be taken to give medical cards automatically to old age pensioners.</P>

      <P>Yes.  We have been <Col N="467" /> acutely conscious of the needs of those people and the question of medical cards for old people has been discussed in this House on more than one occasion. During the passage of the Health and Mental Treatment Bill, I informed the House I had sent a circular about this matter to every health authority. This circular is quoted in columns 967 and 968 of the Official Report of 14th December last.  It points out that my Department advises that non-contributory old age pensioners or wives and widows with non-contributory pensions should automatically be regarded as eligible for section 14 services.  That had been endorsed in the House during the Committee Stage of the Bill.</P>
      <P>The circular states that at a meeting in my Department on 20th October last managers of health authorities had agreed that applications for medical cards from such people should receive special and sympathetic consideration, and that particulars of any case in which it was felt that the circumstances did not warrant the issue of a card would be reported to my Department. Returns since received show that in 22 health authority areas all applications received from 20th October last to the date of the returns were granted. In the remaining five areas, seven individual applications in all were refused; two in one area are being reviewed. This is a considerable improvement on the period before the meeting with the managers of 20th October and I am keeping the position under continual review.  Someone might say it is surprising to see that even one case of an old age pensioner would be held in doubt by the county manager.  I asked my officials why there was doubt about some cases.  I came across the case of an old age pensioner whose son, with whom he was living alone, had a very high income and was in very good circumstances.  I presume he had this old age pension due to his entitlement on the stamps to which he was contributing.</P>

      <P>It was very hard to understand the mentality of a manager of a health authority or the person in charge who would do that.  I did indicate in paragraph 51 of the White Paper that under the legislation which I propose to introduce providing for regulations specifying the classes of persons entitled to participate in the general medical service, recipients of non-contributory old age pensions, blind pensions and widows' pensions would be specified as eligible.  The position in regard to the eligibility of these pensioners for medical cards has much improved.  I do not think that special amending legislation is called for to cover their eligibility in advance of the general legislation proposed in the White Paper.  If it had been brought to my attention, with the response to the Department's circular, that these recipients already mentioned should automatically get the medical card, I would have recommended to the Government that I be given permission to introduce an amending section in this House to compel them to do this, but the returns, as Deputy Fitzpatrick said, show a very great improvement in the position which had existed before the 20th October.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Burke said that in the determination of eligibility the discretionary clause of the 1953 Act should be retained.  It will, both for hospital service and general medical service.  Paragraph 52 of the White Paper says that persons within the prescribed limits <Col N="469" /> would automatically be eligible but that it would be necessary to leave a discretion to the authorities operating the service to admit other cases experiencing undue hardship at any time because of special circumstances, in meeting privately the cost of medical care.</P>
    <P>On paper, a person might seem to have a very good income, £1,800, £2,000 or £2,500 a year, but that person might be crippled with medical expenses.  In fact, it might be a greater hardship for that man if his wife or children were ill to meet the expense involved than for a man with £10 a week who would have to pay for tablets or something like that.  I have come across cases of people with large incomes who were facing bankruptcy or very great worry.</P>

      <P>There are certain categories which the Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme does not cover, and were it to cover these, it would be tremendously difficult to make it economically viable.  By and large, I endorse what Deputy Dillon says, that such people should be in it.  Nevertheless for various reasons which we have to accept, without asking the reasons &mdash;there is no point in locking the stable door when the horse has bolted &mdash;there are cases of people who were at one time wealthy but have carried a burden of excessive medical expense for a number of years until they have got to the end of the road and face this crisis.  It is possible to get assistance under the discretionary clause, and a very good thing I think it is.  When people become ill and have illness diagnosed, it is not very fair then at that stage to go to the Voluntary Health Insurance Board and say: &ldquo;I am sick.  You take over.  Here is the premium.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Connell referred to the desirability of group practice in the general medical service. Surely this is a matter for the doctors to arrange and not for the Minister or a health authority?  Any merger of doctors by direction of a Minister for Health would be doomed to failure, To be successful, group practice should be a completely voluntary effort on the part of the doctors concerned.  I cannot see any objection for my part, when a choice of doctor comes, to considering an application for a group of doctors.  After all, a doctor must have time off as well as everyone else. He must have his holidays.  He cannot continue working all the time.  It appears to me group practice would be reasonable and would make for healthier and better tempered doctors, <Col N="471" /> thereby benefiting the patients in the long run.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick made the point that hospital charges of up to 10/- a day to the middle-income group should be eliminated.  I trust the Deputy will appreciate that I am not now being disparaging, but I think he overstated his case.  This charge is not an onerous charge.  I have criticised officers of health authorities for somewhat rigid and unsympathetic consideration but the information I have indicates that, on the whole, their approach has been very reasonable.  The charge was originally fixed at 6/- a day under the 1953 Act.  It was changed to 10/- back in 1957 and it has remainied at that level ever since, despite the change in the value of money.  While we might like to see free hospitals, free this and free that, I must cut my cloth according to my measure and adopt certain priorities and work within those priorities.</P>
      <P>If a person carries his wage or salary into the hospital with him&mdash;a man earning £1,000 or £1,200 a year, married with perhaps one child, or no children at all&mdash;it is not unreasonable to charge him 10/- a day, £3 10s. per week for his week or fortnight in hospital. He could not live on that sum outside.  Of course, if income ceases, that is a different thing altogether. Hospitals have very heavy commitments to meet and this cost of up to 10/- a day covers food, light, heating, bed and bedclothes, service, and so on.  It may not be popular to say it but I do not believe this charge is a burden. It is a reasonable charge.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I agree with the Deputy.  I see from the statistics that, in the case of a person confined to a mental hospital, the charge is very seldom levied.  Deputy Fitzpatrick raised this matter earlier and he ultimately agreed with me, I think, that only a very small percentage of long-staying patients in mental hospitals are charged.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick made the point, too, that it is unfair for a health authority to move against the estate when such a patient dies.  I get representations&mdash;everyone does&mdash;from the families of such people.  Relatives have been inmates in mental hospitals who, knowingly or unknowingly, had money to their credit.  When they die, probate has to be taken out.  It has often transpired that substantial sums have been lying in a bank or elsewhere. It is only right that the estate should contribute to what the patient cost the taxpayer and the ratepayer over the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister knows that, if a person is mentally ill, and he is the owner of substantial property, he is made a ward of court and his property administered by the court?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not talking about that type of case; I am talking about the type of case in which a patient is maintained in a mental hospital at the expense of the taxpayer and the ratepayer.  On his death it is found that he has a considerable sum of money to his credit&mdash;perhaps £5,000 or £6,000.  Now the taxpayer and the ratepayer contributed to that patient's maintenance.  On his death his estate may pass to a grandnephew or a grandniece.  Why should the ratepayer and the taxpayer not be recouped out of that estate, not directly, of course, but by recouping the mental hospital? <Col N="473" /> If the charge were a particularly high one, I should be the first to insist that it should go.  However, the emphasis now is on preventive medicine to keep people out of hospital.  I do not think abolishing the hospital charge will encourage people to stay out of hospital.</P>
      <P>We have to be realistic about this. The cost of hospital treatment has increased dramatically.  We must face that fact.  In a county hospital the cost has increased from £8 to something over £19 per week.  In the Dublin teaching hospitals, costs have increased from £10 to £30 per week.  That is the cost of maintaining a patient in a public ward.  Of those in the middle-income group, only about 12 per cent have been asked to pay the maximum charge of 10/- per day.  I agree that 12 per cent is too small and I agree that there are people who have got away with it.  The figure of 12 per cent is far two small and should be larger.  The higher the contribution we can get from the people who can afford to pay, the more we can do for the less well off.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I represent a constituency which is half a city and half a town, and on Saturdays I get 30 or 40 people from the country into me and I hear no great complaints from them.  If there is any county in which the charge is automatically made without inquiry into the circumstances of the patient, I should like to hear about it.  The only time that it really becomes a burden and source of anxiety is when a patient has to pay the full 10/- per day over a period of long duration, say from 40 to 50 days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Taking into consideration the average stay in medical and surgical wards, the average cost of treating a medical patient in a county hospital would be £41 and the cost of treating a surgical patient would be £25.  The average term of stay in the medical ward is about 18 days and in the surgical <Col N="474" /> ward, about 21 days.  The middle-income group patient called on to pay 10/- a day would contribute £9 and £5 10s respectively in these instances and the balances of £32 and £19 10s respectively would be shared by the health authority and the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The contribution by the better off middle-income group patients can hardly be held to be penal.  The average rate is under 6/- per day for those who are charged.  I said in my opening statement that the limits of eligibility will bring in a number of those who are to be classified as members of the higher-income group.  In the past they had to face the hazard of having to meet the full amount of hospital charges before I raised the limit of income from £800 to £1,200.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick asked if it was worthwhile collecting these charges and Deputy Carty, who was Chairman of the Committee on Health Services at the time, mentioned that the cost of collection was £60,000.  That leaves a big credit balance to the public funds and I would not ask the Minister for Finance to dispense with it.</P>

      <P>Yes.  Deputy Kyne, when speaking of hospital charges, said that the income derived from these charges could be got just as well by adding a small amount to social welfare contributions.  That is an idea that could be considered in my examination of alternative means of finance but I will point out that at the moment many insured people do not have to pay hospital charges.  What Deputy Kyne suggests would mean that all workers, lowly paid, and highly paid, would have an addition to their contributions <Col N="475" /> and that contribution would increase if the charges for the better off workers are abolished.</P>
      <P>Deputy Harte referred to the fact that in the case of school children, the cost of treatment is paid by the health authority where the treatment is found to be necessary after the children have entered a school, but that if the ailment is found in pre-school days, the cost has to be borne by the parents.  I have this matter under consideration and I indicated in reply to a Parliamentary Question last December that a comprehensive review of the child health scheme is being carried out by a committee of members of the staffs of my Department and of certain health authorities and I will deal with the matter in the light of their report.  I will bear the Deputy's representations in mind.</P>
      <P>Deputy Esmonde, in dealing with geriatric treatment, asked that local voluntary committees be aided by giving subventions to them.  Assistance is already being given by health authorities to bodies dealing with the care of the aged under section 65 of the Health Act of 1953.  Health authorities may give assistance to any organisation which is providing a service similar or ancillary to the service which the health authority itself can provide. This can be done either by contributing to the expenses, by supplying fuel, light or food or by the provision of premises.  Health authorities have given substantial assistance to organisations dealing with the care of the aged.  In most cases this has been done by way of financial contributions to the running cost of the institution run by these voluntary bodies.  In some cases authorities have provided assistance by the way of capital expenditure.  The Dublin Health Authority made a substantial contribution to the provision of a new voluntary institution for the care of the aged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Grants have also been provided to assist centres such as the Mary Aikenhead Social Centres in Waterford, Dublin and Kilkenny, and the Little Sisters of the Assumption in Limerick, which provide domiciliary and other <Col N="476" /> assistance to old people such as meals on wheels.  The total number of institutions and charities which have benefited under the provisions of section 65 of the Health Act, 1953, is 27.</P>
    <P>Deputy Crinion stressed the importance of keeping old people at home whenever possible.  I fully agree with his point of view.  I was not aware of this myself, until it was brought to my attention.  I should like to stress, particularly for those who are members of local authorities, local bodies, that the Minister for Local Government may, under the Housing (Loans and Grants) Act, 1962, make a grant to an approved body, providing, on a philanthropic basis, one or more than one house for the accommodation of elderly persons.  The amount of the grant will not exceed £300 in respect of each house or each separate dwelling forming part of a house.  A grant may be given in respect of the erection, reconstruction, conversion or purchase of a house.  The local authority may make a supplemental grant not exceeding the amount of the State grant.</P>
    <P>The new Housing Bill which is being discussed at present by the Seanad and which was passed by this House, reenacts these provisions and provides for their expansion by enabling the Minister for Local Government to pay subsidy to housing authorities, in respect of housing for the elderly, at the rate of 66-2/3rds of loan charges.  This new Housing Bill also includes provisions to enable the Minister for Local Government to pay grants for accommodation for caretakers in the precincts of elderly persons' accommodation&mdash;I think this is important&mdash;and to enable housing authorities to help, by loan, guarantee or periodic contribution, bodies whose objects include the provision of dwellings for old people, and to empower housing authorities to give technical assistance to persons, including housing associations or societies, providing houses.</P>
    <P>As I have already mentioned, an inter-departmental committee is already considering the question of the co-ordination of the various public and voluntary services for the aged.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dowling has mentioned <Col N="477" /> interesting developments in regard to the care of the aged at St. Mary's in Dublin&mdash;a system whereby patients are taken into the hospital for six weeks, then returned to their homes for six weeks and brought back again to the hospital for another six weeks, thus relieving relatives of the problem of providing continuous care for them. I sanctioned proposals in this matter last November.  We are all watching the progress of the experiment with great interest.  For the success of a procedure of this nature, it is probably necessary to develop community services as well as hospital services.  Deputy Dowling also mentioned the need for making old people aware of the services available. I have already stressed to health authorities the need for the development of information centres and the publicising of the services available through suitable media.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies referred to the inadequacy of the dental, ophthalmic and aural services and particularly to the fact that in some areas denture services are not available for lower-income group adults following extraction of their teeth.  I am sorry to say that this is only too true.  All members of the House must know that the poor standard of the public dental services has been with us for many years and that successive Governments have, understandably, given priority to other needs in the sphere of health. Leaving aside any question of who can claim the credit&mdash;my Party or Fine Gael or Labour or the Coalition Government&mdash;I hope the House will agree with me that this country has succeeded in making impressive strides in tackling the serious problems in health in the past two decades.  We have reached the stage when we can now contemplate dealing with certain problems which have not been tackled as vigorously as we all would wish.  The dental services, in particular, are an example. They are admittedly bad and must be remedied.</P>
    <P>Not only are the treatment and denture services for adults in the lower-income group inadequate in general, but the arrangements for treating school-children, to put it mildly, fall short of the desired standard in many <Col N="478" /> areas&mdash;even though they are accorded priority of treatment.  Surveys carried out by the Medical Research Council in connection with the fluoridation of public water supplies revealed an extremely high incidence of dental decay in children in this country.  The position is that the number of dental officers employed by health authorities would need to be very substantially increased before anything approaching an effective treatment and follow-up service for children alone could be provided by health authorities.</P>
    <P>The fundamental difficulty in the way of a speedy improvement in this situation is that, coupled with the very big problem of widespread dental decay, there is a national shortage of dentists, which has created difficulties for health authorities in recruitment. That difficulty is not peculiar to this country.  It is experienced in Britain and in other countries as well.  We shall have to face up to the fact that if, to raise our public dental service to the required standard, we are to secure the return of Irish dentists from abroad, and to retain those newly-qualified from our dental schools each year, we shall have to compete with other countries for their services.  There is no point in beating about the bush.</P>
    <P>While we should have this tremendous drive for dental services, it appears to me, as a layman, that decaying and decayed teeth, or lack of dental care, must be the cause of a lot of poison in the system or illness at some period.  Therefore, we shall just have to face up to this fact of supply and demand.  We shall have to compete &mdash;and to do so quickly.  I think I mentioned some time ago, in a speech somewhere, that we had calculated that we are short 275 dentists in Ireland.  I should mention, too, that the services of dental officers employed by the health authorities have been and are being, supplemented by private dentists employed on a sessional basis by health authorities to provide services for the present eligible classes either in health authority clinics or in their own surgeries.  I intend to take all possible steps to clear up this very serious position and I hope to arrange discussions with the Irish Dental <Col N="479" /> Association to see what can be done about clearing it up.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick also referred, at column 624 of the debates of 1st March, to the delay which will be involved in extending the dental, ophthalmic and aural services to the middle-income group.  In the light of the inadequacy of dental services for the classes at present entitled to them, it would be impracticable at the moment to bring the middle-income group within the scope of these services. I think it reasonable that an effective service should be provided for those classes of the community, that is, children and persons in the lower-income group, who are to a greater degree dependent for treatment on public dental services, before any extension of the services to the middle-income group is undertaken.  That is proposed in the White Paper.  It is proposed that as a first step the staffs and facilities of the health authorities will be expanded so that satisfactory treatment and follow-up service for children and others now entitled to priority will be provided, together with a satisfactory service for adults in the lower-income group.  When this has been done, the problem of extending services to the middle-income group will be tackled through wholetime pupils of vocational schools and secondary at first, and then the middle-income groups generally.</P>
    <P>Although this is the scheme in the White Paper, I personally, as Minister for Health, am urging my officials to come up with some proposals whereby we could take in all schools because I think the whole basis of success is in the schools.</P>

      <P>It is not a question of the application of the scheme.  The provision is there on paper but the people are not getting the service they are entitled to.

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not consider that ophthalmic services for the middle-income group is a matter of such urgency.  In the lower-income group, children attending child welfare clinics and national schools are already covered and inexpensive services are already available to insured persons under the Department of Social Welfare benefit schemes, but it is intended, under the White Paper proposals, as Deputies will see, to make this service generally available to the middle-income group, including insured persons and their dependants, on a contributory basis as soon as the health authority services are sufficiently developed to cater for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the aural service, I intend that the middle-income group who may at present avail of ear, nose and throat specialist services provided <Col N="481" /> by health authorities shall be able to use the services of the National Organisation for Rehabilitation.  We have already had discussions with that body. The existing hearing-aid service is operating satisfactorily but there is room for some improvements in the procedure for ascertainment of hearing defects, particularly in children. With that in view, I have asked health authorities to ensure that an adequate number of public health nurses in their areas are trained in audiometry and, equally important that their services are fully utilised.  Moreover a training course in audiometry for public health nurses, followed by a refresher course for those nurses who have been already trained, was held recently. That, and the field work of these nurses should considerably improve this service.</P>
    <P>In regard to the existing ophthalmic service, I think it is reasonably satisfactory. In some areas there is room for improvement in the quality of spectacles.  The spectacle frames supplied have evoked criticism and I have asked health authorities to provide a better variety of spectacles.</P>

      <Col N="482" /> I gather from Deputy Kyne's remarks on the dental services that he would be in favour of solving dental problems by amending the law to permit of the supply and fitting of dentures by dental technicians.  There are only two areas in Europe where this practice is permitted, in Denmark and the Canton of Zurich, and before promoting new legislation for this purpose, I should have to be satisfied that a practice which has been apparently rejected by the authorities in the majority of European countries could be accepted in Ireland without danger to the health of the people.  At present the weight of professional opinion and advice is against it and I do not consider that I should be justified in promoting legislation to permit of a practice that might involve a health hazard merely because of the difficulties health authorities are at present experiencing in their recruitment of dentists.  I intend to take all possible steps to improve the public dental service so that there can be fully effective treatment and follow-up service for the classes at present entitled to it.</P>
    <P>The Deputy might have seen in the public Press criticism of the White Paper by the Irish Dental Association. I have now been furnished by the Association with the text of a statement which was dated 1st March on the development of community dental services which was adopted by the Council of the Association and which formed the basis of the Press publicity. I have not yet studied the document in detail but there are a few comments that it would be appropriate to make at this stage.</P>
    <P>The first point the Association made is that the public dental services should be run by a central organisation on a national basis.  I would not agree with this suggestion for a central organisation on a national basis.  There seems to be no compelling reason to single out one particular service to be administered in this manner.  Up to now the policy has been to integrate health services, for example, as happened in the integration of the mental and other general health services and the placing <Col N="483" /> of the services in Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford under unified administration and the further step now proposed of setting up regional health boards.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> Westmeath and Longford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>All this will, of course, come in due course for discussion&mdash;the scheduling of the areas. I do not want to bring in any proposals that are not in the main acceptable to everyone here.  I think it would be retrograde to do what the Association suggests.</P>
      <P>The services for school children will continue to be regarded as the priority in the organisation of the public dental services.  I consider that such a service can best be provided by wholetime staff employed by the health authority. That policy was endorsed by the Irish Dental Association as recently as its last conference in April, 1965 and I am at a loss to understand why in the short interval since then the Association has changed its views; and now considers that private practitioners should be used to the greatest extent possible in the provision of services for school children.</P>
      <P>I agree that some emphasis on dental health education is desirable but not, as the Association suggests, that every area should have a nucleus of dental officers employed in educating children and parents in this matter.  Up to the present, our efforts have been concentrated on the treatment of dental decay and little, unfortunately, has been done to prevent its occurrence. Some thought will have to be given to spreading the doctrine of proper care of teeth, particularly among children and parents.  In view of the national shortage of dentists, however, which is likely to persist for some time, it would hardly be practicable in present circumstances to think in terms of employing dentists wholetime on such a service.  I intend to examine the possibility of organising this educational preventive work on the basis of dental ancillary staff specially trained for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="484" /> The provision of adequate services, particularly denture services, for the lower-income group, presents a special problem in view of the shortage of dentists, the need to concentrate available staff resources mainly on the services for children and the very great backlog of work for adults which has to be overtaken.</P>
    <P>The Association's statement went on to discuss services for the lower-income groups, to mention a new basis on which they might be concluded in future.  These services are being fully considered and in due course I will arrange discussions with the Association to see what best can be done to give a better service for that group.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the point made in the Association's statement with regard to the considerable cost involved in the extension of the dental services provided for in the Health Act to the middle income group generally but, as our economy expands and more funds become available for health services, we can face up then to meeting this cost.</P>
    <P>While on the school health services, I should like to refer to the excellent health education work done through the film shows organised by the National Film Institute for my Department. It is important that the rising generation should be conscious of health problems.  I should like very much to see local health authorities extend their work in the schools through lectures arranged in co-operation with the school authorities.</P>
    <P>I think I should make some reference to the timetable of the changes proposed in the White Paper.  I should like to repeat that any Deputy who has had the experience of the responsibility of ministerial office will appreciate only too well that changes such as are contemplated just cannot be made overnight.  Deputies who spoke on behalf of the Labour Party assured me that if I brought in a Bill tomorrow to give effect to the White Paper proposals, they would be willing to facilitate me in arranging for its immediate passage.  This is just being unrealistic. We cannot have a complicated Bill of this nature prepared in a short time and I do not think it would be proper <Col N="485" /> for the House to pass such a Bill without full consideration, nor do I think it would be proper for me to come to decisions without having the necessary discussions with the parties who can be of assistance to me in the advice they will tender and also from the point of view of ascertaining the problems of the various bodies, associations and organisations who will be affected by certain decisions which might be taken in this House.</P>
    <P>If I can have a Bill brought before this House in the autumn and in force before the end of next year, I do not think that I will have anything to reproach myself about, nor do I think anyone will have anything to reproach me about if I can stick to that timetable. I can assure the House that I will do all I can to do so.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the mentally handicapped and it was suggested that not sufficient appreciation of the problem of mental handicap has been shown in the White Paper.  I do not think that is a reasonable or fair interpretation. It was clear from what I said in introducing the Estimate and the motion in connection with the White Paper that the reason I did not propose to refer at length to the many problems of providing adequate services for the mentally handicapped was, not that I lacked appreciation of the problems and their pressing urgency, but that I proposed soon to issue a separate White Paper which would set out proposals arising from a very thorough examination of the commission's detailed and comprehensive report.  Until that is available, I do not propose to go into it in more detail.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ryan criticised arrangements for hospital outpatient services. I am aware that in some outpatient departments, patients have to wait a considerable time before they receive attention.  This is not the fault of the medical or nursing staff who behind the scenes are working conscientiously and energetically to deal with all patients as quickly as possible.  Unfortunately, the patients are not always aware of this and sometimes they get the impression that there is an attitude of indifference towards them.  For that <Col N="486" /> reason I feel that some hospitals might give a little more consideration to the matter of public relations.  A helpful explanation to a waiting patient, or a sympathetic word, is never out of place.</P>
    <P>Some months ago in the course of a public address, I urged hospital authorities to give this aspect of their service closer attention and I hope that my appeal has had some effect.  I have heard it said that delays in outpatients' departments are unavoidable and that a scheme of appointments or prearranged times would be impracticable. I understand, however, that an investigation conducted in Great Britain last year led to the conclusion that it should be possible to devise a reasonably effective appointments system.  I would urge that our hospital consultants and hospital administrators cooperate in an effort to devise a suitable appointments system.  The benefits to all concerned of an effective system of this sort would make the effort worthwhile.</P>
    <P>Deputy Coogan referred to overcrowding in the Galway Regional Hospital.  My Department at present is considering the possibility of closer co-operation between that hospital and Merlin Park so that the accommodation in both can be used to the best advantage.  We all know that the Galway Regional Hospital is completely overcrowded and that there are some unused but usable units in Merlin Park.  A senior medical inspector from the Department recently discussed the matter locally with the officers of the health authority and we are examining his report at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is.  Deputy McLaughlin was worried about the difficulty of referring people from County Leitrim for specialist care. I understand that any doctor who wishes to refer patients for specialist, surgical or other treatment is not restricted to Manorhamilton.  If the doctor considers the particular requirements of a patient make it necessary to refer him to a hospital outside the <Col N="487" /> county, he may get the health authority's agreement to do so or, in case of emergency, may refer the patient without such agreement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody knows these facts.  It is a universal practice in the country that if a patient wants to go to a particular hospital, he must first go to the county hospital and be referred from there or he will find himself being called upon to pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> The Minister may take it that if a middle-income group patient is referred to a Dublin hospital by a private doctor without first going through the county hospital, he is at the mercy of the county manager in regard to payment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McLaughlin raised this point and I will have it on the record what the position is.  If a doctor considers that the particular requirements of a patient make it necessary to refer him to a hospital outside the county, he may get the health authority's agreement to do so, or, in case of emergency, he may refer the patient without such agreement and the health authority will accept responsibility for the cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McLaughlin also referred to the delays in securing X-ray examination and again I assume he is referring to Manorhamilton Hospital.  I am told that normally there is no delay there for X-rays except in regard to this barium meal test for which there is a delay.  There is an average of three <Col N="488" /> weeks' delay in waiting for this test which is a fairly time-consuming one. I have no information that suggests there is any delay in providing a patient with X-ray examination where medical opinion regards it as urgently desirable.</P>
    <P>In the course of the debate we had a number of references to nurses' pay. I should say that as far as nurses in the local authority hospitals are concerned, the present scales, which represent a considerable advance on the previous rates, were fixed recently following arbitration.  The new rates applied in the voluntary hospitals from the same date as they applied in the local authority service.  I am afraid Deputy Kyne is under a misapprehension in stating otherwise.  I do not think that pay constitutes a major grievance. The major complaint as far as I can gather relates to accommodation and working conditions of nurses.  There are different opinions expressed on this question of accommodation and as to whether nurses should live in or outside the hospital.  I would have thought that most nurses would have preferred to live outside but evidently there are quite a number who prefer to live in.</P>
    <P>Not all the hospitals have nurses' homes of which we can be proud, I am sorry to say.  A good deal has been done, and is being done, to bring the homes up to acceptable standards or to replace unsatisfactory homes by new homes.  The table of work in progress which I circulated contains particulars of these and I do not want to go into detail now.  In regard to working conditions, I am in entire agreement with Deputies who suggest that it is inappropriate that nurses should be employed on non-nursing duties.  I have referred to this myself in the past and I have been engaged in seeing how we can get away from this practice where it exists.</P>
    <P>When I spoke last October to a meeting of nurses.  I directed attention to a number of improvements I should like to see being introduced.  I had in mind particularly the situation in regard to student nurses whose hours are long, who have to attend lectures <Col N="489" /> in their free time and who in some hospitals are required to be in at night at a particular hour which many of us would consider unreasonable.</P>

I am talking about those who have become acclimatised&mdash;girls of 18, 19 and 20. In my part of the country, I have come across girls having to be in at 8 o'clock or 9 o'clock at night.</P>

      <P>This is as far as I can go in relation to the voluntary hospitals, which are autonomous in matters of internal administration such as this.  I am not without hope, however, that they will make such immediate changes as are feasible in each case.  Other changes may take longer because they might involve considerable rearrangement of procedure and also additional staff, with possible consequent accommodation problems. In every hospital, the paramount consideration must be the well-being of the patient.  I would be surprised if there is any hospital in which the administration is such that you can get a good service for the patient from discontented staff.  Consequently, I look forward to the utmost co-operation from all hospital authorities in bringing in reforms such as I have mentioned. There are also in these hospitals a high percentage of non-nursing staff, a very fine type of young girl employed in the domestic staff.  We want to give them the same fair-mannered treatment as the nurses so that they, too, can have their nights off, subject to what I have said about supervision.</P>

      <P>Yes.  There was no prior application from the nursing staff for the granting of facilities to enable them attend that congress.  Therefore, the health authority could not refuse any nurses permission to go.  I agree with Deputy Kyne's view as to the need for nurses to keep up to date in regard to professional developments. Ample facilities for refresher courses for nurses are made available on an organised basis by An Bord Altranais and the Irish Nurses Organisation, with the co-operation of the Department and the teaching hospitals.  The primary purpose of these courses is educational. Nurses are encouraged to attend such courses at regular intervals.  Their attendance is rewarded by facilities such as leave with pay, travel and subsistence expenses and the fee for the courses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dowling asked that old age pensioners should have a leaflet issued with their pension books indicating the health services to which they are entitled. This seems a good idea and I am going to see what I can do to implement it.  Deputy Dowling also mentioned special hospitals for care of the aged.  I welcome his interest in this. I assure the House that I intend to take very seriously my responsibilities in improving and co-ordinating services for the aged.  The Deputy referred to vacant beds in some hospitals and overcrowding in others.  The cases in which there are vacancies are the infectious diseases hospitals, particularly tuberculosis sanatoria.  As far as possible, <Col N="492" /> vacant accommodation is changed over to meet some current health need and the possibility of releasing institutions for other health purposes is kept under constant review.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moore suggested an accident hospital should be established in Dublin.  While he pointed out there would be some advantages in this approach to the hospital care of accidents, medical opinion in general is against him and the advice I have received is against him.  This was also considered by the World Health Organisation and the view taken was that by reason of the variety of services available in general hospitals, it would be desirable to provide for accident cases at such hospitals rather than in isolated units.  There is a problem in Dublin arising from the large number of hospitals, most of them dealing with relatively few serious accident cases. The question of how to rationalise and improve the service has been under examination for some time by the Medical Association, and they are very kindly going to submit their views to me very shortly.  As Deputy Moore will appreciate, the Dublin voluntary hospitals are mainly concerned in this matter and their agreement would be necessary to any changes which may be needed.</P>
    <P>Deputy Clinton referred to the need for a service for the early detection of cervical cancer.  I am fully conscious of the need to make such a vital service available as soon as possible to women in the vulnerable groups.  Experience elsewhere suggests that this type of service can be effectively provided on a centralised basis.  Nearly two years ago a decision was taken at the instance of the then Minister to appoint a cytologist to the Dublin Health Authority and to provide him with the necessary laboratory facilities and equipment at St. Kevin's hospital for the provision of a cytological investigation service for hospitals and medical practitioners referring tests to him. I am sorry to say that so far it has not been possible to recruit a suitable cytologist.</P>

      <P>I do not think so. Competitions held by the Local Appointments Commission in July, 1964, and in June last year failed to secure an adequately qualified candidate. In recent months the post was advertised for the third time, and we expect to know within about three weeks whether the Commission will be in a position to recommend a candidate on this occasion.  In the meantime we have got the necessary technical staff required at St. Kevin's.  Two posts as senior laboratory technician have been created, and the persons appointed to these posts have completed training posts abroad in cytological techniques. I should mention that the Regional Hospital in Galway is developing a cervical cytology service for the western counties, and I consider that the consultants concerned have shown commendable initiative in doing this. However, all the Dublin maternity hospitals are also providing a limited service of this sort for their patients.</P>
      <P>Deputy Clinton referred to a reply to a question by Deputy O'Connell on 23rd February.  I think he implied that I had on that occasion criticised two identifiable senior officials of Dublin Health authority.  I should like to correct the Deputy.  At no time did I say or imply that either of the two officials in question was personally at fault or had personal knowledge of the matters with which I had to find fault. Because of the offices which they hold, however, they are answerable for the executive functions of the authority, and it is proper that they, and not junior officers, should have been asked to come to the Custom House to discuss the matter in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite true, as Deputy Clinton stated, that certain proposals in relation to the pharmacy service which were submitted to Dublin Health Authority in recent years were not sanctioned by my Department, but these were not connected with the specific inadequacies of the pharmacy service which occasioned my remarks relating to the purchase of medicines and to arrangements for the supply of medicines from the Central Pharmacy to local dispensaries. I am now assured that the <Col N="494" /> pharmacy arrangements in Dublin are working reasonably satisfactorily, and I intend to keep the matter under review.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell referred to the possibility that doctors in the health service would be limited in their choice of drugs, and expressed fears as regards the danger of the use of inferior drugs. No doctor in the health service is now or will be prevented from prescribing any drug which he considers to be specially necessary for a particular patient.  It is accepted, however, that there is often a choice of drugs of the same ingredients and equal quality and effectiveness but differing in price.  It is only reasonable, in the interest of economy, that this information should be readily available to the doctors.  The formulary for use in the health services and which is mentioned in the White Paper will endeavour to convey this and other appropriate information.</P>
    <P>In the main, the purpose of the formulary will be to act as a guide to the doctors in the choice of drugs with a view to fostering efficient and economic prescribing.  As regards the preparation of this formulary, it is clearly set out in the White Paper that the medical and pharmaceutical professions will be consulted.  It can, therefore, be accepted that the formulary will not be open to objection so far as these professions are concerned. Should there be any objection to any matters contained in it, the organised medical and pharmaceutical professions can be relied on to bring any such objections to notice.</P>
    <P>It is my concern to ensure that drugs and medicines provided for the health services are and will continue to be of satisfactory quality.  The existing arrangements for the supply of drugs and medicines are made under the provisions of the Local Government (Combined Purchasing) Act, 1939.  While the Department of Local Government is responsible for the detailed arrangements as regards the invitation of tenders and the making of contracts, my Department is always consulted before any contracts for the supply of drugs and medicines are entered into by the Combined Purchasing Section <Col N="495" /> of the Department of Local Government. The House may rest assured that every precaution will continue to be taken to ensure that drugs and medicines supplied under such arrangements are of satisfactory quality.  As regards the purchase of the drugs by Dublin Health Authority referred to by the Deputy, I am not in a position to make further comment on this at the moment as my inquiries in the matter are not yet complete.</P>

      <P>Particulars of the numbers of agricultural holdings are collected in connection with annual Agricultural Enumeration.  The 1960 Enumeration was the latest in which particulars of valuation were sought. The total rateable valuation returned in that year was £8.0 million in respect <Col N="502" /> of 358,500 holdings.  This total covered land and all buildings.  Separate figures for the rateable valuation of land were not obtained in the Enumeration. However, the rateable valuation of all land outside of County Boroughs and Urban Districts is known to be £6.9 million.</P>

      <P>All areas in the country have already had an opportunity of accepting electricity supply under the Rural Electrification Scheme.</P>
      <P>As regards the post-development scheme, I am informed by the ESB that the present rural post-development scheme should be completed within about three years and that all applicants in County Cork and elsewhere who have accepted the terms quoted will have received supply by that date.  However, because of the big increase in demand for electricity in the last year it is necessary to give priority to ensuring the maintenance of supply to existing consumers.  New connections may, therefore, be somewhat delayed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power if he is aware that a number of country council cottages in County Kerry have been wired for electricity but have as yet been unable to get an electricity supply owing to the high special service <Col N="503" /> charges imposed on them by the ESB; and whether he will arrange for the ESB to come to an agreement with the Kerry County Council on an overall total figure to be paid for all such houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The ESB require special service charges only in respect of premises which are situated in comparatively isolated locations.  These special service charges are necessary to remunerate the Board's capital costs in extending supply and unfortunately there is no way short of an inordinately high subsidy in which they can be reduced.  In regard to the suggestion in the second part of the question, I should explain that the Board is precluded by law from giving preferential treatment to any class of consumers.  I am informed by the ESB, however, that a county council or any consumer can, by a cash payment amounting to 25 times the annual special service charge, buy out the charge.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister states that these special service charges are necessary and that there is no way of relieving the people of them, would he not consider that one way would be to recommend to the ESB reducing their very heavy advertising and donating that amount towards a subsidy?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that some of these cottages in Kerry have been wired for years and yet the people cannot get light without paying a special charge which is as high in some cases as £5 19s. 6d. every two months?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>It is anticipated that about 89 per cent of the rural dwellings which have not already obtained supply since the post-development scheme started should be able to get supply at the normal fixed rate of charge, or at special charges not exceeding 50 per cent of the <Col N="504" /> normal fixed charge.  The Government regard that as very good progress in the Rural Electrification Scheme between 1960 and 1970, when the matter can then be examined again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>One would imagine that a body as large as the ESB would provide power for these cottages and economise in some other way so that consumers' bills would not be as high at £5 19s. 6d. every two months.  The ordinary person in a cottage cannot afford to pay that amount.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already explained to the Deputy that out of some 112,000 persons to whom the supply was given prior to the 1961 Act, there were only 12,000 people in that category. If we had a system without special service charges, the losses on the rural electricity accounts would go up from £1.2 million to £2 million, and the rural consumer is already being highly subsidised by the urban consumer. The Government consider at the moment that the subsidy given of 75 per cent of the cost of electrification is adequate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 5 of the Finance Act, 1945, exempted from estate duty and legacy duty, in connection with the death of a member of the Defence Forces, deferred pay credited to the pay account of the member or any gratuity granted in respect of his services with the Defence Forces.  Apart from this, there are no special death duties reliefs applicable to State servants.</P>
      <P>Gratuities paid by grace and not as of right on the death of any person, whether a State servant or not, have never been within the scope of estate duty.  I announced in my budget statement, however, that the Finance Bill would contain a general provision amending the estate duty charge.  This general provision will bring payments made <i>ex gratia</i> on death under a superannuation scheme or arrangement into liability to estate duty.  Gratuities affected by this new charge will include among other things an amount paid under the Superannuation Acts to the personal representatives of a deceased civil servant.  They will include also an annuity secured to the widow of a civil servant by the surrender of a part of his pension.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister recall denying in a most definite way in the course of the discussion on the Financial Resolution that this was the effect of what he was proposing, namely, to bring within the scope of the 1965 financial regulations these payments on death which up to now were not caught?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the Deputy is on the wrong track altogether.  He will remember that during the course of the debate on the Finance Bill last year, certain questions were raised about this non-liability to death duty arising on the death of a civil servant. These benefits were always regarded as <i>ex gratia,</i> and in common with other <i>ex gratia</i> payments on death, they were not subject to estate duty. There was a general consensus of <Col N="507" /> opinion in the House that these payments should be brought within the liability of estate duty.  For this purpose the section is now being amended.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware that certain agricultural employees at the Munster Institute are taxed for income tax purposes at the standard rate rather than under the PAYE system, and that this system imposes considerable hardship on the workers concerned; and if he will arrange for these men to be taxed under the PAYE system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Employees at the Munster Institute are remunerated by the Department of Agriculture and tax is deducted from their emoluments in accordance with the usual system of tax deductions in operation for those paid by Government Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There seems to be some confusion arising from the circumstance that while the standard rate of income tax is 6s. 4d in the £ the rate used in making PAYE deductions from pay is <Col N="508" /> 4s. 9d.  The explanation is that the 4s. 9d rate is a method of granting the Earned Income Relief deduction from the taxable income.  Persons not within the PAYE system get the Earned Income Relief before their income is charged to tax.  The charge on a given income is the same whichever method is adopted.</P>
    <P>On the general question of bringing State employees under the PAYE system, I would refer the Deputy to the reply given to Deputy Norton on 17th February last.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The facilities to which the Deputy refers are not liable to income tax because they do not fall to be regarded as income.  As to the concluding part of the question, benefits received by virtue of the holding of an office or employment which do not take the form of cash in the hands of the individual concerned and which cannot be converted into cash are taxable only where the provisions of Part IV of the Finance Act, 1958, apply.  Those provisions were introduced to prevent avoidance of tax by directors and the more highly-paid employees of business concerns and I am not aware of any developments which would necessitate any extension of their scope.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government the reason for the delay in sanctioning the appointment of rate collectors in County Longford; and when he intends to give sanction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposal by the Longford County Council for the appointment of five rate collectors which involved a change-over from the office system of rate collection that had been in operation for some time required detailed consideration.  When approval issued in August, 1965, to the local authority's proposal to change over from the office collection system and to create posts of outdoor rate collector the particulars then available showed that the results achieved by the office system compared unfavourably with the results of the outdoor collection. Since then, however, arising out of correspondence with the local authority on the overall unsatisfactory position, returns received, in particular those for 31st January and 28th February, 1966, indicate that the office system of collection has improved considerably and is significantly more effective than the outdoor system.  It will not be possible to make a fully reliable assessment of the relative efficiency of the two systems until the returns for the present month become available.</P>
      <P>In the meantime a decision on the proposed appointment of outdoor collectors has been deferred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The March returns should be available within the next week or so and <Col N="521" /> I will then be in a position to communicate with the local authority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that advertisements appeared in local papers after the vote had been taken at the county council meeting, surely it is the Minister's duty now to sanction the appointment of those five people, or is the reason not to appoint one of political expediency, due no doubt to the fact that none of the candidates or the people who would be appointed&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Deputy allow me to answer the question?  I have already indicated in my reply, if the Deputy was listening to it, the basis on which in August last year I agreed to change from the office collection of rate payment to outdoor collectors, but that information has since then shown a considerable change, and in the recent available returns from 31st January and 28th February, so radically has the situation changed that the office collection is now significantly shown to be more effective than the outdoor collection system, which is a complete turnover from what it was last August.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>If you approved it last August, is it not the usual practice, as has always been done in the past, that the appointments were sanctioned by the Minister for Local Government within a month or six weeks without waiting for any investigations, and further, is it not quite evident that there could be radical changes when hundreds of civil bills were issued in County Longford to make people toe the line and pay up this money earlier than in other years?</P>

Corporation staff would be engaged in the inspection of property following both explosions, in the normal course of their duties, to ensure that buildings had not become dangerous. Processing of claims arising out of the first explosion would fall to be dealt with by the local authority.  It is necessary, in the corporation's interest, therefore, to distinguish between claims arising out of the first and second explosions and on that ground the employment of their officers on the processing of all claims in the first instance would be covered by their general statutory powers to assign duties to their staffs.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he will state, having regard to the recent statement by the Builders' Federation relating to the very serious state of the building industry caused by the decline in construction work, what steps the Government will take to ensure that <Col N="529" /> sufficient capital is provided without delay to permit the building industry to regain its former level of operations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>While I do not agree with some of the views expressed by the Federation in their published statement of 18th instant, I note that they say that &ldquo;...If the work envisaged in the recently published estimates is put into hands in the coming financial year, public-financed work should be maintained for most sectors of the industry at a level which is reasonable in the present circumstances&rdquo;. I note also that in a further statement by the Federation, showing the results of a survey, covering the period January and February, 1966, carried out by them, it is stated that &ldquo;... the returns disclose that the volume of work in hands has not declined as much as was anticipated&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>As regards the allocation of capital for services under my control, I would point out that the budgetary provision for 1966-67 of £24 million is the highest ever made and compares with an estimated outturn of £23.27 million in the current financial year and to £18.93 million in 1964-65.</P>
      <P>I might add that I have been informed by the principal building societies and insurance companies that they expect to advance about the same amount of capital loans for the purchase of new houses in 1966 as in 1965.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the position in County Dublin is that fewer than half the number of private houses are being built now than last year?  Furthermore, is he aware that many of the houses built within the past six months have not yet been paid for, or occupied, that the moneys allocated by him to Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council are insufficient to meet the cost of the houses already built and that nothing whatsoever has been provided to enable any more houses to be built in either Dublin city or Dublin county, other than local authority houses?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I recently approved interim proposals submitted by the corporation for new differential rent scales to apply to tenants who are appointed for the first time on or after 28th February, 1966, or who move on or after that date to vacant dwellings in the corporation's estate which were <Col N="535" /> first let since 1932.  Tenants of reserved houses who transfer to non-reserved houses come within the scope of the new scale, which provide for the payment of increased rents by the betteroff families, and reduced rents by the families in the lower income group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister consider it equitable there should be an increase of rent, to the extent in some cases of 30/- per week, in transfers of this kind?  Is he further aware that some of these tenants have been in occupation of the newly-wed type of houses for as long as five and six years, if not longer, and does he not consider that this revolutionary increase in rent of up to 30/- per week will work a great hardship on these families?  In the light of these facts, would he not have a look at the scheme with a view to ensuring that such hardship will be lessened as much as possible?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The point about it is that, by and large, these schemes are sent to me for approval.  They are prepared by the corporation.  Unless I can find particular objection to them, I do not normally go back and say to the corporation that I do not like this, or that they should not do that, because, in a general way, if they conform to the general pattern of things, they are in most cases in a better position in their own housing area to work out the details, and what might appear to me to be unreasonable might, in fact, for their own specific reasons, be quite reasonable in the particular housing authority area.  It is very difficult to say to the corporation that I know better and that something seems to be unreasonable and they should not do it. The other point is that nobody wants his rent increased, but, side by side with that, these increases, as I understand them, are in all cases related to the income of the household concerned. It is not just a matter of increasing the rent because a tenant has changed from one house to another.  Under the differential system, rents are related to income.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">

      <P>Is the Minister aware that on 23rd February he told me he had word from the county engineer that they were working on it and that the flooding would be alleviated in one week?  The week was up exactly one month ago but the flooding is still as bad as it was.  Could the Minister get in touch with the county engineer and the Office of Public Works to see that something will be done?  The small farmers there cannot get out to plough their land which is flooded.  Furthermore, they have to travel up to seven and eight miles to get to land which is only 300 yards away from them.  Grave inconvenience is experienced in the area as a result of this flooding.</P>

      <P>The current season's land settlement programme, which has been gathering momentum in recent months, is now at its peak.  This means that the position regarding lands taken over by the Land Commission for division throughout the country generally is rapidly changing from day to day.  For that reason, statistics on the lines requested, if compiled as of now, would be very quickly out of date.</P>

    <P>NOTES: 1.  Where service is 22 years or more the weekly rate of pension is increased by one shilling in respect of each year in excess of 21 years but not in excess of 31 years.</P>
    <P>2.  A minimum of 21 years' service is required for the grant of a pension to a non-commissioned officer or private who is discharged on grounds other than disability or age.  In the latter two instances a minimum of 15 years' service is necessary.</P>
    <P>3.  Non-commissioned officers and privates are not eligible for gratuities on discharge, in addition to pensions, but married personnel are eligible for an additional married pension.</P>
    <P>4.  The benefits payable on discharge to married non-commissioned officers and privates do not include separate elements in respect of children.</P>

      <P>The report of An Foras Tionscal for 1965 shows that approval was given for a grant of £3,890 to the firm mentioned by the Deputy.  I understand from An Foras Tionscal that the grant was towards the firm's capital expenditure on buildings and machinery for the purpose of enlargement and adaptation to make the undertaking more efficient.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Deputy will realise that one can get many different interpretations or definitions of &ldquo;capital investment&rdquo; in this context. In so far as the State capital investment programme is concerned, the figure for 1965-66 for agriculture was about £19 million as against £11½ million for industry and the estimated figures for 1966-67 will be somewhat of the same order.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so aware. The persons who have been employed as netsmen in the combined estuaries of the Owenmore and Owenduff Rivers were employees of a fishery company operating by virtue of a claim to a several or exclusive fishery.  The bye-law of 11th March, 1966, does not apply to fishing by the owner of a several fishery within the limits thereof and if the persons in question cease to be employed it will not be as a result of the bye-law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>I hasten to assure the Minister that the disemployment of 40 persons will result from this and if the marking were moved, say, about 880 yards up river, certainly in the case of the Owenmore, it would obviate a considerable amount of the unemployment foreshadowed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not my information. The idea of the order is to create sanctuaries so that there will not be public invasion.  There is nothing to prevent the fishery company operating outside these sanctuaries.  My information is that some of the netsmen concerned propose to fish on their own accord inside the fishing limits but outside the sanctuary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>Some are fishing outside the fishing limits and some inside, in pursuance of a claim against the present owner.  I understand that there are certain negotiations going on arising out of a High Court action and that it probably will be settled.  That would probably mean that the Minister will <Col N="557" /> have added responsibility in the matter if the settlement is on the lines I have heard.  In those circumstances, my information is that if the proposed sanctuary limits were moved 880 yards up river it would obviate much of the trouble contemplated.  I am not quite certain about the position on the Owenduff river but I know in all there are eight boats involved of five men each.

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs if he is aware of the serious situation which may arise from the threatened strike of the Post Office Engineering Union with consequent failure to maintain the telephone service in proper working order; and what steps he proposes to take to minimise the inconveniences to essential services, trade, business and the public generally resulting therefrom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am fully aware of the serious situation that would arise if the threatened strike should take place.  I can assure the Deputy that everything possible would be done to minimise the inconvenience to the public and especially to essential services but I do not consider it expedient to give particulars at this stage of the measures planned.  Announcements will be made in due course if the need arises.</P>
      <P>In view of the seriousness of the position, I think it right to inform the House of the background.  Since early January the Irish Post Office Engineering Union have been pursuing a campaign of obstruction in support of wages claims and in consequence many telephone subscribers have suffered serious delay in having faults on their telephones repaired and many people on the waiting list who should have got telephones have been kept waiting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The union in common with the other Civil Service Staff Associations are <Col N="565" /> parties to the agreement with the Minister for Finance which established the scheme of Conciliation and Arbitration for the Civil Service.  That scheme provides a peaceful, orderly, and fair way of resolving disputes between the staff associations and the Administration, and it has brought immense benefits to the Civil Service, including the members of the Irish Post Office Engineering Union.  That union decided, however, on this occasion to use other measures to gain their ends.  Their claims were discussed at the Conciliation Council but agreement could not be reached.  The next step for the union under the agreed scheme would be to lodge the claims for hearing by the Arbitration Board but this they have not yet done although the disagreement on the main claims was reached last September. The union have openly stated that the object of their campaign is to make the shoe pinch on telephone users and to embarrass the Government, the Minister and the public so that when they bring their claims to Arbitration an atmosphere will have been created in which the Arbitration Board will give them a favourable award.</P>
    <P>Despite the serious inconvenience being caused to telephone users, I delayed as long as possible taking any action against the men who were engaged in this campaign in the hope that they would abandon it.  In further efforts to settle the matter I had three meetings with union representatives early this month but they remained adamant in their refusal to return to normal working and to submit their claims to Arbitration.  Instead they informed me that it was their intention not merely to continue but to intensify their campaign.  In the end I was obliged to warn them that if they persisted it would be necessary to take action against men refusing to do their work.  The union continued to campaign. Since the 15th March a total of 29 men have been suspended for refusal to obey instructions and 77 other men withdrew their labour.</P>
    <P>I want to use this opportunity to make absolutely clear to the union and the men that the Government will not tolerate the situation in which they are attempting to secure their <Col N="566" /> ends by hitting out at the nation and interfering with a vital national service. Civil servants have duties as well as privileges and one of them is to refrain from activities of this sort.  There will be no question of the Government yielding to such tactics.  The way is still open to the union to have their claims dealt with in an orderly way by the agreed machinery of Arbitration and I strongly advise them to abandon at once their ill-judged campaign and follow the agreed procedure before creating very grave difficulties for themselves and their members.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he is aware that there is no doctor available on the Aran Islands, County Galway; and what immediate steps he will take to ensure that one will be provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the doctor employed as temporary district medical officer on the Aran Islands resigned on 18th March and that despite special efforts by the health authority a resident successor has not been obtained up to today.  As the Deputy is, no doubt, aware it is difficult to recruit doctors for the more remote areas.  In the case of the Aran Islands, a special allowance of £560 is payable, in addition to the standard salary as an aid to recruitment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have just been informed that the <Col N="572" /> Galway County Council have arranged for a doctor to take up resident duty temporarily on Inishmore this evening. An additional nurse will take up duty on Saturday.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to that. Could the Parliamentary Secretary say if the Minister will regard this as a case for special treatment and see that something will be done so that a doctor will stay there?  This extra money is used up travelling from one island to the other.  A doctor has no practice there, only the dispensary practice, and no doctor will remain without a practice.  Will the Minister see that there is a further additional payment given to make the post attractive?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has made every effort to make this position as attractive as possible by offering an additional £560, which is somewhere in the region of 45 per cent higher than the standard salary for the position.  It is indicative of the Department's anxiety to get a permanent doctor for the Aran Islands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is aware that this money is used to travel from one island to another and in certain weather conditions, it is difficult to get a boat unless the lifeboat is employed. All these things add up.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>On 9th March, 1966, I authorised the County Tipperary (SR) Vocational Education Committee to prepare working drawings and specification for the proposed new vocational school at Carrick-on-Suir.  I await the submission of these documents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister say how it transpired that the original plans and specifications for this new muchneeded technical school in Carrick-on-Suir came to be revised by his Department? Why are the vocational committee now being put to the expense of preparing new plans for the school. <Col N="575" /> Since the original plans had reached a final stage of completion and, I understand, were given virtual approval by the Department?  Why has there been a change of policy in respect of these plans and specifications?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Which one does the Deputy mean by &ldquo;original&rdquo;?  I know one set of plans was submitted a few years ago and subsequently my Department suggested to the committee that the size of the school should be increased.  Further plans were submitted on this basis and, I think, were approved.  But then there was a further revision, to the best of my knowledge at the instance of the committee, to allow for garage accommodation which <Col N="576" /> had not been allowed for in the earlier plans.  There were a number of plans involved and that is why I am not sure to which plan the Deputy is referring. There has been no undue delay on the part of the Department of Education in this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Mullen asked me to clear up the question as to whether the doctors will have a choice of patient.  Paragraph 44 of the White Paper says patients will have a right to be attended by any participating doctor who &ldquo;is living within a reasonable distance and who is willing to take him as a patient.&rdquo;  It is not intended to force doctors to accept patients.  I cannot see why this should be done when the patient will have the right to go to another doctor, if he is not accepted by the participating doctor.  If no doctor will willingly accept a patient, there will be a provision for his being compulsorily assigned to a participating doctor.  This is done now under the maternity and infant care service.  Cases like this, however, will arise very infrequently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Tully referred to the long hours worked by ambulance drivers. As the Deputy is no doubt aware, the hours of duty of these men are fixed by the employing authority.  If any ambulance driver is forced to work excessive hours, the remedy is obvious&mdash;more drivers should be employed. It is open to any local authority to increase the number of drivers <Col N="590" /> at any time.  My approval is not required in a matter of this kind.  I would deprecate any arrangement under which a driver is required to remain on duty for unreasonably long hours, and if the Deputy will furnish particulars of any such cases to my Department, I will have them investigated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one matter not mentioned in this debate to which I should like to refer. I have been receiving a good many letters from members of the public who complain that they have been frustrated and exasperated in their dealings with health authorities because they were unable to find out who was the correct individual in the health authority office who could help them.  What happens in some cases apparently is that a person needs a service, believes he is entitled to it under the Health Acts and wishes either to verify his entitlement or to be told exactly what he must do to obtain the service, or both.  He telephones or calls to the authority and finds that it is very difficult to establish contact with the right person&mdash; the person who knows the problem and what should be done about it, <Col N="591" /> and who will tell the inquirer clearly and sympathetically what he should do.  Again, some of my correspondents suggest that medical officers and pharmacists, officers of the health authority, have not met their requirements in medical care or medicines and drugs.</P>
      <P>Now, I do not want the House or health authorities and their officers to get the idea that I believe that all of the public who phone them or make inquiries are dealt with summarily or brusquely or that they are deliberately fobbed off.  But I do feel that there is scope for better communications, a better way of handling people when they make their approach to the health authority.  We would like to feel that officers of the authority realise fully that the inquirer is either somebody in need of service, or seeking one for one of his family or a neighbour in need, that he or she is very probably legally entitled to it, and that the health authority and each of its officers is there to supply it.</P>
      <P>I propose to ask health authorities to overhaul their machinery for handling inquiries from the public.  I intend to suggest that in the first place each authority should look at the possibility of designating an officer to handle and follow-up inquiries.  The ideal thing to do would be to publicise the name of this officer and to allot him a special, published telephone number, and a private office.  I do not want to have these people coming along as they do in some health authorities, talking through a hatch and having their business discussed in a public way.  I realise this may be open to certain objections, but at least the authority should set up a specific information office to deal with inquiries and, if they cannot be answered on the spot, to follow them up promptly and get in touch quickly with the inquirer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mentioned also the person who feels that the doctor or pharmacist has not met his medical or chemist requirements. I realise, of course, that where the complaint is that the treatment given was not what the patient thought he needed, it is more than likely that what the doctor did or provided was right and that the patient was wrong. <Col N="592" /> Where, however, the complaint relates, for example, to delay on the part of the doctor or delay in getting a prescription for medicine filled, then if the person concerned can speedily contact a sympathetic officer in the authority who will inquire into the matter, do what he can to help out and get in touch with the inquirer quickly, a better service will result.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to say that I think this has been a useful and interesting debate&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasOHara" hpid="Mr. O'Hara Mr. O'Hara">

      <P>I am replying to my main Estimate, the Supplementary Estimate and the White Paper proposals. This is the first occasion on which I have introduced my Estimate in full after a year in office.  I also think, for the benefit of new Deputies and for my own benefit and edification, the exercise in which I have indulged of giving what appears to be the history of the health services, plus the attitude of the different Parties in the House, will serve a useful purpose.  I do not think the differences between us are insurmountable.  They may be academic but we are all united in one thing, I think, that our first consideration is the welfare of the patient.  I am glad that the general tone of the speeches was one of approval or, at least, I might say, of acceptance of what is proposed in the White Paper, and in the hard work which lies ahead for me in making it effective I shall be considerably guided and helped by this debate.  I hope to be back here with my Bill about November.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasOHara" hpid="Mr. O'Hara Mr. O'Hara">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>When I reported progress on Thursday last, the Minister had intervened to remind me that in Mayo we were in the act of setting up a pig fattening station at Balla. I want to assure the Minister that any development of that kind will receive every possible assistance from the Mayo County Committee of Agriculture. I shall go further and say that either the Minister or his Parliamentary Secretary would be very welcome to come to a meeting of the Mayo County Committee of Agriculture to discuss our problems.  The Minister is a busy man and I do not think he would come but perhaps his Parliamentary Secretary could.  His main responsibility is to the western regions, and if at a later date he receives an invitation from that committee we would appreciate very much if he would come down and discuss our problems.  As I have said on a number of occasions, it is not a political committee.  We discuss the business of farming.  The chairman of that body, who has been unanimously elected for a long number of years, is not a member of my Party but of the Minister's Party.  However, he was not elected because of his political affiliations but because we regard him as a man of ability and a man who has done his work well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Pig production in the western areas followed a certain pattern in years gone by.  If we are to have pig fattening stations in different parts of the west the whole approach will have to be changed.  This is not the only business in which people will be obliged to change their methods.  The farming community are rather conservative and slow to change their methods.  Many <Col N="595" /> people in the West got out of pig rearing because they found it uneconomic along the lines they pursued. Whether the new method will be a success or not I cannot say at this stage, but I do believe it has certain advantages for the farming community. Many of my neighbours in the past were in the habit of producing two or three pigs every three or four months. The day of the two or three pig units is gone and the business can no longer be carried on successfully along those lines.</P>
    <P>We do not seem to have made the progress in regard to our bacon products that I should like to see.  I am inclined to blame the bacon factories. Many bacon factories in this country have had long experience of producing bacon, and one would think they would have done better at home as well as in the export field.  Our marketing system is not what it should be. I was in England a few years ago, and as a matter of interest I went round the shops in London and in other cities to see if I could find any Irish bacon on sale but, in those years in any case, there did not appear to be any Irish bacon on sale.  I did meet some people who said they would be glad to buy Irish bacon if they could be sure of regular supplies.  It seems that due to the uncertainity of supply and, in many cases, due to the poor condition of the marketed product, we lost our connection and lost a lot of valuable business in that market.</P>
    <P>It is up to the Minister to do something about marketing arrangements. The all-important things are the quality of the finished product, the proper display of the goods and, above all, continuity of supply.  Over a long period we have had little but nuisance value in the British market.  We were in today with large quantities of bacon and suddenly, when we had established a market for a short while, we had to tell our customers we had not sufficient quantities of bacon or perhaps none at all.</P>
    <P>I have been specially requested to mention the question of creameries which is vitally tied up with the question <Col N="596" /> of bacon.  The Minister will appreciate there are good prospects for the dairying business in the West.  In the past we did not engage in dairying in a big way.  The southern counties were more famous than we for the production of dairy products.  Now that something is being done about the development of the co-operative societies and new separating stations being established in the West, it is important that the Minister would sanction a plan submitted to his Department some three months ago.  I know this is very involved and it takes time to look over it and reach a reasonable decision.  I can tell the Minister that in the Killala and Ballina areas, which would include Crossmolina and other adjoining areas, Killala creamery separating station is overloaded.  It has a capacity of 5,000 gallons and has to handle about 12,000.  That figure will probably continue to increase.  Many of the suppliers to that creamery are small suppliers trying their hand and it would be important that we should encourage and help them in every way possible.  I would ask the Minister to look into the question of sanctioning the proposals submitted to his Department.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to repeat that fundamental to the helping of the small western <Col N="597" /> farmers are the dairying and pig rearing industries.  These industries should receive every possible help.</P>
    <P>There is another matter to which I should like to refer briefly&mdash;I can assure the Minister I will not be as long as the previous speaker, the Minister for Health&mdash;and that is fertiliser subsidies. I am appealing to the Minister to do something special for the West in the matter of giving further subsidies on fertilisers to make them cheaper for our farmers.</P>

      <P>However, my intervention has been prompted in order to make some references to a few of the points in the Estimate which have been brought out in the Minister's speech and in other speeches since this debate started.  There were many references, including some in the Minister's speech, to the calved heifer subsidy scheme.  I have asked numerous Parliamentary questions regarding this scheme in order to get some information on it and I came to certain conclusions on which I should like the Minister's observations. The Minister in his opening statement&mdash;and I quote from the Dáil debates of the 24th March, 1966, volume 221, No. 14, column 2242&mdash; said:</P>
      <P>The main reason for this increase&mdash; that is the increase in the number of cows&mdash;</P>
      <P>is the dramatic rise in our cattle population, mainly due to the remarkable response throughout the country to the Calved Heifer Subsidy Scheme.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to the extent to which a handful of wide-awake boys have cashed in on this scheme because this has been brought out forcibly in the answers I have received to Parliamentary questions asked as recently as the 2nd of March, 1966.</P>

      <P>I have the Dáil debate of the 24th of March in which practically every speaker referred to this.  Most of them praised it and said it brought a lot of good to the farmers.  The Minister himself referred to it and I think I would be in order in answering not alone the Minister's statement but those of practically every Deputy.  I have gone through the debate and have marked on nearly every page a reference to it so I think it is unfair at this stage to cut out reference to this, when it has been gone into in very great detail up to now by practically every speaker.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I definitely do not see why there should be one ruling for all the speakers in this debate up to now, and why a new ruling should be brought in at this stage.  So far the scheme has benefited only a small section of the people.  Fifty per cent of the farmers have got no benefit out of it whatsoever.  However, I will have another opportunity of giving the facts. I want to stress the fact that it has a direct bearing on the Supplementary Estimate now before us, because we would not have this Supplementary Estimate but for the increase in the number of cattle, due to the heifer subsidy scheme.  The Minister said that in his opening speech.</P>
      <P>The amount which the scheme has cost the Exchequer is enormously high, and it is questionable whether this £5½ million could not have been disbursed in a more equitable and more efficient manner, and in a manner which would be of more benefit to a larger number of farmers.</P>
      <P>In his opening remarks, the Minister referred to the June, 1965, livestock figures.  As reported in the Official Report of 24th March, 1966, volume 221, column 2242, the Minister said:</P>
      <P>The official returns show that our cattle numbers have risen from 4,860,000 in June, 1963, to 5,360,000 in June, 1965, an increase of 500,000 in two years.</P>
      <P>It is a pity that the Minister did not use the most recently available figures.  The figures for January, 1966, were available to the Minister around mid-March, and they were definitely available to him when he came into this House to present this Estimate, but it probably did not suit him to produce the January, 1966, figures.  He might have concluded that butter production in 1966 will be, if not less than it was in 1965, definitely not higher.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Nonsense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I am giving facts issued by the Department.  In every one of the past five months: September, <Col N="602" /> 1965, October, 1965, November, 1965, December, 1965 and January, 1966, butter production in the creameries has been two per cent below the level in the corresponding months last year.  I do not see how that can be termed nonsense.  There is a reduction in butter production at the creameries.  This may not mean that there will be an overall reduction in butter production for the full 12 months, but in the same period last year, there was an increase of 12 per cent on the 1964 figures.  This year we have a reduction of two per cent. The months I have quoted are the off-peak months for butter production; nevertheless I feel there is an indication that butter production in the cur-rent 12 months will not be any higher than it was last year.  Of course this should mean there will be no increase in the amount required for butter export subsidies in the coming year. There should be no increase under that heading, if we take any notice of the present indications.</P>
      <P>From what I have heard so far in this debate, it seems that in a year or so there will be no pork or bacon exports either, and that there will be no need for a subsidy for those.  The figures recently issued for in-pig gilts give a clear indication of the intentions of the farmers over the next 12 months regarding pig production.  It is by those figures that we know exactly what the farmers are going to bring to the bacon factories over the next 12 months.  We find that the number of in-pig gilts in January, 1966 was 48.1 per cent less than a year ago.  I cannot find a previous greater drop in the amount than this.  It indicates that the farmers are getting helter-skelter out of pigs.  This, of course, will have serious repercussions on the bacon curing industry.  Those repercussions were fully outlined by my colleague, Deputy Coughlan, when he spoke on this Estimate.  This will have to be taken very seriously because there are too many people involved, both in production and farming, and also in employment in the factories.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Estimate also includes an extra subsidy for butter.  I want to refer now <Col N="603" /> to the possible, and to the suggested, more economic method of butter production in general.  I refer, of course, to the proposals of the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society to amalgamate and rationalise the dairying industry. I want to quote from a leading article of the <i>Irish Independent</i>, Wednesday, March 30th, 1966.  The leading article was headed &ldquo;Proposals Rejected.&rdquo;  I agree with the general sentiments outlined in that article.  I want to quote from the last paragraph of that leading article:</P>
    <P>Like every other industry in the country, the dairying industry must accept the obligations to make itself more efficient, to lower its costs and improve its production and marketing structure.  This obligation is all the greater in light of the heavy subsidy burden on the Exchequer from the existing support programme of dairy products.  Surely the IAOS proposals should not be rejected out of hand?</P>
    <P>Now, a recent announcement by the co-operative creamery committees about this matter seems to indicate there will be strong resistance to these proposals.  Before any of those proposals can be even considered by all those affected, it must be clearly shown that any plan for large-scale reorganisation of the industry, including massive closures of small creameries, must be supported with guarantees regarding the workers in the creameries, their future and their employment.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the Irish Transport and General Workers Union have entered into discussions with the IAOS on this aspect of the matter. Rationalisation and amalgamation of industry in this country has become a very questionable sort of procedure. The words &ldquo;rationalisation&rdquo; and &ldquo;amalgamation&rdquo; are becoming dirty words.  This should not be but it is the image that has been created by what these two words have meant in the past.  We have seen this happen in the flour milling industry where small mills in small towns were closed up, employment was lost and the community in those towns suffered.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="604" /> At the present time there are other forms of rationalisation and amalgamation going on and they are all giving rise to some discontent.  In the middle of last year, even Messrs.  Guinness took over a number of the ale breweries in this country and the workers of those four breweries in that group are now on strike.  This is their third week on strike.  We must, no matter who is at the head of it, whether it is Messrs.  Guinness or the Government, have all the implications of any such plan fully investigated.</P>
    <P>Deputy T. O'Donnell has questioned the Minister from time to time on this problem.  On 23rd February, 1966, at column 231 of volume 221, he asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries the procedure which it is proposed to follow in implementing the IAOS proposals for reorganisation of the dairying industry; and when it is proposed to put the proposals into effect.  The Minister said:</P>
    <P>A plan illustrating a possible form of reorganisation of the creamery industry has recently been prepared by the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society and, I understand, is at present the subject of discussion at the Society's regular regional conferences.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell asked a supplementary question:</P>
    <P>Would the Minister say whether or not this proposed reorganisation was, in fact, examined in his Department before the document was circulated to the creameries; in other words, was it examined and approved by his Department before it was circulated?</P>
    <P>The Minister replied:</P>
    <P>There was no question of my Department approving it.  This is an IAOS exercise.</P>
    <P>Here again the Minister misled the public and misled Deputy O'Donnell because it is not an IAOS exercise. It has been given to the IAOS by the Government.</P>

      <P>The Government, in <Col N="605" /> their <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i>, gave the responsibility for doing this to the IAOS.  It is a matter for decision by the Government whether those schemes thought up will be implemented or not.  The IAOS are only the small boys in the scheme, the men who have the job to think up the finer points, to go round and work out how to apply them.  The general principles have been laid down by the Government in their <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion.</i> When the Minister says this is completely an IAOS exercise, it is a distortion of the true situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>This was published by the Stationery Office in Dublin, this Second Programme Digest, and on page 6 it says under the heading &ldquo;Dairying&rdquo;:</P>
      <P>The IAOS is to be given responsibility for encouraging the rationalisation of creameries.  State aid will be given on the same basis as in industry generally towards the cost of the rationalisation and modernisation of the dairying industry. State financial assistance will be given to a limited number of pilot projects for bulk transport of milk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is down there, and more in detail in the actual Second Programme itself. These things should be made <Col N="606" /> quite clear.  I want to know if sufficient information is available on which to base such an important national decision, on an issue of such major importance. Has sufficient research been carried out?  These are questions that must be answered because in the long run they will affect the price of milk, the price of butter and the amount of subsidy which the Exchequer will have to pay on it. It appears from the information available that the proposals are based on two assumptions&mdash;one, that there will be an increase of 50 per cent in milk output between 1964 and 1970, and two, that larger units produce more economically than smaller units. Both of these assumptions are highly questionable at this stage because not enough research has been done, not enough information is available.  I want to make it quite clear that I am not against the principle of rationalisation and the more efficient working of the dairying industry, but the proposals which are now outlined seem to be rushed proposals, not thought out with all the facts and research that should be done in relation to a national decision of this major importance.</P>

I am not an expert on farming and cannot say how the scheme could be applied more efficiently.  I have learned about other aspects of the scheme from an article in the <i>Irish Times</i> on 17th March last in which it was inferred that this scheme affects the price of cattle generally.  Frankly, I am not in a position to discuss all the implications of the price of cattle but I think this article is well worth the attention of the Minister and the Department of Agriculture.

      <P>Notwithstanding the apparent, even dramatic, success attending it to date, serious reservations must be made as to the ultimate effect of the CHS scheme on the Irish cattle and dairying industry.  The scheme has every appearance of having been hastily conceived and poorly thought out.  In particular it is indicative of a very limited appreciation on the part of the Department of Agriculture of the rather complex relationships which determine cow numbers in Ireland.  The scheme has been superimposed upon these relationships with no apparent consideration of its longer term implications.  Thus, despite&mdash;indeed because of&mdash;its success in the short term, there remains good reason to fear that the ultimate effect of the CHS will be to cause, at great expense to the Exchequer, a serious disruption of the cattle and dairying industry.</P>

      <P>This increase in cow numbers has been achieved in two ways: first, by mating and bringing into herds a larger number of heifers than usual and, second, by retaining in herds cows which, owing to low output, age or other causes, would normally have been culled.  Before 1963 the normal annual rate of culling in dairy herds was around 82 per 1,000 cows.  In 1964 this rate declined to 62 per 1,000 and in 1965 to 39 per 1,000.</P>

But there is another implication to be taken into consideration.  In the years 1961 to 1963, before ever this scheme was heard of, there was an increase in numbers of 4.6 per cent.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to prove to the Minister that the scheme could be disbursed on a more equitable basis and in a more efficient manner than at the present time.  As I said, there was an increase from 1961 to 1963 of 4.6 per cent.  If we take the 1963 figure and apply that 4.6 per cent to it we find there would have been a further increase in numbers of 70,000 between 1963 and 1965, and that without the scheme.  Therefore, we take off from the actual increase of 240,000 the number of cows which should have been culled, which amounts to anything up to about 90,000, and we take off the 70,000 which would have been reached in any event without the scheme, and we find the scheme can really take credit for an increase in numbers of about 70,000.  If the Minister wants to divide that 70,000 into the £5,500,000 he can work out exactly what the scheme costs the Exchequer or, in other words, what each head of actual increase costs the Exchequer.</P>

      <P>I have also referred to the possible reduction in the number of pigs available to the factories in the next 12 months and the serious repercussions this will mean for farmers and the employees in the bacon factories if it is allowed to develop.  I was speaking of the proposal of the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society to rationalise and amalgamate <Col N="618" /> the dairying industry when the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance came into the House and indicated that he would like to hear the facts and figures about the heifer scheme.</P>
      <P>I now want to take up where I left off on this scheme of rationalisation.  I had asked if sufficient information was available on which to base this decision and if sufficient research had been carried out.  The proposals seem to be based on two assumptions, that there would be a 50 per cent increase in milk output between now and 1970 and that larger creameries will produce more cheaply than smaller ones.  Both assumptions are open to question.  Milk production may not increase and we cannot say from the facts and figures available to us that there will be an increase of 50 per cent in milk production between now and 1970.  The present indications do not lend themselves to this assumption.</P>
      <P>Nor has it been proved yet to my knowledge that production costs in the smaller creameries are greater than those in the larger creameries.  This is a matter that requires serious and thorough research and much more information would be required before a decision on it could be arrived at.  It is important that all concerned should be informed of the benefits that may be got from rationalisation and amalgamation. I have already quoted the leading article from the <i>Irish Independent</i> of Wednesday, 30th March, and I might say that the general sentiments expressed in that very fair leading article put both sides of the question fairly well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have pointed out to the Minister that this scheme, about which he has tried to give the impression that it is the sole responsibility of the IOAS, has been put forward by the Government in the section of the Second Programme dealing with the agricultural sector of the economy.  What everybody who is concerned in this industry must know is whether it will involve heavy public and private capital expenditure, whether it will involve large scale redundancy, whether it will result in cheaper butter production, whether it will result in butter being produced in <Col N="619" /> a more economic way thereby helping the producer, the worker and thereby helping to relieve the Exchequer of the present subsidy.</P>
    <P>We want to know if these proposals will have this effect.  There must be a through study made of all these aspects, a study that will produce a complete blueprint for the reorganisation of the Irish creamery industry.  The public, the Government, the milk suppliers and the workers, if this blueprint was available, could then decide on the facts, knowing in advance how this reorganisation would affect all concerned.  I want to emphasise that if all these people knew in advance how the scheme would affect them I can see no reason why such a scheme should not be implemented.  All these aspects of the matter must be investigated.</P>
    <P>The suspicions generated by lack of information are now showing themselves and the co-operative societies at a meeting in Limerick over the weekend rejected these proposals probably because they have not got the guarantees which I have indicated they should get, probably because they do not know what the future will hold. It is essential that there should be complete research on this proposal to reorganise the creameries in order that all concerned will know where they are going, how it will affect them and how it will benefit the dairying industry in general.</P>
    <P>These are three items in this Estimate that I have selected for study and research.  I have aired my views on them.  The fact that I am not a farmer has allowed me to speak more freely and in a more practical manner about them.  I have not been influenced by any prejudices or experiences. Every statement I have made is backed up by facts and figures supplied by the Department of Agriculture&mdash;every one of them.  I challenge Deputy Gibbons, the Minister or anybody else to say where I have given wrong figures.  If they are wrong, then the figures issued by the Department are wrong.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> This Supplementary Estimate has been fairly fully dealt with on behalf of this Party by Deputies Donegan, Dillon, O'Donnell, O'Hara and others and, no doubt, we shall have further expert contributions from this Party before the motion is put.  I therefore rise to deal concisely with one or two points in which I am interested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I see that provision is made in this Supplementary Estimate for a substantial sum for the prevention or eradication of fowl pest.  I know that this is very praiseworthy on the part of the Department of Agriculture.  I know it is very important that fowl pest should be eradicated.  I want to make it clear that I am all in favour of it but I think that poultry farmers who suffer a lot through the activities <Col N="621" /> of the Department in eradicating the pest should be compensated.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that where fowl, after test, are found to be suffering from fowl pest and are destroyed, the poultry-keeper is compensated, perhaps not by payment of the full market value of the birds but, at any rate, he or she is compensated.  The case is different where a poultry farmer who is supplying eggs to hatcheries at a fairly good price is suspected of having fowl pest on the farm.  The farm is frozen for some time, perhaps several weeks, as I have known it to happen, in order to carry out tests to ascertain whether or not fowl pest is there.</P>
    <P>During the period that the farm is frozen, the poultry farmer is not allowed to sell eggs to the hatchery. He may sell the eggs only for table purposes or at commercial value, at a loss sometimes of several shillings a dozen.  If it transpires, after several weeks, that there was a false alarm and that there was no fowl pest there, the farm is declared free again and the poultry farmer is allowed to resume the sale of eggs to the hatchery, but, if I am correct, no compensation is paid to the poultry farmer for the very substantial loss sustained during the period he or she was prevented from selling to the hatcheries.</P>
    <P>I think that is unfair.  I think it is a mistake.  It is not calculated to encourage the poultry farmers to co-operate in the scheme for the eradication of fowl pest.  I have known one case in my constituency, about 12 months ago, where a poultry farmer suffered quite a substantial loss in the circumstances which I have been discussing and I consider that provision should be made for the payment of compensation to such a poultry farmer. I have made my point.  I hope I have made it clearly.  I should like the Minister to deal with it in his reply.</P>
    <P>Since I came in here to make this point, I have been listening to a discussion on the heifer subsidy scheme. I have heard the Minister claim that it has been an unqualified success.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> In your absence, Sir, there was a long and learned discussion on it which has prompted me to make the very brief point I want to make.  I understand that the Minister dealt with it in his opening remarks.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I shall deal with it in the very same way, if I may.  I am afraid this heifer subsidy scheme is catering for quantity more than for quality.  I think it is doing considerable damage to the standard of the cattle industry.  Heifers are now being put in calf which, before the scheme was introduced, would not have been considered the type of animal suitable for breeding at all. Now, the farmers are interested in getting the £15 subsidy and get rid of the heifer any way they like.  That is something that should be looked into. We are in a competitive age.  We are seeking to expand and develop our cattle export market.  I should like to have the Minister's comments on that in his reply.</P>
      <P>There is money in this Supplementary Estimate for the promotion of co-operative societies.  I think these co-operative societies should receive encouragement from the Minister for Agriculture and from the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society, Limited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am speaking now of the smaller co-operative societies throughout the country.  I know one co-operative society group which for two or three years has been endeavouring to set up an industry to process skim milk and that group have been kept on a string for a couple of years. They have been referred by the Minister to the IAOS and they have been told by that body that they can do nothing until they get a decision from the Minister. The Minister says the IAOS are advising <Col N="623" /> him.  I think that leads to frustration.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Parliamentary Secretary had not left, I might have availed of the opportunity to say something about a visit he paid to County Cavan.  It might be relevant to the provision of money for Macra na Feirme and the Irish Countrywomen's Association, as we are providing money here to finance the activities of these bodies.  They are very interested in the provision of piped water in rural areas.  The Parliamentary <Col N="624" /> Secretary came to my constituency and held a meeting at which he promised a number of things to the people of Templeport, including the immediate installation of a group water scheme.  I know the Minister is not responsible for that and, strictly speaking, I suppose it is out of order, but, as the Minister's Parliamentary Secretary promised, perhaps the Minister would ask his Parliamentary Secretary to use his good offices to implement the promise.</P>
    <P>I stood up to deal specifically with the question of fowl pest.  I am asking the Minister to deal with that in reply and I should also like his comments on my remarks regarding the heifer subsidy scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that there is nothing in this Estimate about the eradication of political pests, because if there were, I would be on shaky ground from the start.</P>
      <P>We are discussing a Supplementary Estimate of £2,045,000.  From my observation, there is very little of this amount going into the pockets of the farmers.  The first figure is for a sum of £415,000 under the heading of &ldquo;Salaries, Wages and Allowances&rdquo;. What I cannot understand, having read today's <i>Irish Times,</i> is what the Minister for Finance said yesterday about the dairy farmers: that the Irish people are well known to resist pressures or compulsion of any kind, that the Government are composed of Irish people who have, by and large, the same characteristics as the ordinary Irish people and that therefore they might reflect on these things before this action is undertaken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every other section of the community have in the past held, and are even at present holding, the Government up to ransom and in many cases the Government have given way to them.  Why are the farmers not entitled to the same rights under the Constitution? I believe they should have them. All the Irish dairy farmers want is a fair deal and a reasonable return for their labour.  They are not getting that. We all realise that they have been in the front line trenches in every war, political, national, social and economic, <Col N="625" /> and we know that 300,000 of them &mdash;between farmers and farm labourers &mdash;have left the land in the past 30 years.  The dairy farmers who have to milk their own cows daily have no 40-hour week.  They have a seven-day week and must get up at 4 o'clock or 5 o'clock in the mornings.</P>
    <P>The Government have refused to increase the price of milk.  This has resulted in the exposure of one of the most shameful rackets ever put across in this country.  In 1956 and 1957, when the whole Fianna Fáil Party machine was engaged in a campaign throughout the length and breadth of the land, demanding a large increase for milk for farmers, they moved in on farmers' organisations and used them for a venomous campaign against the then Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Dillon.  Milk marches were organised throughout the country and it is well known that on the day of the Kerry by-election a Fianna Fáil Deputy from Limerick was seen putting up posters in Kerry encouraging farmers to come here and march at that time.  Now, when the farmers talk of marching, the big stick is used and they are told they will not be allowed to march.  I think they have the same rights as any other section of the community.</P>
    <P>This situation reminds me of a story of a farmer who was travelling in an aeroplane and went into a small room to wash his hands.  When finished, he saw a notice saying: &ldquo;Do not pull the chain over cities or towns&rdquo;.  He said to himself: &ldquo;Yes, do not let it down on the city people or the town people but anything is good enough for the farmers.  You can crucify them in any way.&rdquo;  I think I may tell the Minister that out of the chaos of the conflicting ideas of the present time, the voice of the dairy farmers will be heard demanding attention.  There is a limit to the endurance of any section of the community and that limit has been reached by the farmers.  There is no use in the Minister or the Minister for Finance saying that it is their intention to bridge the gap.  There is a gap of almost £3 10s. already and it is time the Government started to bridge the gap instead of the golden boy fooling <Col N="626" /> the farmers' organisations with promises about this, that and the other thing in the future.</P>
    <P>The dairy farmers and pig farmers are entitled to a fair crack of the whip. They are not getting it today.  The farmers represent, roughly, only 35 per cent of the population and are responsible for 75 per cent of our exports, including meat and pigs, but they are getting only 25 per cent of the national income.  The Minister must admit that that is unfair and unjust.</P>
    <P>On page 12 of the Progress Report there is this statement:</P>
    <P>Let us face the fact that agricultural production is down by one per cent in 1965.</P>
    <P>If we are to get out of the mess we are in today it is to agriculture and the farmers that we must look for the necessary increased exports.  Therefore, it is regrettable that at the present time pig production is decreasing.  When I asked the Minister some questions about this a few months ago he denied it.  I said that the farmer was not paid a just price, that I remembered when pigs were selling at £6 or £7 and that last August and September in Mullingar they could not be sold at £4 or £4 10s.  The Minister told me that I was talking through my hat.  I warned him that producers would get out of pigs because they were not paying.  The Minister said that was nonsense.</P>
    <P>It is no harm to quote the official statistics.  On page 329 of the <i>Statistical Abstract,</i> 1964, under the heading &ldquo;Pigs, Porkers, deadweight&rdquo; it is shown that, in 1953, they were fetching as much as 256/- per cwt deadweight. I went to the trouble of getting the figures for 1965 in the office today. They were 239/- per cwt deadweight. That was the average.  That is a reduction of 17/- per cwt deadweight.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the decline in the value of the £ since that time, it is obvious that the farmer is getting 30 to 35 per cent less today for his pigs than he was getting at that time.  No farmer can continue at that rate.  If the Minister does not believe me, let him get the official figures.  I presume that he has the average price for 1965 which I obtained in the office today.</P>

      <P>There is no use in the Minister or anyone else giving a figure for any particular week or month.  On those figures one could make arguments but they would be one-sided.  It is the yearly average that must be taken into consideration.  The averages I am quoting are those for 1953 and 1965.  On those figures, pigs have dropped by 17/- per cwt, despite the fact that the 1965 £ is worth only about 14/- of the 1953 £.</P>
      <P>In 1948, young pigs under 12 weeks old were 106/9.  In 1951, they were 113/3.  Last year they were less than £5. In these circumstances, it cannot be expected that people will stay in production.  They must be paid for their work and the Minister cannot argue that pig producers are being paid for their work.  There is no other section of the community who are asked to work harder and for longer hours for less than they were getting 10 or 12 years ago.</P>
      <P>I welcome the statement by the Minister on 24th March:</P>
      <P>The official returns show that our cattle numbers have risen from 4,860,000 in June, 1963, to 5,360,000 in June, 1965, an increase of 500,000 in two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We welcome that trend and have always stood for that.  In the last 30 or 40 years the members of the Party of which I have the honour to be a member preached the importance of the cattle industry and of the British market and were told by the people on the other side of the House that that market was gone and gone forever, and thanks be to God.  Their own President said that the cattle industry was finished, that he knew it, and that the farmers should get out of cattle and into bees and that he had it on expert advice that the best type of bee <Col N="628" /> was the Egyptian bee.  The Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the present Taoiseach would have looked well going to England a few weeks ago to meet Mr. Wilson with swarms of bees under each arm.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>We welcome the fact that there are more cattle in the country at the present time.  The Minister should also remember that at one time, due to his Party's policy, there were very few cattle left in the country. At column 2243 of the Official Report the Minister spoke at length of the increase of 10/- per live cwt in the guaranteed price for fat cattle and the increase of 4d per lb. deadweight in the guaranteed price for fat sheep and went on to talk of the terms of the Free Trade Area Agreement and the value to the country of those price increases.</P>
      <P>I must point out that it has nothing to do with the Free Trade Agreement, that that increase is due to the 1948 Trade Agreement on cattle.  At that time the cattle prices here were tied to cattle prices in Britain and if there was an increase in Britain we automatically got that increase.  This increase was not passed on because Mr. Wilson wanted to get the votes of the farmers of Ireland today.  We will get the increase but no thanks are due to the Minister. We shall give credit where credit is due.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards pigs and bacon, too much has been made of the Free Trade Agreement.  The Minister seems to hang all his hopes on that Agreement. He has spoken of it on numerous occasions.  Even the Minister for Finance said yesterday that the farmers would benefit to the tune of £5½ million.  He is talking through his hat.  When speaking about pigs and <Col N="629" /> bacon or any other commodity that the farmer is producing, he has not taken into consideration the increase in rates, overhead expenses, et cetera.</P>
    <P>Under the Free Trade Agreement with Britain we are getting a paltry 1,000 tons extra, bringing the quota up to 28,010 tons.  It should be remembered that Denmark, which is making to move to enter into a free trade agreement, has been given an extra allocation of 11,060 tons, bringing their total quantity up to 300,000 tons.  A country that is one-quarter the size of this country is exporting over ten times the quantity that we are exporting.</P>
    <P>Has it not been a great loss to Ireland that we have not had a Government that would look after the small farmers and the pig producers, since 1932?  Denmark tops the list of suppliers to the British market with 300,000 tons; the British home suppliers come second with 232,240 tons; Poland is third with 50,900 tons and we come a very poor fourth with a miserable 28,010 tons.  A country that is only one-fourth the size of this country is exporting to Britain 47 per cent of Britain's imports, whereas we are exporting only 4.5 per cent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Under James Dillon they exported butter to us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>At column 2253 the Minister stated that the Coalition Government had to import Danish butter.  He tells us now that the British had to export butter to us.  The Minister may have been a young boy at the time, but from 1932 to 1948 his Party were in office and despite the fact that we had 2.8 million people and five acres of land for every person, under the Fianna Fáil strong one-Party Government the people in this agricultural country were rationed to two onces of butter per week.  The Minister knows that and he should not be talking about importing butter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister checks back, he will find that we were exporting £6 million or £7 million worth of butter and £506,000 worth of bacon to Britain in 1932.  Our total exports in 1932 were £36 million.  After 16 years of Fianna Fáil Government, and despite <Col N="630" /> the fact that prices doubled due to a world war, our total exports in 1947 were £39 million.  The Minister can check on those figures.  If there had not been a world war we would only be exporting about £20 million worth. That is how the Fianna Fáil Party killed the dairy industry and the pig industry and put an end to our exports at that time.  When he says that the Coalition imported butter from Britain let him get the full facts.</P>
    <P>The Department officials in 1951 went to Deputy Dillon&mdash;and in the three years he had been in office the 1948 Trade Agreement had been negotiated, two years before, the cow population had increased, we had better grass and more food for our cattle&mdash;and they told him that they believed that we could export butter to Britain.  He said: &ldquo;We will take a chance, but if the spring turns out to be bad what will happen?&rdquo;  They started to export butter and the spring weather turned out to be bad and our Government were left in a position that we had not enough butter for a month or two.  Danish butter was imported some of which was yellow but it should be remembered that the English people prefer yellow butter.  Fianna Fáil started a campaign and helped to put out the Government but they were back again in three years.  That should answer the Minister's interjection.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

      <P>No, it does not.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>It certainly does. What is the Minister doing at present? We have an agreement to export a certain number of cattle to Britain who in turn are exporting them to Germany. Why not allow us export them direct to Germany and get a proper price for them?  We are tied first to John Bull. The Minister could and should have done much better in the Trade Agreement. We are entitled to more than one-tenth of the quota allocated to the Danes whose purchases from Britain are less than two-thirds of ours.  Of course, the Danes, it should be remembered, did not have a Fianna Fáil type Party in office since 1932.  They had a business Government, the members of which had their eyes open and who sent their trade delegations to <Col N="631" /> Britain and elsewhere, and their Ministers and got good terms for their products.  The facts are there for everybody to see.  They are a wealthy nation today.  Even as far back as 1938, before negotiations took place, we were allowed to export 29,350 tons of bacon to Britain.  The Minister seems to be relying far too much on this Agreement. It is not going to be a cure for all our ills.  Everything will not readjust itself overnight.</P>
      <P>In the Supplementary Estimate there is provision for £58,700 for university colleges and in Subhead I.4 there is a grant-in-aid of £1,000 to Macra na Feirme.  We welcome that.  We have always stood for education and we believe that our young farmers should be educated.  We have always stood for co-operation with the various farmers' organisations.  Indeed, I have often argued that such organisations should get generous State grants.  We are agreed that if we are to hold our own in the competitive years ahead, and keep our places in the markets, our young farmers must be properly educated.  They must make the most of the land in order to get the best results from it.  They must be put in the position that they will be able to adopt up-to-date methods and modern techniques.  Other countries such as Denmark and Holland have proved that if farmers are properly educated and co-operate with one another they can increase their exports enormously. We on this side of the House are in full agreement with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subhead K.9 provides £43,000 for the prevention of diseases, etc., in livestock. I have already drawn the Minister's attention to the fact that contagious abortion is rife.  He has denied that and I cannot understand why.  I know that in my county it is.  I know of farms which have been taken by the Land Commission and which have been let to farmers and business people who have heifers on the land, and in some cases are getting the £15 subsidy, but contagious abortion is rife there. When the farmers come up with their herds of five or six cows, I do not know what is going to happen to them. It is unfair to them and it is something <Col N="632" /> the Minister should look into.

      <P>I said I would be brief. In fact, I would be well finished by now but for what happened.  I asked a question today in regard to the bovine tuberculosis eradication scheme in Galway.  I was told in reply that it would not be in accordance with usual practice to give particulars of the number of animals and compensation paid, as the heards concerned could readily be identified.  I have no way of readily identifying them.  I want to nail certain rumours going around.  I do not say I hold with them or suggest there is any irregularity. But the people of my town are asking questions which I am afraid require answers.  I have not been given the answers here.  To straighten the matter out the Minister should have an investigation in my area in regard to this question.  I do not suggest anything against the profession involved but I believe it would be a good thing to clear the air.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already raised on this matter of bovine tuberculosis eradication the <Col N="636" /> question of farmers in my area who have had their herds &ldquo;freezed&rdquo; for about six weeks.  This imposes a grave hardship on the people who have to wait for a fair at a time when they might be pressed to pay their rates. Something will have to be done to help them and I would ask the Minister to give attention to it.  This is something that can make or break the small farmers.  I know you cannot allow diseased herds to be going around but the Minister should provide some compensation in these cases even in respect of feeding stuffs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Haughey) Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand there is agreement with the Whips that business should be proceeded with as expeditiously as possible.  Therefore, I shall not reply at any great length, particularly as this is a Supplementary Estimate and I do not think it is expected the House should debate it in the same, broad comprehensive way as we would the main Estimate.  However, a few points were raised by Deputies to which I should like especially to reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Donegan and others took the line that there was nothing in this sum of £2,045,000 for the farmer.  They went on to add there was a provision of £415,000 for salaries and wages of civil servants and were inclined to contrast these two matters.  I shall deal first with this £415,000 salaries and wages for civil servants and officials.  I want to point out that the overwhelming bulk of this sum is as a result of no action of mine but of the award of the arbitrator under the scheme of conciliation and arbitration which exists in the Civil Service and which has now been approved of by every Party in this House.  The Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party from time to time have taken credit for the fact that a Coalition Government introduced permanently here a scheme of arbitration and conciliation for the Civil Service. If they want to take credit for that I do not blame them, because it is true that conciliation and arbitration for the Civil Service was first made permanent under the Coalition Government. On the other hand, they cannot get up <Col N="637" /> here and complain about the results which this scheme of arbitration and conciliation gives.  The bulk of the figure of £415,000 provided in this Supplementary Estimate is as a result of the decision of the arbitrator under this scheme.</P>
    <P>On the other side of the fence there is the suggestion that the Supplementary Estimate contains nothing for the farmer.  Of course, that is just so much nonsense.  Firstly, I claim that this £2,045,000 all goes for the benefit of the farming community one way or another, either directly or indirectly. Every penny of this money will redound to the advantage of the farmer and the farming community whether in the form of providing better veterinary services, better advisory services, better education for young farmers or the eradication of disease in livestock &mdash;in some way or other every penny involved here goes to the benefit of the farmer and of the agricultural community generally.</P>
    <P>But specifically&mdash;and this is where I want to challenge Deputy Donegan, Deputy M.P. Murphy and others&mdash;in this sum are included two items which go directly and immediately into the farmers' pockets.  One of them is the amount provided for the milk quality bonus scheme, £526,000, and the other is the amount we are providing extra in regard to pig prices.  The £956,000 which is provided in Subhead N for Marketing of Dairy Produce includes the full amount payable this current year for the bonus on quality milk, namely, £526,000.  That is an extra sum into the pockets of our dairy farmers.  As many Deputies know, we increased the price of feeding barley last season by 5/- a barrel.  In order to compensate the pig producer for that increase in the cost of his raw material we brought in a corresponding increase in the guaranteed price for pigs of 10/- a cwt.  That increase of 10/- a cwt has cost us in the current year about £275,000.  It is quite clear that whether it is in the form of a better price for barley or a better price for pigs, that £275,000 is an extra amount into the farmers' pockets.  I only mention these two items to indicate that there are included here amounts of <Col N="638" /> money which go directly and immediately to increase farming income.</P>
    <P>There has been a considerable amount of discussion about the trend in our cattle population statistics, and Deputy Dillon, in particular, put to me a number of queries in this connection. I cannot understand the violent dislike of the Fine Gael and Labour Parties for the calved heifer subsidy scheme. They never seem to miss an opportunity of attacking it in some way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">

      <P>Is the Minister sure he is in order?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I must reply to the debate as fully as I can.  They never miss an opportunity in this House of denigrating this scheme or of endeavouring to prove it is not really achieving the results it seems to be achieving. The simple answer is that it is the most successful production incentive scheme ever introduced in agriculture in this country or, I would go so far as to say, in any other country.  Its success has been dramatic.  We are well on the way, as a result of the scheme, to achieving the cow numbers we need to reach the output targets set in the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon said the scheme might encourage farmers to retain old cows in their herds which they would otherwise dispose of.  The statistics show that that suggestion of Deputy Dillon's is not sustainable.  Since the scheme was introduced, in 1963, 1964, 1965 and 1966 there has been culled from the herds every year a satisfactory number of either old or unsuitable cows.  In the year 1963, for instance, between milch cows and heifers in-calf, there was a total of 1,472,400 head; in the following year there was a total of 1,290,100 milch cows, so that between 1963 and 1964 there was a culling of about 12 per cent.  The same applied between 1964 and 1965.  The total of milch cows and heifers in-calf in 1964 was 1,565,400 head; in 1965 the number of milch cows was only 1,404,800 head.  Again, there was a <Col N="639" /> culling of about 10 or 11 per cent from the herd.  The same process took place between 1965 and 1966.  The total of milch cows and heifers in-calf in 1965 was 1,716,900 head, and that was reduced to only 1,535,000 head of milch cows the following year.  Even though the number of cows and heifers in-calf has increased dramatically as a result of this scheme, nevertheless there has been in each year an adequate amount of culling of old and unsuitable cows.</P>
    <P>It is also true that as a result of the BTE scheme there has been a considerable lowering in the average age of our dairying herds and of our milch cow population.  It is believed, and I think with very good reason, that the average age of our cow population is now much less than it was ten years ago when the BTE scheme began.  Therefore, there is no justification whatever for the suggestion by Deputy Dillon that the calved heifer scheme has resulted in the retention by farmers in their herds of old and unsuitable animals.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon also raised the question of our pork exports to the United States, and the relation of these exports to our bacon quota in the UK market.  He suggested that it was not good business to cease exporting pork to the US market if it were unsubsidised and sell the material instead in the form of bacon or pork to the UK market where it would have to be subsidised.  I noticed that the <i>Irish Independent,</i> in an editorial, took the same line.  This is based on a misconception. We were building up a small volume of pork exports to the US, about 600 or 700 tons a year, but it had to be subsidised.  The pork which we were exporting to the US had to be subsidised just the same as pork and bacon going to the UK market.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I was about to say I agree it would be desirable if we <Col N="640" /> could build up trade in pork and bacon exports to the US but, as a Deputy mentioned in the course of this debate, the important thing in any market is to consolidate your position in the market by ensuring that your supplies flow in regular quantities at fixed standards, and so on. We must as a matter of business make sure that we fulfil our quota to the UK market, and only when we have supplied the normal requirements of that market should we then consider building up in a regular way markets elsewhere.  We would all hope that as time goes on we would have adequate supplies to fill all the requirements in the UK market and have supplies available for other markets. That would be the ideal position, but there is no question, at the present time at any rate, of diverting supplies from an unsubsidised market in the US to a subsidised market in the UK.</P>
      <P>In connection with pigs also, Deputy Dillon asked if there were any developments about the co-operative pig fattening units.  The situation there is not unsatisfactory.  There is a number of these pig fattening units in operation, more of them are planned and we are doing everything we can to encourage an expansion of these units.  At the present time there are seven units in operation on a co-operative basis and, as Minister for Agriculture, I have guaranteed loans in the case of five of these.  There are a further seven in operation, associated with creameries, and there is talk of a number of others.  As referred to by Deputy O'Hara, there is one, we hope, about to come to fruition in the Balla/Louisburgh area of County Mayo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been some discussion also on our supply of butter to the United Kingdom market and some Deputies have asked why the subsidisation of our butter in the United Kingdom market is turning out to be expensive. Unfortunately, the position is that the price of butter in the United Kingdom market for all supplies fell catastrophically last year and, while we improved our position relative to earlier years, we still had to take for our butter in the United Kingdom market <Col N="641" /> a very unsatisfactory price indeed. There is no doubt that the weakness in the United Kingdom market was a more or less direct result of an excessive supply into that market from all the supplying countries.  To that extent, the butter agreement did not have the results most of us hoped would flow from it.  Despite the more or less rationing scheme which was introduced, the price was not maintained to the extent hoped.</P>
    <P>In that connection also I want to point out that the quota of 23,000 tons which we have secured under the Trade Agreement is of vital importance to us.  It has now been shown that this is even more important than we thought.  Last year we had a basic quota of 12,000 odd tons but we were able to secure allocations from the reserve which ensured that we could, in fact, send all the butter we had available into the United Kingdom. We sent in something in the region of 19,000 tons, as a result of this allocation from reserve on top of our basic quota.  But this reserve has been drastically reduced&mdash;from about 40,000 tons to 5,000 tons so there would not be any reserve available to us from which we could get an allocation, as we did last year.  The fact that we have a quota of 23,000 tons available to us is very important, indeed, because we expect to have in or around 23,000 tons of butter available for supply to the United Kingdom market.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that Deputy M.P. Murphy is not here because he has made the suggestion to me a couple of times that something should be done for the milk producers on some of the islands off the coast of Cork.</P>

      <P>I have been examining this matter as closely as possible, endeavouring to decide in what way the problem could best be tackled.  I have, by kind co-operation of the Dairy Disposal Company, been able to work out something which I hope will be satisfactory and acceptable.  We have decided that from the first of May of this year the Dairy Disposal Company will pay 4/- a pound for all butter produced on the islands, provided <Col N="642" /> it is of an acceptable commercial standard and provided the Dairy Disposal Company can, with a reasonable degree of economy, make arrangements for the collection of it, so that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, farmers' butter. The only stipulation we make about it is that the butter must be made on the islands.  The Dairy Disposal Company must be satisfied that it has been produced on the islands, that it is of reasonable commercial quality and that they have a collection point reasonably convenient to the islands in question.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael Deputies are quite amusing on the question of the 1948 Trade Agreement.  I believe they have repeated this nonsense so often they have now come to believe in it themselves.  I do not want to get involved in a sort of futile or sterile type of argument about the 1948 Agreement but it was a completely miniscule thing compared with the present Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement. What happened in 1948 was that certain arrangements were made with the British Government, at a time when the British Government were bulk-buying British requirements in food.  The British Ministry of Food purchased in bulk their requirements and the agreement made in 1948 related entirely to short-term arrangements for these bulk purchases by the British Ministry of Food.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All that was decided about cattle at that time was that the British Government guaranteed that they would not introduce any excessive increase in the existing differential of 5/- a cwt, which applied at that time. First of all, there was a differential of 5/- a cwt which was to be continued. All the British Government said was: &ldquo;We promise we will not excessively increase that 5/- a cwt.&rdquo;  That Agreement was expressed to last for a period of four years only.  How can anyone suggest that that in any way compares with what we have achieved under the recent Free Trade Area Agreement?  Now there is no differential. Our cattle will qualify for the <Col N="643" /> British guarantee payments system in exactly the same way as the British home-produced cattle qualify.  The three months' waiting period has been reduced to two months.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon also mentioned the boneless beef trade with the United States.  I agree this was an excellent trade.  It was built up very substantially.  I think in one year it went up as far as £10 million but unfortunately with the movement of prices, particularly the more attractive prices for cattle and beef on the Continent and the tailing off of the BTE scheme, the meat factories here were not in a position to keep up this trade with the US and it declined to practically nothing.  I am glad to be able to say it is now beginning to revive and get going again.  It is a very valuable trade and one which we hope will continue to expand and develop.</P>
      <P>Deputy M.P. Murphy asked about the proposed bacon factory in his constituency in west Cork.  The position from my point of view is quite clear. I have indicated that if there are 1,000 pig producers who are prepared to form themselves into a co-operative society and build a bacon factory, I must and will give them a licence. There is no argument about that.  I have already indicated to the interests concerned down there that that is the position.  I know there have been negotiations in a couple of different directions with a view to getting capital participation and also expert management facilities.  These negotiations are of course a matter for themselves, and I do not come into them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that they are planning a factory with a capacity of about <Col N="645" /> 1,000 pigs per week initially which will be able to go to 2,500 pigs per week eventually.  They also propose to provide facilities for the slaughter of sheep.  There is a question of a grant from Foras Tionscal involved but it is not a matter for me to say whether Foras Tionscal would be in a position to give a grant for such an enterprise. That is entirely a matter for Foras Tionscal to decide.  I am quite sure Foras Tionscal would have to have regard to the fact that there is excess capacity in the bacon industry at present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already dealt with that.  I mentioned that for some time we have been sending about 600 tons or 700 tons of pork cuts to the US.  We have to subsidise them as we subsidise pork and bacon exports to the UK market.  There is no great difference from the point of view of the Exchequer whether our bacon and pork go to the US or the UK.  I have already indicated that it would be desirable, if we had the supplies, to <Col N="646" /> be able to build up a long-term permanent market in the US as well as in the UK, but whatever market we are in we must put it on a regular basis and send our supplies consistently, and of uniform quality.</P>
      <P>The only other point which I feel I should mention at this stage is the question raised by a number of Deputies about the price of milk.  I have already indicated that I and the Government were pressed very strongly this year to do something about the price of milk.  We would very much like to have been able to do something and we would particularly like to have been able to do something in regard to quality milk.  Unfortunately, the position simply is that the resources of the Exchequer were not such that we could do anything.  Anything you do in regard to the price of milk is very expensive from the point of view of the Exchequer.  A penny a gallon on the basic price would cost about £2 million and a penny on quality milk would cost somewhere between £700,000 and £800,000.  This was a commitment we could not undertake this year whether we liked it or not.</P>
      <P>I have also mentioned that the income of the dairy farmers could be increased in a variety of ways.  I have been reading reports that the ICMSA intend to take action by picketing the Dáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>No doubt any Deputy over there would agree if he were told the whole story.  As the Chair pointed out quite correctly, we are discussing a Supplementary Estimate for £2,045,000 for agriculture.  I was saying, with regard to the price for milk, that we would have liked to be able to do something this year but unfortunately, in present circumstances, it just could not be undertaken.  I have pointed out time and time again that there are other ways in which we can increase the income and improve the position of the dairy farmers.  We can try to get rid of mastitis and brucellosis.  We can try to reorganise the dairying industry in a way that will give the farmers the best possible price for their milk.  I would be very sorry indeed if the ICMSA embark on a course of action which will prevent me and them from working together for the development of the dairying industry. There is a great deal of work we can do between us in co-operation.  I hope they will not embark on any course of action which would prevent that full co-operation between us to improve the dairying industry in the variety of ways in which it can be improved.</P>
      <P>I do not think I would like to say very much more about that particular matter at the present time but I hope that commonsense will prevail in the councils of the ICMSA and that the course of action, which it is alleged they are about to embark on, will not be pursued because I think it would only result in harm to the dairying industry as a whole.  By harm, I mean it will prevent us getting on with a number of improvements, which we all know to be necessary, and which can only be brought about if we are working together in harmony and co-operation. I do not think any farmers' organisation today can achieve anything by fighting the Government.  The mistake should have been learned long ago.  It is only by working with the Government that farmers' organisations can bring about improvements.</P>

I do not think we can possibly accept that principle.  It would have to apply generally throughout the whole range of diseases where animals have to be slaughtered.  If we were to have an outbreak of foot and mouth disease, which heaven forbid, would Deputies suggest that we would not alone compensate for the animals slaughtered but also for the consequent loss of profits resulting to farmers as a result of that?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This Supplementary Estimate for £6,900 is required to defray the cost of maintaining the mission to the European Offices of the United Nations in Geneva which was opened in June, 1965, and for which no provision was made in the original estimate.  Because of the increased use of Geneva by the <Col N="650" /> principal organs and specialised agencies of the United Nations and by other international organisations and because of our active interest in acceding to the GATT whose headquarters are at Geneva, we found that we could not defer any longer the opening of an office in that city.  Together with Cyprus and Iceland, we had been the only European member of the UN not represented at Geneva by a permanent delegate.</P>
    <P>Among the units of the United Nations Secretariat located in Geneva are the Economic Commission for Europe and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, of both of which Ireland is a member.  Of the 13 specialised agencies of the United Nations, which have autonomous functions in the economic, social, cultural, educational, health, and related fields, the headquarters of four are located in Geneva.  These are the International Labour Office, the World Health Organisation, the International Telecommunications Union and the World Meteorological Organisation, of all of which Ireland is a member.  In addition, the headquarters of the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs and the International Atomic Energy Agency, which are agencies related to the United Nations, and the European Free Trade Association are also located there.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, some of the principal organs of the United Nations meet as often in Geneva as they do in New York, particularly the Economic and Social Council and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development Board and their committees, commissions, etc.  Over one-third of all meetings under the auspices of the United Nations and related agencies take place in Geneva, while 19 out of 25 major conferences held under United Nations auspices in the years 1958 to 1964 took place there.</P>
    <P>The first Permanent Representative of Ireland in Geneva took up duty there on 22nd June, 1965, and was accredited to the European Office of the United Nations and to the various specialised agencies situated there of which Ireland is a member.  He is required <Col N="651" /> in this capacity to attend and to report on such major meetings as the summer session of ECOSOC, which lasts about one month in July-August, the annual session of the Economic Commission for Europe, which meets for about three weeks in April, and the session of the Trade and Development Board, which is held each year in Geneva.  He is also required to attend, mainly at the request of other Departments, meetings of the specialised committees and commissions.  Prior to the appointment of the Permanent Representative, it was not found possible to service these meetings adequately nor to keep in proper touch with developments in the organisations concerned.</P>
    <P>The Permanent Representative has also been specifically assigned to concern himself with the GATT.  In this context, he is required to deal with all matters connected with the discussions on the terms of Irish accession to the GATT and with our participation in the Kennedy Round of tariff reductions.  In March, 1965, the Contracting Parties adopted procedures for the processing of applications for accession to the GATT under which applicant countries were invited to participate in the Kennedy Round with a view to full accession.  The Government has indicated to the GATT its interest in participating under these procedures in the Kennedy Round with a view to accession, and this country's application will probably be the subject of examination by Contracting Parties later this year.  In addition to representing Ireland in discussions with the GATT on the terms of accession, it will be necessary for the Permanent Representative to maintain close and continuing contacts, not only with members of the GATT Secretariat but with representatives of individual Contracting Parties in the negotiations for tariff reductions in the Kennedy Round.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder would the Minister say if the total of this Supplementary Estimate is required for the European office?  As I understand it, this office was opened in June last and the provision is for the period <Col N="652" /> since June until today, 31st March. The position of our application to adhere to the GATT has been referred to by the Minister, and I would be glad to find out from him what exactly is the position of the application.  As I understand it, some years ago, we indicated that we wished to adhere to GATT.  Then although the application was not withdrawn, action on it was suspended at, I think, the request of the Irish Government.  Then some time last year or at the beginning of this year, an indication was given that it was intended, as it was described, to reactivate the application to adhere to the GATT.</P>
      <P>As I understand it, the Permanent Representative assigned to the United Nations Office in Geneva is concerned with the GATT, but owing to the fact that we are not are present members of it, he is not accredited to the GATT. I would be interested to hear from the Minister what is the precise position at present of the application to adhere to the GATT and if negotiations are in train to have this country's application to adhere to it considered.</P>
      <P>The appointment of a Permanent Representative for Europe of course indicates a further expansion of our services, and in that connection I would be interested to hear whether the particular office will have anything to do other than to represent this country at the United Nations in Geneva or the specialised agencies. Will the particular person have any functions in respect of trade, or is this in fact a political office, with the exception of the fact that certain specialised agencies of the United Nations deal in a general way with trade functions?  Other than that, will this particular office deal in any way with it on behalf of this country?</P>

I sometimes feel that the affairs of the Department of External Affairs are in some way immune from realistic discussion in this House, due to some idea amongst Deputies of all Parties that discussion of foreign affairs, so to speak, is not something &mdash;and I suppose they are correct in this&mdash;that can either catch votes or matter very much at the grass roots of politics in this country, but if they are sincere about feeling that the House has any claim to be a parliament, it should at least make its views known on occasion on our foreign policy.

One of the areas in respect of which my Party are disappointed that this country is not participating more fully is in international affairs, particularly in the emerging African countries.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>At any rate, we welcome this increased participation by the Government in the affairs of the United Nations.  Our advice as a Party is that in this increased participation, we should not be afraid to be realistic in our policy; we should not be too worried about offending some of the more influential great powers of the world.  It is regrettable that some of the European nations, most of whom are in NATO, particularly the Scandinavian countries, seem to have more independent policies than we have and we are supposed to be the original neutral. Far from being neutral, we do not appear to support the better British and American policies but do appear to support the worst British and <Col N="655" /> American policies.  While the Minister is gathering up the money for this office in Geneva, I should like him to take notice that my Party intend to come out pretty honestly on the main Estimate.</P>
      <P>Ireland may be a small power but that is no reason why, having decent domestic policies ourselves at home, we should not look abroad for an extension of those policies.  In this year of all years, with the sort of resurgence of national spirit that has come about in this country, the Minister should welcome a situation in which there was real criticism.  Argument in this House on external affairs is generally restricted to asking how much the Minister spent on a sandwich in Geneva or some other place, rather than seeking to find out the Minister's foreign policy, the Government's foreign policy and how it affects this country abroad.  The lack of such criticism is indeed unfair to the Minister and to the very able officers in his Department. I fail to see the logic in our inability to make some condemnation of the policies of the South African Government during the past few years. It is only because Britain has had a row in Rhodesia that we saw fit in the past few weeks&mdash;&mdash;</P>

We realise it may appear pretentious for a Party of 21 to seek to raise foreign affairs but if this Parliament is to have any adult status in the world, this is an area which must be debated more widely <Col N="656" /> and the Minister and his Department subjected to intelligent examination in the House.</P>
      <P>I give notice to the Minister that the foreign policy pursued by this country during the past few years will be subjected to sharp scrutiny by my Party when the main Estimate comes before the House.  I hope it will not be in the too distant future because many of the subjects we wish to see debated have not been discussed in the House for some time.  We intend to bring them into real discussion in the House and we feel this will be of assistance to the Minister in getting a realistic idea of what our foreign policy should be.  For some time it has been the creature of a very small circle and it is time we widened this circle so that Ireland will have a policy in keeping with the twentieth century.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Supplementary Estimate as an indication that the Government have definitely decided to accede to GATT. I appreciate our difficulties because under the terms of GATT we were tied, to a certain extent, by the most favoured nation clause until such time as we achieved some sort of free trade association.  This Supplementary Estimate is one of the off-shoots of the Free Trade Agreement with the United Kingdom.  The fact that we have appointed, or are about to appoint, a Permanent Representative in Geneva is an indication that we are serious in our application to accede to GATT. I have no doubt our application will be successful.</P>
      <P>This is a late application and I understand that the negotiations that will take place&mdash;they will be largely agricultural&mdash;under the aegis of the United Nations have to commence under the Kennedy Round in or about May.  That seems to be the extreme date, if I may use the term, inside which they have got to be held.  If this Supplementary Estimate does nothing else, it modifies the foreign policy of this Government which has always been rather obscure to me.  This is a global decision and therefore I welcome it the more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is obvious to all of us that if we are to participate in international discussions, <Col N="657" /> all the more so if they are in relation to agriculture, we have got to accede to GATT.  In this respect I should like to ask one or two questions. In his opening statement the Minister points out that we are members of the International Labour Office, the World Health Organisation, the International Telecommunications Union and the World Meteorological Organisation.  The offices of all of these Organisations are in Geneva.  Who represented us hitherto at meetings of these organisations?  Have we had a civil servant to act for us or had we somebody on the spot already?  I understand we have a legation in Switzerland.  Are the members of that legation sufficient to enable us to be represented at discussions of these organisations?  We should have somebody in such an important centre as Geneva.  We are, too, members, through the United Nations Organisation, of the FAO, through our Minister for Agriculture.  I speak subject to correction in that.  It may be that direct representation lies in External Affairs. I know there is a European representative of FAO based on Geneva.</P>
    <P>These are points that need clarification. If we are to deal with international affairs, as quite obviously we must, becoming a member of the Common Market overnight, then we shall have equally to deal with European affairs.  I am rather sceptical about that overnight myself.  I see the Chair looking at me and smiling rather superciliously, but I should like the Minister to convey these comments to the Taoiseach.  It seems to me we should have a representative to deal with all these international organisations.  The cost is small&mdash; £6,500 as against nearly £250 million, which is our annual Budget.  We should have someone there.</P>
    <P>I should also like the Minister to tell us if we are now definitely acceding to GATT.  Quite obviously we are anxious to take part in the Kennedy Round negotiations.  Could the Minister tell the House if these negotiations will start in May?  As they are likely to start before we discuss the main Estimate, could the Minister tell us who will represent us at these <Col N="658" /> negotiations?  I should like to feel we were represented at political level, as are all other countries.  It is only at political level&mdash;many years in the Council of Europe have taught me that&mdash;that one can achieve anything. I should not like to feel we were represented at GATT negotiations, whether in Geneva on a European basis, or in the United Nations on a global basis, by a civil servant.  We should be represented by the Minister.  It is his function to represent us on all matters relating to external policy.  I should be very happy to know that, so long as the Fianna Fáil Government remain in office, the Minister will be our representative at these all-important discussions.  They are more than important to the Irish economy as a whole.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cosgrave asked to what period this Supplementary Estimate refers.  It refers to the financial year ending today.  The Book of Estimates carries a sum for the office in the coming financial year.  Deputy Cosgrave and Deputy Esmonde were interested in the negotiations with GATT.  We did apply to the authorities of GATT indicating that we were interested in finding out on what conditions we could become members as far back as 1960.  The recent Trade Agreement with Britain and other developments have led the Government to seek once more to get close contact with the GATT authorities to find out what conditions would be offered to us, were we to become members.  One of these days a sub-committee of the GATT organisation will go into our case.  We will be represented at that committee by a representative from the Department of External Affairs, the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Industry and Commerce.  When the committee has examined our case, they will report to the general body. We shall then see how the matter stands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In all these international associations and meetings, we try to be represented adequately.  Representatives of the Departments concerned attend, accompanied by an officer of the Department <Col N="659" /> of External Affairs either from home or from Berne.  The meetings have become very numerous and our renewed application for membership of GATT required that we review the situation.  We have done so and we have found it would be more satisfactory now to have a permanent representative in Geneva.  All other European countries, with the exception of two small countries like ourselves, Iceland and Cyprus, have found that, too.</P>
    <P>There is no use in my attempting to prophesy what the future of our activated application to GATT will be.  We will have to await developments. We shall have an opportunity of discussing these matters on the main Estimate for the Department of External Affairs.  I had hoped to introduce that Estimate this week but, owing to the long debate on the Budget, that was not possible.  It will be introduced as quickly as we can get down to it after Easter.</P>

It is regrettable that it should be said that Gaeltarra Éireann is the principal instrument in the development of economic activities of an industrial character in all Gaeltacht areas.  The activities of this company are not widespread enough to provide anything like the employment network in the Gaeltacht areas that would be essential to give an opportunity for the adult people of the Gaeltacht to obtain employment at home. I do not know of any such network in the Dingle Peninsula, or in the whole parish of Dunquin, or in the parish of Ballyferriter.  One could go along the whole western seaboard and see very few opportunities of adult employment being provided anywhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is one of the hypocrisies of our time that we find political people who are enthusiastic about the language treating these areas as a reserve in the summer months in order to improve their accent and treating them as holiday areas and then, when the holidays are over, going away and forgetting about the existence of the people there. <Col N="662" /> What are the Government doing to find employment for the people in these areas?  If the cruel Saxon spent a great number of years trying to get rid of Irish as the people's language, I must say that in the years of native government, we have done very little to make arrangements for fostering the speaking of Irish by adults in the Gaeltacht areas.  Of course, we have Civil Service Irish spoken along the eastern seaboard but nothing has been done to keep the language alive in the Gaeltacht areas.</P>

It is the fig-leaf which covers the inactivity of the Government where these are concerned in general.  I had hoped that the present Parliamentary Secretary would realise that the language is dying out in these areas and that this is one of the facts of life in present-day Ireland. We will not extend the use of the language by having gatherings in Dublin or along the eastern seaboard. The moment of truth for the Gaeltacht has come, if it has not already passed by.  This Government have the alternative of going beyond this point of no return or of doing something for these people, but it will take more than White Papers on the activities of Gaeltarra Éireann to provide the employment necessary to keep these people in the Gaeltacht areas.</P>

    <P>I thoroughly agree with this Supplementary Estimate.  The Parliamentary Secretary said that Gaeltarra Éireann is the principal instrument for the development of economic activities of an industrial character in all the Gaeltacht areas, as promised by the Government in the White Paper on the restoration of the language. All sides of the House want to see the Gaeltacht preserved and the Irish language saved.  We deplore the <Col N="663" /> depopulation that is taking place there. Through the Department, Gaeltarra Éireann is giving valuable employment to young boys and young girls in that area.  It is helping to keep them at home rather than having them emigrate to Britain and elsewhere.  Even if State funds have to be spent on it, I believe it is a good idea to give employment there and to try to keep the West alive.</P>
    <P>There have been many complaints in the past about the running of Gaeltarra Éireann.  Can the Parliamentary Secretary inform us whether the loss by Gaeltarra Éireann has been arrested? Many people claim we should have more supervision and more efficiency there.</P>

I was very surprised to hear from the Parliamentary Secretary that Gaeltarra Éireann is the principal instrument for the developing of economic activities in the Gaeltacht.  It is a sad reflection on the Department that this is all they have done for this area.</P>
      <P>I notice also that it was promised in the White Paper that Gaeltarra Éireann would be encouraged to play a positive role.  I can only assume from that statement, that up to now it has played a negative role in the economic activities for the restoration of the area.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary said that if any Deputy requires any particulars about the activities of Gaeltarra Éireann, he will be pleased to furnish them.  I should certainly like full details of the activities of Gaeltarra Éireann.  I consider it essential that the Department provide a lot more for the Gaeltacht areas than is being provided.  This is just a sham and hypocrisy on their part in relation to what they are providing.  Nothing positive is being provided for the Gaeltacht areas.</P>
      <P>It is time we looked at this matter in a realistic light.  I should prefer to see something more concrete coming from this Department for the Gaeltacht areas.</P>

      <P>The Minister says that since the passing of the Gaeltacht <Col N="664" /> Industries (Amendment) Act, 1965, Gaeltarra Éireann is the principal instrument in the Department of economic activities of an industrial character in all Gaeltacht areas.  We are setting out to do two things here and we should not lose sight of that fact.  It is wrong to emphasise the development of economic activities. There is a social aspect to this, too. We are trying to keep the people in the west of Ireland.  We are trying to keep the west from being depopulated and to keep some sort of economic activity there.  We are also trying to use it as an instrument for preserving and promoting the Irish language.  On that account, I do not think it should be a requirement that these industries should necessarily be economic, certainly at the outset and for some time after they have been developed.</P>
      <P>There is extreme difficulty, in my view, in getting many industrialists to go to the remoter parts of this country because of a large number of considerations. The technical men and the people at management level in the industries, come, in the main, from countries where they were living in industrial areas and they refuse to go to the remoter areas of the west of Ireland.  As well as that, I think the only type of industry that could be established there, at the outset, is one that could give employment to a small number of people.  No industry requiring a large number of people to be present all day and every day could hope to survive in the west because there is no such thing as a large pool of labour available in any area there. It would mean travelling very long distances in order to keep an industry going, and with bad weather and other considerations, it would not be possible for an industry requiring a large labour force to be set up in the west of Ireland.  For that reason, we should at all times try to develop small specialised industries there.  These are the types of industries which I think have not received very much consideration from the Industrial Development Authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since Gaeltarra Éireann have been brought into this, I would hope they would act in a different sort of way <Col N="665" /> and make a different approach to this problem in their efforts to establish industry.  I agree that unless we set up some sort of economic activity whereby the people in these areas will get a reasonable living, we shall arrive at a point where we shall have no native speakers.  There could be no more effective instrument for the preservation of the language&mdash;and we have it in those areas&mdash;than the setting up of some sort of economic activity and employment opportunity for the people there.</P>

Tuigtear go bhfuil níos mó ná fadhbanna eacnamaíocha sa Ghaeltacht: tá fadhb na teanga, fadhb shóisialach agus fadhb eacnamaíoch. Tá sé an-deachair na fadhbanna uile sin a réiteach le chéile.  Dá ndéarfadh duine liom: &ldquo;Is cuma mar gheall ar an fhadhb shóisialach, lean ar aghaidh agus cuir déantúis ar bun sa Ghaeltacht&rdquo;, is é an rud a dhéanfainn, agus sílim an rud a dhéanfadh aon deantúsóir, ná na monarchana go léir a thógáil le chéile agus líon mór daoine a chur ag obair iontu; ach dá ndéanfainn é sin, bheadh deireadh leis an nGaeltacht.</P>
