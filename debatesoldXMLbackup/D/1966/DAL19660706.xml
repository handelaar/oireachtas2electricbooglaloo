      <P>When speaking last night, I was answering in regard to matters which <Col N="1962" /> arose not on the Bill before the House but on the wider aspect of the Free Trade Area, and I sought to allay the anxiety which has been expressed in the House several times in regard to the possibility of dumping.  Legislative proposals have been prepared to meet the possibility of dumping, and I am satisfied that after consulation with industry and having regard to our international commitments, and possible commitments, they are adequate to protect Irish industry, and the various sensitive industries, against dumping.</P>
      <P>The other problems are those of redundancy of workers and, as the House already knows, legislation is being prepared and a committee representative of the people interested has been set up and the legislation will come before the House.  Training and re-training is a matter for other legislation which has already been introduced by the Parliamentary Secretary, and I expect that wide consulation with the people concerned will now take place.</P>
      <P>The points raised on the actual Bill, which dealt with duty-free licences, Rules of Origin and special concessions for Northern Ireland, were mainly on the Rules of Origin.  Deputy Dillon inquired if our Rules of Origin were any more stringent than those applied by the British Government and I should like to say that, by and large, they are not any more or less stringent. We are in certain fields stricter and they in others.  The Rules of Origin have been agreed between the two Governments in the course of the negotiations on the Free Trade Area Agreement and have been drawn up mainly with regard to the state of development of the two economies.</P>
      <P>In relation to the income tax export concession, the goods had to be manufactured here but there was no other qualification except that the Revenue Commissioners had to satisfy themselves that the goods were manufactured here.  In regard to origin rules for which the Minister for Industry and Commerce is responsible, as well as manufacturing, a percentage of the value of the article comes into consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1963" /> Deputy O'Leary feared the concessions which we will give to Northern Ireland firms may be going to firms whose capital is British-based.  This is possible, but the fact remains that the Northern Ireland firms employ Northern Ireland citizens.  The advantages which we would give in these concessions to Northern Ireland firms <i>vis-à-vis</i> British firms would be to the benefit of their employees.  Any order affecting the rate of duty on Northern Ireland goods will be placed before the Dáil.</P>
    <P>There is nothing in this Bill to threaten employment, as was feared by Deputy Larkin, by having further competition which industry here could not face.  The 20 per cent advantage on the first day of the coming into operation of the Agreement has already been the subject of an order and what is sought in this Bill is the authority to make further adjustments as we go along.  Any such concessions as have already been given have been given after consultation with Irish industry and any further concessions will also be the subject of consultation with Irish industry.  Our intention is to give advantage to Northern Ireland over British industry.  This advantage will be ten per cent but our first consideration is our own industry here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>The House is aware that this Bill has already been passed by the Seanad in which it was introduced.  The purpose of the Bill is to enable Ireland to implement the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, 1960.  This Convention was adopted by an international conference of maritime States, including Ireland, convened under the auspices of the Inter-Governmental Maritime Consultative Organisation (more commonly known, from its initials, as IMCO).</P>
      <P>As Deputies will have observed, the Bill is a rather technical one.  Nevertheless, it deals with a subject which is of the greatest importance, not only to ships' crews and officers, but to all of us who have occasion, at one time or another, to travel by sea.  The background history leading to the most recent Convention is as follows:</P>
      <P>Various enactments regulating merchant shipping, including the safety of life at sea, were passed in the second half of the last century.  These culminated in the comprehensive Merchant Shipping Act of 1894, which codified and extended the scope of the law relating to shipping.  This Act enabled the prevention of unseaworthy or undermanned ships from putting to sea, and provided for the survey of ships, the carriage of lifeboats etc., the prevention of collisions by adherence to standard rules of navigation, the holding of enquiries into shipping casualties and the suspension or cancellation of the certificates of ships' officers found to have been negligent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first important International Convention was signed in January, <Col N="1965" /> 1914.  However, the implementation of this Convention was held up, indefinitely as it turned out, by the outbreak of war.</P>
    <P>The 1929 Convention was modelled on that of 1914 but was of considerably wider scope and more detailed in character.  It applied in the main only to passenger ships engaged on international voyages.  Such ships were required to possess a general safety certificate, to be issued annually upon confirmation by survey that the ships complied with construction, fire prevention, life-saving and wireless telegraphy requirements; cargo ships of 1,600 tons gross and over were also required to carry certificates to show that they complied with the wireless telegraphy requirements.  The Convention was implemented in Ireland by the Merchant Shipping (Safety and Load Line Conventions) Act, 1933.</P>
    <P>In 1948 another international conference was convened, which drew up a new Safety Convention.  The principal advance made on this occasion was the extension of certain requirements to cargo ships.  For the first time there was international agreement that cargo ships of 500 tons gross and upwards should be required to carry life-saving appliances.  The range of life-saving equipment to be carried by passenger and cargo vessels was extended, varying with the size of ship.  Lifeboats were required to have fixed or portable radio equipment, and ships were required to have mechanical davits for launching the lifeboats.  With regard to radio, all passenger ships, and cargo ships of 1,600 tons and upwards, were required to maintain a continuous watch on the distress radio frequency either by qualified radio officers or by automatic equipment.  The requirement to carry radio was extended down from cargo ships of 1,600 tons to cargo ships of 500 tons.  Whereas formerly only passenger ships of 5,000 tons were obliged to have a direction-finder, all ships, passenger and cargo, of 1,600 tons and over were henceforth required to have this equipment.  Most of the Convention's provisions were applicable not only to ships of the ratifying country but to foreign ships while within that country's ports.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1966" /> The 1948 Convention was given effect in Ireland by the Merchant Shipping (Safety Convention) Act, 1952, and by a series of statutory rules made under the Act in 1953.</P>
    <P>In 1960 a further international conference was held under the auspices of the Inter-Governmental Maritime Consultative Organisation to revise the 1948 Convention.  IMCO, which is a specialised agency of the United Nations, came into being subsequent to 1948.  The Convention adopted by the conference in general covered the same ground as the 1948 Convention but once again was more detailed than its predecessor, and prescribed higher standards.  A notable advance was that for the first time in the history of the shipping industry it has been agreed at an international level that the hull, equipment and machinery of cargo ships of 500 tons gross and over engaged in international trade should be surveyed periodically to ensure that the various components are adequate for the service for which the ships are intended.  Other advances, though not spectacular, are the requirements regarding the carriage of radio apparatus on cargo ships of between 300 and 500 tons gross, the carriage of inflatable life-rafts, and more stringent requirements regarding the sub-division of some types of passenger ship, stability, watertight integrity, safety of electrical installations, and fire control.</P>
    <P>The 1960 Convention came into force internationally in May, 1965, when it had been accepted by the required number of 15 countries, including 7 countries each with at least a million tons gross of shipping.  Up to the present date the Convention has been accepted by 46 countries of the 55 in all which were represented at the 1960 Conference.  Acceptor countries include Britain, France, the Netherlands, West Germany and the United States.</P>
    <P>The present Bill has been drawn up with the object of enabling Ireland to implement the Convention.  The main provisions of the Bill convey the necessary powers for the making of rules prescribing requirements regarding the construction and periodical survey of <Col N="1967" /> the hull, equipment and machinery of specified Irish registered cargo ships; the issue of the appropriate certificates to such ships which comply with the rules; and the application of the rules to foreign ships which are in a port in the State unless they hold appropriate certificates from their own Governments.  It gives power to appoint bodies such as Lloyd's Register and Bureau Veritas who would be authorised to survey the ships concerned, in accordance with the rules, and to issue the appropriate certificates in the same way as if the vessels had been surveyed by my Department's nautical survey staff.  It requires the owner or master of a ship for which a certificate has been issued to notify the issuing authority of any alteration to the hull, equipment or machinery of the ship, and it prohibits Irish ships from proceeding to sea unless they hold the appropriate certificates.  Power is also taken to fix, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, fees for the survey of cargo ships for construction certificates.  Provision is made for the retention of the fees by any outside body, such as those I mentioned a moment ago, who may be authorised to carry out the survey.</P>
    <P>The Bill, as Deputies will note, is primarily an enabling measure.  The actual process of giving statutory effect to the detailed technical requirements of the Convention is due to take place later, through technical Rules to be made by me in virtue of powers contained in the Act of 1952 and in this Bill.  These Rules will take the form of statutory instruments, and I hope that they will be made within the course of the next few months. The Rules will be laid before the Dáil and Seanad in the customary manner.</P>
    <P>I confidently recommend the Bill for the approval of the Dáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister said in the concluding paragraph of his speech, this is an enabling Bill.  As one listened to the Minister's speech and as one would have regard to the history of legislation and regulations with regard to merchant shipping, the first thing that strikes one is the comprehensive <Col N="1968" /> and enduring nature of the provisions of the Merchant Shipping Act of 1894 and that it was not really until great changes took place and great advances were made that we had shipping and the safety of shipping generally made the subject matter of the Conventions referred to in the course of the Minister's speech and upon which the text of this Bill is largely based.  It is, being an enabling Bill, on the one hand, and connected with safety at sea, the safety of lives, the safety of cargo and the seaworthiness generally of the crafts concerned on the other, as such, not a controversial measure.  It is one which should be welcomed by everybody in the House as a measure simply keeping in line with the advances made in shipping generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased to see particularly the references made to the necessity for survey and the arrangements being made so for regular and adequate survey.  Indeed, that survey is very necessary for the purpose of keeping ships in order, keeping them seaworthy and, of course, from that flows immediately the necessity for it, by reason of the fact that seaworthiness is one of the first things necessary for the preservation of life and the preservation of cargo.  The importance of the preservation of life at sea in merchant shipping generally is something which has been brought home to many of us in recent weeks.  The British seamen's strike over the course of some weeks past has, I think, brought home to people, who never really thought about these things and who took them for granted, the great services rendered by the merchant navies on the commercial side of all countries, and particularly the country next to our own, Great Britain.  In these circumstances, therefore, there is nothing in this Bill to which anybody could take exception. As the Minister has said, it is an enabling Bill, one which will be followed up by the making of regulations. I assume&mdash;and I am sure I am assuming correctly&mdash;that these regulations will follow accurately and will be in full accord with the provisions of this Bill, and further, that the regulations themselves will carry into effect the <Col N="1969" /> terms of the appropriate Conventions. Accordingly, we welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>This country has quite a record for the acceptance of Conventions in the various international world bodies but, unfortunately, we do not appear, in many of the cases in which we accept Conventions, to implement them.  Fortunately, here is one Convention at least which is not alone accepted by this country but which steps are being taken in this Bill to implement.</P>
      <P>There is not a lot to be said on the Bill because the Minister has covered anything which needs to be said.  But what I think all of us would be concerned with would be the periodical surveys of the type of ship referred to here.  I assume&mdash;maybe the Minister will be able to tell us&mdash;that the regulations will set out that these surveys should be undertaken.  It is absolutely necessary that these surveys be made because there have been recent examples on the sea where equipment, which people believed was in working condition, in fact was not.  There was a scandal&mdash;I shall not mention in what line, but it was about two or three years ago&mdash; when it was discovered that the lifeboats could not be put into the sea. In that particular case, again, it was discovered that the radio equipment was not alone faulty but just did not work at all.  If we are to treat not alone passengers but those who work on ships properly, the provisions contained in the Convention and being implemented in this Bill are absolutely necessary.</P>
      <P>I have nothing further to say on the Bill, except to ask the Minister to give us an idea as to when these surveys will be made, so as to ensure that equipment required to be provided under this Convention will be in working order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Corish, the surveys for construction are made every two years and, for life-saving equipment and radio, the inspection is yearly.  I can assure the Deputy that the surveyors of my Department are extremely strict, as will <Col N="1970" /> be found out by asking any one of the Irish shipping companies details about the nature of the survey.  I can assure the Deputy that the surveys will be carried out adequately.</P>
      <P>I thank the House for their reception of the Bill.  It is true that we have adhered to these Conventions and passed Acts to put them into operation, so far as our own shipping services are concerned, at regular intervals throughout the entire history of the State.  I can assure the House that all these regulations will be made to apply to Irish vessels according to the terms of the Convention, and that where we can extend the Convention to ships of smaller size, which we are not obliged to do under the Convention, we will do so.  In this connection, of course, we shall be consulting with the interests concerned.  I should also state that in regard, for example, to very small fishing vessels, that is, those constructed under the aegis of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara, they have already good standards of lifesaving which are determined by An Bord Iascaigh Mhara, apart from any Convention obliging them to do so, or otherwise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Exemptions are occasionally given for a particular voyage.  For example, a vessel that would not normally go to sea except around the coast might be proceeding on one international voyage where it would not be necessary to apply the strict rules.  It would be an exceptional affair and would be granted only for very special reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>This Convention is very complex.  There are some regulations for safety which apply to ships of certain sizes, and some which are not mandatory for ships below a certain size.  It would be very hard to give a particular example, but a ship might be allowed to take one voyage, although the construction of the ship in regard to electrical appliances might not be perfect, simply because it was an exceptional journey.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say whether or not these exemptions might give rise to an absence of life-saving appliances?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  We should make it clear that this exemption business is like so many other things in connection with international regulations, in that when you have a group of nations meeting together to decide rules for <Col N="1972" /> safety at sea, you have to bring in as many adherents as possible, and this clause was put in purely in respect of entirely exceptional circumstances. I can assure the House it does not really apply to countries with high standards in regard to safety of life at sea.  It is simply put in as a saving clause because there are bound to be occasions when it would be necessary to give an exemption certificate to cover peculiar circumstances.</P>

      <P>I should like an assurance from the Minister, and I am sure he is in a position to give it, that the boats in which we are interested, that is, passenger boats plying between this country and Great Britain, have all the equipment necessary and that it is in perfect order, should there be an accident.  I know there are regulations under the Minister's Department or <Col N="1973" /> some Convention which ensure there will be no overcrowding on these boats.  Nobody wants to anticipate any trouble, but it would be a good thing if the Minister could reassure the House and the country that not alone are these boats perfect in regard to seaworthiness but that they have proper lifesaving equipment, as described in the Minister's speech, and, above all, that the crew are competent to carry out any operations necessary in the event of an accident.  It appears to me these journeys are regarded more as short ferry trips, but can the Minister tell us whether or not each passenger is made fully aware of what he or she must do in the event of an accident at sea?  The Minister will understand my concern and the concern of other people in that respect. Perhaps he could make a statement on it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Both we and our neighbours, the British have very high standards of inspection and survey of ships.  When visiting vessels of Irish Shipping Ltd., I made inquiry about this and learned that our surveyors are extremely strict in regard to the examination of lifesaving equipment, inflatable lifeboats, fire fighting equipment. We have a very high standard. So have our neighbours, the British, as the Deputy will know from recalling the occasions of loss of life at sea on British ships.  Both countries have a very high standard.  The ships are fully surveyed and examined yearly. Everything possible is done to ensure that lifeboats are easily floated, that the davits are working, that the fire-fighting apparatus on the boat is working, that the rubber pipes are operating and not leaking.  The inspection test is a very severe one.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very important section because it will cover most of our coastwise trade.  It is absolutely necessary that a ship should have a signalling lamp.  It is a requirement that is honoured more in the breach than the observance.  Could the Minister tell us what steps are taken to ensure that each ship carries the requisite signalling lamp?  We are inclined to be complacent.  It is only a disaster such as befell the <i>Princess Victoria</i> which brings to mind the necessity to have the regulations carried out.  Here was ship that was never out of sight of land but yet many lives were lost, not because of the absence of a signalling lamp but because of some other difficulty.  We should not become complacent.  A signalling lamp may be only a small thing but it might mean the difference between safety and disaster.  The Minister should tell us what inspection is carried out.  Every ship must be inspected every year by Lloyds before she gets a certificate but 12 months elapse before the next inspection and a signalling lamp could be out of order for the 12 months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there can be any inspections in between those provided for in the Convention. There has to be some trust placed in the officers of the ship, particularly in regard to Irish ships, which are very responsible in this matter.  Inspection is made at prescribed intervals to ensure that there is a signalling lamp on board but it would not be possible to have constant inspections undertaken to ensure that on every single voyage the lamp is working.  It would not be practicable to do it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is all that can be done in the circumstances. <Col N="1976" /> When there is an annual or biennial survey of the ship one can get a very good idea of the attitude towards these regulations.  If everything is found to be in good order, it is a reasonable assumption that all the regulations have been carried out and are likely to be carried out in between inspections. In other words, as in the case of all other laws, it is partly the tradition of behaviour at sea that counts.  You have the international regulations and you have the disciplinary attitude of the companies who own the ships, and that enters into it almost as much as the regulations.  As I said, we and the British and some other European countries and countries elsewhere have had a very fine tradition in regard to the observance of regulations and a great many shipping companies have standards they would wish to maintain, irrespective of any international Convention. We rely on the maintenance of standards by tradition to a very great extent as well as on the enforcement of international regulations.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 13:</P>
      <P>Before section 4 to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;() (1) Where&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  a lessee executes a mortgage by subdemise of the whole or part of the land comprised in his lease, retaining a nominal reversion therein, and</P>
      <P>(b)  the land comprised in the subdemise is sold for the enforcement of the mortgage,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>the purchaser shall, for the purposes of this Act, be deemed to have acquired the interest of the lessee in <Col N="1977" /> the demised land for the entire of the unexpired term of the lease, including the period of the nominal reversion, but it shall be open to the owner of the nominal reversion to claim for the value of such nominal reversion (if any) and the value there of shall in the event of dispute, be determined as part of the purchase price of the fee simple in accordance with section 17 of this Act.</P>
    <P>(2)  This section shall apply to mortgages and sales whether effected before or after the passing of this Act.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment is for the purpose of enabling mortgages to have the same rights as the lessees would have. The Minister will be aware that there is a similar provision in the Landlord and Tenant (Reversionary Leases) Act, 1958 and it would seem to me that in these cases where a mortgage has been made of the property, if it is necessary to give possession on foot of the mortgage, the same rights should apply as if he were still in occupation.  I imagine that is the intention but it does not seem to be covered by the Bill.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 14:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1) (b), page 5, line 52, after &ldquo;Act&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;(except he holds such land indemnified against the entire of the rent reserved by the building lease)&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 5 deals with the procedure in <Col N="1978" /> connection with the acquisition of fee simple and provides in subsection (1) (a) that a person holding land under a building lease shall not be entitled to acquire the fee simple in the whole of the land, unless he obtains the consent to the acquisition of all persons holding the land or any of it under a proprietary lease.  It goes on in subparagraph (b) of subsection (1) to provide that a person holding land under a building lease shall not be entitled to acquire the fee simple in part of the land &ldquo;unless ...&rdquo; Then it sets out the various exceptions.</P>
    <P>The point brought out in my amendment is that the section, as it stands, does not go far enough as it does not in fact provide for the terms upon which a person who holds part of the land or part of the premises comprised in a building lease but indemnified against the entire of the rent reserved by the lease can acquire fee simple interest.  I think the general principle of the Bill is that in such a case, whether it is a question of a ground rent or a case where a rent has been imposed but the premises are indemnified against it, the same principle should apply in the case of the rent already having been redeemed by the owner on a fee simple redemption transaction without effect previously to the covenants. I think the principle of the Bill is to cover all those types of cases.  I suggest that this matter might be dealt with by inserting in subsection (b) of section 1 after the word &ldquo;Act&rdquo; the words &ldquo;(except he holds such land indemnified against the entire of the rent reserved by the building lease)&rdquo; and that the owner of the lessee's interest should then be in a position to purchase out his fee simple.</P>

I agree that notice may be necessary.  The Minister will realise that the practical effect of the operation of this provision in a case where the rent has already been redeemed or where property is indemnified against rent, will be in connection with the covenants under the lease.  Except in particular cases which are already covered by the Bill where it is a question of protecting the landlord's own property, by and large, if nobody has a financial interest in the premises or land he has no particular interest in enforcing the covenants except covenants that are there for the protection of the landlord's own premises or his amenities, or his enjoyment of them.  It is worth having another look at that kind of case.  I fully agree that where there is a question of title notice would be essential. It is only the question of consent that I am raising.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 15:</P>
      <P>In page 6, line 30, to add the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In the event of a person on whom such notice is served being unable or unwilling to clear an incumbrance it shall be open to the person serving the notice to request the county registrar to refer the matter to the court to determine the manner in which the incumbrance should be cleared and the purchase money disposed of.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is the kind of section which imposes the obligation on the owner, where the fee simple has been acquired, to effect a conveyance of the property free from incumbrances to the purchasing tenant.  It occurs to me in connection with this section that there might be practical difficulties.  As it stands, the section does not give the lessee any power to compel the lessor to clear his title if there are any incumbrances affecting it.  Suppose there is a claim for death duties or a mortgage or an annuity or something of that description.  It will be a difficult problem so far as the actual drafting of the Bill is concerned and I think it would also be a difficult problem in the practical working of the Bill when it becomes an Act.  There should be some procedure whereby the lessee might be entitled, for example, to lodge his purchase money in court and on such lodgment, he might be able to get a declaration from the court which would enable the lessor to give a conveyance or transfer discharged from any mortgage or incumbrance that affects it.</P>
      <P>My amendment suggests a kind of halfway house to meet practical difficulties of this nature that are nearly bound to crop up if any widespread use is made of the machinery being provided in this Bill.  I am suggesting that we add these words to section 6.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make it clear that I am urging acceptance of this or some other amendment.  I made it clear on the early stages that it is not easy for Opposition Deputies, on a technical <Col N="1981" /> Bill like this, to draft precise amendments that would be acceptable and, so far as any of the amendments I am proposing are concerned, I am not wedded to the particular wording I have used and, if alternatives are more suitable, I am perfectly happy to withdraw the amendments.  I am urging this amendment, particularly from a practical point of view.  I think that any practising lawyer will appreciate the importance of having some kind of enabling machinery, such as I suggest, in this Bill.  If there is any such power in the Bill at the moment, as far as I can see it is only an implicit power.  There is nothing specific there which will enable the applicant, in cases of this kind, to carry through his application fully in the face of an unwilling lessor who is unwilling to do more than is required by the strict letter of the law.</P>
    <P>If you come across a case&mdash;it is very likely that it will happen in a number of these cases&mdash;where there is some incumbrance affecting the lessor's title, where there is some question such as a death on the title, where a grant of administration or probate has not been taken out and where there might be some kind of an admittedly shadowy claim for death duties there, where there might be a mortgage still appearing on the title even though it possibly has been cleared off, but no satisfaction registered, in all these kinds of cases, so that the purchasing tenant may get a clear title, any incumbrance of this sort should be cleared off.</P>
    <P>Then you will have cases of what I might call specific incumbrances, whether by way of mortgages, annuities, or something of that sort, which are still there.  These have to be cleared off in some manner if this Bill is to operate.  It may very well be that, on the question of assessing the purchase price, the county registrar will have regard to these matters.  He may feel&mdash;I do not think he has sufficient authority under the Bill as it stands&mdash; that he is in a position to deal with them on the basis of apportionment of so much purchase price to the lessor and so much to the owner of the incumbrance. I think there will be cases where a direction from the court will <Col N="1982" /> be necessary.  There may be cases where a transaction can speedily be dealt with by an order of the court ordering that the money, for example, should be lodged in court and that, on lodgment in court, the conveyance of the fee simple to the purchasing tenant should be proceeded with, without delay, and that then the question of the disposition of the purchase price as between the lessor on the one hand and the owner of the incumbrance on the other should be dealt with later.  I want to ensure that the purchasing tenant will not be tied up and hung up indefinitely while these kinds of questions are being sorted out as between chargeants of one sort or another and the owner of the fee simple interest.</P>

      <P>I can see what the Deputy is getting at in this respect. Section 6 puts the onus quite clearly on the lessor to give title free of incumbrances. The Deputy's fears with regard to effecting an expeditious title transfer to the purchaser do not, in my opinion, have much foundation.  I think that what the Deputy has in mind in regard to the rights of an incumbrancer are met in section 17 which gives a very global authority to the county registrar in regard to any dispute, question or difficulty arising out of such a purchase in regard to compliance by a person with a provision under the Act or any other matter arising under the Act.  Any person concerned may apply to the county registrar for the area in which the land to which the application relates is situate to have the matter determined by his arbitration.</P>

      <P>This might seem farfetched but take a case where there is a bank charge of, say £2,000 or £3,000 on the entire of the land and a particular tenant, who is owner <Col N="1984" /> of a house on that land, wants to buy out the interest.  The charge affects the entire property.  There might be half a dozen houses on it.  Until that charge is cleared, the owner cannot give a conveyance free from incumbrances to the tenant.  The owner may be getting a purchase price of only £100 or £140 from the tenant; that will not clear a charge of £3,000.  There should be machinery whereby that money can be lodged in court and, on lodgment, the court would then decide whether that is to go in reduction of the charge or whether the bank, which is the owner of the charge.  will be compelled to join with the owner in the conveyance.  I cannot see that the amendment weakens the position.  It might not and probably does not solve all the difficulties that will arise but it would be of assistance.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 16:</P>
      <P>In page 7, line 52, after &ldquo;expenses&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;(not to exceed seven per cent of the purchase money)&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1985" /> This amendment is for the purpose of trying to get some agreed limit on the costs and expenses which a purchasing tenant would have to pay.  Section 9 provides that a person.</P>
    <P>who proposes to acquire the fee simple in land by virtue of this Act shall be liable for the payment of the reasonable costs and expenses actually and necessarily incurred in complying with the provisions of this Act</P>
    <P>by a person who is minded to sell. It seems to me that that section could in some cases operate in such a way as to impose fairly considerable costs and expenses on a lessee who is exercising his rights to buy out the fee simple.</P>
    <P>It is true to say that the section seems to imply that a fee simple owner whose title is not in order can put that title in order at the expense of the purchasing tenant.  I suppose the words &ldquo;reasonable costs&rdquo; would mean, if the costs were not agreed, taxed costs.  I have no particular objection to that, but the section goes on to refer to the expenses, and the expenses could be very considerable. They could include such things as surveyor's fees, architect's fees, mapper's fees and so on, if the question of boundaries or matters of that kind should arise on the owner's title.</P>
    <P>Admittedly, this is a matter of taking a shot in the dark because at the moment we do not know what the general pattern is going to be in connection with these matters and it is only by trial and error that that will be achieved, but I am suggesting the Minister should consider putting into the section some kind of top limit.  The limit I am suggesting is that the costs and expenses should not exceed seven per cent of the purchase money.  In the normal case, people will probably feel that even seven per cent of the purchase money allocated towards costs and expenses would be too high. I am not suggesting that that should be a fixed figure but that it should be the maximum figure beyond which the lessor is not entitled to seek recoupment <Col N="1986" /> from the purchasing tenant if he has to incur expenses to put his title in order.  After all, it is his business to have his title in order.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Deputy O'Higgins in this matter. Any of us who has any association with local authorities and who has had experience of the taking over of plots for building bungalows and so on is aware of the position.  In this case do &ldquo;reasonable costs&rdquo; cover the position where the gentleman has not taken out administration to clear the title? We have seen cases where some years ago a farmer got £10 an acre and the cost of transferring that acre was anywhere between £30 and £50.  It seems to me that there must be a limit but I do not agree with Deputy O'Higgins that it should be seven per cent.</P>
      <P>Consider the case of the man who succeeded in increasing the ground rent from £100 to £1,800.  If the Minister has his way in regard to the 15 years purchase, I cannot imagine this man getting seven per cent on 15 times £1,800.  As the matter stands, it is something that will have to be straightened out.  In my opinion, the clearance of title and so on should all be done at the expense of the landlord. He is responsible for whatever mess may be there.  We all know how the representatives of Mary O'Grady, who may have been dead for 100 years are still collecting.  As a matter of fact, some 23 years ago, when one solicitor was collecting rents and I instructed the lads to stop paying the head rents the solicitor could not produce anyone to whom he was paying the rents.  He had been collecting them up to that on chance.  You meet those cases.</P>
      <P>I suggest that the Minister should compel the lessor to clear the title. Even then I cannot see any gentleman collecting any great percentage.  I think the amount we have stated here would be wrong because, as I said, if the Minister fixes the 15 years purchase, then in the case of the £1,800, what is the percentage going to be which that tenant would have to pay on purchase? These are the things that occur to me and I would like the Minister to clear them up.</P>

      <P>It appears that the purchasing tenant has a lot of unilateral action on his own.  I should like to know if it is proposed, by way of regulation or otherwise, to specify particular fees for legal costs in regard to any action necessary under this section. Is it contemplated leaving the already well-exploited tenant to the tender mercies of the law in this sphere?  We maintain also&mdash;Deputy Corry raised this point&mdash;that the person with the superior ownership in the land should bear the greater part of the cost.</P>

      <P>I find the amendment very tempting indeed and, as Minister for Justice, I am often in the dock as being opposed to solicitors' interests and costs generally.  At the same time, I think Deputy O'Higgins's amendment, although I am sympathetic to the principle involved, is not practicable.  As he is well aware, matters of title vary considerably.  A very small property could require very detailed and difficult investigation from the point of view of title and it would, therefore, be unwise to put any arbitrary figure of six, seven or eight per cent into a Bill of this kind.</P>
      <P>All the thinking behind the Bill has been directed towards reducing expenses to a minimum.  That is a matter for which I have been criticised by certain people in the legal profession. If you take section 9 with sections 17 and 19, which make provision for the hearing before the county registrar and provide for the costs of arbitration, you will see that, under section 9, costs are limited to reasonable costs and expenses actually and necessarily incurred; under section 17 and 19 the registrar has power to award costs against any party who has been unreasonable. We could hardly go further in matters in which substantial questions of title are involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are providing for expeditious hearing before the county registrar, thereby dispensing with the whole panoply of court procedure and giving the registrar global powers to award costs and expenses.  This is an innovation. Hitherto these matters were heard in open court, with solicitor and counsel; we have dispensed with all <Col N="1988" /> that.  The purpose of sections 9, 17 and 19 is to provide for simple hearings at which the lessee can purchase the fee simple.  While I am sympathetic to what Deputy O'Higgins has in mind, there are, I think, very real practical difficulties in putting in an arbitrary percentage figure having regard to the variations that occur.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate what the Minister has said.  It is undoubtedly true that very often the smaller the purchase money, the smaller the consideration, the more difficult the actual conveyancing is likely to be.  Very often the reason for that is the kind of case Deputy Corry mentioned.  In small cases in which there does not seem to be anything of great value involved, people very often just do not bother getting the title in order.  I appreciate what the Minister has said with regard to the form of my amendment and, although I moved it, I am not entirely sure that it would meet the objections likely to arise under this section.</P>
      <P>Here it is a question of balancing the equities.  You have the landlord on the one hand, who probably has no desire to sell his rent, and I can appreciate the argument which asks why, in that case, should the Legislature not only force him to sell out his ground rent, or the fee simple, to the purchasing tenant but should also require him to bear some portion of the cost of doing that; on the other hand, you have the case of the tenant who, in most cases, will certainly be very much less well off than the owner but who has a desire, which is being recognised in this Bill, to own his own home and to own it fully.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Purchasers in title have probably paid the landlord down the years very considerable sums by way of ground rent and if a situation arises in which the legal costs and actual expenses, other than the legal costs incurred by him in acquiring the fee simple, will be out of all proportion to the benefit he is acquiring then from the practical point of view, he will not be in a position to acquire his house.  I am not sure whether the solution might <Col N="1989" /> not be in some kind of declaratory title in such cases which would enable the purchaser to get a title over which the Land Registry, or someone else, would stand without, at the same time, going into all the legal formalities of acquiring the title.  Possibly the Minister could look at it from that point of view.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing like a little bit of old-fashioned socialism in matters like this.  Our attitude is that it is time the ground landlords holding superior rights over city and urban land should be salted, and well salted, and we do not see why a purchasing tenant should bear a great part of the legal expenses involved in winning for himself rights to the land on which his house is built.  We find it very simple to balance our equities. They come down heavily on the side of the purchasing tenant.</P>
      <P>On section 17, the section may appear to say that the county registrar can arbitrate and worry out costs but you cannot leave out of account the fact that a great deal of extra business will be sent into the legal sphere when this Act comes into operation and it seems to me the county registrar will not be fulfilling the kind of job we would hope he would, namely, to arbitrate on costs, if he does not in fact interfere in the actual legal fees customarily charged in this particular type of business.  We are here tempting a purchasing tenant to acquire the fee simple of the land on which his house is built.  This particular type of man does not normally take part in this kind of legal investigation into title and so forth and he must, therefore, be protected in his attempts to gain the fee simple of his house.  The ground landlords have had a field day over the past and we certainly do not make any apologies to anyone in coming down in our equities on the side of the purchasing tenant.</P>

      <P>It seems to me you are putting the registrar into the position of being a Solomon.  He will have to decide so many things that I feel he will end up by not deciding anything at all.  We have seen many developments held up in Dublin and elsewhere and many ordinary people have been exploited&mdash;it is no harm to mention the word&mdash;by ground landlords on very flimsy title indeed.  If by legislation we come to the aid of purchasing tenants who have been carrying the burden over the years and give them this minimum help to acquire their ground rents, we must also give them financial help.  Our equities should come down squarely in favour of the purchasing tenants.  Unless the Minister can reassure me, it appears to me the purchasing tenant is in for another <i>via dolorosa</i> in attempting to get his rights under the Bill.  The ground landlord can still hide behind his title and make it extremely difficult for the tenant to get the fee simple.  Without actual regulations from the Minister and with so many duties to be performed by the registrar it appears to me that so far as the purchasing tenant is concerned this Bill will become a dead letter because it will be beyond the financial horizons of most purchasing tenants to get their rights.</P>

      <P>To recall Deputy O'Leary's phrase about old-fashioned socialism, this particular measure is going further than what was recommended by the Socialist Government in Britain.  What that particular Government are prepared to undertake in regard to leasehold reform falls short of the radical nature of this measure. My main concern with this measure&mdash; and the reason for the delay in its introduction&mdash;was to ensure that it <Col N="1991" /> was in accordance with the Constitution, which lays down basic private property rights.  I do not want to pilot a Bill through the House and find it torpedoed in the Supreme Court within a few months.  We went as far as we could in this measure to provide rights for the tenant to purchase both in respect of business and residential premises.  We have gone further than what was recommended by the Commission established under a previous Minister, but we had to stop short&mdash; and rightly so&mdash;of confiscation.</P>
      <P>We are providing a system whereby the landlord is to be compensated so that he or she can re-invest the compensation moneys in the current national loan; that is what we can and should do to compensate them.  It is only reasonable that the landlord against whom the application is being made should not be burdened by having his or her purchase money diminished further by paying costs in respect of clearing title.  This would lead us into the confiscation field.  It is an elementary principle of law under any code that the moving party, the benefiting party, pays the costs.  There is nothing unreasonable about that.</P>
      <P>I would envisage that what the Deputies are concerned about here is largely an academic matter.  In 95 per cent of the cases, this is going to be a simple form of transaction.  The tenant writes to the landlord and tells him he wants to purchase his freehold interest at the rate set out here. The landlord has no say in the matter. If he disputes the tenant's right, he is being unreasonable under sections 17 to 19 and he will have costs awarded against him by the registrar.  He will see that the game is up once the tenant writes and he will reply &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.  It is normally going to be a matter of exchanging letters and a simple transfer.</P>

      <P>That will be so in 95 per cent of the cases.  Let us be practical about it.  The case of the difficult title is something you cannot <Col N="1992" /> get over.  You cannot have the landlord burdened by the clearance of the difficult title to the extent of diminishing his right to compensation; otherwise you bring in the principle of confiscation. I think the elementary system we have adopted here, the simple system embodied in section 9 and sections 17 to 19, providing for arbitration by the county registrar&mdash;this is an innovation in the way of expeditious arbitration in matters of this kind&mdash;is as far as we can go.  We have come very far in bringing in this innovation.  I fail to see how we can go further, although I have every sympathy with the spirit of the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>This arises from the amendment, although it is not in the amendment itself.  Would the Minister explore further the suggestion that these difficult cases might be dealt with in some way by a declaratory title either from the court or the registrar?  Notwithstanding what Deputy O'Leary has urged, I agree you cannot deal with this on a confiscation basis.  I also agree that a great number of cases will be simple, where there is no question of difficulty about the title and nothing to be cleared.  I do not think those cases will create any problem.  But there is going to be a residue of difficult cases where there will be expense on someone to clear the title, if the title has to be cleared in accordance with section 6.</P>
      <P>The Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary will both know from practical experience that you have, for example, the system of equities in the Land Registry.  Where there is a note as to equities, what the Land Registry are saying in effect is: &ldquo;We have investigated the title fully.  It appears to us on the face of it that this title is all right, but as a safeguard, it is registered subject to a note as to equities.&rdquo;  Generally, in many rural areas, equities are never discharged. They go from one owner to another. Eventually a position is arrived at where it is quite a simple operation to discharge the equities.  The person or his predecessor is there so long that the equities have lost any meaning attached to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1993" /> What I have in mind is that, either through a declaration from the county registrar or the court, you could get some similar type of operation without having any kind of equity.  In other words, get a simple declaration that by agreement between the landlord and the purchasing tenant, the purchasing tenant has paid so much under this Act and that by virtue of the operation of the Act, the purchasing tenant is now deemed to be the owner in fee simple of his particular plot, free from incumbrances.</P>

    <P>There is just one point with which I should like the Minister to deal a little more fully.  If an apportionment takes place, it does not matter which tenant is the instigator of the move and, in fact, all the tenants will benefit by reason of the apportionment.  It seems to be a bit hard that the tenant who initiates the move should have to pay the additional costs and that it would be fair to provide, at least in a case where there is agreement between the tenants that there should be an apportionment, that the additional costs should be divided among the paying tenants.  The amount would be so small as to be of no consequence at all.  In any event, on the face of it, it seems to me that it would be more equitable for all the parties receiving the benefit to divide the additional costs between them.  I do not know whether the Minister feels there is anything in this point which occurs to me in relation to this subsection.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 18:</P>
      <P>Before section 17 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where any ground rent is over £25 per annum the leaseholder shall, if he considers that this rent is exorbitant, have the right to have the question determined by arbitration and the purchase price shall be based on the arbitration decision.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In moving this amendment, I have in mind the position in regard to the town of Cobh in particular.  I do not think any purchase arranged after the manner in which these rents were arrived at would be just.  One rent was increased from £17 a year to £177 a year, covering a block of tenants. In another case a rent of £12 10s was fixed on a site.  The man expended £12,000 in buildings on that site and then when the lease fell in, it was fixed at £1,800, from £12 10s.  Those cases are very common in the town of Cobh.  The arbitrator whom we got after the fight in 1933 and 1934 reduced those rents by an average of 33? per cent, which shows what the arbitrator thought of the manner in which rents were fixed.  Afterwards, <Col N="1996" /> when the leases fell in, these gentlemen took advantage of the kind of mixum-gatherum law we have in this country in regard to ground rents and leases, to go back and fix the old rents.</P>
    <P>Now when we are clearing the decks, there should be an arbitration or an appeal at which fair rents would be fixed just as they were fixed on land. After 15 years on land, you were entitled to go into a judicial court and get a fair rent fixed.  In this case the selfsame programme should be adopted and before a man purchases, he should have an opportunity of going into a fair rent court, before an arbitrator, and having a fair rent fixed, and not let those scoundrels get away with what should amount to common wholesale robbery.  It is essential that these people should have a clearance court in which they could have a fair rent fixed and proceed on the basis of that fixed rent.</P>

What we are setting out to do in this Bill is to remove many of the anomalies and injustices in previous legislation.  We do not want here that justice should appear to be done but we want it done, and if we want justice to be done, the Minister must realise that some of these existing rents are so brutally high that a determination to have them cut down is of urgent necessity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 20:</P>
      <P>Before section 17 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Amounts paid in ground rent in respect of houses built since 1st January, 1946, shall be taken into <Col N="1998" /> account in the assessment of freehold purchase prices.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I was impelled to put down this amendment because I felt this Bill would not be in the House at all were it not for the tremendous building development which occurred in the country, particularly around the perimeter of Dublin, since the last war. While there is always in existence a group or organisation agitating for the abolition of ground rents as such in urban and municipal areas, they never seemed to get very far until recent years.</P>
    <P>This has been due to the fact that following the war and the tremendous housing drive organised by the inter-Party Government under the leadership of the late Deputy Tim Murphy, we had unprecedented development in house building, around Dublin particularly, under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts.  Only then did the question of ground rents become a burning political issue, one which forced itself on the attention of the major political Parties.  It was always, of course, the concern of the Labour Party.  It forced itself as an electoral issue on the major political Parties because there were so many people who suddenly became payers of ground rents who did not know such a thing as a ground rent existed.</P>
    <P>When one thinks of the 11,000 or 12,000 such tenants who came into existence in the post-war building boom who became aware of ground rents as such, one can easily see why this matter became one of concern to political Parties and eventually to the Government who are now in the process of doing something about it.  To get to the point of the amendment, it seems to me that builders and developers who bought land, particularly in the immediate post-war years and indeed every year since, did so on a speculative basis, as they were entitled to do.  In all instances, the prices paid for this land were very inflated and there was no real method of determining that such prices were in equity. These prices were left, in the much lauded law of supply and demand which is, in effect, the law of the jungle, <Col N="1999" /> to find their own levels.  The result was that there was speculation in land.</P>
    <P>Ground rents came into existence immediately after the war in respect of the type of house to which I am referring&mdash;the type built mainly under the provisions of SDA.  These ground rents bore no relation to ground rents as they were known prior to the war and in the early years of the century. Indeed ground rents became a commodity for sale in high financial circles. They became as valuable as property itself, despite the fact that most enlightened people today, like the Labour Party, accepted that there was no moral authority whatever for them.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, ground rents began to be regarded almost as sacrosanct and as important as the very earth itself. As such they were treated, sold, exchanged and bought by certain financial organisations&mdash;for instance, insurance companies&mdash;as if they were gilt-edged securities.  There was speculation in this and ground rents became part of the means whereby profits were amassed by people who spin not, neither do they weave.</P>
    <P>The people who were footing the Bill at the end of it all were the ordinary people who had saved up money to put down deposits in order to get SDA loans to get into houses&mdash; usually newly-married couples and young people about to be married, people with very long periods of loan repayments ahead.  As well, they have been facing, ever since, annual demands for grossly inflated ground rents when in fact they should not have been asked to pay any because if right were right, which it seldom is, ground rents would have been abolished long ago.</P>
    <P>What I want to secure by this amendment is that such people&mdash; tenants of existing houses which have been built since the war, and I put down 1946 as a notional year&mdash;will get the consideration they deserve. They are paying ground rents which bear no relation at all to the justice of the case and there is no consideration for all the years which have passed when thousands of them have <Col N="2000" /> paid substantial increases already in their ground rents.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes that those people should be extended the opportunity to purchase the fee simple in the little plot of land on which their houses stand but they have no rights other than to require the ground landlord to sell them the fee simple for the amount of money which must be paid to the ground landlord, or which must be made available to him.  This has been estimated as equivalent to a set number of years purchase.  This would mean that such a tenant would be placed in financial difficulties in order to find a lump sum of £150 to purchase the fee simple plot.  Very often those tenants have young families nowadays or their families may have grown up but they still have financial difficulties.</P>
    <P>It is not right that those people should be treated in this way.  Some account must be taken of the amount which they have already paid by way of ground rents in the years in which they have been in occupation of their particular houses.  If I had my way, I would say that people who have paid the equivalent of £150 should, in fact, be given the fee simple without the payment of any additional money. It is impossible from the direction of the discussion in this House to get that principle accepted and one has to temporise and get the best one can for those tenants.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister to do what he can in this direction and see that some steps are taken to provide machinery whereby the money already paid by such people over the years is taken into consideration.  Those people are the victims of a situation for which they have no responsibility. They are young people who sacrificed the small luxuries of life to save money in order to get a deposit for their houses.  They had to undergo rigorous financial tests&mdash;even, one might say, securing character references&mdash;in order to get loans for their houses.  Since they have occupied those houses in the various areas such as Walkinstown, Perrystown and various estates in the south suburbs and also in the north suburbs, such as Santry, and indeed Lucan, and various other parts of the <Col N="2001" /> city, they have been undergoing considerable hardship down through the years by virtue of the fact that they have been forced to pay those unjust ground rents.</P>
    <P>We are bringing in a Bill to deal with ground rents.  It is very probable, unless certain things happen of a very radical nature in this country, that we may not have the opportunity of doing much again about ground rents for many years to come.  Therefore, it behoves us to do what we can to secure the maximum amount of justice for the people involved.  We would not be doing justice to those people without giving them some credit, and without affording them some allowance, for the amount of money they have already paid by way of ground rents. We should provide in this Bill that where such existing tenants paying ground rents wish to purchase the fee simple of the plot of land on which their houses stand and set about so doing, there should be, in the determination of the amount which they must pay, an allowance in respect of the amount they have already paid during their occupation of those houses since the war.</P>
    <P>It may be asked why this year of 1946 is brought in.  I have tried to explain that I believe those are a very special grade of people.  If it were not for those people, we would not be discussing this ground rents Bill at all. Influential people tried to do something about ground rents before this. The late Captain Redmond was one of the people working on this and he was the only one mentioned in the Report of the Ground Rents Commission. There were possibly one or two others.  There were certainly influential forces and enthusiastic forces at work but nothing was done because ground rents did not seem to bear very heavily on the votes, to put it brutally, up to recent years.  The number of people who have been paying ground rents has been multiplying in recent years.  It is a brutal fact but unless some issue has an influence on the electorate, nothing will be done about it.  It all depends on how many votes are affected.</P>
    <P>This matter affects a great many <Col N="2002" /> votes.  We in the Labour Party have been concerned about this as a principle long before anybody was talking about it.  James Connolly wrote a lot about ground rents and about the inequity of ground rents.  He traced the very origin of ground rents to the conquest of this country&mdash;I hate to use that word because it is almost treasonable to use it now&mdash;by the foreigner. Here we are, as I say, with the chance to do justice for a section of our people.  They are the very best section of our people.  They are young people who worked hard and saved hard. Most of them saved from nothing. They saved money to pay a deposit in order to get a loan to purchase their homes.  They have been repaying the Small Dwellings Act loans over the years and it has been no small effort to do so.</P>
    <P>Those people have maintained a very high social standard in those areas.  I mean by that that they have kept their houses in a very good state of maintenance.  They have kept their gardens in admirable condition.  The general level and appearance of those areas is excellent.  Those people are the very best in our society.  We are now giving them the opportunity to purchase the fee simple.  This is not enough. We must do something more.  We must give them the benefit, at least in the purchase price which they may pay for the fee simple, of the amount they have already paid for what one may describe as a penal tax.</P>

I know that a number of them are most anxious to purchase their ground <Col N="2003" /> rents.  I just want to make the point to the Minister that many of them may not be in a position to make the purchase, even on the basis of the amendment. I wonder if the financial position improves whether there will be any possibility of creating a fund to help such tenants as are purchasing their homes by various means such as SDA building loans, insurance companies and building societies.  If such people were anxious to purchase their ground rent, it could be purchased over a period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>We shall deal with Deputy Burke's point on the next amendment.  Arising out of Deputy Dunne's point, which relates to giving credit in respect of ground rent paid since 1946, I should like to make my position quite clear in regard to this Bill.  The whole object of the Bill is to give tenants this new right which they had not heretofore.  As Deputy Dunne pointed out, it is a right that has been fought for by them over a period of years and he has played a part in that particular fight, it is acknowledged.  But I must bear in mind a document which is often dear to Deputy Dunne's heart, that is, the Constitution and the rights guaranteed therein.  I see no point in bringing a Bill through the Houses of the Oireachtas and, as I said earlier, having it torpedoed subsequently in the Supreme Court.  That would be a waste of everybody's time.  It would not serve the interests of tenants, and their interests, I take it, are the concern of all of us on all sides of the House.</P>
      <P>I have no doubt that the way in which the Supreme Court would look at any measure of this kind is: is the landlord being compensated to a degree that would give him the same income as he had before being compulsorily bought out?  That is a practical rule of thumb which I feel would be followed by the Supreme Court.  Therefore, it has been my concern in providing this new right of the tenant, in giving him this absolute right which he can enforce, to ensure that in the process no element of confiscation shall arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall not argue the pros and cons of the landlord's interests but I am concerned with having this measure preserved as the statute law of this country.  My concern is that, whatever the rights or wrongs of the matter, we should not in any way impinge on the basic principle of fair compensation where there is compulsory purchase. I am certain that if we brought in any amendment which would give landlords a lower income than they had previously, this measure would be defeated in the Supreme Court on the <Col N="2005" /> basis of interference with the constitutional guarantees relating to the rights of private property.  To set off the amount of ground rent already paid in as suggested by Deputy Dunne, would in effect diminish the compensation. The reality is that this would lead to a diminution of the landlord's income and I would not be happy about the Bill if it contained such a provision.  I would not be happy about the Bill being challenged by the landlord in the Supreme Court for his compensation in the matter, having regard to the fundamental rights in our Constitution relating to property.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is the only fear the Minister has in regard to this amendment, and the only objection he has, then I think it is so important that there is an obvious way around it.  It may very well be that the principle of the Bill itself means that the landlord must be paid, must receive an income equivalent to that which he now receives by way of ground rent.  That is the underlying principle of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody wants to be unjust to landlords any more than any other section of the community, particularly in this case where we recognise what has been described in the Commission Report as the pyramid of interest which has evolved in many cases in relation to ground rents. Nobody wants to do anything which will occasion hardship, so to speak. Very often elderly people may be dependent on this kind of income and have no other income.  They may be living very penuriously.  Nobody wants to harm them and everybody wants to provide such people with an alternative way of living.  Herein I think the State can guarantee the principle which it seeks to establish in the Bill, that is, that the landlord shall not be harshly treated by adopting some system similar to that, though on a very much reduced scale, which was adopted in the Land Act which secured the three Fs for the Irish <Col N="2006" /> farmer which were secured by Davitt first and Parnell after.</P>

      <P>The balance of power was there with the Land League, without which Parnell would not have been worth a damn.  The direct action man who dealt with the landlord was the man who got the Wyndham Act and the whole lot of them on the statute books.  We shall take that up again on another occasion.  Let us try to take example, unworthy as we are, from the actions of such men. We want to do right by all but it is our duty to seek to do justice first for the greatest number, which is what democracy means: the greatest good for the greatest number.  In this case there can be no question that the greatest number are the tenants.  I am asking nothing extraordinary for them.  I am not asking for any privilege or advantage that any reasonable person would deny them.  I am simply asking that they get credit for the amount of money they have already paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister quotes the danger of the Bill being torpedoed by being declared unconstitutional by the courts. That could be, but with sufficient good intentions being brought in with the Bill, that could be overcome by the institution of some system of funds which, it may well be, would require to be supplied by the Exchequer.  It may well be that it could even be <Col N="2007" /> found, as Deputy Corry has indicated, in the funds of suitors.  This is not an insoluble problem, the need of ensuring that the landlords' rights are protected while at the same time doing right by the tenants.  This is something that could and should be done.</P>
    <P>It is not outside the wit, capacity or intelligence of the present incumbent of office to evolve a scheme whereby all the pyramid of interests at all levels would be preserved and to ensure at the same time that justice would be done to the fellow at the bottom who is paying the whole lot, the tenant. That is a very important matter and I will have to press it on the House.</P>

My concern is to get through the House and to get working a Bill that will not be declared unconstitutional by the courts.  Deputy Dunne and I are of the one mind.  We are both concerned to give tenants as much as possible but I want a Bill that will stand up and will not be upset by the courts.  I am going as far as I can in ease of the tenants, consistent with the rights of everybody.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 21:</P>
      <P>Before section 17 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The purchase price of a freehold may be paid in equal annual instalments over such period of years as may be prescribed by regulations made by the Minister.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a very simple amendment.  It is simply to make provision to the effect that in the case where a tenant is purchasing the fee simple, he should be enabled to do so by instalments.  The amount generally mentioned in connection with the purchase of the fee simple I have in mind is about £150. <Col N="2008" /> That is a very large amount of money, especially in the times in which we live.  The kind of family of which I am thinking who would be anxious to purchase this fee simple, either as an investment for the future or to get rid of the anachronism of ground rents once and for all, is the family already facing sufficient economic and financial problems without having to find so large a sum.</P>
    <P>Where would they get it?  Very few would have it laid by for a rainy day and it would be a pretty poor umbrella even in a gentle summer shower.  I would not think there would be many who would have it where they could lay their hands on it readily.  Some provision should be made for such people.  If they go to the bank manager for a loan of £150 to purchase the fee simple of their property, I know the reception they will get.  I know the reception anybody gets from bank managers these days, even if you have collateral far in excess of the amount sought.  I do not see any evidence of the relaxation of credit restrictions or any increase in prosperity.  The banks are just as difficult as they have been for the past 12 months.  They are as tight as a drum and, of course, there is a bank strike and nobody can get money at the moment.</P>

      <P>Bank strikes are like all other strikes: they are like the road to hell, paved with good intentions, paved with rubber flooring which leads to all kinds of difficulties.  That is why it is well to eschew all such things. The kind of tenant I am thinking of, even when the banks are open and doing business, would not find it possible to get the money very easily, even with collateral in excess of what he is looking for.  This kind of person, the best we have in the community, should be helped to the extent that there should be a provision whereby he will be enabled to purchase his ground rent by instalments over a number of years.  I do not think this could possibly affect the principle of the Bill.  It may need a bit of <Col N="2009" /> thought as to the mechanics of it but, again, it is not a very big obstacle and one which should and can be overcome if we but try.</P>

      <P>This is one time I am pulling my weight with my colleague from County Dublin.  I can see here a big difficulty for a number of young people who are purchasing their own homes: they will not be able to avail of this very good Bill for which we have been agitating for a number of years.  Since I spoke last, I have been thinking of insurance companies. Perhaps the Minister may possibly be able to suggest to some of these companies that they might adjust their insurance as to cover the man mentioned by Deputy Dunne in respect of the £150 because if that could be done, it would make it possible&mdash;I shall not suggest how it could be done but an insurance company might do it&mdash;for people with life assurance to get a loan.  People who have not got an insurance of any kind may be able to get themselves insured in that amount over a period. I am sure&mdash;taking into account the age in which we are living&mdash;that a number of such companies would adjust their rules to cover a position of this kind.  If they did, it would, in my estimation, be responsible for meeting that part of the Bill about which we are most anxious, that is, to give everybody purchasing their own homes a chance of purchasing their ground rent.</P>

    <P>This is a most important matter because I know a number of people with young families who are finding it hard to pay their SDA loans, to pay for furniture and to pay rates, without the added burden of getting the money to buy out their ground rents; on reconsideration, I realise that the fund about which I have spoken would need to be colossal to serve the whole country, even taking in Deputy Corry's area.  I feel sure an insurance company would provide that accommodation for a tenant who wishes to purchase his ground rent, provided he is not 70 years of age or over.  That is a matter with which the companies <Col N="2010" /> could deal.  I would suggest to the Minister that if it were possible for him to say a kindly word&mdash;he is a courteous man himself&mdash;to insurance companies suggesting that they consider this matter, it would be of tremendous help because I believe it is very important for all our people.</P>

      <P>I do not want to say a lot on this amendment.  I sympathise very much with the spirit behind it and with any spirit respecting the principle of the amendment but I feel it is not one which could work in relation to very many of the types of ground rents which must fall to be dealt with under this Bill.  Deputy Dunne mentioned, in his remarks on the previous amendment, that in relation to a lot of the ground rents, large bodies would be the owners.  Possibly, in these kinds of cases, a system of payment by instalments might operate but we have to look at the other side as well.  There are very many individuals who have invested their money and whose sole means of subsistence at the moment is the income which they derive from two, three or, possibly, half a dozen ground rents throughout the country.  The principle behind this Bill is that they will be compensated when they have to part with their source of income; they will be compensated so that they can get a purchase money which they, in turn, can invest and derive their income from the investment.  If these people are to be in a position of having to accept the purchase price by instalments, it completely destroys their chance of having a fund which they, in turn, could invest in order to continue their income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the difficulty I see in the operation of an amendment like this. The idea is a very appealing and attractive one in many ways but I do not think it could work, if we are to see equal justice done to both sides.  As far as the large majority of ground rent payers are concerned, I should imagine the position is that very many of them have purchased, by means of assistance, either from building societies or from the local authority under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act.  I do not <Col N="2011" /> know what action can be taken in the local authority.  If members of local authorities, with the co-operation of the Minister responsible, could provide that local authorities will give an additional loan in cases where there are ground rents, to enable them to be tagged on to the existing mortgage, it would enable the tenant who has purchased under an SDA loan to purchase out and there would not be any hardship. They would, in effect, be purchasing by instalment because the amount of the additional advance would then be paid by instalments, together with the loan already there.  It would not be very great in those cases because, so far as Dublin County Council is concerned&mdash;and I think the same probably applies to other local authorities&mdash; there would be a limit on the amount of ground rents in respect of which advances would be made.  They would not deal with cases where the ground rent was more than £10, so that in normal cases the additional advance required to purchase out these ground rents in Small Dwellings Acquisition Act cases would not be very large.</P>
    <P>I would imagine that in the other type of case, where a person has a loan from a building society and has given a mortgage as security, there would not be any great difficulty.  There might be a bit of difficulty in the present general economic situation but, in normal times, I do not think there would be any great difficulty in getting an additional advance from the building society for the purpose of buying out the ground rent because, from the building societies' point of view, their security is very much enhanced; instead of having a mortgage on a leasehold premises, they then have a mortgage on the fee simple.  So far as this amendment is concerned, I would recommend that it be looked at so far as local authorities are concerned, under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act, by members of local authorities and the responsible Minister to provide machinery so that an additional advance can be made to purchase out ground rent.</P>

      <P>There has been delay in doing justice as far as the <Col N="2012" /> town tenants of this country are concerned.  When I first dealt with this matter here on 12th July, 1932, we had the distinction that day also of obtaining our freedom, for it was on that day in this House we abolished the oath to the King of England. However, this is 34 years afterwards. Since then, a new class of ground rent landlords have come up, due largely to employment and a bit of prosperity, that is, a man built his own house or had his own house built for him and, by loans or, in some cases, with his own money, purchased that house but had not sufficient money to meet the demands of the builder or the owner of the house and accepted a ground rent clapped on to fill in the balance. They are an entirely different class&mdash;I do not think they can be covered by the one Bill&mdash;from the ground landlords who got their land as a grant from a British Queen or a British King and who have been drawing an income from that ground ever since.</P>
      <P>Deputy Burke suggested the insurance companies could help in this regard.  I challenge any member of this House to name one insurance company or one bank that is not a ground landlord. The problem was simple if it had been dealt with in 1932 or in the years that followed, because we were dealing then with the grabber and no one had too much mercy on or sympathy for him.  Now we are dealing with an entirely different class, as I shall be explaining on the amendments I have tabled.  Unfortunately we cannot fall back on the refuge suggested by Deputy Burke, for both the insurance companies and the building societies are the ground landlords of today, so far as 1946 onwards is concerned.</P>

        <i>(Dublin):</i> I have sympathy with the group of people Deputy Dunne spoke of, those who have been buying a house over the past twenty years.  There would be very little hope of those people finding £150 to purchase out their ground rent. I cannot see any reason why it could not be paid in instalments, say, over a period of three or four years, even if we had to charge interest or allow the landlord to charge interest.  This <Col N="2013" /> would give such tenants some hope of purchasing out the ground rent.</P>

Would this be possible?</P>

      <P>The idea of providing for a scheme of paying the purchase price in instalments would, as Deputy O'Higgins said, be prejudicial to the landlord; in other words, he would not get the lump sum to which he is entitled to compensate him for his loss of freehold.  However, that is separate from the issue of providing some sort of loan scheme whereby the tenant could obtain a loan from some other source, an insurance company, the State or a local authority.  I am aware that insurance companies are looking into this matter already and that one has actually prepared a scheme to provide loans for ground rent tenants.  We must look at this thing realistically.  If the State steps in, it becomes a social service.  If it is done adequately by private sources such as insurance companies or building societies in the months and years ahead, there will be very little reason for the State to step in.  I appreciate the spirit of the amendment, but I would prefer to see the Bill in operation.  If it is considered necessary, as a matter of a social service, that we should, either directly through the Department of Local Government or through the local authorities, as Deputy O'Higgins suggested, have such a scheme, we can have a look at it in that light in the future.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether the Ceann Comhairle was in the Chair at the time when we had a discussion on an amendment of mine on section 6 which it was agreed was really more relevant to section 17.  I do not want to repeat anything I said in connection with that amendment. By reason, so to speak, of adjourning the consideration of it, I overlooked making a point on section 6 and I would ask the Minister to bear with me for a moment in connection with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 6 is the section which requires the owner to complete a conveyance <Col N="2016" /> without unreasonable delay, to take all necessary steps to effect a conveyance to the tenant purchaser when he is served with a notice. Section 17 then goes on to lay down the procedure in a case of difficulty or dispute&mdash;that it will be dealt with by the county registrar.  There was one point made to me that I want to put before the Minister for consideration: in a number of cases there are what I would regard as a kind of small-time owners of ground rents. I am not talking of large concerns who in one way and another have acquired ground rents in the course of their business and who make it a business to acquire them, but the small-time owner who is depending on a few ground rents for his income. That kind of person might be in difficulty if he has to sell his ground rents at virtually a moment's notice and the case was urged on me that it would be reasonable that the owner should be given, say, two or three months' notice of the tenant's intention to acquire the ground rent.  I am raising this on section 17 because it is the machinery section in cases of any question or difficulty arising.</P>
    <P>What has been put to me is that it is a question of practical difficulty, or may be a question of practical difficulty, in the case of these small-time owners of ground rents if they are required to sell immediately without being given an opportunity of thinking out what they will do by way of alternative investment when they get the purchase money.  I do not know whether it would in any serious way impinge on the machinery set down in the Bill if the Minister were to write into it in some place that if it creates hardship on the owner, he will be entitled to a certain number of months period of grace, so to speak, after service of the notice.  I should like the Minister to consider that.  I do appreciate that, in a number of cases, probably by the time the transaction is finished, a certain period of time will have elapsed.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;the purchase price shall not exceed a sum representing ten years ground rent&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to make it clear, as I said before, that there is a wide difference between the new ground rent landlord and tenant and the old. I wonder if the Minister had any consultation with his brother in arms, the Minister for Local Government, on this when he was considering what he has in the Bill in section 18 about the purchase price.  The Minister for Local <Col N="2018" /> Government maintains that a ten-year purchase is financially more advantageous to the seller than a 15-year purchase.  I would refer the Minister to column 63 of the Official Report of 10th June, 1965, where the Minister for Local Government is reported as saying:</P>
    <P>I would say again that the ten-year period with interest has got the edge slightly on the 15-year period.</P>
    <P>I do not know how the Minister for Local Government worked that out but on that day I said:</P>
    <P>With the utmost amusement, I shall listen to the terms of purchase under the Ground Rents Bill when it is introduced...</P>
    <P>This was on the Bill which extended the Cork Borough and which took property from Cork County Council and handed it over to the Corporation. Does the Minister or does this House consider that the ratepayers of Cork County are less entitled to fair compensation for the property taken from them than the scab of a landlord who walked in for nothing and who has been collecting anything from £15,000 to £16,000 a year out of one town ever since?  Which has the most right in justice here?</P>
    <P>The Minister for Local Government told us that he was following a well-established principle, laid down in the Dublin Act of 1930, followed in Limerick and Waterford, and in the extension of Cork County in 1965. Those were all ten-year periods of purchase.  How can the Minister now come along this year to tell us that a foreign landlord with rights established by confiscation is entitled to a higher sum than the ordinary owner of property as we were in regard to rates in Cork County, we ordinary citizens of the county?  I do not know how he can justify it and I do not see how he can justify the gentleman who was drawing ground rent of £17 per year and who increased that to £177 per year.  How can he justify an unfortunate tenant now having to pay that landlord 15 years purchase on the £177?</P>
    <P>I admit that through the efforts of what might be called an illegal organisation <Col N="2019" /> we succeeded in getting by arbitration that rent reduced by one-third 34 years ago.  To show the difference, those tenants have paid that foreign landlord £183,000 less because of our efforts then.  How is the Minister to justify the individual who can take advantage of the fact that he handed over a bit of land on which those men built hotels and shops out of their own pockets and then when the lease fell in, he came and collared, as his predecessor did before him, the whole lot and instead of £17, puts on £177 in one case and in another where the rent was £12 10s puts on £1,080?  Under this Bill he gets 15 years purchase and can collect on the £1,080, less one-third which we got off.</P>
    <P>What was a simple problem then, 34 years ago, is an entirely different problem today because you have Deputy Burke's widow, the insurance companies and the societies and God-knows-what, all in the swim, not forgetting the gentlemen who are at present on strike, the banks.  Within the past 12 months, the Bank of Ireland, with a gentleman named Montgomery of Cork, purchased the town of Midleton on ten years purchase. When we were discussing matters of that kind some time ago, I gave the Minister another case which he could investigate, the case of Barclays Bank of London.  They purchased the town of Innishannon at 9½ years purchase.  Those two banks were able to pay dividends to their shareholders of 23 per cent and 25 per cent last year and under this legislation they can grab a 50 per cent increase on their purchase price.</P>
    <P>Do we know what we are doing? Is there any justice in what we are doing?  Those are the facts.  The idea of giving a hangman who has been dragging £15,000 or £10,000 a year out of the sweat and blood and toil of the people of the town of Cobh and living in luxury in Britain on the proceeds, a guarantee of 6¾ per cent on his money for evermore is appalling. That is not the kind of legislation envisaged by the men who established this Parliament or by the people who <Col N="2020" /> sent us here.  This is a wretched matter and I suggest to the Minister that, as I propose in this amendment, he sets a figure of ten years purchase. That is enough to give the beggars and get rid of them.</P>
    <P>I am not concerned so much with what the Minister does in the case of the ordinary man who built a housing scheme in the past 20 years and had to accept a ground rent as part of the money because the tenant was unable to pay, but I am very definitely concerned with the town of Midleton and the town of Cobh, and the whole area of Ballycotton and Castlemartyr and also the town of Youghal.  If I could encroach on Deputy Barry, I would include the town of Fermoy.</P>

I have given examples.  If the Minister can give me any justification for the Bank of Ireland, acting through a subsidiary, being enabled by legislation of this House to convert the £50,000 they invested in Midleton into £75,000, he will be telling me something, or as to why Barclays Bank of London who came across here to buy the town of Innishannon outside Bandon at 9½ years purchase will, under this Bill, when enacted, be allowed to collect <Col N="2021" /> 14½ years purchase on that.

      <P>These injustices are still being perpetrated in many of the towns in North-East Cork which is the constituency I have the honour to represent here.  This Bill will leave us with some injustices and irregularities if further action is not taken.  I can say about Midleton and Youghal what Deputy Corry said about Cobh.  The rents there have been increased as much as 300 and 400 per cent in recent years.  If the purchase period is 15 years, then I have no doubt that the tenants will still be sacrificed and will still suffer much hardship.  To limit the period even to ten years will not do justice to them and will merely go half way towards meeting their case.  I am sure the Minister must have read of the agitation in Midleton in the past 12 months.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a misapprehension as to the meaning of section 18.  I do not think it has been looked at in its total effect.  Deputy Corry mentioned people who come in here and buy an estate at a certain number of years purchase and become the ground landlords.  He sought to imply that we are handing these people a profit by guaranteeing them a 15 years purchase: that is not so.</P>
      <P>Section 18 applies in any case where the tenant moves to obtain a right which he, the tenant, wants to exercise. In the event of his seeking to purchase the freehold, certain criteria apply which are set out in paragraphs (a) and (b) of section 18.  Paragraph (a) gives authority to the county registrar to take various factors into account when settling an equitable purchase price and paragraph (b) deals with particular cases and provides that the landlord should get a maximum compensation which would yield an income equivalent to the ground rent if invested in a national loan.  There is nothing in the section to provide that the landlord must get a particular number of years purchase.  All this only applies where the tenant is the moving party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2023" /> However, in a large number of cases the landlord will be the moving party and the tenant may be unwilling to deal with him or with big institutional investors.  There may be 100 tenants on an estate and the landlord may wish to sell the fee simple to all of them.  In such cases, the landlord will have to accept below the maximum because all the tenants may not wish to buy.  This is commonsense.  In the ordinary free play of the market at the moment, where the institutional investor is the moving party in buying and selling properties, the market is around ten to 12 years purchase.</P>
    <P>This Bill does not affect the particular market Deputy Corry is talking about.  There is no basis whatsoever for suggesting that in some way we are guaranteeing institutional investors 15 years purchase if they buy up property. They have to depend on the free play of the market.  All that is provided in section 18 is certain criteria which will apply where the tenant asks the county registrar to fix the terms of purchase where the purchase is compulsorily.  In that case, we say that where the property is less than one acre in extent and where the lease has more than 25 years to run then the landlord is entitled to compensation not greater than what he would get from the current national loan.  I think that this ties up the matter absolutely.</P>
    <P>I appreciate very much that, over the years, Deputy Corry has fought often a lone battle on behalf of tenants to ensure their rights to buy out the freehold.  I have the same interests at heart.  I agree with what Deputy Corry and Deputy Dunne have said that there is very little justification in this age for ground rents as a type of property holding.  A divorce between control and ownership is not good socially: I am totally against it and that is why I am piloting this measure. I do not want to bring a measure through this House, which everybody agrees is necessary, only to find it torpedoed in the Supreme Court within a matter of months.</P>

      <P>That is easier said than done.  There is a Constitution and there are basic property rights set up in the Constitution and we cannot have a system of compensation which has an element of confiscation in it. If you introduce any arbitrary rules, such as the ten years purchase, which may be fair in one case and totally unfair in another, then where the case is unfair and you have a poor person who suffers a drop in income&mdash;and you can have a poor person owning a ground rent&mdash;the Bill would not last five minutes in the Supreme Court. I have the interests of this matter just as much at heart as Deputy Corry or Deputy Dunne but we can only act within the framework of the Constitution and the basic property rights which are guaranteed.</P>

      <P>In the main, these amendments concern covenants which will survive the purchase of a ground rent.  The general principle is that covenants will not survive the purchase of a freehold. The freehold will be subject merely to planning requirements.  There are specific covenants, however, which we decided to retain because of their particular quality.  One of these is an amenity covenant through which the landlord derives a particular personal benefit arranged freely between him and the tenant.  There is also the case of a right of way existing as a result of arrangement between the landlord and other lessees.  Where a lessee would acquire the freehold interest we feel it would be unjust to the other lessees to be able to deprive them of that right of way.  We feel it would be wrong to have these covenants automatically go by the board on the purchase of the freehold.  The principle behind the amendments to sections 25 and 27 is that a lessee who does not purchase the fee simple should be in no better position, as regards relief from covenants, than if he had done so.</P>

    <Title>Committee on Finance. - Industrial Training Bill, 1965: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to delay the House very long as I already made part of my contribution on the previous occasion.  Through a process of question and answer in the last few moments of the debate, the Parliamentary Secretary made it clear there was a considerable stricture on small trade unions in this Bill.  If a person is trained under the proposed accelerated training system to be a painter or carpenter and if a union should challenge the right of that <Col N="2033" /> person to be so described or employed, the penalties in this Bill are sufficient to deter any union or person from making such objection.  This would indicate that an employer prepared to employ such a person could hope to have the benefit of that man's work without interference.  I have not heard anybody in any public pronouncement since the introduction of the Bill objecting to this course.  There has been no objection either from the Labour Party or the trade unions.  For that reason I feel that, on balance, everybody agrees with this provision. This is probably a good thing.  Surely the agency proposed will not retrain people in craft trades which are dying or in which there is not an opportunity for future employment?  This would be a stupid thing to do.  While at first sight it might appear there is a danger here to the craft unions, on mature reflection, it would seem there is no such danger.</P>
      <P>This is, of course, a terrific change. We are all aware that in certain parts of the country the number of apprentices allowed to each accredited painter and carpenter is severely limited.  It is related, of course, to the amount of work there is for painters and carpenters. We know that with the arrival of all kinds of manufactured signs and manufactured surfaces, such as Perspex and Formica, the work of painters in the building and maintenance trades has been severely restricted. It is up to the agency proposed to see to it that they do not train too many craftsmen for these trades and thus create unemployment, whereas the real objective is to fill the void that will be left in industry where there is severe displacement because of free trade.  I think the opportunities are a thousandfold.  New crafts are beginning every day.  There are crafts in which the amount of work is expanding and there are crafts in which, as I said, the amount of work is decreasing.  With wisdom, everything should work very well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been other legislation but this is the first concrete step to be taken by the Parliamentary Secretary charged with responsibility for this important facet of our industrial future. <Col N="2034" /> There are many who would disagree with various provisions in the Bill. Many would say the cost of retraining should be borne by the Exchequer and that we should pay for it in our taxes, both direct and indirect.  There are others who say that this should be borne individually by the industries involved.  The choice made by the Parliamentary Secretary and the Government is that the industries involved should bear the cost by way of levy. I do not want to raise any hare of disagreement at this stage, but it could well be that the levies could impose a severe restriction on the expansion of certain industries.  I do not know&mdash; and I suppose at this stage the Parliamentary Secretary can only conjecture &mdash;what these levies will amount to. The principle is that the industry which will receive the newly-trained employees should bear the cost of the training.  That cost could be very considerable.</P>
    <P>If we look at the problem urgently &mdash;and we have a serious responsibility to do so&mdash;we must realise that of far greater importance is the time factor. Speaking last night on the Import (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 1966, I suggested one of our great problems was that with the advent of free trade, we could not keep pace by providing new jobs at the same rate as jobs lost because of changes in industry and commerce and jobs lost in agriculture. I pointed out that between 1965 and 1964 there were 7,000 fewer jobs in the country.  Apart from whether everything in the Bill is correct or not, there is absolute urgency to get on with the job.  We should all be extremely flexible in our approach to the Bill.  While the Parliamentary Secretary is keen to get it through and get the work under way, it is possible he will be back here&mdash;perhaps as Minister, and indeed we wish him that personally&mdash;in order to change things. I do not think he will hit the bullseye with the first shot.  The urgency is to get the work under way.  If last year we had 7,000 fewer jobs in industry and 14,000 fewer jobs in agriculture, it is evident the crisis is not around the corner, but with us now.</P>
    <P>The first evidence of change appeared on 1st July, 1966, in the shape <Col N="2035" /> of a reduction of tariffs.  I believe that from the discussions that took place on the Free Trade Agreement serious consideration has been given to the question of employment here by industrialists abroad.  The first tariff reduction of ten per cent is the first concrete evidence which will indicate to these people that we are serious in this and it will encourage them to send goods in here in competition with home-manufactured goods.  This we will have to live with but there is the danger that people who have a vast production abroad might be prepared to take a lesser price here so that they would be well established here when further tariff reductions are made.</P>
    <P>For these reasons there is great urgency in looking forward to seeing where there might be serious displacement and for doing the best we can to provide other placement in industry. When Deputy Dillon suggested last night that morally it is quite wrong to give a man a silver handshake at the age of 50 years and tell him that his job is redundant, he was right.  The approach in this Bill will be difficult to carry out.  It is not 100 per cent satisfactory but it is the only approach, the only way by which we can look ourselves in the face, that we should do our best to see that those, whom by our political actions we have displaced, should have the opportunity to have themselves trained to go into other and perhaps better jobs.  For this reason this House must welcome the measure.</P>
    <P>This is a Bill which will receive serious consideration in the Seanad and I would like to know whether the Parliamentary Secretary desires to have all Stages today.  If he does not, the Bill can receive serious consideration here on Committee Stage.  I am glad that the Parliamentary Secretary has given me that indication because my view was that while this was a Bill he should get because of the urgency of the problem, the House should also get an opportunity of giving it mature consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought it was <Col N="2036" /> well known that, by agreement, only the Second Stage of this Bill was to be taken today because the Parliamentary Secretary is anxious to have the views of the various organisations, the employers and the trade unions, during the Recess.  We appreciate that that will give an opportunity to those organisations of saying what they think about the Bill.  It is true to say that this Bill is a start and whether we like it or not or whether we will be satisfied with it is something that is hard to foretell. The big trouble about the whole question is that, as Deputy Donegan has said, this is something that is about to be brought on us by the deliberate action of this House.</P>
      <P>On 6th January, 1966, we approved of a Free Trade Agreement with Britain.  At that time I said, and I repeat it now, that it does appear that that Agreement is about to bring about a considerable amount of industrial unemployment in this country.  Whether industrialists can be encouraged to come in here, knowing that there is a pool of labour available, to attempt to exploit that pool for the purpose of competing in Britain and elsewhere is anybody's guess.  At the present time a number of industries that have been in operation here for many years appear to be easing off.  Over the last number of weeks in this city, there have been tremendous sales in the shops.  I hope that this does not mean that they are getting rid of the last of their Irish goods but I am told that is what is happening and that they hope to import here cheaper British goods as a result of the reduction of the tariffs.  That could cause a very serious upset here and, if it is so, the problems of the Parliamentary Secretary will be far greater than they are at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mention is made in the White Paper that apprenticeship training is the major type of training in the Bill but that arrangements have to be made to deal with other types of training, including adult re-training.  This is something which is likely to lead the Parliamentary Secretary into trouble with the craft unions.  There is no short cut to a professional job and there is no short cut to becoming a craftsman. <Col N="2037" /> This is a complete reversal of the decision taken a few years ago whereby apprentices had to have a certain standard of education before they could go into training and then they had to train for their craft for a certain number of years.</P>
    <P>If it is now suggested that there is going to be a short cut in this matter of training, I do not know whether it is good or bad, but in my opinion, there will be strong objections from the craft unions who have been training their apprentices for five or seven years.  There will be strong objections from them if they find advertisements being issued stating that people can be trained as craftsmen in a couple of months.  It may be that this would result in shoddy work.  The White Paper also mentions operative training and re-training.  This can cover a lot of things.  Would the Parliamentary Secretary explain to me what these people are to be retrained for?  At the present moment we have far more people looking for jobs than there are jobs for them and how is it going to benefit us to retrain people for jobs that are not there?  Do we propose to start some kind of State industry on a large scale to absorb these people?  If not, where are they to be put?</P>
    <P>Refresher training for workers whose skill needs to be improved is also mentioned.  That is an excellent idea. The next one is &ldquo;training for agricultural workers in other occupations&rdquo;. In all these schemes, there has been an attempt made to keep agriculture out and the Taoiseach said in reply to a question by me the other day that it was proposed, if necessary, to include agricultural workers at a later date and that arrangements were being made to train agricultural workers.  The Parliamentary Secretary's biggest problem will be to retain agricultural workers on the land.  Not so long ago we had 10,000 agricultural workers leaving the land in one year and last year that figure was up to 14,000.  So long as we have that problem, so long will the Parliamentary Secretary, with this Bill under his belt, be asked to deal with it.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether he is going to decide that the best thing to do for <Col N="2038" /> agricultural workers is to start industries in rural Ireland akin to agriculture in which they can be employed. The first snag he is going to meet is that the agricultural worker now leaving the land is not the young fellow who is easily trained.  Unfortunately when a farmer dismisses a worker because he has not work enough for his entire working staff, all the evidence is that it is the older man who is forced to go.  This is going to be a big problem, and possibly some legislation will have to be introduced for the purpose of regulating it.  If agriculture were included in the Bill, it would have been a relatively easy thing to ensure that if an agricultural worker were being let go, at least he would be compensated in some way, and it might be cheaper for the employer to keep the older man than to sack him. As it stands, the older man will continue to be pushed out, and we are going to find in the Bill somewhere a section that states that workers over a certain age cannot, need not or will not be retrained.  If we reach that stage, it will be a very serious matter, because we are going to pile on to the Department of Social Welfare a whole lot of people who should be continued in productive employment.</P>
    <P>Advance training of workers for new industrial projects is all right, provided there are new industrial projects. I should like to know what they are and where they come from.  The training of supervisors, technicians, etc., is all to the good.  I wonder how far the Government have gone to investigate what is happening in other countries, and how much evidence of experience of this work is contained in the Bill. It is rather a pity when Bills like this are being introduced that an attempt is not made to have some kind of explanatory leaflet showing where the ideas contained in the Bill have been picked up.  Starting from scratch one is inclined to try out new ideas, and if they are entirely original ones, there is grave danger they may fall down. If years of experience of such ideas in other countries prove them to be capable of operation, then it is an entirely different matter.</P>
    <P>The time is limited and there is a <Col N="2039" /> very big amount of work to be concluded today, so I do not propose to hold up the House any longer on this Bill.  I wish the Parliamentary Secretary well with it, and I hope it will achieve all we are hoping it will achieve.  There is this problem, however, that there are so many questions unanswered, so many suggestions which appear so far to be just pious resolutions, that we may find in 12 months' time we will be very little nearer solution of our problems.  The Government must face up to the fact that this is not a problem for four or five or ten years' time.  This is a problem which must be dealt with now, while we have an unemployed force of 56,000 to 60,000 people who are there all the time, without the additional people we fear will be left unemployed as a result of the Free Trade Area Agreement, and without the additional people coming on the register as a result of leaving agriculture.  That problem is there now and the attempt to tackle it should be made immediately and not in a couple of years' time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>While I do not share Deputy Tully's fears in regard to the effect of the Free Trade Area Agreement, I am with him on one point, that is, on the question of age limit.  At the moment there are plenty of firms all over the country, and even local authorities, who will not employ a man over 40 years of age.  That is a very early retiring age.  I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary will be considering this matter and the fact that we cannot afford to dump manpower at 40 years of age.  Even without the Free Trade Area Agreement with Britain, the rate of automation which is coming into industry will lessen the labour force in existing industries, and, therefore, we must try to attract new industries so that these people can be employed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Dublin city at the moment, there are talks going on between the master stevedores and the trade unions on the decasualisation of labour at Dublin docks.  If this ever came about, it would reduce the total number of <Col N="2040" /> dockers.  It may give the dockers who would remain a higher standard of living, and so on, but there would be many others left without jobs.  I should like to know what would be the plans for retraining these men.  They are skilled in their own way, but they are not skilled as other industrial workers are.  Here we have a great problem as to how to retrain these men and in what spheres.  Then there are the agricultural workers leaving the land.  This problem is not confined to our country; it is all over Europe.  Even the most progressive countries have many thousands of people leaving the land each year, but the urban community can absorb them and put them into jobs.</P>
    <P>If we are to make a success of this Bill, we must start at the very bottom, that is, in the vocational schools. There is a tremendous need in the cities and in the country for more vocational schools, and I do hope the whole lot will be tied up, so that from the time boys and girls go to the vocational school, their training there will fit them for a useful occupation.  If because of a change in the particular trade they have entered, they become redundant, we must also have extension courses which will ensure that they will not be thrown on the scrapheap.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary is to be congratulated on the Bill.  It shows we are looking ahead and that we are anticipating what might happen. Whether we have Free Trade or not, redundancy will occur because of automation. I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary if there is any age limit in mind at which a worker will be retrained or will not be retrained, and if he is not to be retrained, what happens to him then.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I was hoping that when Deputy Tully was speaking on this he might be able to give the House the general reaction of the trade union movement to a sort of crash programme of making a new craftsman in emergency circumstances as far as employment is concerned.  He did not do that.  He said that is something that <Col N="2041" /> will come and he anticipates an unfavourable reaction to such a crash programme.  In circumstances where the loss of a man's employment would be imminent and where there are fellow trade unionists, it would be an extraordinary reaction if they objected to a shorter training period which would provide against such an unfortunate emergency.</P>
      <P>It is well known that in regard to many of the craftsmen's jobs which require, perhaps, five or seven years' training, the skill could be acquired, with an intensive programme, perhaps, in a period of two years.  I remember well, looking back some years, when an apprentice spent the first year running down town for messages, the second year, perhaps, sweeping the shop, and the third year handing out tools, before he started to learn his job.  That kind of thing has changed. Some of it is there still, and there is no intensive training in any of the crafts, as far as I know.  They are spending quite a lot of the time doing work which is not educational work as far as learning their craft is concerned. I believe that in case of necessity the period could be considerably shortened.  Many of the older employees who learned their job the hard way might be inclined to resent it. That is natural.  I would be amazed, however, if we got the unfavourable reaction Deputy Tully seems to anticipate. I am not quite certain whether he does or not.</P>
      <P>Deputy Tully raised another point which is of interest to me.  I can see a great use being made of such an institute as has been referred to for the purposes of refresher courses for persons already employed in industry in order to bring them up to date. Naturally, existing industries would pay for these courses and would know exactly the type of training they required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was wondering if the intention in the Bill is broader than appears.  For instance, would all unemployed persons anxious to improve themselves technically, in a general way, be included for the purpose of training?  Will needs be anticipated or will An Chomhairle wait until an industry is about to be <Col N="2042" /> set up or an existing industry is short of staff?  Will An Chomhairle wait until that point is reached to decide that they will take people in and train them in a particular craft or job?  Certainly, there is an enormous job involved in training all those who are unemployed and who are anxious to become employed. Training is a help in bringing people to the point where they can rapidly acquire skills.  That would be a lead to quick absorption in industry. But I do not think that is the general idea of the legislation.  The Bill appears to me to confine itself to making provision for sufficient technicians and skilled persons in existing industries or industries about to be set up and does not cover general training of those who are unemployed and anxious to find employment.</P>
    <P>I should like to feel that there was some measure of anticipation, that An Chomhairle would take in a number of persons and give them a general training which would shorten the crash programme that is in mind for particular industries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is the first instalment of the manpower policy which the Government have been mulling over for some years back.  We welcome the Bill and would hope that the suggestions we have to make will improve the measure before it passes through both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The real problem we have to contend with here is the creation of the industrial and economic climate in which a manpower policy can operate.  I think it is true to say that a manpower policy, as such, which is designed to accelerate economic growth, create full employment, provide job security, increase living standards, stabilise prices and develop equilibrium in our balance of payments, can properly be operated only in a buoyant economy in which there is full or near-full employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The difficulty we find ourselves in is that we are proposing a scheme of industrial training in an economy which is very obviously underdeveloped, with a very high incidence of unemployment and emigration, in which an average of 50,000 men and women are <Col N="2043" /> allowed to stand idly by while the resources of the country are left unexploited, under-utilised, dormant.</P>
    <P>If this measure does anything to attract more industries to the country and to create full employment, it will have the full support of the Labour Party.  There is no doubt that in this age of advances in science and technology, the old skills to which we were accustomed in trades and industry are fast dying out and new skills and aptitudes are urgently required.  Therefore, an accelerated training programme of this kind is vitally necessary if we are to have the highly intelligent and adaptable labour force which is required in this age of atomic energy and scientific and industrial advance.</P>
    <P>We are nearing the day when the undereducated and untrained worker will be useless and cannot hope for any worthwhile position in life and will be condemned to a blind alley job of little consequence.  Therefore, we are very anxious to see a programme of this kind implemented.  We are concerned about the vast amount of work involved for the Parliamentary Secretary.  Our vocational educational system is not as yet geared to provide the kind of accelerated training envisaged in the Bill.  I assert that the average vocational school is merely training boys and girls in old and, very largely, outdated crafts.  There are very few schools of technology and science in the country.  Apart from that provided at Rathmines, Bolton Street and perhaps in the School of Commerce in Cork, there is not available in the towns and cities the kind of vocational training which young boys, in particular, require.</P>
    <P>A vast amount of money and of technical skill will be required to equip our vocational schools for the kind of modern training in techniques, technology and science envisaged by the Bill.  The only trades that I know of being taught in vocational schools, outside Dublin city and, perhaps, Cork city, are carpentry, metal work, garage mechanics, and so on.  These are limited skills.  I envisage quite a big scheme of readaptation in vocational <Col N="2044" /> schools if we are to provide the ways and means for giving the training envisaged by the Bill.  I appreciate that the desirable thing is that some of the training should be in the vocational schools and also in the industries concerned. I expect that employers would facilitate young apprentices in respect of time off for such training when required.</P>
    <P>Looking at the present situation, the big question which the Labour Party pose in respect of a Bill of this kind, purporting to embark on the industrial training of perhaps thousands of boys, is: where are the jobs to come from? Where do the Government propose to find the work to put all these people into training in the different fields of engineering, industry and technology? At present we have a standing army of unemployed of about 50,000 and emigration running at 40,000 and 50,000 and which is spiralling upwards again and may reach 40,000 this year.  We have this constant, chronic underdevelopment to which I have referred and unless we have a re-orientation of economic development, it may transpire that this Bill will not be worth the paper on which it is printed.</P>
    <P>This Bill is perhaps the first instalment of the manpower policy programme which we have all been considering for some time past.  In that connection we are now to have established a distinct Ministry of Labour and again I avail of the opportunity of welcoming this new proposal.  It is something the Labour Party have been advocating for many years and it is an indication that the policy we are pursuing in this regard is the right one. It is pertinent to point out that it took many years to convince this Government of the desirability of having all the things inherent in a manpower policy, such as industrial training, contained in one Department and that Department should be a Ministry of Labour.  We are grateful to the Taoiseach and the Government for their repentance in that regard.  The reflections the Taoiseach made on the idea of a Ministry of Labour in the past, that it was worthless and unnecessary and not suited to our requirements&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;have all been set aside and he has seen the significance of the stand we took, that if this job is to be done properly, there must be one Minister and one Department and the duplication of control which was evident in the old system under which control was divided between two Departments, one, Industry and Commerce and the other Social Welfare, was not a happy situation.</P>
      <P>This Training Bill will have much to do with the Department of Social Welfare.  Apart from the training of apprentices, we expect the Bill will be utilised most of all to deal with the immediate problems of adult unemployment and redundancy which are now evident and will become more significant as we move towards freer trade with Britain and possibly the Common Market.  The CIO reports forecasting unemployment, underemployment and redundancy in the more vulnerable industries which they have investigated, paint rather a gloomy picture.  This is the problem the Parliamentary Secretary will be tackling.  In the 26 industries which the Committee on Industrial Organisation investigated, comprised of some 77,350 workers, the confirmed view of the Committee was that in freer trade circumstances, some 11,000 workers will lose their jobs.  If the re-adaptation measures which the Committee recommended to the industries concerned were not availed of and quickly utilised, a further 23,000, they said, would lose their jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is evidence at present of factories closing down and workers becoming redundant and there is nothing in this measure to take care of that situation.  We expect that this Bill will be so improved as to take care of redundant workers.  First, we say there should be adequate forecasting in respect of employment.  There should be a positive career guidance system and where there is the likelihood of industry getting into difficulties, economic or financial, the Parliamentary Secretary should ensure that the workers and the trade unions are forewarned <Col N="2046" /> about coming redundancy. That forewarning should not be merely a week's notice but should probably be a year's notice.</P>
    <P>Firms, especially large ones, know in advance the trend of trade and know that it is intended to make changes which will cause redundancy and unemployment and it is an indictment of our Christian society that even in the clear knowledge that hundreds of workers are to be dismissed, there is no prior consultation with or notice given to the operatives.  We have had to contend with that situation on many occasions, with large numbers of workers ignominiously dismissed with a week's or a fortnight's notice, thrown out on the unemployment scrapheap with no hope of other employment. That type of bad relationship should be done away with.  The Minister should strive to include in this measure or some other suitable instrument of Parliament a stipulation that so far as possible industry will be obliged to give adequate notice to workers and their trade unions so as to afford the unions and the workers an opportunity to take whatever steps may be necessary to ensure adequate compensation by redundancy payments and afford the workers an opportunity of getting alternative employment.</P>
    <P>These, Sir, are some of the sentiments we want to express on this Industrial Training Bill.  We would have preferred a different instalment of the manpower policy than this training measure.  We would have much preferred if the Parliamentary Secretary had brought into this House his redundancy payment scheme which would have the immediate effect of dealing with the problems of redundancy in all our constituencies, of which we know at the present time.</P>

      <P>I have seen the statement to which the Deputy refers.  I certainly do not accept that any general difficulty in obtaining ambulances gives rise to this situation. I am aware that persons suffering from minor injuries as a result of accidents may often be brought to hospital by car or other vehicle but in many such cases the services of an ambulance are not sought.  In any event, I consider that the percentage quoted is not a true reflection of the general position.  A survey conducted by my Department into the operation of the ambulance service on accident calls during a selected period of a fortnight showed that an ambulance was readily available to answer all but six of 430 calls received.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have on a number of occasion informed the House that I have the ambulance service continuously under review so as to ensure that it functions as effectively as possible.  At the <Col N="2059" /> beginning of this year, I asked health authorities to assign to chief medical officers general responsibility for the organisation and operation of the service. I consider that this arrangement will be shown to be to the benefit of the service.</P>
    <P>At the moment a small informal committee is reviewing the equipping of ambulances and the training of ambulance crews.  I am sure that further improvements in these aspects of the service will be achieved as a result of this review.</P>

If so, the answer to the first part of the question is in the affirmative. However, the deputation were not given the assurance referred to but were informed that their views would be considered sympathetically in conjunction with an examination of the arrangements for the supervision of boarded-out children and children at nurse being made in my Department.

Mental retardation is a disability for the purposes of this allowance scheme and I am not aware that any mentally <Col N="2066" /> retarded adults who may be eligible for this allowance have been refused it.</P>
      <P>I am also aware that, in general, mentally retarded adults kept in a mental home would have to be maintained at the expense of the State and local authority.  As regards such people maintained at home at the expense of near relatives, it is indicated in paragraph 112 of the recent White Paper on the Health Services that it is proposed to introduce an amendment to section 50 of the Health Act, 1953, so that, in assessing eligibility for a disabled persons allowance, account will be taken in future only of the means of husband or wife, and not of the income of other relatives.</P>

      <P>Cavan Vocational Education Committee has informed me that it intends to provide the common intermediate certificate course in all schools in County Cavan including Arva and Glangevlin as from 1st September. Certain amendments of its plans in regard to Arva and Glangevlin have now come to hand and are being considered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> Is the Minister aware that Cavan Vocational Education Committee consider it of the utmost importance that the common intermediate certificate course should be provided in Arva and Glangevlin so that the same standard of education may be provided in these schools as in the other schools in the county?  With that end in view, the committee submitted proposals to <Col N="2069" /> the Minister on 16th May last because they were notified that the educational grant for the county had been reduced by £4,587.  The committee asked the Minister to receive a deputation to discuss the provision of adequate accommodation and teachers in Arva and Glangevlin.  From that day to this, the Minister has not communicated with the committee or intimated his willingness to receive a deputation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to be too dogmatic about this but I think the Deputy is not correct in saying the last communication from the committee was in May and that there has been no further communication between the committee and my Department. Further, the figure quoted by the Deputy refers, I think, to the deficit which would occur in the committee's finances if they made no adjustments in their proposals.  They have been notified as to the amount that would be available and have been asked to arrange their plans and services for the financial year to come within that.  It does not follow automatically that unless they get the additional money, they cannot provide these services. They have to decide their priorities. This is a function of the committee having regard to their knowledge of their own locality.</P>
      <P>In regard to the two particular schools, they are, I think, two-room schools.  When they were originally sanctioned, I understand arrangements were made at that time that they would serve only as first year post-primary schools because of the proximity of other schools under another committee but geographically in the same region.  It is doubtful if a satisfactory post-primary course could be provided in schools of that size.  Therefore, it is not at all clear that the provision of courses of the standard required cannot be arranged by the committee with the facilities available to them.</P>

I would <Col N="2070" /> suggest to the Minister he is incorrect in saying that there is not a cut in the grant compared with last year, even without making provision for the common intermediate certificate course, of £4,587.  If the committee are to carry on, they will not alone not be able to proceed with any additional courses but will have to cut back their existing expenditure to the tune of £4,587.</P>

      <P>It is a very simple way out for people who are asked to cut their cloth according to their measure to say: &ldquo;We cannot do any more unless we get more money.&rdquo;  The more practical approach, and the one that would be desired by the general public, is that they would have a good, hard look at what has been expended, to see if it is really necessary.  If they have decided on priorities, are there things they want to provide which they think are higher on the priority list than what they have provided or can they provide what they have been doing on a more economical basis? My experience is that committees who have approached it in that way have found&mdash;sometimes to their surprise&mdash; that they can do considerably more than appeared to them to be possible at the beginning.</P>

      <P>In accordance with the procedure of considering each case on its merits, I have had the position in this area already investigated by three members of the inspectorate including an assistant chief inspector.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The schools mentioned by the Deputy are all one-teacher schools in the vicinity of Monaghan town.  There can be no question but that the educational interests of the children attending these schools would best be served by amalgamating the schools with Monaghan Model School, which is at present a three-teacher school.  The process of amalgamation will be a gradual one.  Free transport will, of course, be provided for the children and the Monaghan Model School premises will be suitably extended and renovated to accommodate them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>CIE have had under consideration for some time past the position in respect of the continuation of the services on the Waterford-Mallow railway line.  Normally, CIE could proceed in a matter of this kind by giving notice of intention to close the line under the powers vested in the Board by section 19 of the Transport Act, 1958.  Section 19 of that Act gave CIE full discretion in the closure of railway lines, subject to the Board, before terminating any service, satisfying itself that the service is uneconomic and that there is no prospect that it could be operated economically within a reasonable period.  I am advised, however, that a technical legal difficulty arises in relation to that part of the line between Waterford and Fermoy.  While the services on the line are operated wholly by CIE and the lines and works are maintained wholly by them, they are only part owners of the section from Waterford to Fermoy.  That section forms part of the undertaking of the Fishguard and Rosslare Railways and Harbours Company.</P>
      <P>CIE and British Railways are part owners of the Fishguard and Rosslare Company.  The undertaking is jointly worked, managed and maintained by CIE and British Railways under the provisions of certain old statutes dating back to 1898.  CIE are responsible for the services on the Irish side and British Railways are responsible for the services on the British side, including the shipping service between Fishguard and Rosslare.  In these circumstances, there is a legal doubt as to the applicability of section 19 of the Transport Act, 1958, to the Board's services on the lines of the Fishguard Company and it is considered necessary to remove that doubt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of my speech to the House on the second reading of the Transport Bill, 1964, I indicated that the Government had decided after very full consideration to preserve the <Col N="2080" /> railway system subject to such further concentration and reorganisation as might prove practicable and desirable. CIE have now advised me that they have carried out a detailed analysis of the cost of operating the rail services on the Waterford-Mallow line. They have found that the services are seriously uneconomic and they are satisfied that there is a clear case for making at an early date a final decision on whether to close the line. This situation obtains despite the fact that operating costs had been reduced by dieselisation.  CIE have had to order a number of replacement diesel locomotives this year and, if the line remains open, they will have to spend an extra £344,000 on additional replacement locomotives.  Apart form this capital saving, CIE estimate that a saving of £50,000 per annum would result from the withdrawal of rail services on the line and the provision of substitute road services where necessary.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill is intended to provide the necessary statutory power to enable the termination of train services on the lines of the Fishguard Company in this country as if they were services on the CIE railway system.  CIE will thus be empowered to terminate services on the Waterford-Mallow line, if they so decide.</P>
    <P>I would like to give Deputies some details of the line and of the services. The Waterford-Mallow line is approximately 76 miles long, all single track, with 14 intermediate stations.  The principal passenger service over the line is the Rosslare Express between Rosslare and Cork, which connects with the Fishguard-Rosslare passenger sailings.  During the summer timetable, the express operates twice daily from Cork on Mondays to Saturdays, twice daily from Rosslare Harbour on Tuesdays to saturdays and once daily from Rosslare Harbour on Sundays and Mondays.  During the winter timetable the express operates each way on three days a week.  In addition, there is one passenger service each way daily, except Sundays, between Waterford and Cork all the year round. This service also provides main line <Col N="2081" /> connections at Mallow and Waterford. For freight traffic there is one train each way daily between Waterford and Mallow.  The number of passengers joining and alighting daily per intermediate station on the line has been found to average between eight and nine.  The volume of freight traffic originating and terminating at these stations is relatively small and could be catered for by CIE with an addition to their road freight fleet of seven lorries and trailers.</P>

      <P>CIE have advised me that if the final investigation clearly indicates the need to close the line there would be no intention to withdraw the Rosslare Express service serving Waterford, Mallow and Cork.  This service would be diverted via Limerick Junction with 20 minutes increase in overall time for through passengers, who will still have the benefit of a through service without change of trains.  CIE are satisfied that this arrangement, together with the substitute road passenger services for the areas no longer served by rail, would provide an adequate substitute for the terminated services.  Substitute road freight services, based on Waterford and Mallow, would be provided for intermediate station traffic, and through freight traffic, Waterford-Mallow-Cork, would be diverted by rail via Limerick Junction.  CIE are satisfied that these measures would meet requirements adequately.  The number of additional road vehicles required by CIE for the substitute road passenger services is five single-deck buses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, I have, in recent months, stressed many times that CIE must live within the annual subsidy of £2 million for which provision <Col N="2082" /> was made by the Transport Act, 1964. If the railway system is to be preserved even in attenuated form, it is essential that CIE should continue to seek all possible ways and means of reducing losses.  The Board's costs continue to rise steadily due mainly to increases in salaries and wages and there are definite limits to the extent to which they can recover these losses by increases in fares and rates.  It is, therefore, clearly in the interests of the taxpayer and of the Board's employees and of the general public still relying on the Board's services that the Board should make a final decision on the possibility of cutting losses on uneconomic rail services which can readily be substituted by cheaper road services and, as in this particular case, by better utilisation of alternative railway lines.</P>
    <P>When the Bill was published, I received a deputation of the Deputies for the counties concerned.  I have requested the Chairman of CIE to arrange for either the Area Manager or some other executive officer at Headquarters to receive one representative deputation in order that the Board may hear the case for the retention of the line.  I should make it clear that in my experience over many years there is always a protest at almost any change made of this and other types but the Board of CIE will be able to make their final decision having evaluated the two conflicting sets of arguments.</P>
    <P>It has been the general experience of CIE that people in areas affected by rail closures have found that the alternative road services provided have proved a satisfactory substitute for the former rail services and over seven years I have had very few complaints of substance.</P>
    <P>I wish to make it clear that when CIE receive a deputation on the matter, there is one argument which I as Minister cannot accept.  I do not believe that a minor branch railway line whose major traffic can be carried on a parallel line has any prestige value whatever in a rural area.  If the line were to be closed provision would be made for redundant staff either by transfers of personnel or by payment of <Col N="2083" /> compensation in accordance with the provisions of the Transport Acts.</P>
    <P>I will now deal with other matters covered by the Bill.  While, as I have already indicated, CIE have a statutory obligation to work, manage and maintain that portion of the Fishguard Company's undertaking within the State, the undertaking still remains vested in the Fishguard Company.  It will be necessary to provide for the abandonment of the Waterford-Fermoy section of railway line by the Fishguard Company if the line is closed and the purpose of section 3 of the Bill is to give the company the same powers of abandonment as apply in the case of CIE.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Bill is designed to facilitate the disposal of the land of any abandoned railway line.  It will enable CIE to sell by private treaty cottages and land forming part of an abandoned railway system to the tenants of such property.  It will also enable CIE to include in the sale, where convenient, some additional land of the abandoned line in order, for example, to make the tenant's holding more attractive.  It will be noted that it is the intention that section 4 will be deemed to have come into operation on the 9th day of July, 1963.  The reason for this is that certain sales of this kind have already been made on the assumption that the position was covered by the powers given under section 18 (2) of the Transport Act, 1963, whereas in fact that section was not adequate for the purpose.</P>
    <P>The purpose of section 5 of the Bill is to provide for the more expeditious handling of disputes arising in regard to claims for redundancy compensation under transport legislation and so to avoid inconvenience to claimants.  As some Deputies are aware, there has already been delay in dealing with a number of claims.  I have considered how best to remedy this situation and I am advised that the most effective and expeditious remedy is to give claimants the right to apply to the Circuit Court to have their claims heard and determined.  Section 5 <Col N="2084" /> accordingly provides that claims, which have already been submitted to arbitration and which are not decided within three months of the passing of the Act, may be referred by either party to the dispute to the Circuit Court.  In the case of future claims the applicant will have the option of referring his case either to the Arbitrator or to the Circuit Court.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I was elected a Member of this House on 20th June, 1953, and since then, no legislation has been introduced that was so upsetting, annoying, discouraging or revolting to me as that which the Minister has presented to us now.  What the Minister proposes to do, among other things, is to close the railway line from Mallow to Waterford.  I would not mind if the Minister could give us figures to substantiate the claim that he has made of the economy which will flow from that action.  Since I became a Member of this House, I have always opposed the closing of railway lines, whether in West Cork, Kerry or Galway.  I intend to produce figures to the House which I would ask the Minister to disprove, if he can, when he is replying to the debate.</P>
      <P>The last published annual deficits were of the year 1962.  They revealed an annual loss of approximately £21,000 on the Mallow-Waterford line. That was a very low figure, representing £275 per mile.  Let us compare that £275 per mile with the figures for other railway lines.  The West Cork line which was closed was a line of 92 miles and the loss was £56,000 or £600 per mile.  The line in Valentia, Kerry, was 40 miles and the loss was £54,000 or £1,360 per mile.  The line in North Kerry is 70 miles.  I understand that the loss in that case is £35,000 per annum or £500 per mile. That line is still open.  Here we are talking about one of the most important parts of the country, from Mallow to Waterford and about closing a line on which there is a loss of £21,000 a year or £275 per mile.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was recently announced that two-thirds of the CIE bus routes and one-half of the CIE rail routes are unprofitable. <Col N="2085" /> I think the Minister will agree with those figures.  I do not know why the Minister should select for closure the Waterford-Mallow line, which serves such a large area and which is losing only £21,000 per annum representing only one per cent of the annual subsidy of £2 million to CIE. I do not know how the Minister arrived at that decision, as he obviously has. We realised when we were on a deputation to him recently that this line is to go.</P>
    <P>This loss of £21,000 per annum could be reduced by one-half very simply if proper economies were put into operation.  I wonder did CIE deliberately set out to show a loss on some of these lines?  I know there was a lot of repair work done on this line within the past year.  There was any amount of painting done in the stations from Mallow to Waterford.  I wonder if all this was not done to create a figure that the Minister or someone else could present to the House to show that the railway line was losing money?</P>
    <P>I am prepared to say that economies could be effected on this line and the loss cut by half.  I am also prepared to say that if there were a more determined effort, by a canvassing campaign, increased traffic could easily be got.  No such campaign was instituted and no effort was made as far as I know.  An effort could have been made to increase the passenger traffic on the Waterford end of the line.  As far as I know, no effort was made to make the passenger traffic a better paying and more effective proposition.</P>
    <P>I say these things because I believe we are in a cleft stick.  While this may be only an enabling Bill to allow the Minister to inform CIE that they may close these lines if they think they are not paying, what in actual fact we are doing today is sounding the death knell of the railway from Mallow to Waterford.  There are many good and cogent reasons why I personally could oppose that, but before going further, I should like to ask the Minister one question which he will perhaps answer when replying: would he tell us what was the agreement between British <Col N="2086" /> Railways and the Irish Government made back in, I think he said, 1898?  Would he also tell us the amount of compensation paid by the Irish Government to the British Government between then and now? These are very important figures which the House and the country would like to know.  Some people have mentioned a frightening figure of around £1 million as the amount paid to the British Government.  I do not say that is correct but we would like to know the facts and also if any compensation is to be paid as a result of the closure of the lines and the proposed closure now.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said the traffic is not heavy on this line.  I agree that it is not as heavy as we would like it to be.  The reason for the absence of traffic is the absence of heavy industries along the line from Waterford to Mallow.  Mallow, Fermoy, Tallow, Lismore, Cappoquin, Dungarvan and Kilmacthomas all have development associations and have been striving hard to attract heavy industries to their areas.  The closing of the Waterford-Mallow line will greatly inhibit their efforts.  I can speak personally about Fermoy.  In the brochures we issued in the hope of getting industrialists to come to our town, we say that we are on a railhead and have many suitable sites to offer.  I wonder if we shall have to recall all our brochures on Fermoy which have been sent all over the place and say that we no longer have a railhead there?</P>
    <P>I want to remind the Minister, and perhaps through him, CIE, that for the past year-and-a-half factories such as Cement Ltd., Nítrigin Teo., Gouldings Albatross and Waterford Iron-founders and many other big industries are utilising the railway line to a much greater extent than heretofore, not only for the carriage of raw materials for their factories but also for the distribution of their manufactured products. I can see evidence at Fermoy railway station that there is more traffic in the past year or two in regard to raw materials for factories and distribution of artificial fertilisers through it.  I am convinced that the Minister has no figures to show me what freight <Col N="2087" /> traffic there was at Fermoy for the past year and a half.  If he has and can quote them, I should certainly accept them but I should like to hear them.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke of passenger traffic and we agree that it is not as good as we should like it to be.  Again there are reasons for that.  Should there not be much more advertising regarding the facilities there are for travelling from Cork to Fishguard or <i>vice versa</i>?  I am glad to see the Lord Mayor of Cork here but I think many people in Cork city do not realise and are not told these travel facilities exist.  I think there has been a more or less deliberate attempt to keep that in the background.</P>
    <P>I made a note when the Minister was speaking that he proposed to have a few lorries, seven or eight, and five single-decker buses running between Mallow and Waterford.  I know the road from Mallow to Ballyduff only too well.  That is about halfway. Deputy Kyne knows the remainder of the road.  I wonder what the Minister means when he says this can be serviced by seven or eight trucks and five single-decker buses.  I invite the Minister to meet me in Mallow and drive to Ballyduff, either in his State car or in my car, and he will see the risks one incurs along that corkscrew road for about 30 miles.  Corkscrew is the only description that fits it.  I wonder, just to take that road as far as the Waterford-Cork boundary at Ballyduff, how it will be made right for the seven or eight lorries and five single-decker buses.  Before CIE make any decision or meet any deputation &mdash;which he assures us they are prepared to do&mdash;regarding the closure of this line, I am offering an open invitation to the Minister to drive from Ballyduff to Waterford with me and I shall show him exactly the situation that has to be met.</P>
    <P>That brings me to another point. Naturally this road must be improved if it is as bad as I contend it is.  The road from Mallow to Waterford must be improved to such an extent that I believe it will <Col N="2088" /> cost an enormous sum of money.  I think we told the Minister on a deputation that we already had two meetings in Dungarvan in connection with the proposed closure of this line. The meetings were representative of all sections and all political Parties and were conducted most sensibly. Deputy McAuliffe was present at one of those meetings.  I do not see him here now but he may come in later. I remember him asking what it would cost to improve this road from Mallow to Ballyduff, approximately 30 miles of corkscrew road.  It was reported to us that it would cost at least £3,000 a mile to make even a decent job of it.  Where do we go from there? Naturally the Cork, Waterford and Tipperary county councils have something to say about this.  From my experience of West Cork members on Cork County Council and of all the promises that were made before the West Cork line was closed and of the money that was supposed to be forthcoming to straighten the road from Castletownbere and of how crooked it still is even though that was some years ago&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>There is inconvenience and jerking and turning and switching at Limerick Junction.  It involves a lot more time.  Even if it goes by Limerick Junction, is it not cutting out Lismore, Mallow and Fermoy?  I suggest it is the biggest consideration here today. We should be practical about the enormous bill the ratepayers and the Department of Local Government have to meet for the building of the <Col N="2089" /> new road from Mallow to Waterford. At an estimated cost of £2,000 a mile, I think the £21,000 per annum we are talking about here is a mere bagatelle compared with the cost of repairing and making a decent road there.</P>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that there is a social as well as an economic side to the railway?  I have always contended that the social is much more important than the economic side.  I have already told the House about the economics, as far as I know them. The closure of this line will cost only one per cent of the subsidy to CIE of £2 million per annum.  The economics of it are small but I contend that the social side is much more important. I do not want to hazard a guess as to what might happen if all the traffic is taken off this railway.</P>
      <P>Experience has taught us over the past few years that, with increased traffic on our highways and roadways, the death rate on the roads is appallingly high.  I do not want to say that the closing of this line will make it anything worse but I should be less than realistic if I did not say it is most likely to make it worse.</P>
      <P>From the social side, I think we also have a duty to the people.  I think that a journey of over one hour by bus is a bit too much.  Anything over one hour's travel should be done by rail. Would the Minister not agree?</P>

      <P>Likewise, there are no luggage facilities.  In Fermoy, we think of our people and families who have had to emigrate to England and our hope is that when they arrive at Rosslare for a holiday, they can come back to Mallow in some kind of comfort and when they are leaving us to return to England, we like to see them depart in some kind of comfort.</P>
      <P>I have said that, in my time, this is one of the most revolting and annoying pieces of legislation I have met in this House.  According to the Minister, everything in the garden is rosy.  The people I represent in North-East Cork, and particularly the people of my native town of Fermoy, who have had this railway system for so many years, who lost all they had in their fight for freedom, will now lose the only bit of pride that was left in this town by the proposal to take the railway from them.  I want to register an emphatic protest that any Minister of this State or any CIE group should propose to do such a thing.</P>
      <P>I have been a Member of this House for 13 years and I have never before had occasion to become annoyed with any Minister, official or Deputy on any side of the House.  I am speaking today for the interests of the people of Fermoy, in particular, and I assure the Minister that the closing of this line is a most retrograde step.  He has many friends in Fermoy.  On their behalf, I ask him to have second thoughts before he allows this Bill to go through the Dáil.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCasey" hpid="Mr. Casey Mr. Casey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Casey</NameTxt>
      <P>For the second or third time in recent weeks, it has been my task to expound the policy of the Labour Party on transport matters.  I was quite disappointed, the week before last, when the Taoiseach gave a clear indication to the House, speaking on a Labour Party amendment, that it appeared that we had a personal vendetta against the present Minister for Transport and Power.  I took that remark as being directed towards me because, in my ordinary duties as a Deputy of the Labour Party, I am the Deputy charged with <Col N="2091" /> examining transport legislation and with making as constructive criticism as I can.</P>
      <P>I should like to start off by saying that I hope the Minister does not feel that anything I have to say or have said in the past in relation to transport legislation will be regarded as a personal vendetta against him, although I will say, straight away, that I think he is the most disastrous Minister for Transport and Power we could have.</P>
      <P>The Bill now before us appears harmless enough.  It is short.  The main section concerns the closing down of the branch line from Mallow to Rosslare.  The Minister will not get an easy passage with this Bill.  The Labour Party will oppose it as strongly as we can.  We oppose it on principle. In this Bill, we see the political philosophy of the Minister for Transport and Power in respect of public transport. It must be abundantly clear that the Minister for Transport and Power does not believe in nationalised transport. As far as I can see, he believes in a liberalisation, in a free-for-all, cut-throat competition between the private hauliers.  I hope I am not doing the Minister a disservice when I say that I feel one of his chief ambitions must be to see, ultimately, the folding-up of public transport in all its spheres &mdash;road passenger, road freight and rail.</P>
      <P>What confuses the ordinary Deputy like myself is the effort one has to make to reconcile the apparent attitude of the present holder of the portfolio of Transport and Power with the attitude of the present Taoiseach who guided very enlightened transport legislation through this House.  Naturally I do not know what happens at Cabinet meetings but I am entitled to suspect that not alone the Taoiseach but several other members of the Cabinet must be at variance with the ultra-conservative, pre-Victorian policy of the Minister for Transport and Power in relation to these matters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Casey</NameTxt>
      <P>Right; I bow to your ruling, Sir.  I take it I may refer to the section which refers to the Waterford-Rosslare line.  Again, this baffles me because one Minister gets up at some chamber of commerce meeting and says that he has great plans for Waterford, that it is going to be a growth centre, that it is going to be highly industrialised and that there is to be harbour development there, and while he is saying that, his colleague, the Minister for Transport and Power, is in the process of closing down the railway into the place.  We feel that at some stage the various Ministers might come together and correlate their aims and objectives and put a clear picture before the Dáil and the country in this regard.</P>
      <P>I do not know, and I do not expect the Minister to inform me, what confidential information he got from CIE before he decided to close the branch line concerned but I will challenge him in this regard.  From sources of information available to me, I understand that the commercial section of CIE made a strong recommendation against the closure of this line and that it was the operative section of CIE who made the contrary recommendation which apparently has been accepted by the Minister at the behest of certain people who have vested interests in the particular area, as far as transport is concerned.  I could be very much more specific but I think even in my vagueness the penny will drop with the Minister and that he will know what I am talking about.</P>
      <P>I hope in his reply to this debate he will clear up, once and for all, whether or not the various sections, the executive sections of CIE, were unanimous in their recommendation to the Minister, or whether there was a hurly-burly amongst them in which the fittest carried the day by a slender majority.  The people about whom Deputy Barry speaks, and the people whom Deputy Kyne represents in that constituency, must suffer as a result of this decision by a certain pinhead who happens to be engaged in the service of CIE.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should also like the Minister to clarify another point.  I do not want <Col N="2094" /> to make any political capital out of the retirement of the Chairman of CIE, Dr. Andrews.  Enough has been said about that.  However, I should like to know if it is true that the Chairman of CIE felt it incumbent upon himself to offer his resignation for the reason that he was charged by legislation passed in this House to carry out a certain public transport policy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
      <P>I must admit there is disappointment in my area.  While this Bill does not actually close this line, it does give CIE authority to close it if they think fit.  I attended the meeting to protest against the decision to close this line.  The representative of the Junior Chamber of Commerce expressed the view of the traders in Dungarvan: his members were of opinion that they had more or less to agree with the attitude of CIE because of the small amount of traffic carried on the line.  Excluding Waterford and Mallow, only 14 lbs to 16 lbs per day was the average total from all the other stations.  While it is appreciated that the line is not economic from a commercial point of view, the feeling is that it <Col N="2097" /> should be retained from the social point of view.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Barry that economies could be effected.  I should like to give an example.  There is a crossing-gate just outside the town of Dungarvan.  In the cottage at that gate, there was an ex-CIE pensioner and his daughter.  He died, and his pension died with him.  The daughter was allowed to remain on in the cottage and she was asked to open and close the gates.  I approached the local area manager to get some remuneration for her and he informed me that, in no circumstances, could any payment be made to her.  That was the legal position.  She had to vacate the house in order to find some position elsewhere to enable her to maintain herself. I am told it now costs something in the region of £12 per week to have someone opening and closing these gates.  The railwaymen come out from Dungarvan station to open and close them.  I am sure this lady would have been satisfied with £2 per week and the house, but CIE could not see their way to permitting this.</P>

      <P>If this line is closed redundant staff will either have to be transferred or receive compensation. Now this is one particular aspect of the Bill upon which I should like the Minister to be clear.  Workers on this line from Waterford to Mallow will probably lose their employment.</P>
      <P>A good deal of capital has been made about the road from Waterford to Mallow.  Deputy Barry put a question to the county engineer in Waterford as to the cost and he estimated that it would cost £500,000 to realign the road.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamKenneally" hpid="Mr. Kenneally Mr. Kenneally">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a large sum but this realignment would have been necessary in any case.  Its urgency is accentuated, I admit, because of the increase in heavy traffic.  The road from Waterford to Dungarvan is in reasonably good condition.  It is a good wide road.  A good deal of money has <Col N="2098" /> been spent on it.  The road from Dungarvan to Mallow is definitely bad. Traffic will be rerouted through Clonmel and the people at the protest meeting were of the opinion that the money spent on the roads could be and should be used to subsidise the line.  I do not agree with that.  The road would have to be repaired, even if the line were never closed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatHogan" hpid="Mr. P. Hogan (South Tipperary) Mr. P. Hogan (South Tipperary)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(South Tipperary)</i>: I suppose this Bill would never have come before us, were it not for the fact that it is tied up with cross-Channel interests.  The standard argument in relation to the closing down of lines is economy.  The Minister says keeping the line open would mean a capital expenditure of £344,000.  The line is running at a loss of £50,000 per annum at the moment.  He does not elaborate on whether that capital expenditure might not in time cut down the annual loss.  Presumably the feeling is that it would not.  In view of the fact that many other sections of railway line are running on an insolvent basis, I should like to know why this particular section was picked on at this particular time.  Was it the most insolvent section?  Are there others more insolvent?  If so, why are they being retained and this particular section closed down?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When speaking about the annual loss, the Minister did not advert to the burden which closure will place upon other sources of money.  It is obvious that if traffic is diverted from a branch railway, the Department of Local Government and, more important, the local ratepayers, will have to meet an added burden in so far as they will have to provide improved roads.  Deputy Barry mentioned a figure of £250,000 as required to put the Mallow-Waterford road into a reasonable state of repair.  I know sections of this road. It is, as he describes it, a very difficult, winding road.  It will require much improvement as regards bends.  Those of us who serve on local bodies know that the most expensive kind of work you can have on local roads is realignment. Apart from the immediate expenditure, there will be increased maintenance costs which the ratepayers of Cork and Waterford will have to <Col N="2099" /> meet.  Deputy Barry gave the figure of £3,000 per mile.  I do not know what the exact mileage of road is between Mallow and Waterford but it is probably 70 or 80 miles.  That would amount to a considerable sum, a large proportion of which will fall on the backs of the ratepayers in Waterford and Cork.</P>
    <P>The Minister has told us he will provide an alternative but somewhat longer railway route via Limerick Junction and that he will supplement that with four or five single deck buses and seven or eight lorries.  He has stated that the average passenger rate is eight or nine per day and that there is one freight train daily.  I am not in a position to say whether that auxiliary type of service will adequately compensate for what he is removing, but I have serious misgivings on the point.</P>
    <P>I am particularly interested in this from the point of view of West Waterford which is now part of the constituency of South Tipperary.  It would seem to me this is going to be a considerable disservice to the people of Lismore, Cappoquin, Tallow, and Kilmacthomas areas, all in West Waterford. In fact, they are being by-passed and cut off from rail communication with the port of Waterford.  My second interest in the matter is the question of redundancy and unemployment which inevitably arise when these branch railways are shut down.  It is a simple matter to discuss it academically in the Dáil, but it is a very serious matter for the unfortunate man and his family who happen to be so affected, particularly if he is past middle age.</P>
    <P>We have been told that Waterford is to be developed as an industrial centre, something on the lines of the Shannon Airport development centre. Waterford is named as a potential industrial growth centre for the future. At present the Port Commissioners in Waterford are trying to raise a large amount of money to modernise the port for container traffic.  They have been to various public authorities asking them to act as guarantors and indeed to give them for the first five years interest-free loans in order to develop <Col N="2100" /> their port.  They have been to South Tipperary, Kilkenny and Wexford trying to tie them up with Waterford Corporation and Waterford County Council so as to develop and improve the facilities in the port, particularly for future container traffic.  The shutting down of this branch railway, particularly going through the areas of Lismore, Cappoquin and Tallow, is hard to reconcile with the very worthy effort being made by the Port Commissioners in Waterford to improve the facilities offered in the port.  I appreciate the Minister's difficulty from the point of view of a branch railway which is insolvent; but he has many such branches on his hands.  I would feel there must be other branches at which he could have cast his pickaxe rather than single out the West Waterford or Mallow-Waterford section.</P>
    <P>I was surprised at the statement made by Deputy Casey that there was a conflict of interest between the commercial section of CIE and other sections and that vested interests prevailed. I wish he had elaborated on it.  If there is anything to it, he should have done so.  It raises queer doubts in the mind of anybody listening.  I do not know what significance to attach to it.  Every Deputy who speaks on this knows he is beaten before he starts.  We know that when the axe was sharpened for any local branch line, it has always fallen.  I am not aware of any line being saved by any effort made by public representatives on any side of the House.  It would seem inevitable that once the administrative section of our semi-autonomous CIE Board make up their minds they are going to close down a particular section, it comes about.  I would ask the Minister to consider this branch line, particularly in connection with the projected improvement and development now being undertaken for Waterford port.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>I was particularly struck by the fact that the Minister in his speech paid scant attention to the part British Railways have to play in the introduction of this Bill.  He did not indicate whether corresponding legislation has to be passed in the <Col N="2101" /> British Parliament; nor did he say that it would not have to be passed or whether the British Parliament had any interest in the matter at all.  He did not tell us if any effort had been made by British Railways to induce CIE to shut down the section of the line in which they are mainly interested, that portion from Fermoy to Waterford city and right through to Rosslare.  A definite case could be made for this if it was suggested it was done by a British Railway company to save loss.  Then the discussion would be of considerable interest and we could ask what return was got out of this line by a British company, a line that was built on guarantees by the citizens of Waterford and neighbouring counties.  Is it not because of the altered circumstances of a changing world that a loss is accruing and that they are cutting their losses and getting out?  I ask the Minister if that is true?</P>
      <P>What significance was there in the Minister's complete ignoring of the fact that British Railways have an interest in this line?  I understand that while we can refuse to run trains on the line, we cannot sell a single house on it without the consent of British Railways and that some of our sales of houses which have already taken place are completely illegal.  This Bill now legalises what was done by CIE over a number of years.  That does not commend itself to anyone who might think that the officers of CIE are a responsible body of men who would make no hasty decisions.  Something must have gone wrong somewhere along the line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill does not close the line&mdash; it is an enabling Bill&mdash;but we all know in our hearts that it would not be brought in here unless it was in the minds of the responsible officials of CIE that this line is to be cut out.  The Minister pointed out in his opening speech that he would see to it that some senior officers of CIE would meet any deputation that would go to them on the matter.  There is a deputation already in formation awaiting the passage of this Bill in order to attempt to influence the staff of CIE, whether they be the headquarters men <Col N="2102" /> or the area manager.  I would prefer it to be the board of directors that they should meet because it is the board of directors who will come to a decision on the matter.</P>
    <P>In the case of the closing of the Tramore line, it was the board of directors who made the decision, even though the officials advised them. Getting the area manager in Waterford to meet the local inhabitants is not good enough.  They should be entitled to see the people this House puts there.  These directors were appointed by this House and they have an obligation to this House, and we should be able to get from them the facts and figures of this closure.</P>
    <P>In other cases where railway lines were closed, information was given to me after the closure which, if I had had it before the line was closed, would have placed me in a much better position to argue against the closure.  Unfortunately, when you meet these officials in CIE, they have all the facts and figures at their fingers' ends and the ordinary public representative or business man is forbidden to get any information from stationmasters or anybody else.  The only facts we can get are those given to us unofficially because stationmasters have been warned not to supply information that would help to build up a case that the line was not losing money.</P>
    <P>I know that in the case of the Tramore line, the loss was claimed to be £5,000.  Waterford Corporation and Waterford County Council agreed to put up that loss plus certain increases in fares but the line was torn up at one minute past midnight on 1st April, which was the operative date.  It was torn up in the middle of the night because they were so anxious to get rid of it.  I presume the same will be done when the operative date comes in connection with this line.</P>
    <P>I know, and every responsible Deputy knows, that this is a vital matter for the people of Waterford and for the people employed on the line. It is vital for the tourist industry, for our relatives and friends who come home each year and bring their children with them at great inconvenience and <Col N="2103" /> expense.  They would now be supposed to travel from Waterford to Midleton, or on to Cork city, by bus and without toilet facilities.  How could a woman with a baby in arms undertake that type of journey after having travelled from Paddington to Fishguard and then on to Waterford?  How could such a woman then get into a bus and travel on to Midleton or perhaps further on?</P>
    <P>I do not think this is good enough. The people in my constituency do not think it is good enough.  We feel that in this Bill the Minister is doing a disservice to my constituency and to the constituency of South Tipperary.  A list of the towns affected was read out by the Minister at the request of Deputy Dillon but a considerable number of people are affected as well as these towns.  In Lismore, Tallow and Kilmacthomas, serious efforts are being made to attract industry.  There are development associations there which have advertised in German and American papers and they have entertained industrialists from Britain, Germany, France and other countries.  One of the first questions they are asked is: &ldquo;What railway link have you with Waterford port?&rdquo;  From this on we will have to say: &ldquo;None at all.  You will have to travel by road.&rdquo;  That is wrong.  This industrial estate being set up in Waterford is a good thing.  Our town clerks and those who attended a planning conference in the Custom House only a couple of months ago were told there would be offshoots of this industrial estate all over the county and that we would come into the picture. How are we going to come into the picture if we are to be cut off from the cheapest method of travelling?  I see this as a deliberate effort to weaken West Waterford.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would be able to answer the question: is the Cork-Youghal line less profitable than the Mallow-Rosslare line?  I challenge the Minister to produce proof that our line is less profitable than the Cork-Youghal line.  The Cork-Youghal line was to be axed&mdash;I am glad it was not&mdash;but there were deputations trying to keep it from being closed and the Cork-Youghal line continues.  Even though <Col N="2104" /> the Minister says he has no function in this regard, the Minister has a function when it becomes a dangerous political situation.  I would suggest that the Fianna Fáil Deputies representing South Tipperary and Waterford should assert themselves in somewhat the same manner as the Fianna Fáil Deputies asserted themselves in a neighbouring constituency and county.</P>
    <P>I find it very difficult to work out the average the Minister gave of eight passengers per station.  It is true that some of our stations are not stations in the sense of being tourist stops; they are really halts to pick up creamery produce, cattle or something like that. If you measure up the stations that really would be effective between Waterford and Fermoy, you would find there are four or five stations that could be considered in the working out of an average daily discharge or intake of passengers; then the average would shoot up from eight per station to something like 30 per station, which is a vastly different figure.  Deputy Barry gave some figures in regard to the traffic rate per mile, of which I also have a copy, but it is pointless to repeat them. I challenge the Minister to deny that there are lines in existence in Ireland at the present moment which are costing much more per mile to maintain than the line it is now proposed to close down.  If so, why is the Waterford line chosen as the target?</P>
    <P>I do not believe that the assessment of seven buses, five lorries and a couple of trailers would take the hundreds and hundreds of tons of beet arriving at Dungarvan station during the beet season.  Thousands of tons are sent to Mallow, and that will have to go by road.  Deputy Hogan and Deputy Barry gave some figures in respect of the cost of (1) preparing the road for it and (2) maintaining it.  In respect of the section of the road in Waterford, our engineer put the cost at £500,000, plus a cost of £10,000 per year for increased maintenance due to the closure of the line.  This is hardly economy, when the Minister for Local Government will have to give £500,000 and the ratepayers and taxpayers will have to provide another £10,000 per year for that portion that is in <Col N="2105" /> Waterford, plus the figure for South Tipperary and portion of Cork.</P>
    <P>Apart from this being false economy, we are depriving the people of West Waterford, South Tipperary and parts of Cork of a social amenity. People who in their thousands used to go by train to football matches will now have to go by road.  The GAA people should have an interest in this because when teams like Waterford and Tipperary or Waterford and Cork are playing, the rail service is essential because to travel to Thurles, you have to go down to Waterford, back around by Clonmel and on to Thurles. Furthermore, for the tourist trade and also for the beet trade it is absolutely essential to keep the railway line.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barry suggested that some economies could be made.  I do not know a great deal about how economies could be made because I have never worked in the railway service, but it seems ridiculous to me that a train should leave Waterford in the morning to go to Dungarvan and a bus should leave within ten or 15 minutes of the train.  The roadway runs practically parallel with the railway line, and the bus and the train run the same way at about the same time instead of running in opposite directions to serve the interests of the people.  If that is not crazy, I do not know anything at all about commonsense. I remember that in 1926&mdash;that is a long time ago&mdash;you could leave my town of Dungarvan at 7.45 a.m., get on to a passenger freight train that came from Rosslare, reach Waterford at 9.30 a.m. and then transfer to a train that reached Dublin at 12.5 or 12.10 p.m.  Now, 40 years later, you leave at 9.45 a.m. and arrive at Kingsbridge, after travelling twice the round via Mallow, and so on, at 3.15 p.m. That is surely not progress.</P>
    <P>Something should be done to make the railway more attractive.  A great deal of the falling off, outside of that which is natural because of road traffic changes and more people having cars, could be arrested if people were encouraged to use the railway.  I want to join with my colleagues in the Opposition&mdash;because I am afraid I <Col N="2106" /> cannot say the same for my colleagues on the Government side, although I would be quite sure they agree with me&mdash;in deploring the closing of the railway line, and I want to protest emphatically against its closure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to take this opportunity of expressing my thanks publicly to the Minister for Transport and Power for the courtesy which he afforded Members of this House and Members of the Seanad for the area concerned in receiving a deputation in regard to the proposed closure of this line.  I know it was not the practice, but, due to the extraordinary circumstances of this case, an exception was made.  Certainly the Minister by his very forceful arguments, unfortunately, gave us very little leeway whereby to save the railway line for this important section of my constituency, West Waterford.  One argument was that the second lowest rate of goods and passenger traffic obtained on this line.  I wonder would the Minister, in some altruistic mood, consider retaining it on that ground?  If the line with which it is competing were closed, then it would be the lowest paying line in Europe and might therefore be a tourist attraction.</P>
      <P>From the more mundane point of view, the most cogent argument for trying to retain this line is that West Waterford is a depressed area industrially but in recent times mining and drilling operations have taken place and it is not beyond expectation and, indeed, it is the fervent hope of most of us that some great good may result from these operations and we could possibly see an expansion in industry similar to what has taken place in Gortdrum or Tynagh.  Should that be the case, then it would be imperative to have a railway line in the immediate vicinity of the mines and certainly traversing that portion of the county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those who are familiar with West Waterford know that, while some of the roads are excellent, many roads are narrow or hemmed in by the river on one side and the tremendous cliffs that overhang on the other side.  This precludes any real development of roads in the modern concept.  Therefore, when the Minister states that five trucks plus <Col N="2107" /> trailers will serve adequately the present needs, as possibly they would, that would not be at all sufficient for the potential that is there if the mining operations prove successful.  There is no ground to believe that they will not be successful because in Tallow up to 60 years ago mining was carried out as a reality and were it not for the fact that it became uneconomic with the machinery then in operation, might still be carried on there.</P>
    <P>The tourist potential of West Waterford has never been fully exploited. There is the Blackwater Valley and the scenic beauty of Lismore which have as yet remained virtually untapped. With the greater drive by Bord Fáilte and organisations such as SKAL, West Waterford will come into its own.  The airport at Cork has made it very easy for people to fly from the Continent or Great Britain to Cork and then go by rail to West Waterford and the towns of Tallow, Lismore and Cappoquin.</P>
    <P>There are other grounds for the retention of a railway, despite the fact that it may not be paying at present. There are social grounds.  The welfare of the employees whose whole life has been built up on the railway system must be considered.  They are a class apart.  Many of them would be unemployable in any other walk of life. It has been traditional with them to be railway workers and to be employed on the permanent way.  There is possibly some merit in every cause and I am sure the farmers whose lands are traversed by the railway line would welcome its closure because a railway line going through any farm is a serious hazard and grave inconvenience but I feel the farmers concerned would forgo and forsake any advantage that might accrue to them personally if the greater good of the vast majority of the community were at stake.  It is on that ground that I would ask the Minister to consider the postponement of this Bill or, if that is not possible, to make it implicit that the Board of CIE and British Railways will not close this line for at least five years to give every possible and conceivable opportunity for the development of <Col N="2108" /> West Waterford in the industrial or mining spheres.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that this Bill is not a Bill to close the line but rather a Bill to give power to CIE and British Railways to do so.  If this were a completely cut and dried case of closing the line, it would not have come before the House.  CIE have power to do so of their own accord.  I travelled to Dungarvan some Saturdays ago and representatives of Cork, Tipperary, Waterford, both east and west, were vehement in their argument that the railway should be retained.  Having listened to Deputy Kyne, I can see very good reasons for its retention.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hogan referred to the development of Waterford Harbour. At times the devil can quote Scripture for his own purposes.  Last Monday Deputy Hogan was not too keen on the further development of Waterford Harbour.  If today he thinks differently, I say more power to him.</P>
    <P>The Minister has given his blessing to the Waterford Harbour project.  The development of Waterford Harbour will expand beyond the normal conception of people here the potential not alone of Waterford city but of all the outlying districts such as Kilkenny, South Tipperary and West Waterford. Its development will become a real factor within the next four or five years.  This must of necessity bring a bigger volume of business to the harbour of West Waterford.  If the lifeline of the harbour is cut off even to one degree, it will hinder the development of the harbour and much of the money being spent on this development will be somewhat wasted if we cannot avail of every opportunity of furthering the interests not merely of Waterford Harbour in its new form but also of West Waterford.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that the Minister is on the horns of a dilemma in this matter. He has been told, on the one hand, that the line does not pay and, on the other, that we wish to have it retained.  He, possibly, is not the best person to judge but certainly his advisers would be able to view the position more dispassionately than we can.</P>
    <P>If this matter goes to a vote, I may <Col N="2109" /> have to vote with the Minister while my heart and sympathy are with the people of West Waterford.</P>

      <P>I would ask the Minister to view seriously the grave effect the closure of this line will have on many of the people in West Waterford where employment is not too plentiful. If many of the people at present employed on the line are redundant, they will find it more than difficult to find alternative employment.  On that ground, the line more than justifies itself.  People who have given a lifetime of service, not merely to CIE but to its predecessor, will find themselves thrown on the scrapheap prematurely. I would ask the Minister, if at all possible, to give further assistance, and the benefit of the doubt, in having the line retained for the next five years.</P>
      <P>I know that CIE can be very liberal in their promises prior to the closure of any line.  In Cashel we had a rather unfortunate experience when a branch line was closed and when a deputation of local business interests and members of the UDC were met graciously by CIE personnel, they were promised that there would be no diminution of service.  We found first that the depot they established was withdrawn after a number of years and we were told then that Goolds Cross would no longer be our railhead, that it was moved to Thurles with a daily service from there.  This has been withdrawn and we now find we have a three day service coming into operation in Cashel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the type of treatment CIE wish to mete out to those less fortunate than others in being precluded from <Col N="2110" /> being on paying lines.  Practically no rail service in the world pays but it provides a social service in many fields and one that must be maintained because instead of spending vast sums of money in developing roads where it is possible to develop them&mdash;in this particular area it is virtually impossible to improve many of them because you are hindered by rivers and the terrain, &mdash;why not maintain the permanent way that already exists and gives fruitful employment to many and would be of immense value for further development and even provide the hope of development for a depressed area?</P>
    <P>I again ask the Minister to give every possible benefit of doubt to Waterford and the line between Waterford and Mallow.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Davern has a perfect way of keeping this line open. He knows how narrow is the Government's majority in the House and he can vote with us on this measure and by so doing, ensure that this line will remain open not only for five years but for many years to come.  I am perfectly satisfied that if there was an aggressive advertising programme carried out by CIE they could attract more people to the railways, both as passengers and as people wishing to convey goods by rail.  It is apparent that for years CIE have been deliberately avoiding spending money on railways. I have posed this problem to the House and to the Minister and received evasive replies, but we know that in the Dublin region CIE carries next to no advertising whatever to attract people to Dublin suburban railways.  In seacoast towns adjacent to Dublin, numerous shop windows have posters advertising the times of CIE buses but there is no notice of this kind in respect of the railways except at the railway station outside the towns.  I understand that a similar negative approach operates in the Waterford-Mallow region and I am reasonably satisfied that if CIE carried out an aggressive advertising programme, they could attract to the railway in that region sufficient traffic in passengers and goods to overcome the deficit of £50,000 which the Minister, through the advisory information he has received <Col N="2111" /> from CIE, now suggests is the annual loss on this line.  I doubt if in the calculation of that figure CIE gave credit for the profit which they earn on the express service from Rosslare and the stations on that line.</P>
      <P>We had experience in Dublin of CIE carrying on the same biased accountancy of taking away from a line the overall elements of profitability and pinning on that line only the losses.  The kind of statement the Minister produced here today is utterly inadequate and grossly insufficient.  I think it is an insult to this House. I do not for a moment accept the selected material we are presented with by the Minister for Transport and Power whenever he tries to justify the cutting down of railway or transport services of any kind.  I do not accuse him of telling untruths but I do accuse him of not telling the truth because again and again we have had this selected material presented to us.  How can the 144 Members of the House give a sensible, mature and well-considered judgment on this matter when the only figure they get is that there is an average of between eight and nine people boarding or alighting daily at intermediate stations on this line?  Apparently we ought to visualise some peculiar human factor of 8½ persons joining the rail service at 14 different stations and on this basis decide that the railway should be closed.  It is time the Minister stopped insulting the House and treated it as it deserves.  It may well be that these closure proposals should go to a special Committee of the House who would then go into the figures.  The Deputies from the Cork, Waterford and Tipperary regions could sit in Committee and be able to send for people who would give the correct facts and figures which they would then be able to test against their own knowledge and experience.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is before the House because CIE have not got power to close this line.  That is why he is <Col N="2112" /> here: he says so in his introductory statement and we know that is the position.  We are now being asked as a sovereign Parliament to decide whether or not this line should be closed and whether or not we should give CIE power to close it.  We are entitled to count every nut and bolt on the Waterford-Mallow line and consider everything and keep this House going for months while we do it and there is nothing the Minister could do about it.  We have not deputed CIE to close this line and that is why the Minister is here today.</P>
      <P>Deputy Barry expressed the view that long-distance travel by bus is not the best form of travelling and the Minister accused him of being Victorian. Recently I had what was probably an unusual experience for a member of this House, the experience of travelling for five hours in a CIE bus.  I would not wish the journey on my worst enemy but it was an enlightening experience.  So far as the bus was concerned, its movement and vibrations were sufferable, but what was quite insufferable was that the passengers were expected to sit for five hours as if they were in the stocks. There were far too many seats, 43 seats, and never more than 13 passengers who had to endure the journey in most uncomfortable positions with insufficient leg room and incorrectly designed seats.  My own experience was that when I awoke on the following day I had aches and pains which did not leave my back for some days afterwards. If that is what the Minister regards as the success of travel by bus in 2000 A.D. the sooner we go back to Victorian days of horse-drawn transport the better.  At least people were not so cramped then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To suggest, as the Minister does, that this is an alternative way to travel the journey is quite ludicrous.  Very many people are physically unable to endure the suffering I was called upon to endure on that journey.  It is not good enough for CIE to provide that kind of service and regard it as an adequate substitute.  As Deputy Barry also mentioned, no toilet facilities are provided for travellers by bus.  On the particular journey I undertook, there <Col N="2113" /> was a break half-way through.  A selection of toilet facilities was offered by CIE.  One set of these, which was clearly indicated with a sign, was locked.  The other set was available, provided one was prepared to queue in a queue of persons of different sexes, directly in off the small waiting-room in a bus station.  That is grossly insufficient. If the Minister is asking this House and the country in general to abolish rail services and to accept long-distance bus services in substitution, it is imperative that CIE pay the capital cost of providing proper toilet and other facilities along the route.  If they are unable to provide them in the conveyance itself, then they ought to be provided along the route, and until such time as they are prepared to undertake that responsibility, they should be refused power to close any more railways, be they in Waterford, Cork or Tipperary.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that the Minister, although he seeks additional power to close down railways, makes no attempt to show the social cost of removing the railway amenities from the community. This skill of measuring the social cost has been advanced greatly in recent years and there are very many people who can show how, apart from the direct financial book-keeping of an undertaking, other matters can be affected.  I should like to think that the Minister would look to these factors.  It may be that, on the Board of CIE, there is a specific obligation to keep within certain financial bounds but the community and the Members of this House are justified in seeing to it that they will look not merely to the balance sheet of a particular stretch of railway line but to the social cost of removing the rail services.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies&mdash;Deputies Barry, Deputy P. Hogan and others&mdash; have mentioned the tremendous inconvenience which will be imposed on families wishing to use this line to travel home for annual holidays from Britain.  The Minister is also supposed to be concerned with tourism.  From my actual experience of families living in Dublin whose relations are living down the country, I know that some of <Col N="2114" /> these families used to travel by rail for annual holidays to their home farm when the railways existed.  Since the rails have been ripped up in different parts of the country, the parents are unable to visit their homes annually because of the fatigue involved in bringing their families by a series of different transport conveyances.  Also, the delays involved in travelling partly by rail and partly by bus are such as to make it extremely awkward for people to travel as they did heretofore. I am talking of my experience and knowledge of people from the country who are living in Dublin.  I have no doubt that other people resident in Dublin are put off from travelling home to the country because of the ripping-up of railways, while people in Britain, be they Irish coming home on holiday or English families thinking of coming over here, will be discouraged by the ripping-up of railways in the manner proposed in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I was surprised to hear Deputy Davern's speech.  He mentioned that the Minister was on the horns of a dilemma.  I do not think the Minister is sitting on as sore a spot as the Deputy himself.  I thought it desirable that some person, not directly affected by the particular constituency and its needs, should speak and make his contribution to this debate.  It is important that this House discharge its national obligations without regard to locality and inconvenience.  We have a duty to be concerned about Bills, even though they do not affect our own particular bailiwick.  If a Bill is disadvantageous to the people who elect this House, if our constituents are inconvenienced or opposed to a particular measure, we have a clear moral obligation not alone to speak out the views of those people &mdash;as Deputy Davern, I must say, very ably did&mdash;but also to vote in accordance with the wishes of the people.</P>
    <P>Deputy Davern has clearly indicated that, if he votes in this division, he will vote against the interests of his people.  I find that extremely difficult to justify&mdash;and what a poor pass we have come to if, in this House, we have a young Deputy of the calibre of Deputy Davern saying that loyalty to the Fianna Fáil Party, and the discipline <Col N="2115" /> of the Fianna Fáil Party, is of far greater importance to him than is the discharge of his duty to his constituents: that is what it amounts to. I am appalled to sit in this Parliament and to hear any member of this sovereign democratic Republic give voice to opinions of that kind.  One could perhaps respect him if he were to abstain but even that would not be a correct discharge of his duties having regard to the vehement way in which he expressed the opposition of his people to this measure.  It is not correct to say that Party discipline comes before the national interest or the interest of his constituency.  On that account, I would hope that Deputy Davern would have second thoughts, or that the Minister would release this man from the obligation of committing a parliamentary sin, by making this an open vote.</P>

      <P>As a Deputy for the constituency of South Tipperary which includes west Waterford and takes into account quite a large number of people who are directly involved in the closure of this line&mdash;the Waterford-Mallow line&mdash;I feel I have a bounden obligation and public duty to speak on this issue and to express, in so far as I can, the consensus of opinion of the people in this area and to express, moreover, the dismay, disappointment and widespread regret of the people in my constituency who are directly involved at the possible closure of this railway line.</P>
      <P>It is to be deplored that the Minister and CIE continue on their rampage and with their wrecking policy in regard to the railway system and with the tearing up of hundreds of miles of line.  In this Bill they are adding a further 76 miles of line, despite all the vehement opposition in this House, and the expressions of opposition from members of the Government Party, that this is an anti-social policy which should be discontinued.  That expression has been echoed this evening by Deputy Davern who had the courage&mdash; if not the political astuteness&mdash;to stand up and display some semblance of independence until he came to the stage where he said that in the heel of the hunt, he would have to vote for the Party line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At a time when there is a dire need to render our roads safer, to eliminate death from them, it is to be deplored that we have a Minister for Transport and Power who condones the irresponsible attitude of &ldquo;the CIE&rdquo;, as he calls them, in carrying on this anti-social policy.  We have eyesores all <Col N="2117" /> over the country in the form of stretches of country where hundreds of miles of line were torn up, wrecked bridges and the once busy passage-ways of traffic, trade and commerce now overgrown with weeds.  Is it not within the ingenuity of the planners and technicians of CIE to utilise these once essential arteries again to divert traffic from our roads which have become so hazardous, to say the least?</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to remarks he made on the Second Reading of the Transport Bill, 1964 when he said that he indicated that the Government had decided after full consideration to preserve the railway system, subject to such further concentration and re-organisation as might prove practicable and desirable.  The essential point in that statement is that the Government decided after full consideration of the outbursts of indignation inside and outside this House to preserve the railway system and that this wrecking should be discontinued, but the Minister for his own convenience and in order to enable him to close the Waterford-Mallow railway line added the words &ldquo;subject to further concentration and re-organisation that might prove practicable and desirable.&rdquo;  The Minister is alone in the opinion he expresses that a railway system does not confer any status whatsoever on a community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>He is alone in that opinion.  A railway system is vital to a local community.  We are not concerned about the profit or loss of railways as such; we regard them as a great social need and a social service, as they are recognised in every country, and while one strives to make them profitable, it is a matter of indifference whether or not there are losses.  Invariably there are losses in most countries but they are maintained as an essential service for the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister talks about CIE being forced to live within their allowance of £2 million.  I hope they will but I doubt it very much.  The saving he hopes to effect for CIE here is a <Col N="2118" /> paltry £50,000.  That is the amount which will be saved by the closure of the 76 miles of line between Mallow and Waterford.  We have seen the results of closures in the past.  We know the reactions of our people to the closing of railway lines in the past. I want to disabuse the Minister of any ideas he may have that people are satisfied afterwards with the type of transport service he provided by way of road services.</P>
    <P>I have in mind primarily the tearing up of the Waterford-Tramore line. This was a bad day's work for CIE, a clear indictment of a stupid and foolhardy policy.  Before the ink was dry on the Bill which sanctioned that closure, the Minister had his wreckers in Waterford and Tramore knocking down the bridges and tearing up the lines.  At the time he promised the people the moon.  He promised them a full and adequate road service.  The fact is that there are no adequate means by which families in Waterford city can get to Tramore.  The buses are not catering for them in the same way as the trains did, particularly for parents with young families.</P>
    <P>Promises were made that the buses would pick up the people at certain recognised points but that promise has been departed from and people are being directed to one central point and herded there like animals until such time as a sufficient number of buses come along and take them to Tramore. Nothing could adequately substitute for the train services between Waterford and Tramore.  It saddens one to see the once lovely station houses closed and falling into decay, an eye-sore, a monument to the ignorance and stupidity of CIE and the Minister who condoned their action.  It saddens one to see the once well-kept railway lines and bridges disappearing.  The tracks are now a virtual wilderness. The road&mdash;some seven miles long&mdash; between Waterford and Tramore is now a death trap; it is a most hazardous road to travel.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The additional traffic diverted from the railway to the road <Col N="2119" /> has greatly increased danger to life for those who travel this road.  There have been many accidents.  There have been fatalities, all because of this stupid policy of closing railway lines. This House has passed planning legislation. If we are concerned about planning for the future, is it not time that some of our planners had a talk with CIE and asked them to cease forthwith the folly of wrecking our railway system?  Can CIE not see any useful purpose to be served in the future by these traffic arteries?  In Britain it is no longer the policy to close down railway lines.  Certain Ministers in the Labour Government have set their faces against this policy. People who live along these railway lines suffer inconvenience and a certain dislocation when these lines are closed. In the section with which I am concerned, there are no fewer than 14 stations and some of those stations serve important towns such as Lismore, Tallow and Cappoquin in my constituency of South Tipperary.</P>
      <P>Dismay, anxiety, unrest and bewilderment have been created by the proposed closure.  The Minister has shut his mind to all pleas for sympathy and understanding for these local communities. He has adopted a dictatorial attitude; he alone knows what is best for our local communities; the railway does not confer any benefit on them; it does not confer any status.  He is on record in his speech today as saying these things.  What the Minister is offering as a substitute for the railway system is wholly unsatisfactory.  There is no comparison between an adequate train service and a bus service.  I do not want to labour these points.  I do not want to take up the time of the House pointing out the disparities between the two but I should like to remind the Minister that a bus service is lacking in very many amenities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In cold weather, and we have a good deal of cold weather during almost nine months of the year, there is no heating.  One is famished travelling by bus.  There does not seem to be any recognised timetable.  Buses stop anywhere and everywhere.  There are no adequate toilet facilities.  People <Col N="2120" /> are obliged to avail of the village pub; men, women and children must find their way to some primitive toilet in the back.  Many buses give the impression that they are on a world tour. The railway line between Clonmel and Thurles was closed and people now know to their sorrow how very inadequate the substitute bus service is. It is slow, tedious and cumbersome. It is most unsatisfactory.  Yet, the Minister had the audacity to imply in his speech here today that people are satisfied with the alternative services provided where railway lines have been dismantled.</P>
    <P>This is an enabling Bill but the clear intention of the Bill is to close this particular railway line.  The Minister has offered those interested a deputation to CIE.  He says he has requested the Chairman to arrange with the area manager or some executive officer at headquarters to receive one representative deputation in order that the board may hear the case for the retention of the line.  I suppose we should be grateful to the Minister that he should condescend to permit representatives of CIE to meet a deputation, but ought he not to be good enough to tell the House and the country that the deputation is, in fact, being sent on a fool's errand?  It will be a waste of time, energy and effort to go before these gentlemen of CIE faced with a virtual <i>fait accompli</i> once this Bill has passed. When we did go before CIE in relation to the closure of a line on an earlier occasion, we found ourselves in the invidious position of being told by these gentlemen that we could not discuss the closure as such, that we could only propose alternative transport methods.  That is the autocratic attitude of CIE.  They will not deign to discuss with us our views as to why the line should be retained.  We are forced into the position in which we must accept the fact that the line is closed and all we may do is discuss alternatives lacking in very many amenities.</P>
    <P>I echo the sentiments expressed by Deputy Kyne when he said that CIE are a State body set up by the Oireachtas and as such answerable to us.  They are a public enterprise, maintained by public money.  They should be responsible <Col N="2121" /> to this House.  Most of all the views of the public&mdash;the closing of this line is essentially a public matter &mdash;should be heard by CIE with respect and acted upon.  That is the consensus of opinion in this House this evening from the Labour benches, from the Fine Gael benches and indeed from the Fianna Fáil benches. The Minister has no mandate whatever for the policy of wrecking he continues to inflict on so many towns and villages.  This is the idea of some so-called genius in CIE as a means of effecting economy.  It might be economically wise to tear up hundreds of miles of lines, but is it socially desirable? Is it desirable, in order to save £50,000, to deprive the people living between Mallow and Waterford of this amenity they have enjoyed for so long? We do not believe the Minister and CIE are justified in this attitude in order to save £50,000.</P>
    <P>We can only hope that wiser counsels will prevail and that the Minister will have regard to the sentiments he expressed some years ago when he said:</P>
    <P>I indicated that the Government had decided after very full consideration to preserve the railway system.</P>
    <P>It is to be deplored that the Minister has, once again, departed from this principle.  The matter has gone too far.  Despite the hundreds of miles of railway torn up, CIE to-day are no better off financially.  Indeed, a few months ago when the workers made a demand on them, the Minister and the directors of CIE indicated to the nation that they were virtually bust. They had reached a new financial low.  There were rumours about the possibility of certain CIE transport services being sold out to private enterprise.</P>
    <P>This policy has done nothing to improve the state of our economy or bolster up the shaky reserves of CIE. While the Minister may maintain that CIE are obliged to live within their allocation of £2 million, we shall not be surprised if he comes back to the House in a few months' time looking for additional financial accommodation. <Col N="2122" /> I feel sure this House will not begrudge that money&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;especially for such an essential service and for a public board such as CIE.  We in the Labour benches regard it as a nationalised industry providing an essential service subject to the voice of the people as expressed through this Parliament.</P>
      <P>I speak here as a Deputy for the constituency of South Tipperary and West Waterford.  The latter part of the constituency contains towns such as Cappoquin, Tallow and Lismore which are directly affected by this measure. I want to express the sadness and regret of the people of this area that this proposal has come so far.  I will certainly be a member of any deputation which may go before CIE in order to put forward the most compelling case we can for the retention of this line.  But I want to be satisfied I am going there with a chance of success and that the passing of this Bill has not damned our case and made our task impossible because we will be presented with a <i>fait accompli.</i></P>
      <P>If the Minister is to listen to the voice of the Deputies who have spoken, including Deputy Davern of the Government Party, he should in all sincerity convey the views of Deputies to CIE.  He should convey the views of those of us who should, if we do not, control these State bodies.  He should say to them that Deputies of all Parties have set their faces against the closure of any more railways and that the Mallow-Waterford line must not be interfered with.  I was rather pleased to see Deputy Davern rise courageously and display a sense of independence for a while in the case he made for the retention of this line.  I felt my task was made far simpler and that I would only have to say that I joined with him in all he said and the case he made against this proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, Deputy Davern stopped short in two important instances.  We differ from him on two points.  The first is his appeal to the Minister to defer the closure of the line for five years.  This, of course, is to accept the principle of the closure and give <Col N="2123" /> the people concerned a slow death of five years waiting.  We could never accept that.  This line should not be interfered with and CIE and the Minister should take their hands off it right away.  It should be maintained for the future.  CIE should be obliged to assist, stimulate and co-ordinate the efforts of all concerned in order to make this 76 miles of railway viable and profitable.  We believe it could be made more profitable, but there was evidence from certain Deputies here this evening that when CIE decide to close a line, they deliberately and of set policy run down that line economically.  In fact they create additional unnecessary expense attached to the operation of that line in order that the Minister may seek to justify himself in the case he brings to this House.</P>
    <P>That is something to which the Minister might reply, the allegation that CIE deliberately create a situation whereby a line is placed in a worse economic position than it actually need be in and that additional unnecessary expenditure is incurred in the way of painting premises, even though it is known to CIE that this particular section of line is for the axe.  The House must be suspicious of the case made by the Minister and by CIE when all concerned on the lines proposed to be abandoned are specifically instructed not to co-operate with public representatives and not to give any information to interested parties, chambers of commerce, trades councils, farmers' groups, local and public representatives or even to Members of this House.</P>
    <P>These people are not to get any information from station-masters or anybody else which would assist them to come to a conclusion as to whether the line is profitable or as to how the alleged losses are arrived at.  This is not good enough.  That is showing a flagrant disregard for public representatives and for Members of this House.</P>
    <P>I will, please God, be a member of the deputation which meets the CIE representatives on this matter and if we do, we want to meet them in a cordial, respectful and co-operative way, at a conference at which there is <Col N="2124" /> some hope of our views being heard and at which we will not be presented with a <i>fait accompli</i>.  The Minister should ensure, in arranging conferences of this kind, that it is not a junior officer of CIE who is sent to meet the public representatives but somebody who can affect the policy of CIE.  Deputations are entitled to meet the Chairman of CIE if they so desire on a matter of such great public importance.  This is a matter of great public importance for the people of the towns and villages between Mallow and Waterford.</P>
    <P>I will not detain the House further except to express the view again from these benches that we deplore the continual national vandalism being committed by CIE in respect of the wrecking of our railway system which is bringing in no national, economic or social results.  We had hoped this was stopped, particularly following the statement of this Minister in 1964 when he spoke on the Transport Bill of that time and said that the Government had decided after full consideration to preserve the railway system.</P>
    <P>This has come as a shock and a great disappointment to all of us in this House and to the people directly concerned.  My own personal anxiety about the wrecking of our railway system is that it is being done at a time when every conscientious person should be utilising all the ingenuity at his command to divert traffic from our roads, that traffic which is causing such havoc and injury.  Is it not the height of folly that we should now be cutting off these important traffic arteries and throwing that traffic on to the roads so that the death toll on the roads is being accelerated out of all proportion by the Minister and by CIE. The Minister has a great moral responsibility in this regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to the programme before the House, I do not propose to repeat everything said by myself in regard to CIE policy on railways in relation to the course of the past five years which applies to the case of the Mallow-Waterford line. Deputies can find all the references in the Official Reports and there is no need for me to engage in repetition. <Col N="2125" /> People in every country become sentimental when a railway line closes down.  That is quite natural and there is very little objective thinking about it.  There is nothing very exceptional in the proposals contained in this Bill, as thousands of miles of railway line are being closed down all over Europe by left-wing authorities who have had regard to all the social considerations.</P>
      <P>They are being closed after examination in which all the most modern techniques are being used to see if they would become an economic or social success even in 20 or 30 years from now.  There have been modifications of policy in various countries.  In Britain, Mrs. Barbara Castle, the new Minister for Transport there, has modified the decisions of her predecessor but only in areas where it is believed that the railways might become profitable in conditions of much higher density of population. However, I am talking about railway lines in the character of that under consideration in this Bill in which, so far as we can foresee, none of these matters arise.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to one or two items of a particular character relating to the particular line under consideration in the Bill.  The closure of this line has no connection with British Railways. It will not be done as a result of any representations from British Railways, nor will British Railways save any money as a result.  The administration of this line is entirely under the aegis of CIE.</P>
      <P>I do not know the source of Deputy Barry's figures of a loss of £21,000 per annum.  I have indicated that the loss is £50,000 per annum and that a capital expenditure of £344,000 for the purpose of new diesel engines will not be required if CIE decide to close the line.  A very large amount of capital is involved in this question as well as the annual loss on the line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One Deputy asked when the figures were prepared by CIE.  They were prepared three years ago, and the position has not improved since that time so as to justify any change in the general view of CIE which will be presented to the deputation that comes before CIE after the passing of the <Col N="2126" /> Bill.  I should say CIE do not allow a line to run down deliberately before closing it.  I have no evidence of that whatever.  The area managers and the sales staff do their best to sell the general services of CIE, both road and rail.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies omitted to consider the fact that in this Bill we are concerned with a railway line that is paralleled by another railway line. I think this is the first occasion when this matter is being discussed in this context and, as I have said already, if CIE decide to close the line, the majority of the traffic will be carried on the Waterford-Clonmel-Limerick Junction line to Cork and to Limerick.</P>
    <P>Station masters are forbidden to give information on the traffic that is being carried over the line for the reason, among other reasons, that simply giving the gross value of traffic carried on the lines is no indication as to its profitability.  If Deputies will read the Pacemaker Report, they will see how the computation is made and they will see that mere figures of gross revenue or gross receipts at a particular station have nothing whatever to do with the profitability of the line, because there are so many other factors that have to be taken into account at the same time.</P>
    <P>The usual views were expressed on the possible damage to the roads through the closing of the railways.  I can hardly believe that any section of any road adjoining the railway would not require improvement, in any event, during the next 20 years arising from the huge increase in private car traffic and lorry traffic all through the country.  I have already given statistics about that in connection with the closing of other railway lines, and I do not think there is any need for me to repeat them here, except to point out the enormous increase in the number of lorries in the area of the Waterford-Mallow line in the past ten years and the effect they must have on the road.  I do not think the addition of 16 lorries and buses could affect traffic along some particular stretch of road to such an extent as to present the local authorities concerned with a financial crisis.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2127" /> I want to dispose of all the rumours that there was a tremendous argument within the Board as to whether this Bill should be introduced.  I heard of no conflict whatever.  These matters are very carefully examined but, of course, a great many rumours circulate around every State company, and indeed, every large institution.</P>
    <P>Deputy Davern referred to the possible opening of some coal mine.  I would be willing almost to enter into a wager with Deputy Davern that if the mine did open and it was not directly on a railway line, it would be more than likely traffic would have to be brought direct, unless it was worthwhile to build a branch line to the mine.</P>
    <P>Other Deputies spoke of the growth of Waterford as a regional centre for industry.  I do not believe that the closing of this line and the substitution of bus and lorry services will alter the importance of Waterford city as a regional city for industry.  On these occasions people speak as if there was to be no substitute service.  I want to be quite frank about this and say that there are some individual complaints <Col N="2128" /> when a substitute service operates and a railway closes.  Not everybody can be pleased, but I can say with absolute sincerity that in my office there are very few records of complaints in connection with the closing of railway lines.  In a great many sectors, the traffic has actually increased because the substitute service means there are more points for taking up and setting down passengers, for taking delivery of goods and for enabling a great many other people to take part in the public transport service.  The traffic has increased and, taking it large and wide, I have had very little complaint in regard to the substitute services.</P>
    <P>As I have said, CIE will listen to what the deputation has to say to them if they decide to close the line.  Therefore, everything that has been said here on this occasion can be repeated before CIE by Deputies and by representatives of the public authority.  This is only an enabling Bill, enabling CIE to make the decision that they have already made in other cases one way or another under the 1958 Act, and I confidently recommend it to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 2, lines 22 to 26, to delete subsection (2) and to substitute the following subsections:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;( ) The said section 21 shall, in its application to a railway line of the Company over which all train services have been terminated by the Board, be construed and have effect as if&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the following paragraph were substituted for paragraph (a) of subsection (2), that is to say:</P>
      <P>&lsquo;(a)  Where the Board has terminated all train services run over a specified railway line of the Fishguard and Rosslare Railways and Harbours Company that Company may, subject to this subsection, by order (in this section referred to as an abandonment order) declare its intention of abandoning that railway line.&rsquo;, and</P>
      <P>(b)  the references in subsections (2) (b) to (d), (3), (4), (5), and (7) to the Board were references to the Company.</P>
      <P>( ) Where, by virtue of the said section 21, as amended by this section, or section 7 of the Transport Act, 1955, a liability of the Company in relation to the maintenance of any works ceases, any corresponding liability of the Board shall also cease.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The amendment is purely of a drafting character.  The draftsman said that subsection (2) should be redrafted and this has exactly the same effect. It enables the Fishguard Company to abandon the railway line, if and when the services are terminated by CIE. It takes away any impediment that might remain as a result of the Fishguard services having been operated according to an old British Act up to now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a clear indication of the haste with which this Bill was pushed forward.  Only a week or two ago, we had the Bill as printed on the green form.  Within a couple of hours, CIE found that in their haste to introduce this legislation, they produced something that would not have stood up in a court of law.  There is quite a definite chance of this legislation being challenged in the courts. It will not slip by in the normal way and apparently the law advisers in this House, in CIE or elsewhere advised the Minister that faulty legislation has been introduced, apparently because of the hurry of CIE to close this railway.</P>
      <P>I listened to the Minister in his concluding remarks on the Second Stage and he denied that there was any pressure from British Railways.  He denied there was any question of loss being sustained by them but he did say that CIE had the sole administration of the railway line.  That is not to say that if there is a loss, the joint owner does not have to pay part of it.  If there was a profit to share, would the British Railways not consider they were entitled to a percentage of it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">

    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that.  If there is a loss, there cannot be a profit.  But some comments the Minister made require clarification.  He said the figures were prepared three years ago on which he is now basing his proposal. Could I ask the Minister, through the Chair, whether last year and this year a special account was being taken of passenger and goods traffic on this line?  Is it not true that no attempt will be made to close the line until some <Col N="2132" /> time next March so that a complete survey may be taken?  If that is so, and if such a detailed examination was conducted by CIE, why is the Minister not able to give more up-to-date figures?  He gave us figures of three years ago and he did elaborate by saying that he had no reason to think they had improved since.  Has he any reason to know whether they have or not?  It is just a simple statement of his opinion.  I suggest when a big number of railway workers, a big number of businesses and a huge number of people are concerned, it is not good enough to say that he has no reason to think any change has occurred since then.</P>
      <P>The Minister denies there is any attempt to run down a line if it is decided by the executive of CIE to close it.  Could I remind the Minister that a big military movement took place once in Waterford when they got two diesels to travel along the Quay across Waterford city to the old Tramore railway station?  There was no reason why the old steam engines which would normally hold together for ten or 20 years, should be replaced by diesels but CIE had to show a loss. They took off the steam engines which were quite easily able to run the seven or eight miles between Waterford and Tramore and they had this big manoeuvre to bring the diesels over to the Waterford section of the Tramore railway, making quite a military expedition.  Surely that must have cost money?  These two diesels were brought over absolutely unnecessarily but it was very useful to be able to quote them against that line if you wanted to shut it down two years later.  Either it was ignorance to bring the diesels there, knowing that the line would close or the diesels were brought there in ignorance of the fact that it would be closed.  Surely there was something wrong?  That is why I am opposing this Bill.  That is why I am opposing the Minister's amendment.  That is why I shall have to demand and look for a vote on each section on which I am permitted to do so because I feel I am speaking on behalf of the people I am sent here to represent.</P>

      <P>Like Deputy Kyne, I feel constrained to get up again to talk in a very brief way with regard to this issue which I have already told the House I regard as of primary importance not only to myself but to a great many people I represent in my constituency and indeed far outside its confines.  Speaking earlier this evening, I mentioned figures that I think the Minister accepted as being out of date.  That is all right but the figures the Minister has given us are, I believe, figures of three years standing.</P>
      <P>I did say, when I was speaking, that I should like the Minister to examine the figures with regard to the freight and passenger traffic of Fermoy station over the past year or two.  Until such time as I get these figures from him, or from some responsible authority in CIE, I am not prepared to accept in any circumstances any proposal to close the Mallow-Waterford line.  There are many other reasons, as I already indicated, which would annoy me if there were even a mention of the closing of it.  I think I am most reasonable when I say that when the Minister produces the figures in respect of the Fermoy station over the past 1½ or two years, whichever is the more convenient to him, and reads them out in this House, then I shall stand corrected if what I have already said is not true or near the truth.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCasey" hpid="Mr. Casey Mr. Casey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Casey</NameTxt>
      <P>In my Second Reading speech on this Bill, I posed some questions to the Minister to which I hoped he would reply.  He has paid me the discourtesy of disregarding any remarks I made in my Second Reading speech.  I am not particularly upset personally about that but this is Committee Stage and, in discussing the amendment proposed by Deputy Kyne, I shall have to pose further questions. The Minister will possibly disregard them again.  He will steamroll the legislation through the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact of the matter is that the history of this Minister for Transport and Power has been that of a man who appears determined to close down the railway system, and not alone to close down the railway system but to <Col N="2134" /> dismantle and disintegrate the whole concept of nationalised transport&mdash;rail, road freight and road passenger.  I shall ask the Minister the question again which I put to him in my Second Reading speech and to which he failed to refer&mdash;inadvertently, I am sure, but I should like to remind him of it again. What advice did he get regarding the closing of the railway line between Mallow and Rosslare?  Is it not a fact that a very substantial, influential and intelligent section of CIE advised the Minister strongly against the closure?</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I answered that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCasey" hpid="Mr. Casey Mr. Casey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Casey</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not interrupt the Minister and I hope the Minister will not interrupt me.  I ask this question again to which the Minister failed to reply when I asked him to do so when making my Second Reading speech. Is it not a fact that a substantial section of the CIE organisation, including the Chairman who has now retired, advised against closure?  Perhaps one of the reasons the Chairman retired was that he was bound by legislation to carry out the dictates of this House to provide a reasonable, co-ordinated public service transport organisation but found that the policy of the Minister, the exercise of the Minister, the operation of the Minister, was completely contrary to the dictates of this House as passed in legislation largely advocated and carried by the present Taoiseach in his enlightened approach to public transport.</P>
      <P>The only reason, of course, the Minister has had to put this section in the Bill is that a similar Bill must be passed in the British House of Commons.  He had no such difficulty when he decided to close the West Cork railways and when he decided to close the Waterford-Tramore line. But, in this instance, because of old legislation, there is an arrangement between himself and his counterpart in the British Parliament to pass similar legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Casey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am suggesting this. The Minister can reply if he wishes. It is an arrangement arrived at between our Minister for Transport and Power and the appropriate Minister in Britain. Therefore, this Minister has to go through this drill on this occasion which he refused to go through when he closed the West Cork railway and the Waterford-Tramore railway.  He has the humiliating experience of having to come to this House and endeavour to explain to us why he now wishes to close the line between Mallow and Rosslare.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Casey</NameTxt>
      <P>Waterford.  As I said, I invited the Minister's comments and, inadvertently, I am sure, he refused to comment on them in his reply to the debate on Second Reading.  As an ordinary Deputy, I should like to know why one Minister tells us, on the one hand, that Waterford is a city of growth, that the port of Waterford is being developed at tremendous State expense, while, on the other hand, the Minister for Transport and Power is deciding to close down the main line of communication between the centre of Munster and the city and port of Waterford.  This House is entitled to an explanation and we should like to know if there have been discussions between the Ministers on these matters, if there have been differences of opinion and if the Minister for Transport and Power won the argument within the Cabinet?</P>

    <P>I happen to know something about transport, and I think the Minister knows that, and I will sincerely advise him to have another look at the advice he has got from several executives in CIE who possibly brought in a minority report in regard to this matter.  These are people who are old railwaymen, who know their jobs and weigh their evidence and advice against that of some of the new found-outs the Minister imposed on the top executive of CIE&mdash;people who were managers of chewing-gum factories or the like. They are people who spent their lives in the railway, who came up from the grade of porter to guard and to signal-man and to stationmaster.  Some of <Col N="2136" /> them are now sales managers or area managers and the Minister should weigh up their evidence and advice against that of some of the new found-outs who were recruited, not personally by the Minister but inadvisedly through the agency of the Minister by the chairmen of Fianna Fáil organisations. That has happened and the Minister knows it has happened.</P>

      <P>No; I am making the point that the Minister, before he incorporated this section in the Bill, must have got advice from CIE, from some working party and ultimately, I presume, from the Chairman and Board of CIE, that this line should be closed.  I am simply trying to help the Minister in saying he should have a second look at the advice he got and should investigate the sources from which he got it.  I am saying that in the most helpful fashion and I hope the Minister will accept it in this way. People who know something about transport&mdash;and I do not mean these fuzzy-wuzzy people of work study, for whom the Minister has a great regard, time and motion experts and work study experts&mdash;railwaymen in all grades, from the lowest to the highest, who have worked from 30 to 50 years on the railways and who know what they are talking about, consider that this is the most stupid thing the Minister has ever done.  Without intending any personal insult, I must confess the Minister has done many stupid things in his time as far as public transport is concerned.  I would appeal to him to withdraw the section from the Bill, that he should accept&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Casey</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister moved his amendment, he explained that it made no substantial difference to the Bill as circulated and that it was simply a change in the wording.  Therefore the point at issue is Deputy Kyne's amendment.  I would ask the Minister <Col N="2138" /> to accept Deputy Kyne's amendment to delete this section, until he has had second thoughts on the matter.  I can assure him that I will give him any assistance I can give him and there is some evidence available to me which I would gladly place at his disposal, and that the trade unions concerned, and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, will willingly co-operate with the Minister in an intelligent and reasonable discussion on the matter.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister not to steamroll this through the House. Many of his own Party know quite well, and must have conveyed to him, that this is a foolish thing.  I should not like the Minister to project himself further, as he has been doing in the past, as the enemy of public transport. Unfortunately, inadvertently or otherwise, the Minister is now regarded by everybody who knows anything about transport and by users of public transport as a man with a policy of liberalising transport, denationalising it, letting it be a free-for-all.</P>

      <P>What is being debated here is the closure of the line between Mallow and Waterford.  You can wrap it up in all sorts of technicalities and say what you like about it, but the fact is that the representatives of the people here are being asked to decide whether or not we will give the Minister power to close the line between Mallow and Waterford.  Deputy Kyne's amendment is designed not to give that power to the Minister; we should not write into the Statute Book any such power.  I grant you there are <Col N="2139" /> transport problems and, I perhaps more than anyone else in this House, realise the difficulties of CIE.  The Minister will admit, I think, that the trade unions have been most co-operative and have done their best in relation to the re-organisation of CIE.  We have entered into consultations.  We have made permissible arrangements suitable to the unions, to the Board and to the Ministry of Transport and Power.  We are willing at all times to do that again and I only wish the Minister would at some stage, at some dinner, or at some chamber of commerce meeting, acknowledge the co-operation he has got from the trade unions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Casey</NameTxt>
      <P>I will conclude by appealing to the Minister to accept the amendment to delete section 3.  If, at some later date, he feels it might be profitable to discuss the matter again, as a result of further consultations with all the interests involved, including the residents in the affected towns, the public representatives, the Board of CIE and the trade unions concerned, then he might re-introduce it, but I would appeal to him to accept the amendment and withdraw the particular section at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I very much regret I cannot accede to the Deputy's request. The purpose of this Bill is to enable CIE to make a final decision as to whether or not to close this line.  CIE have agreed to accept a deputation to discuss all the matters mentioned in the course of the debate.  That seems to me to be very reasonable.  It is not true to say that there was some tremendous unheaval within the Board of CIE over the provisions of this Bill. It is merely an enabling Bill and CIE have still to make the final decision. In the usual way, I shall get the decision of the Board.  If we were to <Col N="2140" /> hear the views of all sorts of groups and cabals, the situation would be utterly impossible, not alone for CIE but for any State company.  The Minister has to be particularly careful not even to appear to be intervening and he would be doing just that if he were to hear all the views of the conflicting interests and groups.  Management would obviously become impossible in such circumstances.  Dr. Andrews's decision to retire later this year has nothing whatever to do with either general policy in relation to transport or with this Bill.  I can assure the Deputy of that certainly.</P>
      <P>I was asked about the traffic figures taken three years ago.  They have been checked since and have been found essentially to represent the 1965-66 position.  In reply to Deputy Barry, the House probably knows that CIE established not many years ago a modern accountancy system through the medium of which they can ascertain receipts and expenditure and losses along certain sectors of line and apply proportion of overhead costs to a particular section, thereby finding the profit or losses in running the line.</P>
      <P>The British Government do not have to pass a Bill as a result of this measure.  British Railways simply signify their consent.  They make neither a profit nor a loss out of it. This is entirely the responsibility of CIE and it was for legal reasons we thought it necessary to have a Bill because of the original joint control by British Railways and CIE.</P>

      <P>I shall give that to the Deputy on the next Stage.  I am doing this for the Minister.</P>
      <P>Copies of the draft order were sent to the public and local authorities concerned and to the occupiers and landlords of houses within three hundred yards of the site which it is proposed to use for the manufacture of gas.  No objection to the proposed order was received.</P>
      <P>Apart from the power relating to the take over of the interests of G. Anderson Ltd. in the other gas companies, the powers requested by the company are necessary in order to make improvements in their gas manufacturing process which will be required if the gas undertaking is to survive against growing competition from suppliers of other fuels.  The new process will use oil instead of coal as its main raw material.</P>
      <P>The proposed takeover is in the interests of the smaller gas undertakings as it will place the company's resources in the fields of science and technology at their disposal and should improve the supply of gas to the communities served.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied as to the need for the order and that there is nothing in it repugnant to the public interest.  I, therefore, recommend the order for the approval of the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is clear that, as we move forward in technology and as costs become greater, it is necessary that organisations such as the Dublin Gas Company should have permission, if permission is required, to spend more money on the replacement of plant and on the extension of their activities.  The fall in the value of money would necessitate this in any case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposal that the Dublin Gas Company take over jointly with Calor Gas Ireland Ltd.  The interests of G. Anderson Ltd. is an interesting one. We all know that around Ireland the production of gas has proved uneconomic in many cases and in fact one plant has been allowed to run <Col N="2147" /> down.  The cost of the replacement of the plant is prohibitive and it is a better commercial undertaking to provide bottled gas even though the bottle may be a much larger one than the one we are used to seeing at home.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to tell us when he is replying what are the interests which are now being taken over by the Dublin Gas Company and Calor Gas.  We are told that G. Anderson Ltd. has an interest in a number of small gas companies, and if the Minister has a list with him of the degree of shareholding which is held by Anderson, I should be obliged for it.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that in the new process oil will be used instead of coal as the main raw material in the production of gas.  I wonder about this because those who use anthracite from Ballingarry and from other collieries in the midlands, such as Kilkenny, know the extreme efficiency of this fuel.  I am not skilled, as I suppose most people here are not skilled, to the extent of knowing whether it is practicable to produce gas by the use of this fuel.  However, it would be a retrograde step if we did not attempt to use native fuel in the production of gas.  It is possible that that sort of work could not be done on peat or on turf, but it did seem to me that the traditional method of producing gas was by using coal and that if it could be done by using the products of the collieries which have been in trouble here for the last year or so, it would be the right thing to do for the nation and for those who work in the collieries.  Would the Minister tell us something about that when he is replying?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The important statement the Minister made in respect of this order is, I think, that he is satisfied that there is nothing in it repugnant to the public interest.  I should very much like him to elaborate on that statement and tell us the extent of this Dublin Gas Order and how many gas undertakings are involved. Many of us are aware of the importance of gas undertakings in small <Col N="2148" /> towns, the service they provide for the local community and also the employment they provide.  We should like to be assured in respect of these takeovers that there will be nothing like a monopoly created and that the consuming public will be adequately safeguarded.</P>
      <P>We should also like to be assured that the workers engaged in this important industry will be adequately safeguarded and that no redundancy will arise as a result of the change over from coal to oil.  My information is that the substitution of oil for coal does and will make for redundancy. I should like the Minister to indicate to us to what extent that may be so. Otherwise, we shall have to accept his assurance that there is nothing repugnant to the public interest in this measure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dealing in this matter with the Gas Regulation Act, 1920.  As far as my memory serves me, we are also dealing with other Acts which go even further back in time than 1920.  I want to avail of this opportunity to inquire from the Minister if the Companies Act, 1953, applies to the Dublin Gas Company.  I do not think it does.  I am aware that the Dublin Gas Company is one of the leading public companies, and its annual accounts are published in an archaic form.  It would seem to me to be very desirable that the accounting provisions as to disclosure of information to the shareholders under the Companies Act ought to be applied to the Dublin Gas Company which, by reason of the fact that it was formed under these earlier Acts, was excluded from the provisions of the Companies Act on an old point of principle which would seem to be no longer relevant in these days and times.</P>
      <P>The suggestion I am making is particularly desirable because the step now being taken is going to result in the Dublin Gas Company becoming a holding company.  That makes it even more necessary that the provisions of the Companies Act relating to consolidated accounts be applied to the Dublin Gas Company in the shareholders' and in the public interest.</P>

      <P>I want to ask, the Minister two questions.  Is it true that you cannot smother yourself with gas produced from oil?  I do not know whether the Minister knows that any more than I do.  The other question I want to ask him is this, arising out of what Deputy Byrne said: I have a kind of vague recollection that there is some provision in the old Gas Acts that payment of their dividends to shareholders is related in some way to the price they charge the consumer for gas and that there must be, if they propose to increase their dividends, some corresponding concession to the consumers of gas in the price per therm charged.  If it would be convenient for the Minister to answer these specific questions, I would be obliged.</P>

      <P>I will bring it to their attention.  On the point raised by Deputy Donegan about quiet takeover, there is seemingly a continuous danger of takeover by outside firms and these firms, of which I have not the names but whose location I have, are already substantially owned by Andersons. There are 12 &mdash; Cobh, Dundalk, Fermoy, Enniscorthy, Kilkenny, Monaghan, Naas, Thurles, Tipperary, Waterford, Wicklow, Enniskillen&mdash; small companies in each of these places.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I gather that production of gas from oil is cheaper, and also I am aware <Col N="2150" /> from earlier inquiries that Irish anthracite is not considered suitable for gas production.  I am assured that there is no danger of any immediate prospect of redundancy arising out of the implementation of this change.</P>
    <P>As regards to the Companies Act and the Gas Company, certain sections which apply are mentioned in this order but the Gas Company is already in process of examining this question of the method of keeping their accounts.  Gas from oil is not lethal.</P>

      <P>That Dáil Éireann approve the nomination by the Taoiseach of Deputy Seán Flanagan for appointment by the President to be a member of the Government.</P>
      <P>I am asking the Dáil to agree to the nomination of Deputy Seán Flanagan, at present Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
      <P>Following on the nomination of Deputy Seán Flanagan as a Member of the Government, it is my intention to allocate to him in due course responsibility for the Department of Health.  The other changes intended in the allocation of Departmental responsibility amongst Ministers following the coming into operation of the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Bill are: Deputy P.J. Hillery will be Minister for Labour; Deputy George Colley will be Minister for Industry and Commerce and Deputy Donogh O'Malley will be Minister for Education.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion requesting the Dáil to approve the nomination by the Taoiseach of Deputy Seán Flanagan is one which requires a little more explanation than that given by the Taoiseach.  So far as the motion to appoint Deputy Seán Flanagan as a Member of the Government is concerned, we do not object personally to that proposal, that is, as an individual. We do, however, object to the decision to increase the number of Ministers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has often seemed to me that it was somewhat difficult to understand, with the obvious lack of talent amongst the Fianna Fáil Party and particularly amongst the Ministers, that Deputy Seán Flanagan was not promoted earlier and I would like personally <Col N="2152" /> to wish him well as a Member of the Government.  We regard him as a person entitled as an individual to the promotion which he has now got.</P>
    <P>However, it is, I think, significant that three Ministers have been moved after little more than a year in their Departments.  This is quite a considerable reshuffle for changes which were regarded last week, when the Taoiseach moved the establishment of the new Department, as inconsequential or, certainly, only those changes which were warranted by the establishment of the new Department of Labour.</P>
    <P>It is, I think, worthy of comment that the Minister for Health is being moved from the Department of Health where he has promised everything to everybody and given nothing to anybody because the Government have no money to do it.  It is equally significant that Deputy Colley is being removed from the Department of Education after little more than a year in that Department, with his expressed views in favour of the replacement of the English language by Irish, and this can well be regarded as the first move by Fianna Fáil to an acceptance of the Fine Gael policy.</P>
    <P>It was generally foreshadowed that Deputy Hillery would move to the new Department of Labour.  It is common knowledge in the country, if the fact has not yet penetrated to the Taoiseach, that most Ministers in this Government are passengers and, what is worse, they are not even fare-paying. One obvious solution of the present problems which affect the Government would be to retire them&mdash;it would be in the interests of the country&mdash;before they inflict further harm on it and possibly before they cause further embarrassment to their colleagues.  It is well known that one Minister has expressed the view in regard to a colleague that the Fianna Fáil Party is a great Party that it is able to carry him.  I shall save both of them the embarrassment of mentioning their names.</P>
    <P>The fact is that this extra Minister now means that we have the maximum number permitted under the Constitution.  It is a needless and unwarranted expense, an expense at a time when <Col N="2153" /> every other section of the community have to bear increased burdens, at a time when money is not available for worthwhile projects and when, according to the expressed views of the outgoing Minister for Health, he would like to do a lot of things but had no money to do them.  A great many schools are needed but the outgoing Minister for Education had not the money to build them.  Every local authority is finding it not merely difficult but virtually impossible to get money to build houses and Small Dwelling Acts loan applicants cannot get loans.  In most local authorities, the money available will only pay for the applications that were in up to last December.  In the circumstances, there is no justification for providing jobs for Fianna Fáil Deputies at the public expense.  We suggest there is an obvious way in which this extra increase could be avoided, that is, by amalgamating existing Departments. I expressed the view last week that it is no function of Ministers or Parliamentary Secretaries to act as Fianna Fail organisers as they attempted to do during the recent election at the public expense.  State cars were bringing Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries all over the country&mdash;as they were entitled to do&mdash;but it was in fact on election business, whatever ostensible reason might have been given to the contrary.</P>
    <P>We believe there is no justification for the present increase in expenditure when everyone else has to bear increased burdens and increased taxes, when the cost of living is rising and when so many sections, particularly those in need of housing, are being obliged to go without or even, in the best cases, to postpone their prospects of getting the accommodation they need.  Nobody suggests that the salary of a Minister or even the total cost of a new Department would provide all the services or all the requirements of the country but what is wrong is the irresponsible mentality behind this, the irresponsible attitude of the Government who preach restraint and moderation, who have no money to give the services that are required or provide the work which is necessary <Col N="2154" /> and at the same time, refuse to practise what they themselves preach.  That is where there is a lack of leadership and a question of the sincerity of the attitude adopted.</P>
    <P>One wonders&mdash;and there will be speculation for a considerable time&mdash; about the removal of the present Minister for Health and of the present Minister for Education.  These are two changes which in present circumstances cannot be regarded as consequential and which are more than is necessary on the establishment of the new Ministry of Labour and more than is necessary on the proposed appointment of Deputy Flanagan as an additional member of the Government.  We believe that this situation is one in which the Government suggest that they have not sufficient funds for a variety of worthwhile projects, in which income increases are limited to a ceiling fixed by the Government, but in which so far as Government expenditure on jobs for Fianna Fáil Deputies is concerned, there is no limit, except that imposed by the Constitution which has now been reached by Fianna Fáil and which, by implication, was criticised in the remarks of the Taoiseach when he attempted to refute the facts which were produced here and which show that for the size of the country, for the population, for the gross national product and by whatever test is applied, even on area, we have more Ministers and possibly the most expensive Government in Europe.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>There is so much sameness about the different debates that have taken place here in the past three or four months that I do not propose to speak at any length.  As regards the competency of the Government, that can be debated over the next two days.  I should like to ask the Taoiseach whether or not it is proposed to appoint a Parliamentary Secretary in place of Deputy Flanagan who is now nominated to be Minister for Health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I approach the nomination and appointment of these Members of the House in a slightly different way from that of Deputy Cosgrave.  I wonder if there is any sinister significance <Col N="2155" /> in the transfer of what I regard as two pretty good Ministers, Deputy O'Malley and Deputy Colley.  Does the Taoiseach or the Government realise the importance there is in the fields of education and health at present?  I think if votes were won or lost in the last two general elections, it was on the policies of the various Parties on health, in particular, and I suppose to a similar extent on education. I wonder if the Taoiseach is beginning to get a little panicky. Things are not going too well for the Government, not to exaggerate too much, and we have had quite a number of gimmicks and announcements that were frothy but meant nothing.  I suppose, with all due respect to the Press, that one of the biggest items in tomorrow's newspapers will be these changes and photographs of the new Ministers, Deputy Flanagan and his colleagues in the Cabinet.  That is one of the diversionary gimmicks, in my view, the Taoiseach has had to resort to in recent times.</P>
    <P>I am particularly sorry for Deputy O'Malley and, on the other hand, I am inclined to ask myself whether or not he asked to be relieved of the Ministry of Health because what Deputy Cosgrave has said is quite true: he has promised quite an amount.  We in the Labour Party have taken him in good faith.  We were disappointed when he said his White Paper proposals, with much of which we agree, would not be implemented until 1967.  He has said other extravagant things and has been quite liberal in the way he has acceded to various requests by workers in the field of health.  I think he should be given an opportunity to implement these promises he has made so frequently since he was appointed Minister for Health in the spring of 1965.</P>
    <P>Or would it be that the Taoiseach and the Government contemplate a change in the health laws?  We in the Labour Party believe the White Paper containing the health proposals of the Government to be an improvement on the present system.  They do not go far enough as far as we are concerned <Col N="2156" /> because we wanted to provide a health service that would be applied to all the population on a certain basis.  The Minister for Health was not prepared to go that far.  He was obviously embarrassed, particularly after he had made his pronouncements about health He changed his mind a few times.  One wonders, therefore, whether he was rapped on the knuckles and would have liked to get out of the difficulty in which he found himself.  However, a reassurance by the Taoiseach that what he promised will be given will make the job for Deputy Flanagan a little easier.</P>
    <P>I think most Members of the House, even though critical by times of all Ministers, have a healthy respect for the ability which Deputy Colley has displayed here.  I think every Party in the House has a policy on education and in detail.  We certainly have it in detail.  We have had it in detail for the past two or three years and published it.  Fine Gael have the same and I assume that the Government Party have theirs, as expressed by the new Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Colley.  I do not think, that in that particular field, as in relation to Health, the chief administrator in the person of the political head of the Department should be changed.</P>
    <P>Changes are needed in education and are promised and the sooner we get these changes the better.  I do not believe in somebody going in there new, with all due respect to him.  I believe people regard him as a likeable sort of man but, in this delicate field of education, perhaps the person the Taoiseach now proposes as Minister for Education, Deputy O'Malley, might not be the most discreet.  I do not think anybody would challenge his ability but, by times, as in the Department of Health, he has tended to kick over the traces. However, that is a matter for the Government. We shall place responsibility for all the Ministers on the head of the Taoiseach and on the Government generally.</P>
    <P>As we propose to do again in the next two days, we had quite a long debate on the appointment of a Minister for Labour.  Incidentally, let us <Col N="2157" /> hope that the present Minister for Industry and Commerce will be successful in the tasks that will be allotted to him and which were described by the Taoiseach when he introduced the measure in question last week.  We said we believed that the person to be appointed Minister for Labour was important.  There are quite a number, if not the majority of the Fianna Fáil Front Bench, to whom I personally would not entrust the Department of Labour if the new Minister is to do the tasks successfully &mdash;those which the Taoiseach said would be allotted to him.  However, as a Party with connections with the trade union movement, we should like to wish the new Minister for Labour well and to say that, as far as we are concerned, in any of his efforts to relieve industrial disputes or to eliminate industrial unrest, he will have our co-operation as he will also if he demonstrates that he is prepared to accept proposals from this side of the House and from the trade union movement.</P>
    <P>We have given our views on the Department of Transport and Power.  We think it is superfluous, apart from the man who is the political head of the Department.  We believe there are two or three other Ministries which could be amalgamated.  There is too much work on the shoulders of some Ministers and too little on the shoulders of others.  As a matter of fact, there are some Ministers who have a better time than some of the Deputies because they have so little work to do.  Most of the work they do&mdash;I say this with due respect to them&mdash;is done, and can be done, by their office staff or by the Department.</P>
    <P>I should like, also, to congratulate Deputy Seán Flanagan, who has been a Member of this House for some time, on his promotion to Minister for Health and to assure him again that, as far as we are concerned, if he goes the distance he is allowed by the Fianna Fáil Party in the matter of health, he will certainly have our support.  We shall still continue to press for the type of health scheme we want but improvements are needed.  We would ask him and the Government to ensure that these improvements will not be put off <Col N="2158" /> for very long more because they are urgently needed.  I believe this is one of the big tasks&mdash;that and education&mdash; for these two particular appointments, and the sooner the new Ministers get on the job the better.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>For the record, I think I should point out that it was as a matter of courtesy that I informed the Dáil of the new allocation of departmental responsibility between Ministers. This is solely a matter for the Taoiseach, and the Dáil is not asked to approve or disapprove.  The only matter before the House is the appointment of Deputy Seán Flanagan as a member of the Government.  If, as Deputy Cosgrave suggests, Ministers have no talents, it cannot make much difference in what Departments they exercise their lack of talent.  For my part, I think that Deputies Colley, O'Malley and Seán Flanagan have already displayed, in the exercise of their responsibilities so far, very considerable talents and that is, I am sure, what most people recognise.  Indeed, it was with very considerable reluctance that I contemplated transferring either Deputy Colley from the Department of Education or Deputy O'Malley from the Department of Health.  Both of them so enhanced their reputations since their appointment to these offices that I think many people will be critical of the decision to transfer them.  If the development of departmental policy was all that was involved, the transfers would not be justified.  I believe that each Minister can give more valuable national service in his new Department.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cosgrave professes to be ignorant about what is going on in the country either in school construction, of which the 1965 output was an all-time record, or in anything else.  That argument has become a bit futile.  I do not believe Deputy Cosgrave is half as ignorant as he pretends.  Somebody has persuaded him that this is the right attitude for the Fine Gael Leader.  We think he has got wrong advice.</P>

    <Title>Industrial Training Bill, 1965: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Earlier I was emphasising, from the Labour point of view, the necessity for making provision for redundancy, apart altogether from the question of apprenticeship, training and the coming into force of free trade.  Let us not forget that in this month of July, we have, in fact, embarked upon free trade with Britain and, in the next ten years, the barriers will be going down all the time and, at the end of that period, we shall have to face free trade with the gigantic industrial force in Britain.</P>
      <P>It is the confirmed opinion of both the labour and trade union movement that, as a result of the excruciating experience industry will suffer, industrial chaos will result.  There will be widespread unemployment, underemployment and redundancy.  While appreciating that this Bill is an integral part of the manpower policy programme, we would have expected in the circumstances I have outlined that, prior to the introduction of such a measure as this, we would have had a positive policy in relation to redundancy, with an assurance, first of all, that where workers are displaced there would be adequate compensation for long and devoted years of service, adequate retraining with ultimate absorption in alternative employment, with redundancy payments continuing in the interim period.  Retraining must be coupled with adequate redundancy payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my view, that is the measure urgently required now.  We support the argument that training in skills and techniques is important.  We have always said so.  Such training is an integral part of Labour policy from the point of view of education.  We are confirmed believers that a nation which is underdeveloped educationally will always remain underdeveloped economically.  We lay emphasis on <Col N="2162" /> education in the sphere of training in new techniques in this modern age. We think it pertinent to point out that the immediate problem is to ensure adequate compensation in relation to redundancy and we would have much preferred to have before us now the Minister's redundancy scheme, inadequate though it would appear to be from the glance we have had at it, because that would give immediate relief to many thousands of workers who have lost their employment in recent months and, indeed, in recent weeks because of readaptation, because of fears for the future on the part of some industrialists and the apparent inability of some employers to face competition.</P>
    <P>Many employers have made no effort at readaptation, despite the generous aids, grants and stimuli provided by the Department.  There has been a certain indolence and inertia on the part of very many employers, some of them employing a large labour force.  It is evident that these are the industries which will not survive in free trade. These are the vulnerable industries.  A good deal of research has been done by the Committees on Industrial Organisation.  The figures they have spell out the position in regard to the industries they have surveyed and the Minister should be in a position to assess the position as regards redundancy. He must know the likely redundancy. Too many small firms have closed down in too many small and large towns in recent months, and that at a time at which there was a great deal of talk about a manpower policy, about redundancy payments, about re-training measures, and so forth.  These unfortunate workers have been thrown on the unemployment scrapheap and no legislation has been enacted here to help them to pick up the threads again and become absorbed in some alternative employment suited to their needs.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to tell the House when it is intended to bring in here a measure dealing with redundancy. That is the measure to which the trade union and labour movement look forward most of all.  It is the measure most urgently required at present.  We are entitled to know, without any more <Col N="2163" /> flagwaving or flourishes of trumpets, when these measures will come into this House and when the unfortunate unemployed working classes can avail of them.  This measure is to include the following types of training: the training of apprentices; the retraining of adults to skilled level by accelerated vocational training methods; the training and retraining of operatives; the training of unemployed and redundant workers who have the aptitude to acquire new skills; refresher training for workers whose skills need to be improved or brought up to date; the training of agricultural workers for other occupations; advance training of workers for new industrial projects and the training, where necessary, of instructors, supervisors and technicians in our technical schools, schools of technology&mdash;when we get them&mdash;and in the factories.</P>
    <P>These are very laudable in themselves but&mdash;and this is the big &ldquo;but&rdquo;&mdash;where are the jobs to come from? Where are the indications that our economy is going to improve from its present underdeveloped position of virtual bankruptcy to the happy stage where we can implement all these things?  Imagine the problem.  We have a standing army of some 50,000 unemployed, the flower of our youth. We have an emigration rate running at approximately 30,000.  We have an annual output from schools of 40,000 boys and girls.  In addition, we have this continuing redundancy problem, which will become more pronounced as we move closer to free trade, upon which we have now embarked.  In these circumstances, there is a colossal task before the Government to build up the economy and to provide in every town, village and city industries to absorb and put to productive work the vast numbers to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>We wish the Minister and the Government well in these endeavours, but we will not allow the people to be codded by an impression that this can be done overnight.  Obviously, it is going to be a long and difficult process. It is all the more unlikely of realisation by reason of the clear collapse of the Government's policy, <Col N="2164" /> particularly in respect of the Second Programme for Economic Expansion. If there were signs that this country was moving forward to that kind of economic growth and to that degree of prosperity to which we aspire, we believe these things could be done; but we fear that at present this is nothing more than a piece of political windowdressing which will not cut any ice with the unfortunate workers unemployed today or threatened with unemployment in the months to come.</P>
    <P>We welcome the establishment of a Ministry of Labour.  It is something for which this Party has been crying out for a long number of years.  It is an indication that our policy in this regard was the right one.  I want to avail of this opportunity to congratulate Deputy Dr. Hillery on his appointment to this important office.  I am aware of the role he has played as an administrator and an accupant of various Government offices in the past.  We look to him now with hope and enthusiasm to implement a positive, integrated manpower policy such as the Labour Party and trade union movement have been advocating for so long.</P>
    <P>This manpower policy is meaningless unless it has the effect of creating full employment and providing jobs quickly.  If private enterprise cannot find jobs, as they have failed to find them, then this Government have a bounden duty to extend State enterprise, embark on more and more State enterprise in order to put our people into productive work and ultilise the vast resources of our country as well as the harvest which abounds in our seas.  This manpower policy should be an intelligent, planned development of our economy, providing for jobs, for job security and also for stability of prices.  We do not want to see the wage scales of our people dissipated by rising prices.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is getting away from the Bill, which deals with industrial training.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Very good, Sir.  This measure is an integral part of the manpower policy programme entrusted to the new Minister.  I feel I am entitled to relate it to the manpower policy proper. <Col N="2165" /> It is good that the Taoiseach decided on the implementation of a manpower policy and the creation of a distinct Ministry of Labour, especially in this the 50th anniversary of the Rising.  I refer again to the fact that in the Government of the State between 1916 and 1921, it fell to the Countess Markievicz to be appointed as the first Minister for Labour in the new young Republic.  I sincerely hope this will influence the Minister to implement as far as he can the ideals and aspirations for which the Countess Markievicz and others worked and died in the initial stages of the Republic.</P>
      <P>I want to advert to one or two aspects of the Bill.  Even at this stage I have some suggestions to make.  I want to remind the Minister that under this industrial training measure, he is now abolishing the Apprenticeship Board as we know it.  Whether that is necessary or not I do not know.  This measure may also have the effect of abolishing many other bodies which have been doing work in this sphere of training and apprenticeship.  I think it only fair and proper that we should pay a well-deserved tribute to the Apprenticeship Board for their great work since their inception.  When one reads the reports of that body, one obtains a graphic description of the important work they have performed in the training of apprentices.  That Board have done much to break down prejudices and distrust, to open closed shops and to bring about better co-operation and understanding between employers and employees.  It is only right that I should pay tribute to the members of that Board whose fate is now sealed, and especially to the chairman, Mr. John A. Agnew, and also to the workers' and employers' representatives and the educationists who have done such valuable work over the past few years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another aspect of this Bill to which I would like to advert.  The various industrial training committees which the Minister proposes to establish will have a chairman who will not be representative of either workers' or employers' interests.  That may seem to be a fair and impartial <Col N="2166" /> thing to do but the Minister must be aware that adaptation councils have been established here in connection with the printing industry and the boot and shoe industry.  These councils are vitally concerned with the education and training of skilled operatives for their particular industries.  They have established their own training committees and in the main, these committees are composed of people directly from the industry, employers and employees.  It would be unfair and unreasonable to foist an independent chairman on such committees as these, an independent chairman who may not be in tune with the industry with which he was dealing, who may have little knowledge of the working of the industry, who could do very little good and might be likely to do a lot of harm.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to consider amendments on Committee Stage whereby it would be left to the discretion of these committees to have a chairman of a different kind.  If they are satisfied with their present personnel, they should be left alone.  They should not have an independent man foisted on them, particularly a civil servant who might not have any specialised knowledge of the industry itself.</P>
    <P>I do not purport to speak for the trade union movement when speaking on this Bill but I understand that the Irish Congress of Trade Unions is awaiting the outcome of these deliberations to make known its own views, awaiting the outcome of the Second Stage debate of the Bill.  But I am concerned that it is alleged that in the drafting of this Bill, Congress were not consulted.  The manner in which they were consulted was that the Bill was presented to them in draft form and they were asked for their comments. Congress are entitled to take exception to such an approach.  If the Minister is to make a success of a measure of this kind, he will have to be more co-operative with and have regard to the interests of the trade unions in this matter.  Without their active support, this Bill will come to nothing.  It is disconcerting to realise that in an important measure of this kind, which <Col N="2167" /> impinges particularly on the trade union movement, and especially on the craft and industrial unions, they were not consulted in its drafting.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that there are very serve penalties in this Bill for non-compliance with certain orders the training authority may have to make from time to time.  There are penalties which may be imposed on the employer and penalties which may be imposed on the trade unions for non-compliance with directives under this measure.  I appreciate the desirability of ensuring that every child in this country will have equal rights and opportunities to pursue the craft, trade or skills to which he has a particular bent and I had hoped that we would have arrived at a situation in which there would be no obstacle in the way of a child getting into the trade of his choice.</P>
    <P>However, it must be realised that trade unions, for the protection of their own members, are sometimes compelled to restrict the inflow of workers into a particular trade.  That practice has become known as the closed shop.  In my opinion, that practice will fade away only in proportion to the extent that workers are made more secure in the long-term sense in their particular trade.  The only reason the closed shop practice is maintained is that in an economy such as ours, where there is a super-abundance of labour, it seems to be necessary that in order to protect wage standards and decent conditions of employment, trade unions must take steps to ensure that there will be no action which would drag down this standard in respect of their members. The Minister will have to contend with that kind of situation.  It is more pronounced, perhaps, in an economy like ours which is so underdeveloped and where there is a surplus on the labour market at all times.  Nevertheless, I would support the Minister in regard to a more enlightened and co-operative approach to this matter so that we would always have available a trained and adaptable labour force in the numbers the economy requires to keep it moving in a buoyant fashion.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2168" /> I hope the other important aspects of the manpower policy programme, of which this Bill is but a small instalment, will be brought before the House and implemented without further delay.  We recommend the measure which can and will be improved upon, and we trust the Minister will bring forward the related legislation, with particular reference to the redundancy pay scheme which was very much lauded in recent times, and which is the most urgent aspect as far as Labour and the trade union movement are concerned.  If the Government intend to grapple effectively with the question of unemployment and underemployment, an obligation devolves upon them to bring in these more practical, more necessary and more desirable pieces of legislation connected with the manpower policy such as the redundancy pay scheme and the re-absorption scheme to which I have already referred.</P>
    <P>Being the first Deputy to speak after the Minister's appointment to the new Department of Labour, I should like to wish him well in all he does for the betterment of our working class people. If he has regard to the views of Labour and the trade union movement in respect of what we conceive to be the ideal manpower policy for a Minister for Labour, he will not go far wrong. Indeed, the extent to which we have been right in this matter was very much underlined here tonight when the Taoiseach announced the appointment of a Minister for Labour.  We rejoice in that fact.  We have advocated it for a long time.  We believe a Minister for Labour worthy of that name has the primary responsibility of doing all he can, however long or short he may remain in office, to enrich, to ennoble and to render more secure labour in Ireland.  In talking about labour, I do not think I could conclude on a better note than by adverting to the slogan of the great founder of our Party who said: &ldquo;The cause of Ireland is the cause of labour, and the cause of labour is the cause of Ireland.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should like to congratulate Deputy Dr. Hillery on his appointment as Minister for <Col N="2169" /> Labour.  He is moving from a difficult Ministry into what may prove to be a hot seat.  I wish him well and I think everyone in this House and outside it wishes him well in that capacity.</P>
      <P>The Bill before the House is one which provides in broad detail for the establishment of industrial training procedures and the establishment of a body for that purpose.  The first comment one might be tempted to make is that, having regard to the experience not alone in recent years but over many years, of the deplorable lack of training of workers in industry of all grades, this measure is not merely due but overdue.  The percentage of Irish workers today who are employed in an unskilled or untrained capacity &mdash;no work of any significance is completely unskilled&mdash;is far too high for any economy to be satisfied with it, much less an economy which should over a long number of years have been taking adequate and positive steps to deal with economic problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The training of workers, at least some sections of workers, is nothing new in this country.  The training, in some form, of apprentices has gone on for 100 years and even longer.  Established skilled craftsmen for many years have claimed&mdash;and I think with justification&mdash;that they have, as far as the trades in which they are involved are concerned, endeavoured to secure improvements in training as time went on. Even fairly old legislation provided for apprenticeship committees through which representatives of the workers and employers met for discussion and arrived at agreements in the form of limitations in regard to the training of apprentices.  In many cases, of course, the decisions made were, for modern times, a little narrow, particularly having regard to the changes that have been taking place, not just in recent years but previous to that, because the development of technology in industry, the replacement by the craft worker of the manual worker to a great extent in large-scale industrial concerns, did not start five or ten years ago.  It started many years ago.  It is true to say that, apart from craft workers and professional people, by and large, <Col N="2170" /> workers entering industry got little or no training except the training they received on the job and in many cases that training was to do a particular operation reasonably satisfactorily. Consequently the position was that workers who could possibly have benefited by much wider training were being half-trained.</P>
    <P>To some extent it might be true to say that had it not been for the introduction of the Bill establishing An Cheard Comhairle in 1959, the Industrial Training Bill might not be before us today because the decision to establish the Authority for apprenticeship training and the experience gained by the chairman and officers of the Authority has helped not a little in the framing of this measure.</P>
    <P>There is, of course, a broad difference between training boys and young persons by apprenticeship and training and retraining workers who have been in employment from one to 15 years and whose need for retraining arises from the fact that the employment they are in is liable to be adversely affected.  The suggestion has been made in more than one report of the Committee on Industrial Organisation that there are a number of industries in which it is estimated that as they develop, even if adaptation grants were sought and applied, the manpower in the industries would tend to decline over a number of years by five, ten, 15 and in some cases as much as 20 per cent.  Some of these industries are firms in which people have been working for many years.  Some of them are specialised firms.  Consequently, the need to think in terms of a broader system of training than purely apprenticeship training is becoming more evident all the time.</P>
    <P>In this question of training and re-training, a number of problems and obstacles arise.  There are a number of conditions which must be met.  The first condition has been referred to by Deputy Treacy, that is, that if the Minister, the Government or a board established by the Government, are to hope to get the co-operation of the workers the fear of redundancy must be removed <Col N="2171" /> from the workers.  Of course, it can be removed only by one or two methods&mdash;by taking such steps as are possible to secure that the industries are equipped to meet competition or, where this is not possible, adequate provision must be made for the maintenance of the workers in a generous way and not in the somewhat niggardly way that so far has been advanced by adaptation councils in respect of workers.  In a number of industrial sectors small firms are going to the wall or are being absorbed in larger units and in quite a number of industries, as Deputy Treacy has said, workers have already been told that redundancy is pending.</P>
    <P>Secondly, in regard to the matter of redundancy, the question arises, where training is available, of the willingness of the workers to accept training and the availability of employment at the end of the training period and the availability of means whereby the worker can be trained.  In the linen, cotton and textile industries there are centres where workers are threatened with redundancy.  At this point in time there are no physical arrangements made for training workers to operate the latest machines.  There is a lack of adequate vocational training centres or, where there are such centres, a lack of equipment because in industries such as the linen and cotton industries, modern equipment is expensive and takes up a good deal of space.</P>
    <P>It may be necessary to think in terms of training workers in centres other than the centre in which they are working at the moment.  While there is reference to this in the Bill, I am not sure that there is a reference to adequate expenses for maintenance in centres.</P>
    <P>There is a further problem that may arise even before training commences. I am referring now to the question of retraining workers made redundant because of the failure of an industry to meet competition or because of the fact that, in order to meet competition, the industry in which they were employed has imported modern equipment which requires fewer hands to operate.  The first problem that will <Col N="2172" /> arise and which will need very great care and attention is the field in which the worker is to be retrained, and the positive possibility of employment for such workers on training.  When you train apprentices in the building trade as carpenters or joiners, they can move to various centres, possibly, in the locality.  This occurs with almost every craftsman but when you are retraining an operative in an industry, in the shoe trade, linen and cotton, woollen and worsted or tobacco or something like that, unless there are openings for further training to handle more advanced equipment in the particular establishment or close to the operative, it is necessary to ensure that there is employment available in that field.  This will require very careful handling and I do not know if it has got the attention it deserves.</P>
    <P>Most of the training today is possibly on-the-job training.  It may be necessary to continue a certain amount of such training, but unless it is carried out in an intelligent and progressive way with a clear and definite objective and with the assistance of experts it will be useless.  A hit-or-miss type of training may be almost worse than no training.  The Minister and Deputies are aware that in certain cases in some modern industries employers believe the way to train operatives is to send one of them, or a person with some slight supervisory responsibility, for a course of a month or two in Europe to study techniques and handling of new equipment. After a short period, he should return and become almost an expert in training operatives in some similar type of equipment.  This is not an intelligent or progressive form of training.</P>
    <P>Another feature of the Bill which might be commented on, although possibly I may not be the best person to do so because I have been a member of An Cheard Comhairle, is that it appears that the provisions of the Bill are somewhat extraordinary in this respect:</P>
    <P>The chairman of An Chomhairle shall be appointed by the Minister either:</P>
    <P>(a)  in a whole-time capacity and subject to a condition that <Col N="2173" /> the chairman act as the Chief Officer, or</P>
    <P>(b) in a part-time capacity,</P>
    <P>It also provides that:</P>
    <P>Of the ordinary members of An Chomhairle, two shall be workers' members, two shall be employers' members, one shall be an educational member and one shall be a representative of the Minister.</P>
    <P>An Cheard Comhairle, the body that has been wiped out by this Bill, consisted of five representatives of the employers and five representatives of the workers to act on a body with a much narrower scope than that covered by this Bill.  This Bill takes in all the functions of the Apprenticeship Board and greatly extends them, and yet the Minister suggests that the membership shall be on the basis of two workers' members and two employers' members.  Membership of An Cheard Comhairle included representatives of educational interests. I am raising this point now because it appears that the extended scope and added responsibility of the Bill would at least justify the membership of An Comhairle Traenála being as large and as widely representative as in the case of An Cheard Comhairle. If this body is to be other than a body which consists of a chairman and chief officer, it appears somewhat strange, since I believe the Minister will expect&mdash;and I hope will get&mdash;the co-operation of both workers' and employers' organisations, that he should have such a sentence as this: On the workers' side one shall be representative of skilled workers and the other shall be representative of other workers....  I should be interested to hear the Minister, when replying to the debate, advert to this and explain why he feels this is either necessary or desirable.</P>
    <P>Secondly, it appears that the Minister is repeating in respect of An Comhairle Traenála in another way what is already the position under the National Apprenticeship Board, except that there is this difference: the industrial training committees, it appears to me, will exercise purely advisory functions.  This is unlike the <Col N="2174" /> procedure adopted in the North and in Britain in regard to similar training legislation.  The training committees in respect of the various industries and trades have some authority and some actual power delegated to them to deal with matters within their own sphere.  As far as I can gather from the Bill, industrial training committees here will be, to all intents and purposes, merely advisory committees.</P>
    <P>The urgency of the Bill was mentioned earlier.  When we reach the time when this Bill becomes an Act and the authority is established, the position of the workers should be given somewhat more consideration than it is given today.  Except with more enlightened employers, the position, in this year of 1966, is that workers are still considered just cogs in the industrial wheel, just items to be taken into account in dealing with production programmes.  Even large-scale employers are reluctant fully to accept and to introduce into their undertakings the types of consultation and co-operation necessary so that workers will feel they are other than inanimate cogs.  The most valuable and essential part of any commercial or industrial undertaking is the workers.</P>
    <P>There is reference in the Bill to the chairman, pension rights, and so on. The position is not quite clear.  It would appear that when this board is established it will have the right to recruit its staff.  Is this a change from the position of the National Apprenticeship Board?  Administrative staff was seconded from the Department of Industry and Commerce to An Cheard Comhairle.  I was a member of that board.  As a Deputy, I followed the reports of the board. Through my trade union, I was aware of the valuable work done by the board.  There is no tribute too high to pay to the various officers, starting with the original chairman and the other officers seconded from the Department, for their services to An Cheard Comhairle.  The position, however, was not too satisfactory. Almost all the semi-State boards were empowered to recruit their own staffs and consequently they had a situation where there could be some continuity. <Col N="2175" /> No matter how much they were interested in the work of An Cheard Comhairle, the seconded officers felt that if an opportunity of promotion in their previous field were available to them they would not be expected to forgo it.  I just wonder if there is any change in respect of the administrative staff under this Bill.</P>
    <P>I do not see written into the Bill a guarantee to all existing staff of An Cheard Comhairle that they will be taken over.  Of course, those who are seconded will be protected but there are quite a few supervisors, assistant supervisors, and so on.  I do not know if any special protection is written into the Bill for these officers or employees of An Cheard Comhairle.  If that has not been done, I suggest the matter be rectified forthwith.</P>
    <P>As there may well be discussions on the various items in the Bill on Committee Stage, I do not think there is any need to deal with the situation at greater length now.  I hope this Bill will set in train positive efforts to secure adequate training for all workers in industry and adequate retraining of workers liable to be redundant. I hope that steps will be taken to ensure that workers liable to be affected&mdash;there are many thousands of them at the present time&mdash;by adverse economic circumstances will be given full protection in the form of adequate redundancy compensation or full maintenance during their period of unemployment.</P>
    <P>Again, I congratulate the Minister for Labour on his appointment.  I hope his problems will not be too great.  I trust that one of his first acts as Minister for Labour will be to reconsider the ESB Bill which became law a short time ago and that he will turn his back on any form of compulsion&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The Minister has had some experience in dealing with labour problems during his term as Minister for Industry and Commerce and I am sure that experience will prove of value to him in his new position.  I am sure he appreciates what many in this country do not yet appreciate, that is, that as far as the worker is concerned, you can bring the horse to the water but you cannot possibly make him drink.  The question of co-operation, not in matters of pious platitudes or good intentions, but in responsible action, will secure the support which has always been forthcoming from workers in industry.  I wish the Minister well on the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a few remarks on this stage of the Bill. We will have plenty of time to ambush it by way of amendment on Committee Stage and we feel that in several respects it invites ambush because in many respects it could be made more useful.  I wish to congratulate the Minister on his appointment to this risky job which he is taking over.  I previously compared the new incumbent to the shorn lamb being led to the slaughter.  Perhaps the imagery was wrong in the present case but the Minister has a difficult job before him and I wish him well in that job.</P>
      <P>I am also glad to see a person with whom I was concerned in certain negotiations going to a post in which I think he will do well, Deputy Colley, going to the Department of Industry and Commerce.  It was quite apparent that industrial training would have to be brought within the ambit of the new Department.  One experience of the Apprenticeship Board was that, doing useful work as it did, it could not take on some of the critical problems of industrial training.  The present Bill at least tells us the size of the problem before us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our employers in the past did not consider industrial training a tremendously <Col N="2177" /> important part of their economic activity.  Their training of their work force was a hit and miss affair.  They did not plan any training programme.  The employers have not been over-anxious about having a really competent training programme. In the free trade future, our work force must at least be as highly skilled as that of our competitors and we cannot afford to be over-confident in that respect at the moment.  The expanding industries of the future will require skills that our workers do not have at the present.</P>
    <P>There are sections of our industries that will be closed up under the new conditions and that will mean the re-training of those workers for industries that will be expanded.  This shows that it was impossible to deal with this matter under the limited provisions of the former Apprenticeship Board.  I presume that the experiences of that Board and the problems they met with are covered in some of the sections of this Act.  There are sections in this Bill which deal with penalties which will at least ensure the co-operation of employers in making the new measure a success.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that in this Bill we are dealing with industrial activity. Some of the so-called training programmes of our new industries backed by foreign capital are far from being proper programmes.  It would seem to me that to apply the description of training programmes to them is to apply a euphemistic term.  They are just another way of getting at the taxpayers' money.  This has been the experience of many trade unions in dealing with these foreign employers.</P>
    <P>There should be no ambiguity about the cash basis of the arrangements for retraining.  This is a problem which we want out of the way as soon as possible. We want the programme relating to redundancy and training to come into operation as quickly as possible. Despite the spate of well-meaning words and despite the so-called unanimity between the parties, the fact of the matter is that when a man becomes redundant and requires retraining for another industry, he can only go to the employment exchange and join the <Col N="2178" /> other people there.  It would seem that we must get away from these expressions of cosy unanimity.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies will be aware of industries that have already closed down in different towns.  I have not had the unfortunate experience yet of explaining to these men without work that the Government have a manpower policy, that the Government are setting up a new Department and that they will be retrained for employment in another industry.  I do not want to have that experience and I hope that the action we are to get from this new Department will not be too long delayed.</P>
    <P>The measure of appropriateness which we see in this Bill before us must give the members of the Labour Party a special feeling of selfrightousness. This is something quite understandable because of our experience.  We are in close touch with the reality of industrial life and we have been agitating for some years for just such a measure because of our consciousness of the necessity for having some co-ordinated scheme of retraining.  I do not know how many teams have returned from the Continent recently with unanimous reports about the necessity for these schemes but there has always been, of course, a lag between the enlightened policy of minority groups and official action. However, it is a hopeful sign that the lag now appears to be growing shorter in duration.  I do not know the reason, but that appears to be the case.</P>
    <P>The statement in the Press today about the trade unions tentative proposals for a five year plan can only help in the proper implementation of this measure.  It is useless talking about a scheme of retraining unless we are approaching full employment and some kind of settlement of the employer-employee conflict.  Until some kind of general peace obtains, we cannot hope to see any training programme properly implemented.  If we cannot achieve a stable situation, we cannot get the best out of any training measure and, until some semblance of peace is restored, we cannot understand how planning can take into <Col N="2179" /> account skills that are disappearing and the training that will be necessary to replace those skills.</P>
    <P>We have tremendously complicated problems and the solution of them will call for the utmost concentration. The trade union viewpoint can only contribute to getting a proper consensus of opinion between employers and trade unions in relation to the pattern of our economic future.  If there is agreement in general terms, Bills such as this will get an easier passage.  Let us be honest about it; there will be problems of implementation on both sides of the industrial structure and, if agreement can be got, there will be progress from the point of view of the provisions in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I do not know that I agree with this idea of appointing a chairman either whole-time or part-time.  If he is whole-time, he will also act as an official.  In our experience of voluntary committees, they are, by and large, so much windowdressing for official action.  If it is to be a real committee, really representative of the interests involved, then the members must be, as far as possible, full-time. The experience where part-time committees are concerned is that the full-time officials make the decisions and the danger from the point of view of this measure would be that full-time officials would make decisions without regard to all the interests involved. The fullest co-operation on the part of the interests involved will be necessary.</P>
    <P>There is a possibility the chairman will be paid.  Will remuneration be involved if he is part-time?  It would be ludicrous if payment were made to a part-time chairman.  I should like all interests to be really representative. A part-time committee, coming together at infrequent intervals to hear reports of activities and of decisions made by full-time officials, would involve the danger of decisions being made by the full-time officials, in which case the committee would become divorced from industrial reality.  That would be very dangerous.</P>

      <P>I shall convey that to him.  It was our intention to have a long period between the Second Stage and the Committee Stage of this measure in order to allow all to communicate with us and to permit of consultation between the Minister, the trade unions, the employers and all others interested.  I hope this period will be availed of now for the purpose I have outlined: I will welcome any criticism.  Judging by the notes I received from the Parliamentary Secretary, I am satisfied the Bill has been welcomed by both Fine Gael and Labour in its general principles and intent.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Leary said we shall suffer an ambush on Committee Stage.  That will be welcome but, perhaps, in the consultations between now and Committee Stage, interested parties may find agreed suggestions for amendments.</P>
      <P>This is a new sphere in which we must succeed and we must, therefore, do everything in our power to ensure success.  When the body is set up, we shall learn from experience and we can make any changes necessary as a result of that experience.  This is a very important area and we must be prepared to be adaptable and flexible. All these matters can be discussed on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>Earlier today Deputy Treacy was of the opinion that this measure should not come before the redundancy measure.  The latter has been prepared and there has been fairly detailed examination of it by the manpower advisory body.  It will be introduced early next session.  Since it does not involve the setting up of a new body or complicated administrative procedures, it will become effective, I think, before the training authority activities commence and the priorities will, therefore, be as Deputy Treacy would desire.  The redundancy measure will be implemented first.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>Some detailed points were raised.  Deputy Donegan thought the levy system may restrict industrial expansion.  I do not think this is so. The levy system should stimulate greater interest in training and the training itself should stimulate industrial expansion.  The total cost of the training will not, of course, be borne by industry but a great deal of it will be borne by the State, which will contribute substantially to the establishment and running of the various training centres.  It was said by many people that there is no point in training unless jobs are available. That is quite true.  However, experience over the last ten years has shown that new types of jobs are becoming available in industry.  It is more than likely that the availability of new jobs will depend on the availability of skilled labour.  Possibly one of the main attractions for industry here will be the availability of trained skilled labour or of easily trained labour.</P>
      <P>As far as the attraction of industry is concerned, the Industrial Development Authority are now having a reappraisal of themselves.  I recently asked them to take on something often raised here by Deputies, that is, aiding Irish industrialists who want to set up in Ireland.  Up to now industrialists from outside the country were helped over the difficulties of setting up here, of getting a site, developing the project and going to an Foras Tionscal. The Irish industrialist was dealt with by the Department of Industry and Commerce.  Some people felt that this was a lesser service to the Irish industrialist. I have now asked the IDA to deal with the Irish promoters of projects in the same way as they deal with foreigners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They have also undertaken a total re-appraisal of their activities and methods of selection and approaching industrialists.  For this purpose they have employed a firm of international consultants experienced in doing this work for other countries who are themselves engaged in this process of <Col N="2182" /> attracting suitable industry.  There is also a research bureau set up in the IDA.  Recently a number of Irish industrialists who have been successful here and who have foreign connections have agreed to act as a panel of advisers to the IDA in this quest for other industries.  A similar panel has been set up consisting of industrialists from Germany who have established subsidiaries here.  A survey of the grants and incentives is also in progress. I believe this review is bound to attract a great deal more industry to this country.</P>
    <P>One of the most important attractions is not the grants and incentives but the availability of trained labour. I recently spent some time travelling and meeting people interested in setting up outside their own country whom we were trying to attract to Ireland.  They regarded the grants merely as something to help them over the growing pains of setting up in a strange country.  The main attraction was the availability of labour.  It is a question of which comes first: the chicken or the egg?  Most people say: why train labour if you have not got the jobs?  I believe the very existence of trained labour will attract jobs.  I am quite optimistic about the outcome of the newly stimulated activity of the IDA.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully spoke on the objection of craft unions to the accelerated vocational training.  I might refer him to the introductory speech by the Parliamentary Secretary who dealt with this matter.  The Parliamentary Secretary gave an assurance that there was no question of flooding the skilled trades with adult trainees.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary dealt quite adequately with this point, as I am sure Deputy Tully will agree if he reads the record of the debate.  Deputy Tully also referred to the problem of training for industry workers leaving agriculture.  This is a problem for the new authority to tackle as best they can.  I agree it will be a big problem. The question was asked if we had any ideas in the Bill based on experience elsewhere.  The answer is that experience elsewhere has been examined <Col N="2183" /> and regard had to the operation in Britain and European countries of the schemes they have.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moore referred to persons over 40 going into new employment and asked if there would be any age limit for re-training.  It is not intended to have an age limit for re-training.  It is hoped that the training authority and the placement service will help to overcome any prejudice against what may seem older workers.  We must all adjust our thinking in this matter. People of that age can, and in other countries do, become re-trained and take up different employment very successfully.</P>
    <P>As I said on another Bill this morning, our thinking will have to be flexible.  We will have to be flexible in our minds in our approach to change.  This is a hard thing to do&mdash; and I am not speaking of any changes happening to me at the moment.  It is not easy for a worker to change.  We must appreciate the difficulties.  If we are afraid of change, however, it will destroy us.  We are coming into a period when there will be rapid changes.  In fact, we are already in it and I think it will accelerate.  Unless we can do away with fear of change and find ways to safeguard our own security and employment in this changing world, we will be overcome by the change.  There is no need to be overcome by change. The whole history of human life has been adaptation to change and, as I say, we must adjust our minds to doing this.</P>
    <P>The inadequacy of the facilities already available was raised by Deputy Treacy, who asked how could the accelerated vocational training course be added to the already hard-pressed system of vocational education.  The answer is these facilities are being improved. It is not intended that the accelerated vocational training course would be entirely dependent on the facilities available in the vocational schools at present.  The Deputy can take it that special centres will have to be set up to meet this problem.</P>

      <P>No, separate centres. It is intended that these schools of technology will deal in a general way with the courses from the common intermediate certificate to the leaving certificate technical side with a number of regional centres for specialist subjects. But for accelerated vocational training, special centres will be set up where the present system of vocational schools cannot meet the situation.</P>
      <P>I have already answered Deputy Treacy's question about the Redundancy Bill.  It will be brought in early in the next session and will be operative before the effects of this Bill can be operative because of the administrative difficulties and because of the fact that a body has to be set up.  The priorities will be as he asked.</P>
