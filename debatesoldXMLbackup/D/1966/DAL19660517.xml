      <P>The number of persons living outside towns and villages, as returned at the 1961 Census of Population, was 1,257,579. The number of persons at work, together with their dependants, in the occupations farmers, farmers' relatives, farm managers, other agricultural occupations and fishermen was 973,179.  Corresponding information for a later period is not available. While the number of persons who left the land in a recent year is not available, it is estimated that the number of persons at work in agriculture, forestry and fishing decreased by 14,000 between April, 1964, and April, 1965.</P>

      <P>Reliable figures for net emigration are available only for intercensal periods.  Between the Censuses of Population in April, 1956 and April, 1961, the total net emigration was 212,003.  For periods since April, 1961, estimates of net emigration are based on the net outward passenger movement by sea and air.  On this basis it is estimated that the total net emigration between April, 1961 and April, 1966, was about 117,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Lynch) Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 3 and 4 together.</P>
      <P>The authority of the Government is not required for the closing of the banks and no order has been made by the Government in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that absolutely certain?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Perhaps I should add this clarification.  There is no legislation under which the banks are required to seek permission to close other than on extraordinary bank holidays.  They close on ordinary bank holidays like August Monday in the ordinary way, but they usually seek permission to close on 1st January each year and the Order in that instance is made under the Public Holidays Act, 1924.  I might further clarify the matter by saying that, prior to the cessation of the Supplies and Services (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1946, which lapsed at the end of 1957, the banks could have been given permission under that Act to close on days other than ordinary bank holidays.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The implication in the question is unfounded.  Issues from the Local Loans Fund for these purposes since 31st December last totalled approximately £2.43m.  All demands on the fund up to 26th April have already been met in full.  Further loan accommodation is being approved as required within the limits of the housing capital allocations for 1966-67 notified to the authorities last March.</P>
      <P>While the portion of these capital allocations intended for house purchase loans and supplementary grants is more than was provided in any recent year, it has not been possible to allocate sufficient funds to meet the full demands for house-purchase loans engendered by the rapid expansion of house building in the private sector in recent years.  In areas where the demand is high I am in co-operation with the housing authorities concerned keeping the position under special review.  I have already recommended such authorities to adopt a liberal attitude in regard to the forward allocation of house-purchase loans and informed them that their allocation for 1967-68 may be assumed to be of the same general order as in 1966-67.</P>
      <P>The allocations for supplementary grants are regarded by housing authorities generally as reasonable in the light of their commitments and anticipated demands.  Particular problems which have arisen in a few areas are being examined.</P>

There is a doubt expressed in the letters to applicants, an implication that the grant may not be paid at all.

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Road tar is supplied to local authorities under the Combined Purchasing Scheme operated by my Department, and the requisite standard of quality is ensured in the first instance by the inclusion in the tender conditions of a requirement that the tar should comply with the terms of the appropriate technical specification for this material.  The standards of quality are also subject to an annual review by my Department with a view to such alteration as may be found necessary from time to time.  The specification applicable at present is B.S. 76/1943 for type A tar with viscosity range 20º to 38º C.E.V.T. Compliance with the specification is ensured by the checking of deliveries by the roads engineers of the local authorities, and by the making of laboratory tests, where judged necessary, in accordance with the statutory <Col N="1763" /> procedure under the Combined Purchasing Scheme.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 26, 27, 28 and 29 together.</P>
      <P>In January, 1965 the banks and their officials established a Joint Industrial Council, the Chairman of which is a conciliation officer of the Labour Court.</P>
      <P>The Constitution of the Joint Industrial Council sets out agreed procedures for resolving disputes between the banks and their officials and I am not proposing to intervene in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the efforts being made in Northern Ireland, can the Minister say if there is anything practical he can do at this stage to bring the parties together?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister feel that he could offer any help to the community operating such things as marts, people who receive cheques from creameries and so on, to keep these people going?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>In answer to Deputy O'Leary, the conciliation service in the Six Counties is attached direct to the Ministry and here the conciliation service has been attached to the Labour Court since the 1946 Act.  As I said, <Col N="1767" /> a conciliation officer is chairman of the Joint Industrial Council and he is in constant touch with both sides.  This is the explanation why action in one place takes the form of action by the Ministry and not here.  I have no reason to believe, and I do not think that any Deputies have reason to assume, that Ministerial intervention has any magic formula for success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be right, but has the Minister any legal power or authority to request the Labour Court to intervene?  Has he any power to ask the two sides to meet the Labour Court?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>Actually, in regard to the machinery set up by the banks the constitution of the Council to which I referred has procedures for direct negotiations between the parties, which took place in this case and were not successful; then there was the consideration of the dispute by the Council, which was not successful in effecting a settlement, and finally, after that, there was the step by which either side could request the setting up of a tribunal.  Neither side has asked that the dispute be referred to the tribunal as provided under the constitution of the Council.  There is adequate machinery to solve the dispute if there was any indication on each side, or on either side, of wanting to solve it.  The machinery is quite adequate and there is no question of someone going in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>No one, least of all the Labour Party, wants the Minister or the Government to intervene in an industrial dispute but surely it would be a good thing if the Minister could indicate to the two parties that they should have recourse to this tribunal or, if necessary, have recourse to the machinery of the Labour Court?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>As I say, the machinery is there.  If either party wants it, all they have to do is ask.  It is not binding unless both agree</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware that the difficulty is that the side <Col N="1768" /> that makes the approach is regarded as the weak side?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy seems to have the idea that there should never be a strike, that there should always be somebody coming in stopping it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Few people are concerned at the present time because there is a bank dispute but repercussions may come later on, and surely the Minister and the Government would not lose face if they made a simple request that these two parties should have recourse to the tribunal or have the Labour Court intervene?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no question of losing face.  The chairman of this Council is an experienced, skilful officer of the Labour Court who is in constant touch and if there was any indication from either side that a settlement could be reached, the machinery is quite adequate.  Deputies cannot assume that Government intervention is the answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that this seems to have the appearance of an extremely long dispute.  As Deputy Corish said, there does not appear to be any public alarm over this dispute, but it could be very damaging in its long-term consequences.  Is it the position that the employers' side do not wish this matter to be referred to the Labour Court?  Is it true that they are sticking their employees to the Council?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an agreed Council. Either side could ask for this procedure. Under the constitution of the Council, either side could ask for the tribunal and this has not happened. You could say that the machinery has not been used.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £3,155,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1967, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Offices of the Minister for Lands and of the Irish Land Commission.</P>
      <P>In line with the agreed procedure adopted for the last two years, I propose to take the Votes for Lands and Forestry together this year also. Accordingly, in my opening remarks, I shall refer to Votes 35 and 36 and at the conclusion of the discussion, the motion in respect of Vote 35 will be put to the House.  Vote 36 will then be formally moved.</P>
      <P>The Lands Vote, No. 35, shows a net decrease of £259,700 compared with last year.  I shall commence by explaining the salient features of this Estimate&mdash;especially those items which reflect a significant change from last year's provision&mdash;and continue with a review of the principal activities of the Land Commission during the year ended 31st March last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Provision for salaries, wages and allowances is made under Subhead A. The additional amount, namely £75,000, required this year is partly attributable to salary increases which were granted following the preparation of last year's estimate and to increases in staff numbers.  In particular, I am arranging for a telling increase in the inspectorate staff, as I am <Col N="1778" /> anxious to get on with the rapid disposal of acquired land and equally to move promptly on the inspection of properties brought to notice.  An extra 25 posts are authorised; some were recently recruited and have taken up duty.  I have also introduced a new post of Deputy Chief Inspector, headquartered in the West, with assigned responsibility for enlarging, co-ordinating and guiding the campaign towards purposeful Land Settlement which I am determined to have there.  The allotment of the Oranmore and Browne Estate amongst upwards of 50 allottees was very welcome.  This property of 1,000 acres was aggregated with other nearby lands in the possession of the Land Commission with the result that it was possible to frame a comprehensive and satisfying resettlement scheme for the particular area, embracing enlargements, rearrangements, part-exchanges and a number of new full holdings; this is illustrative of the type of land structural reform which I would hope to see accomplished more generally in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>The first part of Subhead B relates for the most part to travelling and subsistence expenses incurred in connection with the inspection, survey and allotment of lands under the Land Acts.  Provision for incidental and miscellaneous expenses such as advertisements, etc., is also included.  The extra amount, namely £8,050, this year is required for the most part to meet the travelling and subsistence expenses of the inspection outdoor staff.</P>
    <P>Part (2) of Subhead B provides for payment direct to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs for all services rendered by that Department.  This has now become standard procedure.  The total amount required this year is £48,000.</P>
    <P>The moneys required under Subhead D are in the nature of statutory commitments. They represent the tax-payers' contribution in the current year towards the service of land purchase debt accumulated, since 1923, on both tenanted and untenanted land.  The total contribution this year, viz. £1,108,770, constitutes the biggest individual <Col N="1779" /> item in the Vote and represents 35 per cent of the entire net Estimate. Of the total Subhead provision, some £954,600 will be utilised to make good deficiencies in the Land Bond Fund arising from the statutory halving of annuities under the Land Act, 1933.  Indeed, the overall increase of £52,830 in the Subhead this year is attributable mainly to the halving of purchase instalments payable by new allottees as land settlement proceeds.</P>
    <P>Deputies will, of course, be aware that under the provisions of section 7 of the Land Act, 1965 certain classes of persons who now receive allotments of land on an annuity basis in non-congested areas do not benefit from the halving of annuities under the Land Act, 1933, the classes being (i) recipients of enlargements, and (ii) cottiers and other persons who get allotments in non-congested areas. But all allottees in congested areas, together with migrants and displaced employees getting holdings in non-congested areas, continue to get the benefit of the halving of annuities.</P>
    <P>Section 24 of the Land Act, 1965, provides that whenever a purchase annuity lapses by reason of the operation of the Statute of Limitations, 1957, the resultant deficit shall not remain a charge on the ratepayers but shall, where necessary, be defrayed out of public funds.  A number of annuities payable out of holdings situated mainly on remote islands are becoming affected by the Statute of Limitations, 1957.  Subhead D includes a sum of £150 to meet resultant deficiencies in the current year.</P>
    <P>As I am referring to the 1965 Land Act, I might mention that before the provisions could be fully implemented it was necessary to make statutory regulations under certain of the vital sections.  Some of these regulations were by their very nature very complex and had to receive careful examination by the Attorney General, the Parliamentary Draftsman and by my other advisers.  I was not, therefore, in a position until February of this year to operate the order implementing provisions in section 13 of the Land Act, 1965 for a &ldquo;stop notice&rdquo; in land sales. <Col N="1780" /> Broadly speaking, the same considerations apply to sections 5 and 6 of the Act, to which I will be referring in more detail later on.</P>
    <P>As this subhead is in four separate parts, I think I can best deal with it by referring to each part individually.</P>
    <P>Subhead G.1 involves two items, namely, the purchase of land by the Land Commission for cash in the open market and the provision of life annuities under section 6 of the Land Act, 1965.  Up to last year, cash purchases under section 27, Land Act, 1950 were restricted to lands required for migrants' holdings or for rearrangement of fragmented holdings.  As Deputies are aware, however, these hampering restrictions have been set aside by the repeals section of the Land Act, 1965 and purchases for cash can now be made for all the general purposes of the Land Acts.  During the year ended 31st March last, a total of 68 properties, aggregating 4,326 acres, were purchased for cash under section 27 at a price of £338,000.</P>
    <P>Section 6 of the Land Act, 1965, provides that where elderly, incapacitated or blind persons voluntarily sell their interest in land to the Land Commission, the Land Commission may, at the option of the vendor, and in lieu of payment in cash in whole or in part of the purchase price, provide the vendor with a life annuity.  Substantial progress has been made with the Department of Finance on the preparation of the detailed regulations and actuarial tables which are necessary to make the section fully operative and these regulations will be finalised shortly.  It is encouraging to note that some 57 applications or inquiries relating to section 6 have been received to date and will be dealt with when the regulations are operative.</P>
    <P>The funds being provided this year under Subhead G.1 amount to £175,000 &mdash;representing a cut back of £190,000 on last year's provision.  I need hardly remind Deputies that in common with other Departments, the Lands programme has necessarily to bear some limitations on public spending just at the present time.  However, the main bulk of land acquisition by the Land <Col N="1781" /> Commission is financed in land bonds issued under Land Bond Orders made annually by the Minister for Finance. A new series of bonds, of the total amount of £2.5 million bearing interest at the rate of 7 per cent per annum has been created by the Land Bond Order, 1966, for use in the current year.  This large amount of £2½ million should more than compensate for the temporary curtailment which is unavoidable in the cash sector, in the present stringency.  The cash provision has, of course, in the past proved a decided advantage to the Land Commission in purchasing some useful properties which would otherwise have fallen into the hands of non-nationals. This danger, however, has now been eliminated as section 45 of the Land Act, 1965, provides a system of absolute control by the Land Commission over such purchases.  Taking these factors into account and having regard to the strengthened acquisition and resumption powers of the Land Commission which will have the effect of speeding up considerably the acquisition of vacant and let lands, I felt that for this single year we might tolerate a cut back on this Subhead and at the same time maintain the land intake figure at a satisfactory level.</P>
    <P>The second part of Subhead G stems from section 5 of the Land Act, 1965, which enables the Land Commission to make loans to progressive farmers in congested areas for the purchase of viable farms of their choice, subject to making their existing lands available to the Land Commission for land settlement purposes.  As in the case of the life-annuities scheme under section 6, appropriate regulations requiring the consent of the Minister for Finance are necessary before the loans scheme can be operated and these regulations are expected to be ready at an early date. A sum of £45,000 is proposed for the scheme in the current year.</P>
    <P>Subhead G.3 provides £10,000 for payment in cash of compensation for tenancy interests resumed on the small outstanding residue of Congested Districts Board estates.  The fourth and final part of the subhead relates to the payment by the Land Commission of <Col N="1782" /> auctioneers' commission on relevant purchases of land for cash and land bonds.  The amount provided for this purpose last year was £35,000 and it is anticipated that £70,000 will be required this year.  This is a big figure but I welcome it and I hasten to acknowledge the co-operation of auctioneers and the new disposition that has been found between them and my Department.  I should say that the provision has proved a decided asset in inspiring the voluntary sale of properties and my own preference is for voluntary rather than compulsory transactions.</P>
    <P>Subhead H provides the funds for payment of gratuities, pursuant to section 29 of the Land Act, 1950, to persons displaced from employment on estates taken over by the Land Commission for distribution.  Last year, gratuities totalling £14,452 were paid to 64 ex-employees&mdash;an average of £225 each.  Perhaps I should reiterate that displaced employees who are deemed competent to work land are automatically considered for allotments&mdash;indeed, this is only right and proper&mdash;but, where they are not found to be suitable for allotments, they are considered by the Land Commission for a cash gratuity, depending on such factors as length of service, personal and family circumstances, availability of alternative employment and so on. It is difficult to make an accurate forecast of commitments under the subhead in any particular year because this depends on the level of acquisition activity and the extent to which estate workers become displaced from employment through these activities.  With continuing impetus in the acquisition sector, it is anticipated that £14,000 will be required for the current year.</P>
    <P>Subhead I&mdash;£675,000&mdash;in the main, provides the funds required to meet the cost of the various estate improvement works which are such an important feature of land settlement.  These works include the erection of dwelling houses and out-offices; the provision of access roads; fencing and drainage; provision of water supply for domestic and stock requirements; turbary development; repair and maintenance of embankments. <Col N="1783" /> Subhead I is invariably a popular debating sector in the Lands Vote.  Last year, the amount provided under Subhead I was £900,000 and expenditure totalled approximately £908,000, including about £552,000 on building works.  Some 630 men were employed on the various improvement works in the course of the year and their wage bill amounted to almost £264,000.  I might mention here that the Land Commission have recently undertaken, on an experimental basis, the erection of a new type of out-office on holdings being provided for migrants and displaced employees.  This consists of a three-bay hayshed with lean-to byre for twelve cows with feed store and dairy.  Technical opinion is that this type of flexible accommodation will constitute a good basic set of out-buildings which will be readily adaptable.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the current acute pressure on resources the provision under Subhead I for the coming year has been fixed at £675,000.  This will mean that the building programme which normally accounts for a very large proportion of expenditure under the Subhead will have to be curtailed for the year ahead.  I can assure the House, however, that there will be no slackening in the tempo of other land structural reform measures.  Special emphasis will be given to the direct allotment of additional land to bring smallholders up to the current family farm standard.  The provision of buildings does not generally arise in these cases and the usual range of estate improvements works&mdash;roads, fences and drains&mdash;will be carried through as far as practicable.</P>
    <P>Deputies will notice that a new subitem entitled &ldquo;Housing Loans&rdquo; has been inserted in the Subhead.  This refers to the scheme under which advances up to £500 are made to farmers to supplement grants from the Department of Local Government for the erection of new houses and for reconstruction work on existing houses. During the past year the total amount sanctioned for this purpose was £116,000.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1784" /> While on the subject of estate improvements, I should say that work study techniques continue to be applied to Land Commission fencing, drainage and roadmaking operations.  Since the introduction of the Incentive Bonus Scheme six years ago the productivity of Land Commission workers has increased by 58 per cent.  During the past financial year alone, the scheme resulted in increased earnings, aggregating £33,100, for the workmen, while increased productivity resulted in savings worth £60,700 in the cost of the improvements works concerned.</P>
    <P>Grants for the preservation and improvement of game resources are provided under Subhead L&mdash;£60,000&mdash;to assist Regional Game Councils, representative of all appropriate interests, in carrying out approved locally-organised schemes of direct improvement to game.  In the main, these schemes include provision for the re-stocking of game, improvement of habitat and selective control of predators.  Despite the prevailing economic stringency, it has been found possible this year again to increase the provision for game development.</P>
    <P>Good progress continues to be made by the 24 Game Councils which have been established throughout the country.  Last year grants totalling some £40,000 were paid in respect of current schemes of game improvement in addition to grants amounting to £5,210 in respect of some previous years' schemes.</P>
    <P>The 1965 hatching and rearing programme of the Quarantine Station operated by the County Dublin Game Council, to which I referred when speaking on last year's Estimate, was, I am glad to say, very successful. Deputies may be interested to learn that over 5,000 game birds, pheasant, partridge and quail were successfully reared and distributed to Game Councils and others concerned with game breeding.  This hatch is, I think, very nearly a record.</P>
    <P>These birds have been well received by the game councils and there are hopes for an overall improvement in the quality of our stocks.  Consideration <Col N="1785" /> is being given to further importation of game birds' eggs and, in this context, consultations are taking place between my Department and the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries with a view to establishing a suitable balance between the hatching and rearing of birds of native strains and of imported strains at the Quarantine Station.</P>
    <P>I spoke last year about the importance of the setting up of sanctuaries or refuges for game birds, particularly for wildfowl, native and migratory, and referred to our international responsibilities for the conservation of the migratory species.  On my recent visit to England to study the practice of game and wildlife development there, I was particularly struck by the cordial co-operation between sporting, agricultural and nature conservation interests.  I saw very quickly that the work of conservationists and that of sportsmen are not inimical but are, in fact, complementary and of mutual benefit.  I would like to see similar co-operation here&mdash;particularly in a national build-up of conservancy or &ldquo;bird refuge&rdquo; areas where wildfowl can be encouraged to breed.  This would be of tremendous benefit to our sportsmen as a whole; they should realise that &ldquo;conservation&rdquo; today simply means wise and careful management and development of our resources for man's use and benefit.</P>
    <P>The aim of conservation and development measures is to build up and maintain sound stocks of game and native-breeding wildfowl, to cater for the legitimate needs of our sportsmen and of visitors alike.  As was recently announced, I have appointed a joint management committee, comprising senior officers of my Department and of Bord Fáilte, for the specific purpose of developing projects for the provision, promotion and sale of shooting for visiting sportsmen.</P>
    <P>The co-operation and goodwill of local game development interests will, of course, be essential factors in the success of the work of this committee. In order to assure in advance full understanding of the functions and objectives of the committee, I recently convened a meeting of representatives <Col N="1786" /> of all game councils, at which this matter and also all aspects of local game development were discussed in a frank and cordial atmosphere.  I am happy to say that the setting-up of the committee and its intended lines of activity met with general acceptance on the part of the game councils.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise that the committee will in its activities be seriously concerned to ensure that conflict or rivalry will not arise between our sportsmen and gunclubs on the one hand and the genuine sporting visitor on the other.</P>
    <P>The Game Branch of my Department has been strengthened by the recruitment of scientific and advisory personnel; arrangements have been made for specialised training of these officers in up-to-date techniques of game management and conservation and their knowledge and experience will soon be available to Regional Game Councils and others engaged in the conservation and improvement of our game resources.  This will enable the Department to take a much more active part in game development generally.</P>
    <P>I have dealt in some detail with the more important subheads of the Lands Vote.  As the remaining items are either unchanged from last year or else are token provisions, they do not seem to call for specific comment, but if Deputies wish to obtain further information about them I shall, of course, gladly supply it.  I propose, therefore, to continue by reviewing the principal activities of the Land Commission during the year ended 31st March last. In some instances the statistics are still provisional but they are unlikely to vary to any significant extent from the final returns.  The over-all results are very satisfactory.</P>
    <P>On the acquisition side, the aggregate area inspected during the year was 67,000 acres while the total intake of land amounted to about 33,000 acres. As the total area in the acquisition machine at 31st March, 1966, amounted to about 63,000 acres, acquisition prospects for the current year also are particularly good.</P>
    <P>As regards land settlement, the total <Col N="1787" /> area allotted amongst some 2,650 allottees was in the region of 50,000 acres which is amongst the best achievements since the war and is the result of very solid and sustained effort.  The acreage distributed included the provision of 120 fully-equipped holdings for migrants and the rearrangement of 500 fragmented holdings.  In all 150 new dwellinghouses and 227 new out-offices were provided for tenants and allottees during the year.  With the increased staff that has been made available I am hopeful that this accelerated rate of land division can be maintained in the present year.</P>
    <P>The vesting of holdings and allotments was continued and, in all, approximately 3,200 holdings, parcels and rights of turbary were dealt with. Tenanted land&mdash;including residues of CDB estates&mdash;outstanding for vesting at 31st March, 1966, comprises approximately 6,400 holdings.  These residual holdings, situated for the most part in western congested counties, now represent the remaining hard core of difficult tenanted land cases: they are being released for vesting according as the necessary rearrangement, enlargement or other improvement is carried out.</P>
    <P>The position as regards collection of land annuities continues satisfactory. Out of a collectable total of £2,655,043 for the year, the amount actually collected by 31st March, 1966, was £2,526,212.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to the fact that there is now in operation a system of direct control by the Land Commission over the purchase of rural land by persons who are not &ldquo;qualified persons&rdquo; as defined in section 45 of the Land Act, 1965&mdash;principally non-nationals. It is probably true to say that the measures taken are acting as a brake on the inflationary trend in agricultural land prices which now appear to have reverted to a more reasonable level.  On the whole the general guideline in force is that permission would not be granted to non-nationals to purchase land in order to engage simply in those forms or lines of production commonly practised by our own farmers; <Col N="1788" />&ldquo;white-elephant&rdquo; properties unable or unlikely to attract Irish purchasers in the market could be entertained for sale to outsiders.</P>
    <P>A non-national who could illustrate that he was going in for some special line with expertise and capital to back it up, and with export possibilities, could very well be acceptable.  Since the passing of the Land Act, 1965, on 9th March, 1965, up to 31st March, 1966, the number of non-national purchases exceeding 50 acres permitted has been 22, amounting to 5,100 acres. Of this acreage, half was accounted for by three transactions affecting large properties, that is to say: (a) an extensive area noted as a wildfowl habitat; (b) a substantial property encumbered with buildings carrying a rateable valuation of £162. 10; and (c) a large stud farm disposed of as a going concern.</P>
    <P>Turning to the Forestry Vote there is a net decrease of £204,200 in the amount being provided as compared with the Vote for 1965-66.  While there are a number of changes, upwards or downwards in other subheads, this decrease reflects a drop of £201,500 in the provision for Forest Development and Management.  This arises mainly from the decision of the Government to cut back planting in 1966-67 to 20,000 acres but is also influenced by other economies arising from the use of new and improved methods.</P>
    <P>The decision to confine the planting programme to 20,000 acres in 1966-67 was taken in the context of the Government's general policy in relation to the stabilisation of State expenditure and in particular of public capital expenditure.  Taking the individual headings of the Vote, the position is as follows:</P>
    <P>Subhead A&mdash;£760,000&mdash;provides for salaries, wages and allowances and shows an increase of £101,990 over the original provision for 1965-66 of £658,010, and of £82,349 over the actual out turn for the year.  The out-turn in 1965-66 was greater than the provision because of some salary increases not provided for in the original Estimate.  This year's figure <Col N="1789" /> includes provision for additional forester staff and allows also for the impact of normal incremental progression.</P>
    <P>The provision under Subhead B.1 &mdash;£155,500&mdash;for Travelling and Incidental Expenses shows an increase of £10,300 on the provision for 1965-66 and an increase of £3,584 on the actual outturn of £152,016 for that year. Increases in travelling costs, arising in the main from continuing expansion of activities, have been partly offset by anticipated savings on &ldquo;Advertising and Publicity&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The provision in Subhead B.2 for Post Office Services at £34,000 shows a decrease of £3,500 on the provision for 1965-66.  The actual out turn in that year was £37,383.</P>
    <P>Subhead C.1 is a Grant-in-Aid for the acquisition of land.  The balance in the Fund at the end of 1965-66 was £141,732 so that a total of £281,732 will be available for land purchase in 1966-67.</P>
    <P>Expenditure in 1965-66 totalled £115,822 and covered purchase of 21,645 acres in 486 individual transactions. The productive area acquired was only slightly over 18,000 acres and was, I regret to say, the lowest annual intake of productivity lands since 1956-57.  Experience during the past year shows increasing difficulty in maintaining an adequate intake of plantable land and the prospects of improvement in the current year are not bright.  Our plantable reserve position, at an effective level of only about 50,000 acres, is, however, much too low for proper and orderly development of new plantations and we must redouble our efforts to improve the intake rate.  I am satisfied that the amount which it is proposed to provide will cover the best results we can hope to achieve this year.</P>
    <P>Subhead C.2 covering Forest Development and Management, at £2,921,500 shows, as I stated earlier, a decrease of some £200,000 on the provision for 1965-66.  The actual out-turn for 1965-66 was £2,884,704.</P>
    <P>The provisions on the individual heads of this subhead are (1) £212,500 for State Forest Nurseries, (2) £846,000 <Col N="1790" /> for Establishment of Plantations, (3) £445,000 for New Roads and Buildings, (4) £960,000 for General Forest Management, (5) £140,000 for Timber Conversion and (6) £318,000 for Mechanical Equipment for Forest Development and Management.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned that the planting programme is being reduced, as an economy measure, to 20,000 acres, as against the normal target of 25,000 acres and an actual accomplishment in 1965-66 of approximately 23,500 acres.  The economies resulting from the reduced programme in 1966-67 affect particularly the provisions for nurseries and establishment of plantations.</P>
    <P>Under the Nurseries head there is also an allowance for savings from continuing improvement in nursery techniques.  Despite the reduced planting programme the provision for establishment of plantations is up on the 1965-66 provision, due mainly to the transfer to this head of provision for certain drainage work previously charged to general forest management; the amount involved in 1966-67 is £150,000.</P>
    <P>The provision for new roads and buildings at £445,000 shows a decrease of £92,000 against the 1965-66 provision but actual expenditure in that year was, in fact, below the level projected for 1966-67.  The fall-off in actual expenditure which occurred in 1965-66 and which is expected to continue this year arises partly from a continuing trend towards better organisation of road construction programmes and elimination of costly methods associated with small isolated annual programmes.  There is now a greater tendency to question the merits of constructing management roads soon after planting in cases where the basic road network could not be established before planting.  These management roads, as distinct from the more intensive network required at thinning stage, serve primarily the objective of better fire-protection but, in cases where the fire-risk is low, it is now considered more economic to defer road-construction until thinning stage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1791" /> Under general forest management, the burden of cost continues to grow annually with the extension of the State forest area but the transfer of some drainage charges to the establishment of plantations head which I have already mentioned, coupled with an expected saving arising from improvements in the methods of controlling competing vegetation in young plantations and some anticipated savings in the construction of firelines, have brought about a net reduction under the general forest management head.</P>
    <P>The aggregate of the sums provided for labour under the various heads comes to £2,221,000 and allows for the incidence in the current year of 53 pay-days. The average labour force which expenditure of that order is sufficient to cover is approximately 4,400 as compared with an average number employed of 4,668 in 1965-66 and 4,812 in 1964-65.  The curtailment in planting programme, accounting for a fall of approximately 100 in the average employment level, is not the most significant factor contributing to the reduction in labour force since 1964-65.  The major cause of the decline is the progressive decrease in operational costs in connection with nurseries, roads and general forest management to which I have already referred.  I need hardly emphasise that falling cost incidence is conducive to a more economic return from the State's capital investment in forestry.</P>
    <P>Subhead C.3 which provides for the Department's two fixed sawmills, shows practically no change on the provision or out turn for 1965-66.</P>
    <P>Expenditure on Subhead D, which provides for grants for afforestation purposes, for 1965-66 was £17,334 against a provision of £17,500.  The increased provision of £25,000 for 1966-67 is, in part, due to the fact that second instalments of grants now falling due are at the £20 per acre rate but is mainly designed to ensure that the fund available will be adequate to meet applications.  Payment of grant was sanctioned in respect of new planting of 1,054 acres in 1965-66.</P>
    <P>Despite propaganda and publicity, <Col N="1792" /> the availability of a grant of £20 per acre and free technical advice, the annual volume of private planting seems to have settled at about 1,000 acres per annum.  During 1965-66 the Department's mobile exhibit attended fourteen shows.  Lectures were given at 13 centres and the scheme whereby demonstration plantings sponsored by &ldquo;Trees for Ireland&rdquo; were subsidised by the Department was continued for a further year.</P>
    <P>The provision of £33,500 under Subhead E deals with Forestry Education and is £1,560 up on the provision for last year.  The increase arises from normal incremental progression of staff and increases in food and general costs.</P>
    <P>The provision for Agency, Advisory and Special Services in Subhead F at £30,000 shows an increase of £10,000 on the provision for 1965-66.  Actual outturn for that year was £18,493.  The increased provision is attributable to expenses which will be incurred in 1966-67 in connection with a comprehensive expert examination of the economies of pulpwood utilisation in Irish conditions, including a survey of all potential forms of processing.  This survey, which was envisaged in the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i>, is designed to assist in securing optimum market development against the increasing production of thinnings from the State forests.</P>
    <P>The provision of £35,000 under Subhead G, for the John Fitzgerald Kennedy Memorial Park, which exceeds the provision for 1965-66 by £10,000 and actual expenditure in that year by £26,383, is intended to cover the cost of some roads and of preliminary work on buildings and water supply, as well as the purchase of specimens and the normal day-to-day running of the Park site.</P>
    <P>During the year site-planning of the Park was completed and the arboretum area was surveyed and gridded. The forest plot area has also been marked out.  The design of the main Park buildings has been completed as has a water supply survey.  Planting has commenced in the forest plot area and shelter planting to protect less hardy specimens has been undertaken <Col N="1793" /> in the arboretum.  A phenological garden has been opened in the Park and a meterological station has been completed on the site and is operational.</P>
    <P>Subhead H, which covers Appropriations-in-Aid, represents, mainly, the sale of produce from State forests. The provision this year at £762,500 is £150,500 greater than in 1965-66. Actual receipts in that year, however, were more than £710,000.</P>
    <P>The market for forest produce continues to be buoyant and could absorb additional supplies of sawlog and pulpwood timber if such supplies were available from the State forests.  While fluctuation in supply&mdash;particularly in sawlog sizes&mdash;is inevitable there can be no doubt of steadily increasing supplies becoming available as the produce of the increasing planting programmes during the years is taken out of the forests.  As I have already stated when dealing with Subhead F a survey of utilisation of increasing forest produce commenced recently and preliminary reports are expected during the year. The total area of plantations now held by the Department is 450,000 acres distributed in 190 different forest centres throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I want to assure the House that this Estimate provides for all work necessary to the proper care and protection of our existing plantations.  The capital investment value of the State forest estate now stands at a figure of over £50 million and the safeguarding of this investment by a full standard of maintenance is of paramount importance. The Estimate as presented meets these requirements in every respect and, on this basis, I can confidently recommend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Estimate presented by the Minister this year displays every evidence of the cold hand of economies.  I wish to say how very disappointed I am and how very disappointed the country will be, having regard to the hopes raised by the Government when the recent Land Act was being passed through the House. At the same time, I feel that the report which the Minister has made <Col N="1794" /> and in which he referred to the fact that during the year ended 31st March last a total of 68 properties comprising 4,326 acres was bought for cash at a price of £338,000 is heartening because I welcome any move on the part of the Land Commission to purchase property for cash.</P>
      <P>The Minister gave us a very carefully-worded record of what the Land Commission have been doing in the past 12 months.  It is very easy to present a report to the Dáil on the workings of institutions like the Land Commission but one would imagine that the Minister would have availed of this opportunity, now that the Land Act has been functioning for some time, to give us some idea of the Government's general broad policy in regard to the Department of Lands. It is all right to give us a report on the activities of the Land Commission. We all know the Land Commission are a big body who move very slowly.  In my opinion, the Land Commission are bound up in volumes of red tape and many of these volumes of red tape appear to be in tight black knots.  I had expected the Minister would take some practical steps to shake off some of the volumes of red tape which seem to tie down the Land Commission.</P>
      <P>It is not generally understood throughout the country why the working of the Land Commission is so tedious.  I am afraid the Land Commission are completely understaffed, particularly in regard to their outdoor activities.  Those engaged in such outdoor activities appear to be greatly overworked.  It is time to stop tinkering with the setting up of our people on the land and to keep them on the land.  It is certainly time to take stock of the whole situation in this respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister must know that at the present time there is a very serious drift from the land.  There is clear and ample evidence that smallholders and others are disposing of their properties for one reason or another.  Many are emigrating and many are seeking employment in the cities.  It is a serious situation when we see the drift from the land continuing.  We know that 60,000 holdings in this country are too small.  That, <Col N="1795" /> in turn, means that there are 60,000 families living or trying to eke out an existence on holdings which are not capable of giving them a decent standard of living.  It naturally follows that the owners of these holdings must go where a good standard of living will be forthcoming.</P>
    <P>In the past 12 months there has been a vast increase in the numbers leaving the land.  I repeat that it is a very serious situation which must gravely concern the Minister for Lands or any Minister whose primary responsibility it is to set up on the land as many families as possible.  I had expected that many more people would have been inclined to avail of the provisions of the Land Act, that many elderly, incapacitated persons voluntarily would have sold their land to the Land Commission.  The Minister, when this Bill was going through the House, had really high hopes of the provisions in section 6 which were welcomed by all sides and all Parties in this House. Now, we are told that there are just some 57 applications or inquiries relating to that section.  The Minister seems to think that that is encouraging. It might be encouraging if we had any ray of hope that we would have as many inquiries, or applications next year or the year after.  Is it not a fact that the applications which have now been made under section 6 of the Land Act, 1965, a total of 57, represent all people who wanted to avail of its provisions?</P>
    <P>The Minister might at some future date, or when replying later, tell us how many of the 57 are actually applications from elderly or incapacitated persons who desire to sell their lands to the Land Commission under the provisions of the section and how many are mere inquiries.  There is a difference between an inquiry about the provisions of section 6 and an actual application under the section.  The Minister might be able to give the House a little more information in that regard.</P>
    <P>I should like to express my disappointment again at the manner in which the land programme has been cut.  Spending appears to be more <Col N="1796" /> drastically cut.  It is wrong, and must be very wrong, to cut down on the spending of public money used for setting people up on the land.  It is most regrettable that the money provided for the purchase of large tracts of land which come on the public market is not available, that the State has not sufficient funds at its disposal to purchase these tracts of land in order to assist an uneconomic holder or a congest in congested areas who may be very anxious to get out of the congested districts.</P>
    <P>The cutting down on the land programme and the limitation on public spending this year are not in the national interest.  I cannot understand why there should be a very serious cutting down on public spending in relation to land or forestry.  I shall deal specifically with forestry later.  I think all this is being penny wise and pound foolish.  What greater national investment could there be than the investment of public money in the purchase of land for those who are in the congested districts, so that those who are now put to the pin of their collar to exist on small holdings might be given a decent and better living on the land?</P>
    <P>One would imagine that the provision of a decent holding for those who are anxious to live on the land should be the primary concern of the Government.  It is common knowledge that in rural Ireland today there are very many who would be anxious to remain on the land, marry, settle down and rear families.  But we also have very great difficulty in obtaining the land on which to live.  The Land Commission is the only machinery whereby the smallholder, the uneconomic holder or the farmer's son who is not afraid to work and who is anxious to work but who is not in a position to buy a holding of his own can obtain land.  Such people appear to be in the majority and they have to look to the Land Commission.  That is why I say with a very great sense of regret that it is too bad that such a brake has been put on public spending by the Land Commission.  This is work which should be undertaken with the utmost speed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1797" /> The Minister must be aware of the fact that there are very many smallholders in this country today who depend on conacre land.  Those who have to take land by conacre never seem to be able to improve their standard of living on this type of land. Usually they have to pay a high fixed price for it.  The fixed price will be the highest which the land realises at a public auction.  Very often many of those smallholders have to compete against the bids of their very well-to-do neighbours.  In many cases these conacre tenants with large families have to depend on the weather, the markets available for their crops &mdash; whether wheat, oats, beet or barley&mdash;and on the prices governing these crops.  At the end of it all, in many cases they have to manure the land and must run the risk of losing it at the end of the 11 month term.  It is regrettable that a little more encouragement is not given to these people who have proved themselves both hardworking and industrious and who have demonstrated their anxiety to engage in the production of crops from the land.</P>
    <P>However, it is gratifying to note&mdash; this is one of the redeeming features of this Estimate&mdash;that we have now reached the stage at which a brake is put on the purchase of land by non-nationals.  The Land Act of 1965 makes it necessary for the approval of the Land Commission to be sought before lands can be sold to an alien. I would ask the Minister to bear in mind the lands purchased before the introduction of the 1965 Act.</P>
    <P>In the years before that aliens, notably Germans, purchased large tracts of what many of us regard as reasonably good land.  I think the time has now come when the Land Commission should consider how these lands held by aliens are being worked and, should the opportunity arise, the Land Commission should consider acquiring these lands, more particularly in those cases in which the owners are not dependent on them for a livelihood. Some of these aliens have other professions abroad.  Many are company directors.  Some have other occupations outside this State from which they derive <Col N="1798" /> their incomes.  Some go abroad for long periods.  Some regard these lands as something for recreational purposes, as something to enable them to recuperate away from the spheres of activity in which they are normally engaged.</P>
    <P>Smallholders living on very limited acreages have to pay big money for conacre.  They are compelled to do that in order to rear their families. That is something the Land Commission should keep in mind.  I want to pay tribute to the Land Commission for the manner in which they have kept this matter under review during the past 12 months.  There is ample evidence that arable land is not now falling into the hands of undesirables. I take it that supervision will continue.  The only drawback is that it is akin to closing the stable door when the horse has gone, but I appeal to the Minister and the Department to continue keeping under review all lands purchased by aliens prior to the passing of the 1965 Act.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to loans made available to farmers in the congested areas to purchase viable farms of their choice.  A sum of £45,000 is being provided for that purpose in this year's Estimate.  I wonder are farmers generally in the congested areas, anxious to purchase farms of their choice, aware that these facilities are available.  One would expect, with the number of progressive farmers living in the congested areas, that there would have been a greater demand on the finances available for the purchase of holdings.  It may be that suitable holdings did not come on the market, but I would recommend progressive farmers in the congested areas to avail of these provisions.  I expect that this sum of £45,000 is the estimate made by the Minister's Department as to what will be required this year for this scheme. We all know that £45,000 will not buy very many holdings.  Practically any kind of holding now commands a sum of from £3,000 to £8,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so.  I am glad the Minister made the complimentary references he did to the co-operation <Col N="1799" /> he has received from auctioneers.  Auctioneers are always anxious to get the best possible price they can for their customers.  It is gratifying to note that the Land Commission is a good buyer from that point of view.  My personal experience and I think I can speak as the vice-president of the auctioneers association of this country is that there has been the greateest possible spirit of co-operation between the Land Commission and the auctioneers, and that is as it should be.  I should like to take this opportunity of expressing to the Minister the thanks and the appreciation of the auctioneers in this matter.  The auctioneers and the Land Commission can both work to mutual advantage.  The auctioneers have already expressed their thanks and appreciation to the Minister for the payment of fees on all cash purchases by the Land Commission.  That has been a step in the right direction and has most certainly been responsible for providing a pool of land for the Land Commission which it would never otherwise have got.</P>
      <P>When auctioneers make inquiries as to whether or not a possible purchaser is likely to be approved by the Land Commission, I have heard of the great efficiency and speed which the officers of the Land Commission have shown in their effort to facilitate the auctioneers. Not alone have they been facilitating the auctioneers but they have been facilitating the vendors as well who are very anxious to know whether or not such an interested party would be approved.  It is very important that that good service should be maintained between the auctioneers and the Land Commission because, if a vendor puts his property on the market for sale and has a number of inquiries, it is only right that the Land Commission should be as speedy as possible in giving an opinion on whether or not the proposed purchaser is likely to be approved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would facilitate matters very much if, where an inquiry had to be disposed of without delay, the senior Land Commission official in each of <Col N="1800" /> the divisions were permitted to say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo;, on the spot.  There might be some delay, which would result in some financial loss to the vendor, while awaiting a speedy decision from the Land Commission. These inquiries are usually made before any contract for sale is signed. Naturally, it will be the job of the auctioneer to get for his customer the highest and the best possible price. That is why he is engaged and that is his job.  At the same time, he will want to take steps to guard himself against the signing of a contract by a person who, on investigation, will not be approved as a suitable purchaser by the Land Commission.  If the chief inspector in each of the divisions could be approached either by the auctioneers or the solicitors and his opinion sought on the possibility of having such and such a purchaser approved, and if he were at liberty to say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; I think it would facilitate matters very much.  However, I do say that the general body of auctioneers, at the moment at any rate, seem to have no complaints in so far as their dealings with the Land Commission are concerned and, as I say, co-operation of that kind can be a great help to both the Land Commission and the auctioneers.</P>
    <P>I agree very fully with what the Minister says about favouring a voluntary rather than a compulsory transaction. A voluntary deal, a voluntary transaction, is always the most satisfactory. The compulsory acquisition of land may at times be necessary but I really feel that if a voluntary deal can be made, then, in nine times out of ten, it is the most satisfactory transaction. It would be very regrettable if the experienced men at the purchase end of the Land Commission were debarred in any way from taking over or purchasing a good property because of a decision by the Land Commission in their head office on a hard and fast price for any particular property. Where a large tract of land comes on the public market and should, in the opinion of the local people&mdash;local smallholders or others&mdash;either be acquired or purchased for the relief of congestion, it would be regrettable that, for the sake of £100, £200 or <Col N="1801" /> even £500, the Land Commission should lose the purchase of such a property which would be a very great asset to some smallholders in the area who could never hope to purchase land in the public market, more particularly if such a holding were convenient, say, to a group of county council cottages.</P>
    <P>I have known county council cottiers in my constituency and elsewhere who have been given land by the Land Commission.  I have known county council cottiers who have been given accommodation plots.  They have given a very good account of themselves.  It would be entirely wrong, and I am glad the Land Commission are not doing it and I hope they have no intention of doing it, to overlook at any time the application of the cottier.  The cottier may be employed either at forestry work or road work or he may be an agricultural labourer employed by a local farmer.  He may have a large family to provide for.  He may have aged parents to provide for.  In a rural district, he may be anxious to keep a cow or two.  He may be anxious to grow an acre or two of beet but, perhaps because of eelworm or something like that, the Sugar Company have seen fit to say that beet should not be produced in cottage plots.  It is only right that accommodation land should be provided convenient to estates that have been divided, if there are any county council cottages in the vicinity. Those cottiers gave a good account of themselves in the Emergency and are giving a good account of themselves now by growing a few acres of beet or having the grass of a cow which they could not get otherwise.  I strongly recommend the Land Commission to keep in mind tenants of council cottages where land is being divided so that at least accommodation land is made available to them.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the gratuities totalling over £14,000 that were paid to ex-employees on estates in the past year.  We see that 64 employees lost their jobs and received an average of £225 each as gratuity and while we have reached a stage when we should be thankful for small mercies, this is not a very generous gratuity.  It may be impossible for ex-employees of estates <Col N="1802" /> to get work in their own district.  They may be elderly and an average payment of £225 for the loss of one's job is very small and I would ask the Minister and the Land Commission to try to be more generous in future when dealing with the claims of ex-employees.</P>
    <P>I note with satisfaction that displaced employees who are deemed competent to work land are usually considered for allotments.  That is right and I hope that preference will be given as far as possible to those anxious to work land.  They should at least be offered the land.  No doubt many of them give a good account of themselves.</P>
    <P>On Subhead I reference is made to the sum of £675,000 for improvement works of land settlement.  These include the erection of dwelling houses and out-offices; provision of access roads; fencing and drainage; provision of water supply for domestic and stock requirements; turbary developments; repair and maintenance of embankments. That is very useful work and should certainly be undertaken but I am sorry to have to direct the Minister's attention to the fact that on many estates in the year which is now ending the Land Commission funds appear to be exhausted so far as provision of fencing and water supplies and the maintenance of embankments are concerned.  I would impress on the Minister the necessity to provide generously annually for these purposes. Nothing is so disheartening as to receive an allotment, have it sown, using the best form of husbandry and then find the Land Commission slow in carrying out fencing, providing gates and providing a water supply convenient to the residence.  I have known many cases, not only in my own constituency but elsewhere&mdash;I have referred them to the Land Commission&mdash;where I really thought the delay was unreasonable.  The main factor in the delay was the cost involved.  The Land Commission should not put up fences that will not last.  That may be a penny-wise, pound-foolish policy.  It is better to have it done well so that it will last.  The same applies to water supplies for domestic and stock requirements.  We have noted many cases where allottees were given <Col N="1803" /> holdings and there seemed to be unreasonable delay in sinking wells and providing water.  One of the reasons is that the Land Commission appear to exercise too much economy and this can be overdone if they want to provide a good service.</P>
    <P>I welcome very much the Land Commission undertaking the erection of a new type of out-office which they are erecting for migrants and displaced employees on an experimental basis. This is a very good idea.  It consists of a three-bay hayshed with a lean-to for 12 cows with feed-store and dairy.  This new type of out-office is a credit to the Land Commission and, where provided, it has met with the full approval of the allottees.  I can also assure the Minister it has won the admiration of those in neighbouring districts.  That is a development to be encouraged.  I hope the Minister's experiment will be successful and that later on it will become the pattern for the Land Commission to go on.</P>
    <P>The lay-out and planning of Land Commission houses have certainly elicited praise from many.  I think it is correct to say that the first of these modern Land Commission houses were erected in my constituency on the main Dublin-Cork road on the Franks Estate at Castletown, Mountrath.  The lay-out is most satisfactory and they are splendid from an architectural point of view.  We have now got away from the old, cheap, cottage type of house and instead we have something much more attractive bringing the farmhouse more into line with modern architectural ideas.  Such houses may cost more but in the long run they are well worth the money.  An attractively designed house with attractive out-offices placed well in from the road and with attractive drives which can be decorated with hedges or suitable shrubs cannot but win general approval.  It would be no harm if some local authorities and others were to take as an example the most recent residences that have been erected by the Land Commission.  I do not know if the Minister has ever stopped on the main road near Castletown to view these houses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister was impressed.  They are models of what a Land Commission residence should be.  I am very proud of these houses in my constituency and regard them as a credit to the Land Commission and to those who reside in them, who are keeping them in the best possible taste.  I am glad that the Minister has called to see them on his way down south or that they have been pointed out to him because in no other part of Ireland are there Land Commission residences as attractive, neat and compact as those of modern architecture in the Castletown area.</P>
      <P>I hope that wherever Land Commission houses are being erected they will be of the same standard of taste, attractiveness and beauty.  The housing section of the Land Commission deserves to be congratulated on the architecture of these houses.  Too often, opportunity is availed of to offer harsh criticism and a word of praise should be given where it is well merited.  The planning section is up to date and the high standard and the lay-out of the houses designed by it are worthy of appreciation.</P>
      <P>Reference has been made to the £500 advances made to farmers to supplement grants they obtain from the Department of Local Government for the erection of new houses and the reconstruction of existing houses.  I trust the Minister will reconsider this matter.  The £500 loan has been proclaimed to be a great asset and a great help to a farmer building his own house.  Would it not be better if, instead of advancing a loan of £500, the Land Commission would consider undertaking, perhaps not this year but in the future when the Minister considers that the financial circumstances permit, the erection of houses for small farmers and having the cost repaid in the Land Commission annuity on the same lines as were adopted under Section B of the Land Project? There are smallholders living in dreadful hovels, condemned shacks, in housing conditions which are the most appalling in Europe.  Many of us, as Deputies, have gone from time to time to farmers' houses and could get only as far as the door in many cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1805" /> There are people living in the most shocking housing conditions, through no fault of their own.  They may have large families.  Their holding may not be sufficient to allow them to erect a house on it.  They may not qualify for county council houses because of the amount of land they possess.</P>
    <P>The housing section should make a survey of the position.  I have written to the housing section on many occasions complimenting them on the amount of work they are doing.  The housing section are handcuffed and blindfolded and cannot work in a satisfactory manner, for lack of finance and capital.  The personnel of the housing section of the Land Commission are fully competent to provide every landowner with a good house.  All they need is the lead from the Minister to implement this as part of Land Commission policy.  It does not require legislation or amendment of the law.  The housing section of the Land Commission is already established. They have funds to advance in the form of £500 loans to smallholders to build houses and to supplement grants.</P>
    <P>It may cost £2,500 to build a house. In many cases, the out-offices attached to houses which may have been standing for 200 years are made of stone and mud and should be replaced.  We are living in 1966 and the day of the dilapidated mud-wall out-office is gone. Out-offices should have running water and be airy and dry and healthy for livestock.  All farmers should have modern dairies provided for them. The out-offices should be placed in as convenient a position as possible while being a proper distance from the residence.  In many cases where a small-holder may build a new house convenient to the road, he may have to traipse from the new house to the out-office at the back of the old condemned shack.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission would be very well advised to examine the whole question of housing for farmers in rural Ireland.  The proposed scheme cannot be availed of by the majority of smallholders because it may involve seeking a loan from the Agricultural Credit Corporation or from a bank <Col N="1806" /> to whom they may be committed already.  There are thousands of smallholders who would gladly avail of modern living conditions if they had the wherewithal to provide them.  I, personally, and this Party, notably Deputy Dillon, at the last general election, before the last general election and, since then, Deputy Cosgrave, have been pressing the Minister to undertake responsibility for the provision of modern housing for all our people in rural Ireland, repayment to be by way of the half-yearly instalment.</P>
    <P>Why should we expect the present generation to pay down or to repay in the course of a few years a sum of £2,500 plus interest in respect of the provision of a farmhouse?  If out-offices are to be included, the amount will be much more than £2,500.  Is it not right, that if a commitment is entered into by the father of a family, his sons and daughters should share in that commitment and that it should not be the responsibility of the landowner to have to pay for it in one, or two or even five years.  It is something that should be spread over a generation.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Land Commission to review and recast their entire policy in regard to houses and in regard to the provision of up-to-date offices and suitable haybarns.  There should be a haybarn at the back of every holding. It is regrettable to see the number of holdings which still have what are commonly called hayricks or hay-stacks behind them.  Very often these are blown away during bad winters or, due to constant rainfall, such as we are experiencing every year now, the hay becomes unfit for use because it has been allowed to remain out in the weather.  The expenditure of £116,000 for loans is very welcome and is money well spent but I would much prefer that instead of this expenditure, the Land Commission would tackle the whole problem.  If there is, as I have no doubt there will be, a change of Government, I want to assure the Minister that this is a problem that will be tackled by his successor&mdash;the provision of houses and out-offices for all those in rural Ireland who need them.  The scheme will be tackled as defined in the land rehabilitation scheme and the <Col N="1807" /> amount will be paid back in the rent. This should be the case for all smallholders, small farmers and others who have not the necessary security to obtain loans.  As soon as Fine Gael resume office as a Government, this is one of the schemes we will ask the Land Commission to administer.  I have no hesitation in saying that the Land Commission personnel dealing with housing loans are highly competent and capable people.  I venture to say that at the end of a ten-year period not a single condemned hovel will remain.</P>
    <P>The Minister made complimentary reference to the Regional Game Councils.  This is work that should be encouraged.  Last year £40,000 was paid out by way of grants and it certainly reflects great credit on the progress that continues to be made by the 24 game councils which have been established.  These councils deserve congratulations for their marvellous work.  They should be encouraged in every possible way.  I would ask the Minister and his Department always to pay special attention, as far as possible, to the reasonable requests made by these councils.  I feel now as I have felt in previous years, that special financial facilities should be made available for the owners of private hatcheries.  The equipment that is required, such as the electrical equipment, including incubators and heating apparatus, all cost money.  We have a number of very fine game hatcheries and I have previously been in touch on more than one occasion with the Minister about several of them.  These enterprising people, because of their interest in game, have gone to great expense equipping these modern hatcheries and the Department should have some scheme whereby grants could be given to them to assist them.  I should certainly like to congratulate the quarantine station operated by the game council in County Dublin.  It has been an outstanding success and it is encouraging to note that 5,000 game birds, pheasants, etc., were successfully reared there and distributed to many of the game councils and others concerned in the breeding <Col N="1808" /> of game.  This must certainly be very near a record and I am glad that the Minister has commented favourably on it.  We wish the hatchery every success and good luck.</P>
    <P>I have often wondered if the Department of Lands have paid sufficient attention in the past to the preservation of our game, which, in my opinion, is a national asset.  I hope the Minister will bear in mind that the protection and preservation of our game is work of national importance, particularly in view of the number of tourists and others who come here to shoot game.  It is something which may not pay off in a year or two but it certainly will bring benefits in time.  Sportsmen and visitors alike to this country have paid many tributes to our game potential.  This is something which should be and can be developed to a far greater extent but it cannot be developed unless you are prepared to spend money on it.  That is why I hope that in future steps will be taken to review the whole structure of our game councils, the preservation and protection of game, the provision of suitable grants for private hatcheries and the publicising to a greater extent of shooting facilities in this country.</P>
    <P>We have the best shooting facilities in Europe.  I welcome the appointment by the Minister of a joint committee, comprising senior officers of the Department and representatives of Bord Fáilte, for the promotion of shooting for visiting sportsmen.  I am sure Deputies would like to have some information about this committee, which I have no doubt will do valuable and useful work.  It might be no harm to ask the Minister what the terms of reference of the committee are, whether he proposes to ask them to submit recommendations and, if so, will steps be taken to implement them and will the Minister have funds at his disposal to put them into effect?</P>
    <P>The Game Branch of the Department has also recruited some advisory personnel.  That is very necessary.  It is important that we should have available to us the best advisory personnel, if possible the best in the world.  These people will have very specialised training and I hope they <Col N="1809" /> are being well paid.  This is something of a national investment and we should have the best possible scientific advice. I have no doubt that the Department will endeavour to achieve that.  If there is one thing in this country we can boast about, it is our fishing and shooting; but we do not seem to brag enough about it.  We do not seem to give it sufficient publicity.  We are overwhelmed by continental competition and our shooting and fishing, apart from very limited publicity, is hardly ever mentioned abroad.  The shooting and fishing which this country has to offer our visiting sportsmen are as good as they will get in any part of the world.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed at the acquisition side of the Department's working during the past year.  There were 60,000 acres of land inspected but there was an intake of only 33,000 acres.  I suppose the credit squeeze was responsible for that.  It is a pity there should be any cutting down on the amount of land for acquisition.</P>
    <P>While I am on that point I want to direct the Minister's attention to his power to declare certain areas as congested districts.  In a congested area where land is divided the allottee will only have to pay half the amount of rent the allottee has to pay for land in a non-congested district.  There are many areas which are not defined as congested districts, part of County Wicklow, many parts of County Carlow, a very large area of County Laois, parts of North Tipperary, of County Kilkenny, and of County Cavan and a large part of County Monaghan, which should most certainly be defined as congested districts. I should be glad if, during the coming year, the Minister would examine the matter of the declaration of congested districts.</P>
    <P>The present outline of congested districts is not as it should be.  These congested districts were established very many years ago.  There are pockets in some of the areas I have mentioned, where congestion is as bad as if not worse than in the areas already defined as congested districts, and which have as good a right to be defined as a congested <Col N="1810" /> district as parts of the west of Ireland which have already been declared congested districts and where congestion might not be as acute as in these other areas which are not defined as congested.  I hope the Land Commission would not be inclined to recommend, in the interests of economy, that an area be not defined as a congested district.  They might feel that the amount of rent they would be receiving by way of instalments from the allottees would be only half of what they would be getting if it was not a congested district.  I hope this matter will be approached on a long-term, national basis, on the basis that we want to help the people on the land and not place unnecessary or additional burdens by way of repayments on them.  The time has come when there should be a complete review of the congested districts.</P>
    <P>I welcome the procedure adopted by the Minister in taking the Forestry Estimate and the Lands Estimate together. It is right that the one debate should cover the two.  I am saddened and disillusioned by the Estimate for Forestry which the Minister has introduced. It indicates nothing but gloom and unemployment and appears to place a dead hand over the development of forestry.  If there is one good medium of rural employment in Ireland it is forestry.  There are about 4,800 men employed in forestry work at the moment.  I have always felt that employment in forestry should reach a target of about 10,000 people.  Now that there is a cutting down in the Estimate many of those who are at present engaged in forestry work will be unemployed during the coming year.  In my constituency, where there are some of the finest forests in the country, there has been a reduction in the number of workers: there has been a reduction in the number employed at the Emo State forest, at the Kinnitty State forest, at the Clonaslee State forest, the Stradbally forest and the Mountrath forest.  When there is a cutting down of employment in these State forests I presume that in the other State forests in Cork, Wicklow and elsewhere there will be some pruning.</P>
    <P>Land is being offered continuously <Col N="1811" /> for forestry.  There is plenty of work available in our State forests but now by cutting down on forestry the Government are telling us that they have failed miserably in regard to afforestation.  This is not an Estimate of hope or an Estimate in which any State Department can have confidence. It is an estimate which undoes the valuable work which has been carried out in the Forestry Division up to now. I had great hopes of an expansion of afforestation this year, that more money would be made available to purchase the lands which have been offered.  This very day a constituent of mine from the Banagher area approached me to know if the Forestry Division would take over 100 acres of land for afforestation which he wanted to give them immediately.  I have written today to the Forestry Division in this connection.  I know of many cases in the midlands and elsewhere where people are anxious to dispose of their lands to the Forestry Division.</P>
    <P>What has happened to the great scheme which the Forestry Division had developed in conjunction with Bord na Móna for the planting of cutaway bog?  There is not a mention of that here.  What has happened to the ideas the Minister had some time ago for vastly increasing the number of persons employed in afforestation? Look at the vast amount of work afforestation can give: the preparation of the land, drainage, thinning, planting and the other seasonal work that is there.  I can never understand why there could not be some co-operation between Bord na Móna and the Forestry Division so that there could be a dovetailing of their work at various times of the year.  There are parts of the year when Bord na Móna have short time and parts of the year when Forestry have short time.  With a dovetailing of the work, through close co-operation between the Forestry Division and Bord na Móna, there could be continuous employment.</P>
    <P>I want to object strongly to this cutting down in regard to forestry. This is something on which Deputies from rural Ireland should express an <Col N="1812" /> opinion in the House.  This unnecessary cutting down will be responsible for throwing out of employment hundreds of forestry workers who have no other employment in their area and have no other means of obtaining a livelihood. These men may be the fathers of large families and may now be forced to emigrate.  This forestry work has always been looked upon as a constant and permanent source of employment. Now because some form of book-keeping has to be adopted, in order that there might be economies exercised, in order that two and two may make four, in order that by juggling with figures things will look better on paper, hundreds of forestry workers must be thrown out of employment. This is an Estimate to which I most certainly cannot subscribe and one which will undo the valuable work which has been achieved.</P>
    <P>The Minister says in his introductory speech:</P>
    <P>This decrease reflects a drop of £20,500 in the provision for Forestry Development and Management.  This arises mainly from the decision of the Government to cut back planting in 1966-67 to 20,000 acres....</P>
    <P>Where is the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i>?  Has that gone down the drain?  What about the additional workers who were to be employed on forestry?  Why did the Minister speak with two different tongues, one increasing the numbers to be employed in forestry and the other inviting people to offer their lands for forestry?  For the first time we see today that this is a decision taken by the Government to cut back planting to 20,000 acres.  It is a wrong decision.  It is a decision which will not be accepted by workers engaged in forestry.  Deputies who represent constituencies where there are State forests which will be affected by this reduction will make it know clearly and plainly that this cutting down by the Government in afforestation is not in the interests of employment.</P>
    <P>Is there anything which beautifies the country more than our forests? Are they not some of the most attractive and beautiful forests to be found in any country?  Why interrupt the <Col N="1813" /> work?  Many of these men are specialists in their own spheres of forestry work.  Many of them are specialists at thinning, pruning, drainage work and the making of forestry roads.  They have spent all their lives at it in these areas.  Now that suitable alternative employment cannot be secured, I venture to say that whenever the Government reach sanity again and desire to provide money for afforestation, these will be no employavailable; there will be no employment to keep them there and the Government will be faced with emigration. It is a very bad step and, most certainly, one to which I cannot subscribe.</P>
    <P>This country could not possibly be compared with Canada.  Much importance and great emphasis are laid on afforestation in Canada; one of the finest sights I ever saw was the wood pulp industries situated along the Ottawa river, more of them along the St. Lawrence, the extent of these industries and their continued expansion. You see vast acres of woodland being cleared away and the heavy timber being dumped down into the swift currents of the Ottawa and St. Lawrence rivers.  Immediately the lands are rotavated, prepared and men come along to replant.  No sooner is timber cut away than preparations are being made for replanting.</P>
    <P>If only on a small scale in Ireland, why not keep in line and give to our afforestation schemes the proper importance, the importance they should be given?  Builders have stated&mdash;and correctly so&mdash;that Irish timber used for constructional purposes is far superior in every way to imported timber.  Is it not a nice thing that those engaged in the building industry have paid such a fine tribute to our native grown timber?  Whilst we know afforestation is something which does not pay immediately, it is a sound national investment.  The money we invest in forestry today may not pay us for 20 or 30 years but is it not a sound national investment?  When the first Government took office in this country and embarked upon their schemes of afforestation, the moneys they put into them at that time only <Col N="1814" /> reaped the real benefits when our sales of commercial timber went up and when those who were engaged in the building industry are on record as having stated that our Irish-grown timber, for constructional purposes, was far superior in every way to imported timber.  That, in itself, is a credit to Irish afforestation.</P>
    <P>Now we are to have a complete standstill.  It is wrong.  I think the Government are unwise and it is something which most Deputies who have a knowledge of afforestation cannot in any way support.</P>
    <P>We have the Minister making another admission of failure during the past year.  He says:</P>
    <P>The productive area acquired was only slightly over 18,000 acres and was, I regret to say, the lowest annual intake of productive lands since 1956-57.</P>
    <P>The lowest annual intake for some years was last year.  I venture to say that, as a result of the passing of this Estimate, when the Minister comes along this time 12 months, the intake figure he will be reading will be something in the region of 12,000 acres.  A cutting down of that kind is disastrous.</P>
    <P>We have a third clear admission of failure from the Minister.  To quote his own words, he says:</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned that the planting programme is being reduced, as an economy measure, to 20,000 acres, as against the normal target of 25,000 acres.</P>
    <P>Here we have again the cold, dead hand of economy stopping the development of afforestation, stopping our expansion in afforestation and the provision of additional rural employment.</P>
    <P>One thing can be said about the Minister today in relation to forestry: he was honest about it.  There was no pretence or guessing about it.  He was very candid when he referred to the fact that it was Government policy to cut it down and it was being done as an economy measure.  This is one economy measure which will have very detrimental results.  Perhaps the Parliamentary <Col N="1815" /> Secretary could take a brief note for the Minister so that, when replying, he will be able to tell us what are the employment prospects in forestry at the end of the financial year for which he is now providing? Has he any hope of re-employing those who have lost their employment in forestry during the past three months? What steps has he taken because there is no mention in this year's Estimate of providing the foresters with the facilities they sought.</P>
    <P>I raised this matter 12 months ago on the Forestry Estimate.  I raised it because I felt it was something which should be raised in Parliament.  I thought, having given the Minister for Lands a year's notice, some reference would have been made to the manner in which foresters are treated.  The foresters are a very special type of trained personnel.  They have very great responsibility.  They have the responsibility of the management of staff and the full working of the State forests.  It takes a long time for a man to qualify as a forester.  He must have practical knowledge.  He must go through a training college and qualify.  A man does not become a forester overnight, and he certainly does not become a forester unknown to his parents' bank account.</P>
    <P>In my constituency, in Kinnitty, we have a training college.  It is one of two, I think, in the country.  I say that in Kinnitty we have perhaps the best forestry training college in Europe. The Minister and the Forestry Division can take credit for that.  They are entitled to it.  In Offaly, we have the best forestry training college in Europe but I am told there were vacancies in that college last year, and that young people are not now taking up forestry as a career.  May I ask the Minister, why?  When a person is deciding what profession in life to adopt, be it medicine, or the law as a solicitor or a barrister, or any other profession, he takes a long-term view of what the prospects for the future are.  There must be many people in this country who take a very dim view of the profession of forester.  Some years ago I would have advised any young <Col N="1816" /> man wanting a good career, with a real future, with security at home, in a profession of which he could be proud, earn a good living and be independent in his own country, to go to a forestry training college.  I thought there was a great future in forestry.  Now, as a result of this Estimate, as a result of last year's Estimate, and of what I am afraid will be next year's Estimate, I think there is a very poor future in the profession of forester.</P>
    <P>What is the position of the foresters in charge of State forests under the Department of Lands?  According to housing statistics taken in 1964&mdash;and this is 1966 &mdash; we had 163 married foresters and of those, 80 were living in official forestry houses.  Forty-seven of those houses were in good condition and 33 were unfit for human habitation. These men were responsible for State forests, and 33 of them were living in damp, cold, draughty houses with decayed floors, defective woodwork, woodwork completely rotted by woodworm, leaking roofs, and roofs which let out most of the heat.</P>
    <P>A number of sites were available for building houses for these foresters.  In fact, 29 sites were available but it took up to 12 months to provide 18 sites, from one year to five years to provide nine sites, and over five years to provide two sites.  Thirty of these foresters were paying more than 35/- a week rent for these hovels.  Fifty-six were living in rented houses of a lower standard and the rents being paid for these houses were: £1 a week by one forester, 21/- to 30/- a week by 25 foresters, and 31/- to 40/- a week by 26 foresters.  Five were paying between 41/- and 50/- per week.  There were 11 houses without piped water, and three houses without electricity.  Perhaps there are two now because I think one in County Wicklow got electricity.  The number living in their own house or their wife's house was 15.  Here we have this annual Estimate with not one single word about building houses or improving housing conditions for these foresters.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Minister: what will happen to afforestation in the future if these foresters go out of the country? <Col N="1817" /> There is a big opening on the Continent for foresters.  There is a very profitable future for foresters in Canada and in parts of the United States.  Yet, here we have those men living in the most horrifying and shocking conditions and they are in charge of our State forests.  That is an extraordinary situation, and it is something to which I certainly cannot subscribe. I want to condemn the Minister loudly, definitely, and entirely, for not providing for this situation.  I accuse him of failing in his responsibility to his own employees.  He was wrong in not pressing the Department of Finance for money to improve the conditions in which those foresters are obliged to live.</P>
    <P>I was also disappointed that this Estimate contains no provision for grants for private planting.  Surely the Minister is aware of the facilities available on the Continent and elsewhere for private planting?  I should like to know the real objection of the Minister and the Department to the encouragement of private planting.  Should private planting not be encouraged, here?  Should suitable private planting grants not be made available?  If we want to encourage private planting, we should hold out some encouragement to those people whose lands are suitable for afforestation.</P>
    <P>I was reading quite recently about the facilities available in some parts of the Continent for private planting.  In France, new plantations are exempt from all local rates for a period of 30 years.  In Denmark, special grants and facilities are available on all private planting in that country.  British Columbia offers the same facilities. Norway also has those facilities.  In this country no effort whatever is being made to encourage private planting. A few moments ago I referred to Ontario which I visited some time ago. Deputy Kitt must know this as well as I do.  Special facilities are given by the State forestry service there.  That is a great help.</P>

      <P>I would like, if I may, to ask the Minister what has happened to the proposal for a scheme of planting the entire Shannon Valley? I do not know what has happened to that proposal but I remember&mdash;I think it was at the time when Mr. Blowick was Minister for Lands&mdash;that the question of planting the Shannon Valley and the banks of the Shannon was under consideration.  I presume nothing has happened with regard to it, that it is, like most of the other Government plans, on the shelves, covered in dust and cobwebs.  If it would not be too much, between now and this time 12 months, perhaps the Minister would wipe away the cobwebs, shake off the dust and tell us what he proposes to do about the proposals for the initiation of the Shannon Valley planting scheme.</P>

      <P>I can see little hope of a general all-round improvement, particularly in regard to the forestry workers, if there is to be a drastic cut-down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister will make a statement on the question of the five-day week all the year round and the 45-hour working week.  I would like an explanation as to why some steps were not taken to provide better facilities for workers convenient to State forests, particularly in regard to eating and washing.  The facilities at present <Col N="1819" /> available for workers, convenient to all our State forests, for eating and washing are far from what we would expect.  The Forestry Division should arrange that convenient to State forests the necessary facilities are immediately available, that proper accommodation is provided and that forestry workers can at least wash themselves and that proper eating facilities are available for them.  I would also like to hear from the Minister about the pension scheme that was spoken of and also the sick pay scheme.  We seem to be lagging very far behind in facilities for our workers, particularly in regard to foresters.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I would like to direct the attention of the Minister is his failure to introduce some support by his Department for private sawmills which are giving good employment. The Forestry Division have been considering for a long time past the possibilities of the wood pulp industry but they do not seem to have made any great headway with regard to it.  I would like the Minister to tell us whether the by-products of our forests are being utilised in any way and to outline what plans the Department have in mind.  Surely with the forests we have we should be able to make up our minds with regard to the wood pulp industry.  Our private sawmills deserve some recognition from the Forestry Division.  There are private sawmills giving very good employment.  This is a branch of the Irish economy that has been more or less neglected and the time has come for the Minister to review the position.</P>
    <P>The Forestry Estimate as it stands cannot be described as being favourable. My Party are disappointed with it because it does not hold a ray of hope for the general development of afforestation.  All Deputies who had held out hope for future growth and expansion of afforestation are disappointed. Despite this, I hope the high volume of unemployment which I can foresee will not take place in the coming year but I am afraid of the situation, after listening to the Minister.  I hope that in the near future some Minister for Lands will <Col N="1820" /> tackle this problem in a brave, courageous way so that our afforestation programme will produce one of our finest industries, resulting in good employment for men who work in rural Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Estimate clearly shows that the Minister has been struck rather violently by the economic blizzard.  We have on the joint Estimate for Lands and Forestry a statement indicating that as far as Lands are concerned there is a reduction of £259,000 and a reduction of £204,200 in respect of Forestry, making a combined reduction of £463,200. That is not very welcome news for the Members of the House, nor will it be good news for the people of the country tomorrow.  I thought for a time that Deputy Flanagan was off balance because, if I may say so, the two speeches made by him on this Estimate were in marked contrast. The first speech on the Department of Lands displayed great brotherly feeling towards the Minister and the Land Commission.  Indeed, I do not know how the affection arose because I have not read anything in the Minister's statement that should warrant this display of affection by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>It is not many months since we spent weeks in the House debating a Land Bill which was to cure all our land ills, a measure under which all people in congested districts would get economic holdings and under which, possibly, landless men would be set up in some districts.  It was a Bill under which the small economic holder might be able to get an additional piece of land adjacent to his holding.  What do we find?  In the very first Estimate for that Department, there is a marked reduction in the allocation of public funds to put the Act into operation and we find this reduction represents a sizeable percentage of the total amount in the Estimate.  As well as that, we have a statement early in the Minister's speech indicating that an additional sum of £75,000 will be made available this year towards <Col N="1821" /> salary increases.  The Minister went on:</P>
      <P>In particular I am arranging for a telling increase in the inspectorate staff, as I am anxious to get on with the rapid disposal of acquired land and equally to move promptly on the inspection of properties brought to notice.</P>
      <P>It is peculiar that at a time when the Minister has reduced the Estimate by more than a quarter of a million pounds, he should tell us that he is about to increase the staff.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister has reminded me of Land Bonds, I shall make some statements on them.  I dislike them because I think they are an unfair and unjust way of buying land and that there should be no such thing, as far as the buying of land is concerned, as Land Bonds.  Land should be bought at public sales.  The Land Bond system is unfair.  The owners of land do not understand anything <Col N="1822" /> about Land Bonds.  They are not conversant with the fact that the value of Land Bonds can fluctuate, as they did during the past year.  Six per cent Land Bonds selling at par are now on sale at 88½, a reduction of 11.5.  It is true to say that a number of people have been caught badly as a result of that drastic reduction, brought about by the credit squeeze.  The Minister and the House have an obligation to those people to rectify that wrong and I shall endeavour during the debate to support a move to provide compensation for these people.</P>
      <P>The best way to illustrate the position in regard to Land Bonds is by presenting a particular case.  I shall cite the case of a person in my constituency, Mrs. McCarthy of Lahadana, near Bantry.  All public representatives in the area know the case because if any person in Ireland has a justifiable, genuine grievance it is Mrs. McCarthy. Before giving details of the case, I should like to tell the Minister that I have a very high regard for his integrity and his compassion and I should like to express the hope that compensation will be paid to people like Mrs. McCarthy.</P>
      <P>She is a widow whose husband died in 1954, leaving her with a family of one son and three daughters, all in their early teens at the time.  They worked the farm, adjacent to the town of Bantry.  It is one of the most valuable farms in that part of the country. Located contiguous to Bantry town, it had many advantages over and above the type of farms which are to be found in that district.  I have said Mrs. McCarthy worked this farm until 1960, but due to difficulties which she was unable to overcome in the early sixties, she had to let the farm.  She could no longer continue tillage, keeping cows, and so on, and she had to let the farm.  When the Land Commission heard of this position, they approached Mrs. McCarthy in 1962. The agent informed her that they heard she was letting the farm and that the Land Commission intended to take it from her.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a person who required capital, and a person who possibly found some <Col N="1823" /> difficulty in continuing to work the farm on her own, and feeling that there was no way of opposing the Land Commission, Mrs. McCarthy did agree to a sale by consent, even though at that time her son was 18 years of age and she had in mind to let the farm until he reached his majority in a few years' time, took over the farm and worked it.  That was not to be. The Land Commission continued to approach Mrs. McCarthy and eventually, through their agents, agreed to buy 100 acres of that farm and to pay for it in Land Bonds to the value of £11,000.  That was the bargain.  That amount of £11,000 was put in Land Bonds, as I say, but Mrs. McCarthy, and others like her, are not conversant with Land Bonds and their fluctuations in price.</P>
    <P>The reply the Minister gave me on 2nd February, 1966, indicates that the Land Commission took over possession of that farm on 1st February 1965 and from that date to 17th May 1966, Mrs. McCarthy has not got one penny of money for her farm, good, bad or indifferent.</P>

      <P>My intention in raising this matter in the House is, if there are other people similarly affected in any part of the country, to speak on their behalf also.  This is a national Parliament and the reason I am giving details of this case is to <Col N="1824" /> illustrate the position, and that very clearly.</P>
      <P>Here is the document to the solicitors. This farm was vested in the Land Commission in early February. On 11th March, 1964, the Land Commission had this to say in a letter to Mrs. McCarthy's solicitors:</P>
      <P>I am desired by the Land Commission to refer to your letter of 20th February, 1964, addressed to Mr. O'Boyle, Cork Office, regarding the above matter, and to state that the position regarding the grazing letting has been noted.</P>
      <P>As agreement has been reached on price, the Land Commission propose to continue the proceedings on a voluntary basis and a formal Proposal to Purchase is being prepared and will be issued shortly to you for acceptance by your client.</P>
      <P>When the proposal to Purchase has been accepted, the title of the lands will be examined by the Examiner's Branch of this Office and possession could be taken by the Land Commission when a prima facie certificate of title has been issued by the Examiner.  In view of the position about the grazing letting, the Land Commission agree to postpone possession until February, 1965.  Meantime it will be possible to make progress on the examination of title. The Land Bonds representing the Purchase Money would be put to credit when possession is taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last sentence in that letter is the vital one.  It was indicated clearly by the Land Commission to Mrs. McCarthy that as soon as possession was taken, the Land Bonds would be paid to her credit.  At that time the price was £99 10s and Mrs. McCarthy had in mind to cash these bonds immediately as she had been told there would be no difficulty in cashing them.  At that time they were at par 100.  As a result the bonds have now decreased in value, so far as this woman is concerned, by the amount of £1,265, plus accrued interest if she had sold the land by private sale. I have no doubt, Sir, and I can assure the Minister and the House, that had that farm been sold by private sale at the time, the minimum price for that <Col N="1825" /> 100 acres would be at least £15,000, or £4,000 more than the Land Commission agreed to pay for it.</P>
    <P>Surely there is an obligation, if not a legal obligation arising out of some of the sections or subsections of our Act, a moral obligation, to compensate that widow woman in Bantry for the way she has been treated by the Land Commission.  There is no doubt in my mind, and I am sure there will be no doubt in the mind of any Member in this House, that in such a case we are in duty bound, and morally bound, to pay this woman compensation for unjustifiably holding her money for the past 15 or 16 months.</P>
    <P>The Minister may be interested to know what the cause of the delay was. Four reasons were given.  Let us examine the first reason which was: &ldquo;You must tell us whether any rates were due to Cork County Council.&rdquo; Was there not someone in the Department of Lands, or in the Land Commission, who could take the telephone and inquire from the rate collector in Cork, Mr. Callinan, whether money was owed by way of rates?  Why could that not be done?  Is that not the procedure? The position was made quite clear to the Land Commission that no rates were due.  Now, however, we are told that the Land Commission could not hand over possession of the bonds until it was made clear to them that no rates were due.  If there was anything wrong with the title, why did the Land Commission vest these lands in themselves?  It was completely unfair and unjust to do so if there was anything wrong with the title.</P>
    <P>Why did they state in the letter I have just read &ldquo;as soon as this land is vested, the bonds will be in your possession&rdquo;?  Is that an erroneous statement; is it a statement that would give a false impression to anyone who read it?  Would any person in this House read this statement to Mrs. McCarthy in March, 1964, and not come away with the impression that as soon as the vesting order was signed, she would be in possession of the bonds?</P>
    <P>I should like before I go into the three other reasons for withholding <Col N="1826" /> money from Mrs. McCarthy to ask the Minister this question: does he agree that anybody reading this letter&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>

      <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister and his Department on the very helpful document circulated to Deputies giving an account of the Department's activities.  It brings to light the importance of the industry and the importance of the Department's activities in relation to that industry. That is only right and proper since one-third of the population find their living on the land and, by their activities and their hard work, contribute in large measure to the exports which earn valuable moneys abroad to enable us to bring in essential imports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference is made at page 2 to the importance of the industry and to the targets set for agricultural expansion. It was calculated that agricultural production could be increased by 33 per cent by 1970.  That programme has suffered, of course, as a result of the vagaries of the weather and other circumstances.  The increase is not what it was.  It was envisaged that the projected increase in relation to cattle, pigs, milk, etc., would be £62.8 million. In fact, by 1965 there was a decline and the value of net output, including <Col N="1827" /> livestock, showed an increase of only £4.8 million with a consequential decrease in farm incomes.</P>
    <P>It is, however, still valid to look at this industry in the context of exports. The latest statistics issued in February of this year show that of total exports of some £36,180,000 approximately £18,500,000 represented the agricultural industry.  The supreme importance of the industry in the context of those figures does not have to be laboured either in this House or outside it.  What is exercising the minds of people at the present time is the fact that there has been this decline in prices and this decrease in incomes from the projected figures.  The value of the industry is paramount in balancing the economy.</P>
    <P>I am primarily concerned with the dairy industry.  In the county which I represent, we have more co-operative creameries than has any other southern county.  We have a very deep interest in what happens to the creamery milk industry and to those associated with it.  In the report of Bord Bainne of 31st March, 1964, there were encouraging signs which justified the original allocation made by this House some years ago of £250,000 for market research.  Kerrygold butter has won its place in Britain and elsewhere.  We hope there will be a further expansion in sales of this high-class product which is commanding an increasing price.  The price increased from £303 per ton in 1962-63 to £349 per ton in 1963-64.  Exports increased from 15,500 tons in 1962-63 to 20,300 tons in 1963-64.  That is very gratifying. There has also been an increase in cheese exports, providing a valuable outlet for milk.  If we could increase exports of fresh cream, that would be a considerable help.</P>
    <P>The position in regard to the dried milk market is not as encouraging as the others.  We hope there will be further progress and, indeed, progress has been made with regard to dried skimmed powder.  This could be of great value to the development of the dairying industry.  The figures for chocolate crumb seem to be rather <Col N="1828" /> static.  They are associated probably with world markets and the price of sugar but neither the amount exported nor the price per ton seems to show much variation: it is keeping rather constant.  The figure for 1963-64 was about £135 per ton as against £134 per ton for 1962-63.</P>
    <P>I was gratified to notice that we have not to carry over as much butter as we had formerly been carrying.  At long last, we seem to be getting rid of our stocks more rapidly.  This is very important from the point of view of the product we are putting on the market and from the point of view of not having to store large quantities of butter.  There has been a progressive decline in that respect.</P>
    <P>The price being secured for exported butter must be gratifying to the Minister for Agriculture and also to the Minister for Finance.  Butter as a product has always had to be supported. In 1961-62, the average price was £262 per ton.  There was an increase in 1962-63 to £303 per ton and in 1963-64, to £349 per ton.  These figures are rather heartening.</P>
    <P>We have the prospect of an increasing supply of milk.  Anybody who studies the figures will note how predominantly Munster appears in the picture.  With 532,500 cows, Munster is producing, in round figures, 258½ million gallons of milk.  It is interesting to note that the number of cows per supplier of milk is nine.  That ought to be kept very much in mind.  One will come across the occasional large herd of cows but, on average, these are the figures as given by An Bord Bainne.  The number drops in Leinster. There are 63,500 cows in Leinster with an average of 6.5 cows per supplier. In Ulster, the figures are lower still and, finally, in Connacht they are the lowest of the lot.</P>
    <P>The selling price of butter per ton has already been mentioned.  In their 1963-64 Report, Bord Bainne showed that the price of butter which we sell in Northern Ireland and in Great Britain has rather consistently been increasing.  It is quoted on December 10th, 1962, as 360/- per cwt. in Northern Ireland; it went up in 1962-63 <Col N="1829" /> to 370/-, then to 383/- and 390/-until, in March, 1964, it reached 410/-per cwt.  Our butter was not finding as favourable a price, perhaps, in Great Britain.  In January, 1963, it rose from 337/6 per cwt. until, by March, 1964, it reached 372/6 per cwt.</P>
    <P>Our intake of milk increased from the 570 million gallons in 1960 to 613 million gallons in 1962.  I am sure the present figure is very much higher, though I imagine that this year it will be somewhat down in view of the fact that it has been a bad year and in view of the losses in cattle already referred to.  Contagious abortion and other factors will certainly make themselves felt in regard to milk production in the coming year and also in regard to our final figures.  It is interesting to note that the percentage of milk used for manufacturing purposes is keeping somewhat static, from 61.8 per cent in 1960 to 63.9 per cent in 1962.  These figures, as well as the section which deals with external trade in these notes issued by the Department and the value of the agricultural industry in balancing our trade accounts abroad, are certainly very revealing.</P>
    <P>When I turn to the section dealing with the scheme for the eradication of bovine tuberculosis, I am happy to note that the end now seems to be in sight.  Nevertheless, occasionally a farmer will still be unfortunate enough to find himself locked up through no fault of his own but rather through one of these misfortunes that occur when an animal is found to be infected. Generally, this is not discovered until the animal is delivered at the factory and then the farmer finds himself locked up.  These are steps the Minister must take.  The farmer must then carry on as before.  He must feed his animals, and so on, but he is unable to dispose of his young stock and will have to remain in that position for maybe three months or more.  He is under a cloud and his position is difficult.</P>
    <P>Here is a fact which is not often adverted to in this connection.  We talk about the amount the State has invested in the scheme for the eradication of bovine tuberculosis.  It has, indeed, invested a very large sum of <Col N="1830" /> money but all of that money has not gone to the farming community.  I notice in this report that payments to herd-owners amounted to over £37,632 but, of that amount, a sum of £17,272 was recovered in respect of salaries and administrative expenses.  It is important to bear that figure in mind. So far as the State is concerned, I suggest that the amount going out in this case was very much less than the figures would indicate.  Certainly, a very large amount of money had to be paid for veterinary and administrative services, without which the job could never have been done.</P>
    <P>We may take pride in the fact that this scheme has successfully been accomplished.  It is sincerely to be hoped, having invested this large amount of money in it, that there will be a much brighter outlook for this industry.  Our farmers tried to co-operate wholeheartedly with the Department in the eradication of bovine tuberculosis.  It must be appreciated by the Minister, by the Department, by this House and by the public that, in this struggle, the farmers have had to put vast amounts of money into restocking and have had to suffer loss by reason of immature cows coming into their herds.  Where heavier milch cows were taken out of herds and replaced by heifers, the price paid for the reactors taken out as against the price of the heifers put in left the farmer having to pay, on average, anything from £15 to £25 or more.  Also, his milk yield for the next two or three years would be reduced because he had lost his heavier milkers.  That operation, which had to be performed, was one of the things which depleted the farmer's herds and depleted his financial liquidity which might otherwise have enabled him to weather the situation which developed recently.  I shall say more about that later.</P>
    <P>The export of dairy products is dealt with in these notes.  In 1965, as compared with 1964, there was an increase but not a very large increase in total exports but, compared with previous years from 1960 onwards, the increase was dramatic.  All this series of notes give the facts and figures for all aspects of the industry.  I hope the <Col N="1831" /> Minister is in a happier frame of mind now than on the evening on which he introduced his Estimate&mdash;would the Minister like to comment?</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>His speech on the Estimate seemed to be influenced throughout by the situation with which he was faced and which I must assume at this stage he is still facing.  In his speech, the Minister indicated that the Government were satisfied that positive steps would have to be taken to improve farm incomes and that he would be in a position to announce specific measures to improve them, but, immediately afterwards and again later on in his speech, the Minister seems to have been obsessed with the situation which brought the farmers to Dublin.  It must have been looming largely in his mind that here was a situation about which he was rather annoyed.</P>
      <P>Much has been said about this.  I am sure the Minister appreciates that these people do not easily take this kind of action bringing them away from their homes and farms here to the gates of Leinster House and Merrion Street and that nothing but the kind of crisis they felt had arisen for the dairying community when they were carrying a burden they were no longer able to bear, would have had that result.  They wanted to show that on this occasion the Government would have to improve their incomes if they were to survive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the average supplier sending about 3,600 gallons to the oreamery and contrasted the hypothetical case of an extra penny per gallon as against the greater benefit the farmer would gain by having an extra cow.  I am sure the Minister is well aware that on agricultural holdings, and certainly holdings in the dairying counties of the south, the farmers are carrying as many cows as it is possible for them to carry.  One factor which contributed to the difficulty of the situation this year is that in the emergency which arose from the bad weather when normally <Col N="1832" /> they would have been able to turn their cattle out, the farmers did not have enough feeding to keep their cattle and that caused them further losses.  In mentioning one more cow as a solution for the smaller man, I am afraid the Minister overplayed his hand on this occasion.  It is understandable that when faced with the task of finding one more penny, the Minister should turn that aside by saying that one more cow would be more profitable to the farmer.  It is particularly true of the smallholdings in my constituency that the farms are very small and anybody studying the statistics will see the size of the average holding is very small, especially in West Limerick.</P>
    <P>In one portion of my constituency, we have as much congestion as anywhere along the western seaboard which was originally treated as a congested district.  I drew the Minister's attention, for instance, to the fact that there was a request from Carrigkelly in my constituency for a pilot scheme for the area.  There was a meeting at which Deputies for the constituency were present with representatives of both NFA and the Creamery Milk Suppliers, Muintir na Tíre and others in the parish.  Everybody felt that if the farming community were to survive there and any realistic attempt made to keep them there, something would have to be done to help them to make a living in that part of the country which forms a very large part of the constituency.  I could not see why the Minister would not accede to the request and give such a pilot scheme to the area.</P>
    <P>Figures quoted on that occasion were certainly very telling and I have reason to believe this has already been brought to the notice of the Minister. On those holdings in that area there could not be any question of keeping an extra cow.  As has been mentioned in regard to the heifer scheme, in attempting to avail of the grant, farmers took an extra animal or two into their herds and then found themselves in difficulty in keeping the animals on their small holding.  This has proved to be most unfortunate for them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1833" /> The Minister referred to the creamery milk quality grading scheme.  Recently, I had the opportunity to say to the Minister in regard to this scheme that in the case of a supplier whose milk is tested on the first of the month and on the 8th of the month, if he finds that the milk has not reached the requisite standard, he has no further interest in quality milk production for the remainder of that month.  Even if he succeeded in supplying quality milk for the period from the 9th of the month to the end of the month, he does not qualify.  The Minister should give some further thought to the question whether a supplier should be allowed to qualify if on the third or fourth test the milk is of the requisite standard.</P>
    <P>I have heard Deputies saying that dairying does not entail as much hardship nowadays as it used to do. Deputies who spoke here last week of the clamour being made by the dairy farmers seemed to represent tillage farmers rather than dairy farmers. When Deputy O'Donnell was speaking, it was suggested that he had not said much about the tillage farmers. I suppose it is natural that he would not say much about tillage farmers. There are Deputies here well qualified to speak on behalf of the tillage farmers. To say that dairying is easier nowadays than it used to be is quite true.  It is easier because of mechanisation and because of the fact that the dairy farmer may have installed water and a cooling system and has a supply of electricity; but all of this represents investment which in many cases involved having to raise credit with a bank or with the Agricultural Credit Corporation and represents an extra burden.  It involves harder work because of the necessity to pay for these amenities.  That is a factor that should not be overlooked.</P>
    <P>On a morning last week, farmers in Limerick and in other parts of the country were faced with tragedy.  I saw a long line of milk carts stretching along the road.  Farmers were frantically inquiring what was going to happen to their milk.  I had to ring the head office of the ESB in Tralee and the Minister's office in Dublin to <Col N="1834" /> find out what would happen on that occasion.  What will happen on any other such occasion to a day's milk or several days' milk which represents the lifeblood of the farmers in the south?  Is their livelihood to be suddenly disrupted?</P>
    <P>People speak of dairy farming being an easy matter at present.  There is no such thing as a five day cow. A cow has to be attended to morning and evening on seven days of the week.  That entails early rising for the farmer and his wife and family.  They have to attend to the cows and get the milk supply to the creamery.</P>
    <P>Somebody said to me recently that Irish farming is a way of life.  It is a way of life which I hope we will never depart from.  I hope we will never abandon what has been a traditional way of life.  Let us have modernisation by all means but do not let us depart from what has been a tradition. It has been suggested that farmers can finish work earlier than used to be the case.  Of course, creameries cannot take in all the milk at the same time.  The milk has to be tested for quality and weighed and entered and the skim milk delivered.  The farmer must make the morning journey to the creamery and must take home with him what is required for the farm, feeding stuffs and, perhaps, medicines, fertilisers, and so on, and also household goods. It would be a strange thing if he were to go home without these things and have to go back again to the town.</P>
    <P>There is a misconception about dairy farming.  If anybody thinks it is a rather indolent way of life, all he has to do is to go into the dairying counties and visit a farm in the early morning and see the work being done.  In spring and summer, the cows have to be driven out and in winter, the farmers have to work late cleaning cowsheds and foddering the animals.</P>
    <P>When the dairy farmers consider the reward which they have been able to earn by their work and compare it with the kind of income available to other sections of the community, they become dissatisfied.  There is the kernel of the unrest and dissatisfaction, unrest and dissatisfaction which have been <Col N="1835" /> growing for quite some time.  I suggest to the Minister that, very understandably, a feeling of disquiet has developed amongst dairy farmers.  They have been unable of their own efforts to improve the position.</P>
    <P>Farmers' costs have been increasing. There is the increasing burden of rates. There is the increasing cost of sickness, if it should come their way, and of educating their families.  It has become increasingly difficult, almost to the point of exclusion, to obtain credit, as any Deputy knows quite well if he has had to make representations on behalf of any member of the farming community to the Agricultural Credit Corporation or to a bank within the past 12 months.  That has been a most difficult situation for the farmers, particularly in this year in which there have been such losses.</P>
    <P>When Deputy O'Donnell was speaking about cattle losses, the Minister intervened to say that the Deputy's assertion was nonsense.  I do not know what the real figures are. Deputy O'Donnell mentioned a figure of around 5,000 cattle and that seemed to be supported by some other speakers.  I am sure the Minister has a more accurate figure but certainly the losses which individual farmers have suffered from contagious abortion and from the situation which arose because of the spring weather conditions, in which cattle died at calving time, were severe.  This is one of the great tragedies that has hit the farming community this year.</P>
    <P>The Minister also adverted to the rationalisation of the dairying industry when speaking about increasing the dairy farmers' incomes.  In regard to this, the Minister rejects the two-tier system and says that he has cogent reasons for doing so.  One of the things that seem to be cogent is the fact that there could be evasion and perhaps fraud.  I suggest that the record of the creamery milk suppliers is well known to the creamery societies to whom they deliver milk.  The quantity of milk which they supply is on permanent record and equally, the Minister's Department know the number of cows <Col N="1836" /> registered in the dairy areas and indeed they know the numbers for the country at large, inasmuch as the bovine tuberculosis eradication scheme has been completed and between this scheme and the calved heifer scheme, they know how many grants were paid out.  In addition, the Minister has the returns from the factories of animals sent for slaughter.  Therefore, the Minister has a pretty clear picture of what the situation ought to be, but even outside that&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>There are 110,000 creamery milk suppliers.  I have a picture of every one of them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>What I mean is that the Minister in his Department, through the creameries, has available to him the number of cows which each supplier has and the quantity of milk each has been delivering to the creameries. If there were to be this type of fraud, and I do not want to say that there might not be some cases of it, it could certainly be discovered rapidly. No scheme, and this includes industrial schemes, which has ever been introduced has not had some snag. This would not apply to the dairying industry alone; it would apply equally to other types of industry which have been subsidised.  There are numerous examples, with which the House is familiar, of industries which were subsidised and in which we have had an imposition in so far as the State was concerned, fraud of one kind or another; yet nobody has ever suggested that the scheme should be immediately thrown out because there was this danger in it.  In so far as industrial grants are concerned, we have continued to encourage them, continued to subsidise industries, despite the fact that we knew, and still know, that this kind of thing will happen. However, we have a large number of people among those concerned who, if they are being assisted, are honest enough not to abuse that assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, it was disappointing to learn that the Minister had decided to have nothing to do with the two-tier system.  This system would help the smaller person to a much greater <Col N="1837" /> extent than the larger person.  The figures of Bord Bainne which I quoted earlier&mdash;and these are the latest figures available in the Library; if the Minister has more recent figures, I would be glad to hear them&mdash;show that the average number of cows in Munster per supplier is only 9.9 and therefore this system could be of great help to this kind of person.  I would ask the Minister to have another look at it.  He will not lose anything by doing so and he will not be committing himself to anything further in the sense that when the price of milk is increased, the increase in so far as the smaller person is concerned, would be more and would enable him to stay in business.</P>
    <P>In that connection I want to say that there is a philosophy or a growing idea in the world today, and it is growing in this country also, that is that smaller units should get out of the way.  To say the least, such an idea is harsh; it is also unwise and certainly should not be typical of the country because this country is composed of small people and small enterprises.  If we reach the stage where the small farm, the small school and the small man is put out of business, I think we have lost the country.  The way of life which we have had here is something which is valuable and worth retaining.  Use any modern means you like but you must keep small people on the small farms where they are at present.</P>
    <P>Figures given today in reply to a Parliamentary Question showed that they are leaving the land and moving away from it.  That is a bad trend for the country.  I want to put this question to the Minister: if and when Ireland gets into the EEC, is the hope of the country not going to be based, in the main, on the land?  Is it not the hope that we will provide a better way of life for the agricultural community and does it mean that the better way of life must be for fewer people living on the land?  Therefore, are we to turn around and set our sights on a target of fewer people, blotting out the smallholdings and getting larger units of land, with more mechanisation and perhaps with increased production? We will pay a terrible price for it in denuding the land of the people who have lived on it in their traditional way <Col N="1838" /> of life.  If we have reached that stage in this country we have reached the stage where the people have left the traditions of the country and are thinking in terms of large scale mechanisation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should come to my county and he will find some of them.  They are still able to do it.  The country held up to us when we talk of dairying is Denmark.  I should like for a moment to contrast the situation in Denmark with the situation here.  Before doing so, I should like to repeat what was said last week, that what applies in Denmark does not automatically apply here.  Denmark has an area of 16,500 square miles and there is a creamery for every 15.7 square miles.  In 1939 there were more&mdash;one creamery for every 9.5 square miles&mdash;and in 1963 there was one for every 13.4 square miles.  Here we have one for every 43.4 square miles which includes 156 central creameries and 456 branch creameries.</P>
      <P>One of the things which the creamery industry itself had been looking into in this respect was the question of federalisation.  There are many experts who think that that is the answer, among them Dr. Knapp. The creameries in the south were moving towards federalisation of their own accord.  In the document issued to the creamery societies recently by the IAOS there is nothing to lead the farming community to think that if they adopt the plan outlined in it they will get an increased price for their milk.  Maybe the Minister is prepared to give such an assurance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>There would have to be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says there would have to be, but would he say there will be?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the whole point of the thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>I will run through some more points and maybe the Minister will remain convinced.  It is foolish <Col N="1840" /> to say there will not be closures of creameries if the plan is adopted.  Of course, there will be, and widespread closures at that.  In regard to cost, I am sure the Minister is aware of what it costs the Dairy Disposal Board to collect milk.  It costs them anything from 2d to 3d per gallon to collect it. That can be found in the balance sheets of the Board.  Any average sized creamery would be able to manufacture milk at about the same price.</P>
      <P>One of the things the Minister might advert to when dealing with this matter is the establishment of central creameries and what the estimated cost of each of these creameries would be, leaving out operating costs and stocks they will have to carry.  I want to suggest that the cost will be at least £1 million per central creamery.  The next point in this document is that at peak periods the producers would pay £3 per gallon for this privilege. Take the average creamery with 8,000 gallons and you get the sum of £24,000. Where would they find that?  These are questions to which the farming community want an answer.</P>
      <P>I do not say they should reject this out of hand.  Along with Deputy Dillon, I say this is something to be studied and examined.  Equally, there is an obligation on the Minister to convey to the IAOS that they ought to be able to convince the dairy farmers of the benefits they will get if they adopt the proposed scheme.</P>

The number of creameries affiliated is 184; the number of agricultural societies, 56; the number of livestock societies, 28.  There are 184 creameries and 154 others.  In regard to all those societies affiliated to the IAOS, it will be found from the returns that some of them have no turnover; of the miscellaneous societies there are 17 with no turnover; under £1,000 there are four; between £1,000 and £10,000 there are also four. In regard to miscellaneous societies, there are 16 with no turnover; under £1,000 there are 11; and from £1,000 to £10,000, there are 18.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the Minister think that the IAOS so constituted and having these other bodies with no direct interest should be able to dictate or decide what would happen to the dairying industry?  With 184 creameries against 154 others, all that is needed is 16 creameries to join the 154 to have a majority saying that the re-organisation scheme ought to be carried out. Whether this plan should be carried out or not ought to be decided and decided only by the creameries affiliated to the IAOS and nobody else.  The 184 creameries are the only bodies directly concerned and they are the <Col N="1842" /> only people who should have the say as to how their industry should go.</P>
    <P>One of the all-important things in regard to any co-operative creamery society has been the credit which it has been able to make available to its members.  We are all familiar with the pattern in the country that, for feeding stuffs, seeds, fertilisers and all the miscellaneous items which are required on the farm and in the home, the supplies are got at the local creamery. These societies have been providing this service for their members over the years.  How much more likely is a farmer to get credit at his local creamery where he is known, where the manager knows him, and knows his background and what he is capable of, than from somebody 15, 20 or 25 miles away?  Is he going to be put in the position that a person at one of these central creameries will be charged with the responsibility of making a decision for him?  This again is a most important point.  This has been mentioned and the Minister can check it in regard to suppliers to the creamery, that in this particular year their credit is used up, their milk is pledged from this until the month of August; normally it is pledged into the month of June. The position in, say, Leinster, is that the Leinster Milk Suppliers Association who supply milk in the main to Dublin use two herds, as opposed to the situation in Munster whose feeding arrangements have been referred to rather disparagingly by some speakers, where there is a slackness of milk when the cows dry out in the month of November until the following March.</P>
    <P>The farm operations must go on; the farm family must live and they must have credit.  They have no place to get it but at the local creamery. This is one of the other great factors which will influence their thinking on this matter.  Every rural Deputy is aware of the type of thing that can happen in farming, the misfortunes that can occur when animals get sick or die, when the weather is unfavourable and bad crops hit them.  It is a fair weather type of industry and if it meets these conditions the farmers are in trouble and they must rely on credit locally if they are to keep going.  This <Col N="1843" /> is a very real fear among the farming community and among the dairy farmers in particular in regard to this re-organisation.  They view it with great suspicion and they are not convinced that they have had all the answers to their case.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned the pilot scheme, and the Minister might give us such a scheme in the western part of Limerick.  The Minister has said that one of the lessons Moorepark has taught people is how to do things better.  We should be very glad if the Minister would tell us how to do things better in West Limerick.  We are asking for a pilot scheme and we do not think we are asking for too much.  If the Minister can concede this to all the western seaboard, to the congested districts there, and if he has been able to appoint, as he has, various agricultural advisers to look after the west, he will agree that we are as much entitled to the services of some of those people.  Our small farmers in that area are as much entitled to a pilot scheme as any others&mdash;something which would show them how they could live on the land.</P>
    <P>This is one of the things which has been happening in regard to the agricultural community.  You have this increasing age group in farming.  You have the younger men leaving the country and going abroad.  Others are coming to Dublin seeking work in the building and other industries because they are unable to find a living on the land.  It is very regrettable that this should happen.  Anything by way of advisory service or otherwise which the Minister could envisage to help them is most necessary.  It would be a tragic day if the same things happen in other portions of the country as happened in the west.  Those of us who have been in the western areas, in the Sligo and Mayo areas, have seen the older men left and the younger men gone.  If this continues for a time, there will be no farming problem left because the young farming community will have gone at that stage.  We will be left with an old and aging generation who will manage to eke out their existence but we will be losing the <Col N="1844" /> virile younger people who should be remaining on the land.  It is because of this low income that this is happening.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I think the Minister's thinking has been bounded by the horizons of the Budget.  It is perfectly clear from his speech that the Budget set the frame in which the Minister's thinking had to be done in regard to agriculture.</P>

      <P>The Minister would do more for agriculture if his thinking were not framed within this type of situation.</P>
      <P>Again I want to say to the Minister &mdash;dealing with a Ministry which I believe is the most important Ministry in the Government&mdash;that he should speak for the interest which he represents, he should carry conviction to the Government in this matter and that, amongst the sections for which he is responsible, I am convinced the dairy farmers of my constituency are entitled to an increase in the price of milk.  I think the Minister is agreed on that; that they are entitled to an increase in the price of milk.  The finding of this is another matter.  On one thing at least anybody I have heard speaking here so far has agreed and that is that there must be an increase for the dairy farmers.  In that respect it would be a most desirable thing if the farming community were speaking with one mind.  I am sure the Minister would agree that nothing could do better for the interests of the farming community than that there should be a united type of voice speaking for agriculture.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree; I believe it would but, in this matter again, I want to speak for the dairy farmers.  They have been for a long time agitating and seeking the type of relief to which they justly believe they are entitled.  I would hope that nothing would happen at any stage which would make them feel that, in their approaches, they would be denied the kind of relief they sought and for which they should get credit.  It is regrettable they have <Col N="1845" /> been in such straitened circumstances; that they have been driven to the stage where they find themselves here in Dublin.  They would have been much happier, I believe, on their own small-holdings, at much less expense to themselves and certainly more at ease.  I do not think they are a breed of people who just breathe defiance for the sake of defiance.  They are much more reasonable than that.</P>
      <P>I hope that the winds and smoke signals which we heard, saw, felt or read of over the weekend will mean something positive in so far as this dispute is concerned, and in so far as the relations of the Minister with the farmers are concerned.  I hope the Minister will meet them speedily and alleviate the distress in which they find themselves.  I believe they will, for their part, respond by working all the harder to justify the type of investment which all sections of the country are prepared to make in what is the most important sector of the community&mdash; the agricultural sector.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Gibbons)</NameTxt>
      <P>Everybody in this House appreciates that Deputy Jones is a very honest Deputy and that he approaches this question of agriculture with an honest mind.  While I regret I had not the pleasure of hearing his complete contribution to this debate, the part of it I did hear, I am afraid, reflected what we have come to recognise always as the Fine Gael attitude to agriculture and farming problems in general.  It goes like this: a Fine Gael Deputy, such as Deputy Jones, is capable of reviewing the general situation and recognising difficulties which have cropped up in recent times, or difficulties of a more permanent kind. They are able to identify the hardship and difficulties which these occasion for the farmers.  It is quite easy&mdash;in fact it is most unusual&mdash;to refer to anything in a discussion on agriculture other than the small farmers, but the Fine Gael trade mark on all this is the complete absence of any suggestion whatsoever which would serve to get the farmers out of the situation which they are able to identify.  I do not say that with any intention of <Col N="1846" /> disparaging Deputy Jones or any of his colleagues but I have been listening to agricultural debates in this House for many years now and that is always the hallmark of the Fine Gael approach to agriculture.  They recognise some of the difficulties but they can never prescribe a cure.  The most normal reaction&mdash;of which I acquit Deputy Jones in large measure &mdash;is to blame the Government Party, to blame Fianna Fáil.  That is a simple, handy, solution to the problem, in the absence of any constructive thinking on their own part.</P>
      <P>Deputy Jones referred to the traditional rural life of the farmers.  He waxed a little lyrical about it.  I have no doubt that he is as familiar with rural Ireland as I am, and his memory and mine both go back to this idyllic situation which he described. But if we look at it closely, we will discover that the standards of living that were so rosy in his eyes over the arches of years, looking backwards, were not so rosy after all.  Looking at them with the cold eye of realism, he and I will remember the dire poverty of the thirties, and he and I will both say that no young man in rural Ireland today will accept the standards our fathers accepted that gave rise to great new problems for people who would set themselves the task of improving the lot of the farmers of Ireland.</P>
      <P>Now, Deputy Jones also expressed a view about the IAOS.  He expressed it in his own mild way.  I have expressed the same view much more trenchantly here in past years.  In my opinion, the IAOS rested in a fossilised state for many decades, but under the spur of a visiting American expert, Dr. Knapp, they produced this very mild document I have here with me, to which Deputy Jones referred in his speech and to which I shall refer again later on.  I do not want to harp on Deputy Jones&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but he expressed the gravest suspicions of the recommendation made by the IAOS for the rationalisation of the Irish creamery industry.  This debate, so far as it has gone, has been coloured <Col N="1847" /> by recent events in the agricultural world and in particular, by the demonstrations of the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association for what they call a two-tier price.  This is not the brainchild of the ICMSA.  It was not conceived by any Irish farmer.  It is the brainchild of an old classmate of mine, Ray Crotty, of Kilkenny.  It is not my intention to throw a great deal of cold water upon it, but there are some obvious things that come to mind.</P>
      <P>The vast majority of the creamery milk suppliers would be the beneficiaries under, let us say, the first tier.  But these are men who by their own industry and thrift&mdash;and there are men like this in every parish, as Deputy Jones and Deputy Flanagan well know &mdash;and by their application, suitability to their job, brains and hard work, built themselves up to a level where they would qualify for the second tier, and the thanks they get from the organisation which says it represents them is to reduce the price of milk for production over a certain figure. I recognise that the objective and the intention behind this is fair enough, but I think that underlying this automatic demand is the belief that the one and only cure for the problems of the dairy farmer and, indeed, the whole agricultural community in general, would be more assistance from the Government.  It is no harm to recall that over the past ten years the assistance given by the Government to farmers directly has multiplied by three.</P>
      <P>It is unfortunate that the organisation that makes this demand without any discussion, without any argument, is the same organisation as hanged this IAOS document without trial. The proposals made by their own organisation, the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society, for the benefit of the farmers was hanged without trial by the Irish Dairy Industry Committee, the personnel of which, I am told, is largely identical with that of the ICMSA.  I think that is most unfortunate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said by way of interjection a while ago, this does not profess to be a blueprint in any respect.  It is merely <Col N="1848" /> a most tentative suggestion that points out in a very general way the present condition of our co-operative organisation and it makes mildly, almost timidly, some proposals for its benefit. They are proposals for discussion, for improvement, if possible, and all for the benefit of the farmers.  It has this great merit in this document the farmer says to himself: &ldquo;The Government will give us every help possible and we, in turn, will look at our own organisation and see what we can do to help ourselves.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In thinking of the recent campaign by the ICMSA and what must be called the civil war between them and the NFA, it is my opinion as a farmer that our problems are being ignored both by the NFA and the ICMSA and that more attention is being given by each organisation to the war for supremacy between those two organisations. I appeal to them both to recognise this fact themselves and to settle their differences because they are doing the farmers of Ireland no service. Some foolish people have said that the Government would be delighted to play off one party against the other.  How can anyone be so stupid as to say such a thing?  How could any Minister for Agriculture do anything but rejoice if he had one, strong, united farmers' organisation to help him do his job properly, because the criterion of success for any Minister for Agriculture is to increase benefits for farmers, to ease their lot, to increase their production and make them healthier and happier men.  He will not do that when the farmers' organisations are tearing one another's throats out, and anyone who says the Minister or anyone else is benefiting by this regrettable split in the farmers' organisations is no better than a fool, and should be treated as such.</P>
    <P>Again as a farmer representing a very rural constituency, I appeal to these people.  This has gone on long enough.  The rank and file of the farmers are fed up with it, and wish that they would come together and form a decent farmers' organisation, if possible, something on the lines suggested recently.  However, that is a matter for themselves to decide.  It will demand great breadth of mind on the <Col N="1849" /> part of leaders of the organisations.  It will possibly demand the eating of a little crow by both parties, but I think the men who constitute both these organisations are big enough to do that.  If that could be achieved, it would be a great day for the Irish farmer, and both of the organisations could then get down to examine the purpose behind this IAOS plan.  As I have said, its main purpose is to get the farmers' organisations and the farmers' co-operatives to do something for themselves as well as getting the maximum amount of help from the Government which will always be forthcoming from any Irish Government.</P>
    <P>It is true to say that the help they have got has been multiplied by three by this Government, but, in my opinion, it is dangerous that a mentality should grow up in which farmers will automatically and unthinkingly turn to the Government, to the Minister for Finance, to the Minister for Agriculture, and say: &ldquo;We are in trouble.  Our incomes are low; you will have to fix this.&rdquo;  He can help but if that idea becomes accepted, it would be a bad day for the farmers themselves, because in the last analysis they must depend on themselves.  I believe if the small farmer co-operatives do not improve themselves by uniting and the individual small farmers do not try to stand on their feet collectively through their co-ops there will be little chance for the maintenance of the small farmers' position.</P>
    <P>It would take too long possibly to go into any detail as to the reasons why the IAOS plan was rejected out of hand, without trial and possibly without being read.  The constitution of the IAOS and of the committees under their control have been examined already in this House during this debate and there are many people who fear, as Deputy Jones fears, that some small creameries will become extinct and that the creamery personnel will thereby be disemployed.  The same kind of argument can be made with regard to any line of industry where efficient methods are introduced to replace old, inefficient ones.  Possibly it would almost be necessary to have some rearrangement but since its aim is to <Col N="1850" /> have a thriving industry, then it is obvious that a thriving industry will give more employment rather than less.  This will mean more competent management.  The fears some people may have of disemployment because of the adoption of some such plans of the IAOS are, in my opinion, groundless.</P>
    <P>I want to return to something I discussed in this House before.  Some of my colleagues, especially Mr. John Moher, who was a Deputy here, took the same line with regard to this.  As I have already said, this IOAS scheme is based on a tentative approach. When Mr. Moher was here, he, some others and myself did not flatter ourselves when we identified some of the difficulties of the co-op organisation before Dr. Knapp arrived.</P>
    <P>Probably Mr. Moher and many others of us had the advantage of coming from rural Ireland.  We lived there all the time and we knew what we were talking about.  The same difficulties have been underlined here year after year.  The IAOS did nothing about this for about 40 years.</P>
    <P>The first thing to do is to identify the obvious faults of the co-operative organisation as it is now.  Some progress has been made out of the utter isolation of the small co-operatives in recent years.  I suppose, ten years ago, the great majority of co-operative creameries in Ireland were completely isolated.  I remember Mr. John Moher described the individual managers of those little creameries as Raniers in their little Monacos.  That was the position then.  Not only was there no co-operation in the individual creamery societies but in many cases there was keen rivalry as regards such things as suppliers.  Those individual creameries should realise the great opportunities that would accrue to them if they all got together and said: &ldquo;We will go into this business together.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The first fault in those small organisations is their small size and because of that many of them are operating as butter factories with their little churns working for a couple of hours a week. The small suppliers come into them with their supply of milk on their own vehicles, whether it is the back of a <Col N="1851" /> tractor, the ass and the cart or some other conveyance.  I often wonder how some of those individual co-operative societies ever managed because of their general inefficient running.  Of course, like all small units, there are notable exceptions.  There are some small units in my own constituency which have made notable contributions to the raising of agricultural standards within their own areas.  Those individual units are very few.  It is a very different matter when it comes to the boundaries of those areas.</P>
    <P>The sole preoccupation of those small co-operatives was milk and butter.  The farmer who supplied them had some other enterprises.  They had pigs and grain but the co-operatives never took any interest in that at all. Above all, the co-operatives never concerned themselves in any way at all with the basic material for the milk, in the first place, which is grass or the necessity to produce high quality grass in order that milk production would be increased within their own creamery area.  Advisory services of their own were completely absent in those creameries.  The creameries did not take the slightest interest in the activities of the individual members.  Each person arrived early in the morning with his milk; he collected his skimmed milk; and he went home again.  That particular kind of production is long since doomed to failure.</P>
    <P>We must, in fairness to the managers of the creamery co-operatives, recognise their natural fears in any proposal that will be made for re-organisation.  As I have already said, the re-organisation will give more employment for co-operative people rather than less.  It seems to me at any rate, that the fears of individual managers are groundless. Another difficulty of the small independent co-operative creamery was the fact that while his product might be good in quality, the gross production of our Irish creameries was not uniform. The production of three or four different creameries might all be good but it would be different and they were not able to produce a uniform high quality production for export out of that area.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1852" /> High-pointing the faults of creamery organisations as we find them, we come to the constitution of creamery committees and again this varies.  There are some creamery committees who, with efficient managers, have done excellent work for the farmers in their areas. There are other committees in which the tenure of office not only lasts for the duration of a committee man's life but it passes on.  It is a hereditary title. It is a little status symbol of committee membership, of hereditary succession to fathers to whom membership had also been passed on.  These committees are not remarkable for their contributions to the welfare of the creameries they serve.  The most serious fault of all in the small creameries is their isolation one from the other.  I have said it before but it is worth saying again that the obvious and logical questions this begs is what ought the co-operative organisations be.</P>
    <P>I think the local creamery ought to be an integral part of an agricultural organisation which could be enormous in potential, in production and in the benefits it would confer on the farmers who put it there in the first place.  It could be very efficient.  It is with a view to achieving efficient production that I advocate the amalgamation of the creameries, because what use would there be in reorganising the creameries if it were not for the farmers in the country as a whole?</P>
    <P>Ideally, a local creamery in an organisation such as I envisage would supply cream to a central butter factory, having collected the milk in the first place from the individual suppliers. In that way, there would be more uniform butter production.  Not only that, but the local creameries should be centres from which individual farmers would get their fertilisers. Local farmers would be able to hire their farm machinery, would be able to arrange for the erection of farm buildings, would be able to plan their production programme and their marketing programme.  I shall return to that because, as I have said, many farmers not only produce milk but they produce meat of all kinds &mdash; beef, mutton, pork and the other kinds of <Col N="1853" /> produce which are not considered at the moment by most co-operatives.</P>
    <P>When I speak of amalgamation of small creameries into large units, I envisage for the sake of argument areas of about county size, embracing all the co-operative societies within their respective borders.  I consider that in an area of that size the co-operative organisations should be well able to handle the bulk distribution of fertilisers from one centre. I consider it to be the function of the individual societies, the various creameries, to take farmers' orders for fertilisers, to transmit them to the central depot and have the fertilisers distributed to the farmers' land as and when the individual farmers require it.</P>
    <P>Most co-operative creameries at the moment deal in fertilisers.  In the first place, they deliver them in sacks.  In the second place, they very often attune their prices to the prices of local merchants and thirdly, and most importantly, they deliver them in very small quantities, therefore, uneconomically and, therefore, expensively.  I feel sure an organisation of county size, of the kind I am talking about, would be able to do the whole job for the farmers more cheaply than is being done now, when the farmers have to collect from the creameries. At present most co-operative creameries deal in feeding stuffs for pigs, calves and other animals, in small quantities.  Since they are produced in small quantities they are relatively expensive.  I understand that in parts of the country co-operatives are approaching the problem of the establishment of a central stock feeding milling plant.  It is probably one of the most obvious courses for the adequate supply of animal food that is open to co-operatives, but no great progress has been made.</P>
    <P>The Mitchelstown group of creameries have pioneered a farm machinery hire service and I believe it is very efficient.  Speaking of the dairy country as a whole&mdash;the whole of Munster and south Leinster&mdash;there is not any uniform availability of the kind of machinery the farmers require nowadays, such as silage making machinery. It costs the individual farmer about <Col N="1854" /> £2,000 to £3,000 to equip himself for silage making economically.  This is an ideal case where the local co-operatives could provide such a high service, but it would be provided more economically by a large central unit.</P>
    <P>A great source of mastitis among cows in recent years has been the inefficient servicing of milking machines by inexpert people.  A group of highly trained technicians with vans could get around an area of county size and be able to service such machinery.  There could be a couple of teams of maintenance men who would call on farmers periodically to check all milking machines and see that they were functioning properly. This has not been done on a wide scale as far as I know.</P>
    <P>There are in this country meat processing plants that were established as co-operatives but which do not function as co-operatives.  The only benefit shareholders get from them is that for every £100 they own in share capital they get a cheque for £6 10s. or £7 every year if they are lucky. They are never told when there is, for instance, a market for lamb and, in fact, the co-operatives never inquire if the farmers have lambs, bullocks or pigs.  Very often the management committee of such co-operatives is the hereditary right of a small minority and gives the farmers, whose money put it there in the first place, no service at all.  I do not see why co-operative meat factories of this kind could not be welded into the general structure of a strongly federated, united co-operative organisation.  I mentioned already that advisory services are topics about which opinions clash very heavily and have done so for years.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon always advocated a parish plan.  The parish plan, in my opinion, took no cognisance of the facts at all.  The parish advisory service was accepting the Ireland, first of all, of the individual farmer and it would help him as best he could to produce whatever he could to no set pattern.  Other people have advocated other advisory services of other kinds. I think that a strong united co-operative organisation, embracing all the farmers in the country eventually, primarily <Col N="1855" /> and initially in the dairying areas where a co-operative movement exists, in however stunted a state, would be the place to impose advisory services because with tight liaison between production and management and, finally, processing of products, the advisory service is a vital link between the farmer who produces the stuff and the food processing factory, whether it be a butter factory or a meat factory who handled it.  They would be able to gear their production completely and precisely through the advisory service to the available market.  They would be able to diversify to some extent, and in fact, through the advisory service, advise the individual farmers when there would be a market for such and such a commodity.</P>
    <P>Similarly in the handling end of the business, the food processing end would be fairly accurately aware of the available size of any commodity, whether lamb for the French market or bacon or pork for the British market.  I think that close liaison between the farmer and the processing end of agriculture would give a strong organisation and farmers would be able to iron out a lot of the troughs that occurred most noticeably in our pig production over the years.  The graph of pig production over 20 or 30 years looks like a saw, a slight over-production leading to a light drop in prices, leading in turn to a slight drop in production and numbers.  When the numbers and prices drop, people get in at that stage and there is the rising end of the graph again.  There is a complete absence of liaison between the processing end of the bacon industry and the producer.</P>
    <P>As I say, a well organised co-operative organisation, with a good advisory service superimposed on it, would eliminate management difficulties.  It is a tall order, I suppose.  It is a tall order when you consider the reception the tentative plan of the IAOS received from one fraction of the farmers' organisation, but I think it must be done.  I think there is no point at all in any Deputy coming in here, whether he be Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil or Labour, or anything else, and pointing <Col N="1856" /> out in dreary monotony all the difficulties the small farmer has if some means are not devised whereby he can help himself.  He must learn and he must understand that with the best will in the world and the best support the Government can give him, unless there is this effort to independence and self-reliance, many of them will not succeed in raising their standards. Therefore, it behoves farm organisations to apply themselves to the problem of helping the farmer to help himself.  The leadership, in my opinion, must come from the farm organisations.  I hope in the future it will come from the farm organisation; I hope there will be only one.  But, so much effort is dissipated in scoring clever points one after the other that the real interests of the farmer seem to have been forgotten, to some extent at any rate, by both parties in the present dispute.</P>
    <P>It is easy enough to recognise the farmer's grievance.  It is easy enough to understand how a small farmer living perhaps on 25 acres and making a living of £300 from it, if he is fairly good, feels when he looks at the ease with which industrial workers can improve their lot and get the sympathy of everybody because they are united.  It never seems to strike the farmers that if they were strong and united, they would probably have the strongest organisation of all.  The béal booht approach to farm problems will not solve the farm difficulties and the sooner we all face up to that the better and the farmers must be the first to recognise it.  If they do not, no matter what help the Government gives, they will never achieve the production this country is really capable of.  I hope they succeed in resolving their differences and I hope they will apply themselves to this most important of all tasks, that along with the help they already get from the Minister and the Government they will unite the forces of the farming people of Ireland and enable them to help themselves.</P>

      <P>Every year this House considers the Vote for the Department of Agriculture as the most <Col N="1857" /> important Estimate before the House. Not alone is the Agriculture Estimate considered to be the most important, but it is, and the reason is very evident and clear.  This is an agricultural country and this being an agricultural country, the main concern of the Government and of this House should be to advance the interest of agriculture.</P>
      <P>May I say at the outset how happy I am to learn that, as a result of commonsense prevailing, the farmers' pickets are now gone from outside Leinster House?  With the continuance of that same commonsense and a sane approach, plus a little give and take, may we hope this will be the end for all time of farmers picketing outside Leinster House?  I am glad the Minister and the creamery milk suppliers have agreed to meet.  I trust that when these talks take place, irrespective of what sacrifices may have to be made, there will be a satisfactory settlement of this problem. These men are hardworking, industrious, decent farmers.  They feel they have a genuine grievance.  I believe they have a genuine grievance.  Let us hope there will be a successful outcome to the conference between them and the Minister for Agriculture tomorrow.  The Minister has the good wishes of every Member of this House in this grave situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If one likes to call it such, there has been competition between the Creamery Milk Suppliers Association and the NFA.  Both have entered the race, anxious to see which can do the most, get the most, and act most quickly in the interests of the farmers. In the Creamery Milk Suppliers Association, there are men of understanding, men of intelligence, men of great commonsense, men who have exercised a great deal of patience; in the NFA, there are reputable men, men of great courage, men who are sincere in their efforts to improve the lot of the farmers, men who are reasonable in their negotiations.  It is regrettable that there should be any great difference of opinion between them or any race to see which will be in first to the Minister's office to be the first <Col N="1858" /> to carry out the good news.  I have the greatest respect and admiration for the men in the Creamery Milk Suppliers Association who negotiate on behalf of their members.  I would have the greatest confidence, the greatest trust and the greatest reliance on the ability and sincerity of the NFA to negotiate on behalf of milk suppliers or on behalf of any group of Irish farmers.</P>
    <P>It is generally regretted throughout the country that there should be any cleavage.  The aim of every Minister for Agriculture since the State was founded and the aim of every Member of this House is to try to make the farmer a more prosperous man in the autumn than he was when he entered his lands in the spring.  So it is with the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers and so it is with the members of the NFA.  Their ambitions are identical. They want to improve the lot of the Irish farmer.  It is regrettable, therefore, that there should be any rivalry or any misunderstanding between men who have so much in common.</P>
    <P>I trust the Minister may be able to do a service to the country; before his conference with these men breaks up tomorrow, I hope he will be in a position to give at least 3d. per gallon for milk.  They are entitled to that and I trust the Minister will see fit to give it to them, as a first instalment of his recognition of the very genuine case they have.  I shall say nothing further at this stage lest I might prejudice the case one way or the other.  I hope the Minister will leave nothing undone to ensure a favourable conclusion to the negotiations into which he is about to enter.  He has the good wishes of us all.  I trust the outcome will be successful.</P>
    <P>I want now to deal with general agricultural policy.  May I say that I think the Minister is the worst Minister this country has ever had?  I am quite serious in that.  He may have been a good Minister for Justice.  I believe he would be a good Minister for Industry and Commerce.  He is a likeable fellow, very approachable and very understanding.  Nevertheless, he is a misfit in the Department of <Col N="1859" /> Agriculture.  He has an attractive personality. We all acknowledge that.  It is reasonbly easy to see him and he can grasp with speed and understanding any problem one may put before him.  But how on earth the Taoiseach picked on him above all to be Minister for Agriculture is something I could never understand.</P>
    <P>Whether we like it or not, he is now Minister for Agriculture.  I doubt if any Minister for Agriculture was ever quite so far removed from the people on the land as is the present Minister. I know he will take what I have to say in good part, remembering that what I have to say I am saying in the interests of the agricultural community. In addition to its being in the interests of the agricultural community, I am, I believe, expressing the opinion of the vast majority of our Irish farmers.  It may or it may not be a good thing to have a Minister in charge of a Department who knows nothing of the practical workings of that over which he has control.  The present Minister for Agriculture has been far removed from the conditions, the responsibilities, the worries and the trials experienced by farmers in rural Ireland.  I should have liked a Minister for Agriculture who came from the farming stock, who understood and knew the problems.  But why I really feel that agriculture is decaying today is because the Minister is so far removed from the realities of agriculture.</P>
    <P>There is nothing easier than to go into a ministerial office to keep in the closest possible contact with one's officers and officials, to read and study and make oneself familiar with the everyday workings of a Department but I really feel one must live amongst the people, one must be familiar with their conditions and their problems and one must understand the difficulties associated with life on the land. The Minister for Agriculture is as far removed from the realities of Irish agriculture as if he were operating from space.  His selected company is not the farming type.  In my opinion, he does not put himself in the way of knowing and meeting the ordinary plain farmers of this country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1860" /> The time has come for the Minister to take a little advice.  For what it is worth, I should like to give him a word of very humble but nevertheless sincere advice, that is, to come down to the level of the farmer, to talk the farmer's language, to see problems as the farmer sees them and to understand the difficulties of the life of the Irish farmer.  If a Minister for Agriculture possesses these qualities, I have little doubt that he will make a success of his Department but if we are to view the state of Irish agriculture over the past 12 months&mdash;the past 12 months is the period now under review&mdash;we must candidly admit that it is in a state of very serious decay.</P>
    <P>The Irish farmer is growing thinner and poorer while other sections of the community are, at his expense, inclined to become fatter and richer.  Is it not correct to say that people in every walk of Irish life have got some measure of increase in order to meet the cost of living and in order to meet other rising costs, with the exception of the Irish farmer?  I do not mind what records or what economists may say or even the reports and the statistics that are published from time to time: the real fact of the matter is that, as we know them, farmers are undoubtedly poorer than they were this time 12 months ago.  If we have to judge prosperity, the one way in which prosperity is judged is by the amount of spending money a person has in his pocket.  I put it to the Minister tonight that Irish farmers have less spending money in their pockets, that the Irish farmer's wife has less spending money in her purse, that the Irish farmer's daughter has less shopping money in her shopping bag and in her purse. The facts are that their incomes have dropped steadily.</P>
    <P>I challenge any member of the Government Party to come down to any county in Ireland and to judge the position, whether it is the tillage lands of Laois or Wexford, whether it is the milk counties of north Cork, Limerick or South Tipperary, whether it is the beef lands of Westmeath, whether it is the farmers of the west with their small farms problem, whether it is the farmer who rears <Col N="1861" /> his sheep on the Wicklow mountains or on the Kerry mountains or whether it is the farmer in Leitrim or Roscommon with his very special problems. I will challenge any Deputy to say that he can meet any farmer honestly who can prove he is a better-off man today than he was 12 months ago.</P>
    <P>Rates have gone up.  Taxes have gone up.  Petrol has gone up.  Car tax has gone up.  The rate of pay of his agricultural worker has gone up.  Social welfare stamps have increased in price. The ordinary running of any farmer's house is more expensive.  The position is that there is a greater demand on his expenditure.  Practically everything he has to sell is bringing in a lesser amount than it did with the result that we see that farmers have now become a most confused, disillusioned, depressed, distressed and uneasy section of the community.</P>
    <P>There was a time in Ireland when the farmer could be described as the backbone of this country.  He cannot now be described as the backbone of this country because his financial position and the conditions in which he is forced to work, render him a slave in this country.  The sooner any Minister realises that you cannot talk down to the farmers, that they cannot be treated as penny-boys and as slaves, the better. You cannot look down upon them: on the contrary, you must look up to them and listen to them.  You must take their advice.  You must find out what they want and do what is possible to apply the remedies they suggest.</P>
    <P>Every man knows his own business best.  It is like the old saying that the cobbler should stick to his last.  So it is with the farmer.  The farmer knows his job best.  If the farmers' organisations&mdash;the county committees of agriculture, the general council of committees of agriculture, the organisations that may speak on behalf of Irish agriculture&mdash;make suggestions and proposals, I put it to the Minister that they are suggestions and proposals of a practical character, coming from the men who are on the job and men who know exactly what they want themselves. That is why I say that until such time as the advice of the Irish farmers themselves is accepted and acted upon, <Col N="1862" /> you will not have a prosperous agricultural community.</P>
    <P>How many times have we had the experience in recent years of the Government trying to convert this country from an agricultural country into an industrial country?</P>

      <P>You cannot make an agricultural country an industrial country.  No matter how you may try to do it, it still will not work.  Industrial countries and agricultural countries are, as such, ordained by God and the power of man cannot change them. There is nothing the Government can do to alter the fact that this is an agricultural country and that agriculture should come first here.  The great mistake was and is that the Government from their infancy did not realise the importance of Irish agriculture and failed to invest a small proportion of what they invested in industry, particularly unprofitable industries in Irish agriculture instead.  If they had done so, we could be, as regards agriculture, in our own way, as prosperous as any farmer in New Zealand or Denmark. But we did not concentrate on the importance of Irish agriculture.  We were too busy trying to drive the people off the land, to destroy the British market, and industrialise the country instead of helping the farming community to become the most prosperous section of the community.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Everybody is worried about it.  We are very worried about it here.  Recently, when Sir Walter Nash, the former New Zealand premier, was here he stated in my presence that in New Zealand they had the highest degree of prosperity among the farmers.  I have no reason to believe that a man who was a member of the New Zealand Parliament for 44 years, was twice Prime Minister and twice Minister for Finance and a number of times Leader of the Opposition and who is now Father of the House of Representatives in Wellington, would give a false impression. I am convinced he knew what he was talking about when he described the farmers as the really prosperous backbone of New Zealand. We find here that instead of concentrating on improving agriculture and investing courageously in it we are driving people off the land.  The real test of agriculture is found in the prosperity or otherwise of the farmers.</P>
      <P>The Irish farmers are not afraid, and never were afraid, of hard work which is nothing new to them.  The hardest work falls to the tillage farmer who is now practically in a state of bankruptcy.  Many farmers you meet today will tell you that tillage is finished and gone.  Take wheat, for example.  The wheat acreage in 1958 was 418,000.  That is now down in 1965 to 182,000 acres.  Why is it down? Is it because it paid too well that they grew less of it?  Is it not true that if a farmer is not being paid for a crop he will not sow or grow it?  That is the position regarding wheat, a drop from 400,000 acres to 182,000 acres, an extraordinary fall.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But the Irish farmers never made money on wheat: the one section of the community that did is the millers. The Government always took care that if there was to be any profit out of wheat the millers would get it.  Nowhere in the world would an influential, small, greedy monopoly such as the millers be allowed to treat the farmers as the millers here were allowed to treat the Irish farmers.  I <Col N="1864" /> salute Deputy Dillon when I think of how he dealt with the millers.  The Minister will remember the bad year in which the millers told Deputy Dillon when he was Minister for Agriculture that they would not take the wheat because it had too high a moisture content.  This was during one of the very wet years.  Deputy Dillon told them he would make them take it and did so and they paid for it.</P>
    <P>The regrettable thing from the Irish farmers' point of view is that Deputy Dillon was not long enough there as Minister for Agriculture.  If he had been, he would have taught the millers how to treat the farmers and would have shown them the importance of the farmer in Irish agricultural life.  I cannot understand why any Minister for Agriculture should stand idly by and see farmers having to work hard to produce wheat and get it to the mills and then be ordered away with it by the millers.  It would be very disheartening for any of us, having to work hard and cope with the weather and finally depending on the price we expect for our crop, only to find that at the time we rely on it to pay our way and provide the wherewithal to keep body and soul together, the crop is rejected by the rich millers.  I have known first-class wheat to be ordered away from the mills.  I have known the moisture content to be taken and the readings passed on to the farmer.  I have known the millers to say that the wheat was not of a superior quality and that the grower could not be paid the recognised price and the rejected wheat to be brought back again, the same wheat in the same sacks, by other farmers and the top price to be paid and the millers to accept it as best quality wheat.</P>
    <P>I want, if I may, to pay a special tribute to the memory of the late Mr. Gerald Fitzgibbon of the Department of Agriculture.  Mr. Fitzgibbon died during the year.  The Irish farmers owe a great deal to the efforts of the late Mr. Fitzgibbon on their behalf.  He was keenly concerned about them and on many occasions intervened with the millers with the result that the millers were compelled to take and to pay top <Col N="1865" /> price for wheat which they had rejected.</P>
    <P>The millers must owe the Irish farmers some millions of pounds.  One reason why the acreage of wheat has dropped so much is that the Irish farmers never got fair play in the marketing, payment, sale or disposal of their wheat.  In 1965, the acreage of wheat in Irish soil was the lowest for many long years.  I venture to say that this year there is less wheat sown by farmers.  If wheat were a profitable crop for the farmers they would sow it.  The Irish farmers have now got wise to the position.  They see no reason why they should work hard growing wheat for the millers to reap the benefit.  The result is that farmers have got out of wheat production.  Is that a matter in respect of which the Minister deserves a bouquet or congratulations? The acreage of wheat is down drastically.  The reason is that it is a non-profitable crop.</P>
    <P>The acreage under oats, in 1958, was 457,000.  It is down this year to 284,000 acres.  Does the Minister deserve congratulations in respect of the drop in the acreage of oats?  As a result of his activities there is less wheat and less oats under the ground.  The reason is that these commodities do not pay the Irish farmer.</P>
    <P>In 1958, there were 3,000 acres of rye grown in this country.  In 1965, there were 1,612 acres&mdash;another drop. The acreage under potatoes in 1958 was 262,000; in 1965, it was down to 174,000 acres.  In 1958, there were 13,000 acres of fodder beet; in 1965, 10,000 acres.  Mangolds were down from 54,000 acres to 39,000 acres; sugar beet down from 84,000 acres to 65,000 acres.  Is there any degree of prosperity in that?  Can anyone explain why the tillage farmers of Carlow, Laois, Wexford, Kilkenny and Kildare have gone out of tillage?  They are not growing wheat, oats or beet.  May I ask the Minister for Agriculture, what crop is paying the farmer?  Beet was always a profitable crop.</P>
    <P>The Irish Sugar Company and the Beet Growers Association reresentatives met to negotiate the price which farmers should get for beet.  My information <Col N="1866" /> is that when the conference took place it was the council of the BGA, without any consultation with the rank and file that fixed the price of beet and that the price fixed has not been in accordance with the wishes of the majority of beetgrowers and that beet is coming to be recognised as a crop which cannot be profitably produced at the present rate of pay per ton and with the tags and conditions attached to it.  The beetgrowers made the only protest they could make when they found that the crop was not profitable at the price they were receiving. The beetgrowers supplying beet to Carlow, Thurles, Mallow and Tuam felt that the price they were receiving did not compensate for the cost of production, including the sowing, thinning, pulling, transport to factory and taking into account the deduction made by the factory for wear and tear.  I have known beetgrowers in my constituency and elsewhere who, instead of receiving a cheque from the Irish Sugar Company, received bills.  Instead of being paid what they were expecting for their crop, the farmers owed the Sugar Company money.</P>
    <P>Farmers cannot be expected to produce beet in these conditions any more than they can be expected to grow oats or wheat at a loss.  In addition to the decline in the acreage under corn crops, root crops and green crops show a decline.  The reduction in the acreage of beet is a very serious matter for the beetgrowers.  The Minister should have had consultation with the Irish Sugar Company and the Beetgrowers Association with a view to seeing that the beet-grower was given a fair and profitable price for his beet.  I put it to the Minister that the farmer has not been paid for his beet, just as he has not been paid for his wheat or for his oats.  That is the reason farmers are getting out of tillage and not producing these crops.  There has been a very serious drop in acreage.</P>
    <P>Some time ago the Irish Sugar Company told farmers that they should engage in the production of fruit and numbers of them did so yet we find that while in 1961 there were 12,000 acres of fruit the figure in 1965 had gone down to 10,000 acres.  They were also told by the Sugar Company and <Col N="1867" /> by other concerns to produce such vegetables as celery and peas and I know of landowners in parts of Offaly who produced these vegetables and had to allow them to rot in the ground because when it came to getting profitable markets for them they were just not there.  I trust that the Minister will sympathetically consider the case of many Galway and Offaly farmers who produced greens for the Ever Fresh factory near Banagher in County Galway and who in many cases suffered serious financial loss.  Who is going to compensate or help these farmers?  There is no question of any of them trying to recoup themselves.</P>
    <P>If that is the agriculture about which the Minister boasts he should hang his head in shame.  It is disgraceful that farmers should be treated in that fashion and it is a very low level to which to allow farmers to sink.  That is the Minister's record in regard to tillage.  It is a bad record as we have perhaps the worst tillage record since the State was founded. In my opinion the tillage record has been responsible for driving farmers to the doorsteps of the workhouses. On top of that there was the situation which arose in regard to the price of milk and the extraordinary situation that arose in connection with rates. Agriculture was never in a more depressed state.  To cap everything there is a credit squeeze and the ordinary farmer is in a very serious plight for the want of working capital. He is asked by the Minister to increase his stock and to increase his acreage under tillage but he has refused to do this because it is not profitable.  There are no means by which the farmer can be provided with capital to work his lands.  The banks will not give him anything and the Agricultural Credit Corporation has not been as generous as was expected.  The Government have restricted loans and the situation is that if a farmer walked into a bank, before the strike, seeking a loan to improve his lands, purchase livestock, or break up additional land for tillage, I venture to say that a gangster with a six-shooter in his hand and a mask over his eyes would have been <Col N="1868" /> more welcome in that bank than the farmer.  Is that not a grand state of affairs in an agricultural country where one would expect that the farmer would at least be treated by the Government with respect and confidence? Is it not true to say that today the vast majority of farmers are on the verge of bankruptcy and not only that but that the vast majority of them have their lands mortgaged to the hilt?  They are seriously in debt with no hope of paying off the debt, no matter how hard they work or how industrious they may be.</P>
    <P>With great respect to the Agricultural Credit Corporation, and to the Department of Agriculture for all the loans and grants they have made available, and with great respect to the commercial banks who may trust the occasional farmer, I still feel that I am correct in saying that agriculture is now being starved to death for the want of sound capital investment. There seems to be no sound national investment in agriculture.  The industry requires an investment of some millions to enable the farmer to stand on his own feet, to stock his lands to their capacity.  It is regrettable to see the number of farmers who say that although they have good lands and excellent grazing, they have no stock to eat the grass that is now coming up.</P>
    <P>In my capacity as an auctioneer, I meet this type of farmer.  I have met farmers coming to make arrangements to let their grazing and when I asked them why they were doing this they politely said that they had no stock themselves to put on the land but that if they had stock they would certainly put them grazing on their own lands.  The prospect of purchasing stock is nil because of the lack of financial accommodation available for the purpose.  I hope that the Department of Agriculture will tackle this problem in a courageous manner. What is the use of tinkering with agriculture?  Let us have some sound investment in agriculture to put the farmer on his feet and not have him living in drudgery and in a depressed state, living from hand to mouth.</P>
    <P>I fail to understand why the Irish <Col N="1869" /> farmers have been regarded as the one section of the community that cannot be trusted with money.  I could never understand why the Irish farmer could not get substantial amounts of money, either for livestock or for increased tillage at normal rates of interest. The interest rates are far too high and the security and guarantees necessary are far too strict.  If the Government are serious in helping the Irish farmer out of the plight in which he now finds himself, they must first see he has the necessary working capital.  He is starved of capital.  Today there are no means by which he can get that capital.  Nobody gives two thraneens whether he gets it or not.  The Minister is not concerned whether the Irish farmer owes £100 or £1,000.  Everybody seems to be concerned that he gets one thing only, that is, nothing.</P>
    <P>What makes the Irish farmer depressed? Is he not depressed when he sees what happens to people in other walks of life, for example, those engaged in industry?  I am not saying that those engaged in industry are not entitled to what they are getting.  Of course, they are.  They are entitled to more than they are getting; otherwise, you would not have the great industrial unrest you have in the country.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>When the farmer sees the share of prosperity other sections of the community are claiming and getting, all he can do is sit down and look on. When he goes to look for anything, <Col N="1870" /> there is a way of dealing with him. The poor farmer has no strike weapon. He must milk his cows.  He must carry on his foddering.  He must till and sow and reap.  He must work.  He cannot strike.  Another reason is that nobody ever seems to be afraid of the farmers.  Why?  Because the farmers are not united.  They are not a strong driving force.  If the Irish farmer were even as cute as the British farmer, he would be better off today.  I take off my hat to the British farmers.  England is undoubtedly an industrial country, but the British farmers are a highly organised section of the community there.  It is regrettable that in Ireland agriculture seems to have been the playtoy of Irish politics.</P>

      <P>I was endeavouring to convey to Deputy Crowley and others why the Irish farmer is so depressed.  He is depressed when he sees all the organised sections of the community making their demands and being successful in their demands, when he cannot make a successful demand at all.  All of us agree that the Irish farmer is entitled to a fairer crack of the whip than he is getting.  There is a gap of £300 per year between the income per family of the farmer and that of the industrial worker.  Then, as a result of the policy of the Minister for Agriculture, the flight from the land has increased from 10,000 in 1964 to the alarming level of 14,000 in 1965.  I have already explained to the House the problem of the reduction in tillage and the plight of the milk producer, and in addition to all that, there are 14,000 people fewer on the land today than there were in 1964.  Surely that is nothing to be proud of?</P>
      <P>Very recently agricultural labourers have been given an increase of £1 a week in two instalments.  Let me say there is no labouring man more entitled to that increase, but surely the farmer himself is entitled to some substantial increase to enable him to pay the agricultural worker?  In Ireland today, the lowest paid is the farm worker and the second lowest paid is the farmer himself.  I do not see what the Minister has to boast about when it comes to the question of the prosperity of our agriculture.</P>
      <P>Let us turn for a moment to the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement. Fianna Fáil went over to London and on 14th December, 1965, signed the Free Trade Area Agreement between Ireland and Britain, which comes into force on 1st July next.</P>

      <P>I welcome it. Is that not what Fianna Fáil should have been doing the whole time instead of shouting that the British market was gone and gone forever; burn everything British except her coal? I congratulate Fianna Fáil on their <Col N="1873" /> conversion to the British market.  If only they had listened to the common sense and intelligence shown in the speeches from this side of the House, if only they had taken some inspiration from them years ago which would have converted them to the wisdom of and the necessity for the closest possible marketing link between Ireland and Britain, the Irish farmers would be better off today.  However, it is better late than never.  After 30 years in the wilderness condemning the British market, dissociating themselves from the British market, they now have to eat their words, and one would expect at least some member of the Party to admit that Fine Gael were right.</P>

      <P>The British market is our nearest and most profitable market.  If Fianna Fáil had handled this situation rightly from the start, we should be one of the most prosperous agricultural countries in the world, having this huge, consumer population of industrial Britain at our doorstep crying out for Irish food, for Irish beef, Irish butter, Irish lamb, Irish bacon and ham.  Instead of the Irish farmer being asked to produce for export for Britain where he would have a profitable, guaranteed and long-term market, he was told by Fianna Fáil to boycott the British market. They should have stopped this nonsense and said: &ldquo;Here we are, an agricultural <Col N="1874" /> country, ready to produce, and what we can produce we can land in Britain inside three hours&rdquo;&mdash;a stone's throw away.  The huge population of London at our doorstep; the big population of Manchester, Birmingham and all the cities of Britain and here is Ireland&mdash;the garden for Britain&mdash;right at the doorstep.  But the Irish farmers had to make sacrifices just to satisfy Fianna Fáil.  Now we have reached the stage when they have at last grown out of swaddling clothes.  They are beginning to grow up and see the value of the British market.  How many times did Irish Ministers go over to England? Fianna Fáil Ministers went over.  I remember on one occasion the former Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Smith, going over to negotiate better prices for the Irish farmers' produce He came back having lost the concessions we had when he was going.  He came back worse off than he had gone.</P>
      <P>The 1948 Trade Agreement put millions and millions of pounds into the pockets of Irish farmers.  That was negotiated when Deputy Dillon was Minister for Agriculture and Deputy John A. Costello was Taoiseach.  The 1948 Trade Agreement linked up the price of Irish livestock with the price of British livestock which the British farmers were getting on the British market.  That was the first time that ever happened.  It meant that millions and millions were put into the pockets of Irish farmers which would never have been put there were it not for the foresight, intelligence and negotiating power of Deputies John A. Costello and James Dillon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil went over recently and they tell us they did even better than that.  There was very little in the recent trade agreement by way of an improvement on the 1948 Agreement. The Anglo-Irish free trade area agreement is a continuance of the 1948 Agreement for which Deputies John A. Costello and Dillon were mainly responsible.  If you ask any of the Fianna Fáil Party what did the Irish delegation get from Britain in the recent negotiations they will proudly tell you that as a result of these talks the basic quota for Irish butter has been raised from 12,905 tons to 23,000 <Col N="1875" /> tons in the year ending 17th March, 1967.  That is to say the quota of Irish butter to Britain has been increased from 12,000 to 23,000 tons, despite the fact that 24,000 tons went over last year.  But they are not telling us that every single pound of Irish butter in that quota exported from Ireland to Britain is neatly wrapped up in a 1/7d postal order and the Irish tax-payer is paying 1/7d for every single pound of butter which is exported. So that the British can have their throats lubricated to swallow our butter, we are paying them 1/7d a lb. Is it not an extraordinary state of affairs to say that when we export 23,000 tons of butter for every single pound we send 1/7d out of the country as well?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot understand why we must pay the British for eating our butter.  Our butter is of sufficient quality; very appetising and, perhaps, the best manufactured butter in the world.  I would put Irish butter to the test with Danish, British, Australian or New Zealand butter.  I say our creamery butter must rank as the best and highest quality butter in the world today.  That cannot be denied.  Does the Parliamentary Secretary agree with me?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Now we have the best butter in the world but, despite the fact that we are sending over to Britain the best butter in the world, is it not extraordinary that we have to send over 1/7 with each pound to help the British eat it?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can never understand why we must pay the British for eating our butter.  The position is that whilst we must pay the British for eating our butter, Irish <Col N="1876" /> creamery butter can be purchased in any part of Britain where it is on sale, and that is not every place in Britain because there are Irish in Britain who never see Irish butter or bacon and who would be only too delighted to purchase Irish agricultural goods if they could get them but they cannot because they are not there. Irish butter can be purchased at 1/7d and 1/8d a lb cheaper in Britain today than it can in Dublin or in any part of the country.</P>
      <P>I am always most enthusiastic to hear the Parliamentary Secretary explain matters in his constituency.  I promise very sincerely that I will be the most attentive hearer he will have at any meeting in the constituency which he will convene for the purpose of explaining why we must pay 1/7d or 1/8d a lb more for our butter at home than the British pay for it in England.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Parliamentary Secretary I will not interrupt him but will be a very keen listener, because this is something I have wanted explained to me for a long time and I have failed to get a satisfactory explanation.  However, perhaps at some future date we may be able to organise this explanatory conference when we can go into this matter in greater detail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here we have what I consider to be very important figures&mdash;figures which show Irish agriculture on the decline.  The farmers would be in the poorhouses long ago were it not for the export of cattle.  If it were not for the price of cattle Irish farmers would have been begging long ago.  It is the cattle export trade which has kept the Irish farmer with a shirt on his back and a boot on his foot.  Here we can see that in 1963, between fat cattle and store cattle, the total number of cattle exported to Britain and the Six Counties was 631,000, and in 1965 the total number of fat cattle and store cattle exported had dropped, and dropped considerably.  It was down from 631,000 to 500,000.  Is that a sign <Col N="1877" /> of prosperity?  Is that a sign of wealth? Is that a sign that the Irish farmers are getting money into the country? In my opinion, that is a substantial loss to the Irish farmers, and I should like an explanation from the Minister.</P>
    <P>We have already demonstrated to him clearly today in this House that there has been a drop in tillage.  We now find that as well as a serious drop in tillage, there has been a serious drop in the export of fat cattle and store cattle.  All I can say is, if Fianna Fáil are in office for another two or three years, may the Lord help the Irish farmers.  There will be a further fall in the export of store cattle and fat cattle, and the farmers will have gone out of tillage.  The Lord knows what will have happened to the milk producers.  Unless the Minister exercises some degree of commonsense and intelligence tomorrow, there will be a very serious situation, holding nothing but gloom, for Irish agriculture.  There appears to be no degree whatever of prosperity.  There seem to be no means by which Irish agriculture can improve.  There seem to be no means at the disposal of Irish farmers for improving their standard of living.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to allow this opportunity to pass without making a brief reference to poultry.  The poultry industry is now a thing of the past. I should like to refer, if I may, to the very serious plight of those engaged in the production of turkeys.  This is a very serious matter.  There was a time when the farmer's wife was able to supply the domestic needs of the household at Christmas out of her profit from the sale of turkeys on the Christmas market.  That is gone.  It is no longer at her disposal.  The June, 1965, statistics showed a further reduction in turkey numbers, and exports during the Christmas season were only about 13,000 birds.  I am sure the Minister will tell us that the reason why only 13,000 birds were exported for the Christmas market last year was that there were already too many turkeys in Britain, that the British producer of turkeys had already produced a sufficient number of turkeys for the British market.</P>
    <P>I want to put it to the Minister that <Col N="1878" /> it is on record that the Irish turkey producers can produce a bird of better quality, more appetising, and with a higher degree of flavour, than the British producer can, and that if Irish turkeys are on the market in Britain, nine times out of ten, the British housewife will ask for an Irish turkey in preference to the British turkey, because the flavour of the Irish turkeys is to her taste.  There is a flavour associated with Irish turkeys that is not associated with the British bird. If there is such a demand in Britain for Irish turkeys, I fail to see why we have not some proper organisation to deal with the export of Irish turkeys to Britain for the Christmas market.</P>
    <P>There seems to be a complete breakdown in the marketing of Irish turkeys in Britain.  There was a time when turkey was regarded as a seasonal dish but now turkey is eaten at any time of the year.  The greatest demand is at Christmas, but the export of turkeys to Britain for the Christmas market has been mishandled and badly managed. This has been responsible for a substantial loss in the income of the farmer's wife and the poultry producer. There should be an inquiry into the method of marketing turkeys. I understand that expert advice has been offered time and again to the Department of Agriculture but that expert advice has been ignored.  The time has come for a full investigation into the marketing of turkeys.</P>
    <P>May I now enter in some detail into the question of pig production, bacon factories, and the working of the Pigs and Bacon Commission?  I have some observations to make in regard to pig production.  Like every other section of Irish agriculture, the pig producers are on the verge of bankruptcy. They are no different from the wheat growers, the dairy farmers, or any other section of Irish agriculture. The pig producer today is undoubtedly on the verge of bankruptcy. In other words, he is out of business. The Minister should look into this matter in some detail because there was a time when pig production was a very profitable business.  It is no longer a profitable business.</P>
    <P>Some years ago in the midlands, in <Col N="1879" /> Waterford, Wexford and Cork, farmers went in for pig production to a very high degree.  At that time it was on a far more profitable basis than it is today.  Many years ago we had farmers engaged in pig production, and we <Col N="1880" /> also had another section of the community engaged in pig production.</P>
    <P>Progress reported: Committee to sit again.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 18th May, 1966.</P>
