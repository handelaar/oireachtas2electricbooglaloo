      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power whether it is the intention of CIE to agree to become the sole guarantors of the 3½ per cent new guarantee preference stock in the Fishguard and Rosslare Railways and Harbour Company; and, if so, how this is to the advantage of CIE.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>CIE and British Railways, as successors to the Great Southern and Western Railway Company and the Great Western Railway Company, respectively, are joint guarantors of the interest payable on the new guaranteed 3½ per cent preference stock of the Fishguard and Rosslare Railways and Harbours Company. By virtue of an intercompany agreement, scheduled to the Fishguard and Rosslare Railways and Harbours Act, 1903, CIE are responsible to the Fishguard and Rosslare Company for the <Col N="2" /> interest payable on capital issued to meet expenditure on the portion of the undertaking in Ireland.  As the capital represented by the new guaranteed 3½ per cent preference stock was all raised to meet expenditure in Ireland, it should not affect CIE's financial responsibility if they were to become the sole guarantors of the interest on the stock.</P>
      <P>The implications of this and other provisions of a Bill which the British Railways Board have applied for leave to introduce in the British Parliament in the present session are, at present, being examined by CIE and by my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it, then, that CIE are to agree to become the sole guarantors?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>If they do, it will not affect their financial position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Since British Railways <Col N="3" /> are at present legally jointly responsible, surely CIE should benefit in some way from agreeing to become the sole guarantors?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>That is one of the points which will be discussed.  For a long time, CIE have been responsible for the payment of the interest on the shares in respect of all the expenditure undertaken in Ireland relating to Rosslare Harbour and the portion of the railway from Rosslare to Fermoy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not disputing that.  If CIE are to give up their right to a position of being joint guarantor and are to become sole guarantor, then this is an advantage for British Railways and CIE should get some compensation for it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Up to 30th November, 1966, 87 road merchandise licences were issued by my Department to Northern Ireland licensed hauliers enabling them to engage in cross-Border carriage of goods for reward, excluding point-to-point haulage within the State. At the same date, vehicle entry licences had been issued in respect of 487 vehicles which these licensees are using or propose to use in the course of their cross-Border operations.</P>
      <P>At the same date, 50 operators' licences and 162 vehicle licences had been issued by the Ministry of Development, Stormont, to road hauliers licensed to operate in the State.</P>

      <P>Information received by my Department indicates that the proportion of the mountain wool clip sold this year is generally not less than in other years.  Some decline in price which took place at the end of the season would, of course, have affected any producers who deferred too long the disposal of their wool.</P>
      <P>As I indicated in reply to questions by Deputy Donnellan on 17th November and Deputy Governey on 1st December, I am arranging for the introduction of legislation with a view to improving the marketing arrangements for wool.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister <Col N="5" /> for Local Government what steps are contemplated to ease the traffic congestion in Dublin city centre during the coming Christmas season, with particular reference to the operation of large public service omnibuses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Bye-laws and temporary rules designed to improve traffic flow are made by the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána with my consent, and the enforcement of such measures is also a matter for the Commissioner.</P>
      <P>A number of such provisions already apply to the central city area, for example, the system of one-way streets, the extensive restrictions on kerbside parking and the reservation of substantial sections of kerbside space for stops and stands for public service vehicles.  I understand that the Commissioner does not propose to make additional bye-laws or rules for the present, but to intensify enforcement of the existing parking controls; the Garda also hope to secure, by suitable publicity, an improvement in the co-operation of the public in alleviating peak-hour problems.</P>
      <P>I may add that serious obstruction to peak-hour traffic has tended, with the development of the central city one-way system, to move to the suburban radial routes.  As a first step in dealing with this, clearways have, with my consent, been established with effect from 5th instant on the two suburban routes most affected.</P>
      <P>Public transport will naturally benefit from the various measures I have mentioned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. O'Malley) (for the Minister for Social Welfare)</NameTxt>
      <P>The person referred to made a claim to unemployment benefit on 10th October, 1966, which was disallowed on the ground that he was not unemployed.  Apart from his insurable employment, the insured person is a farmer.  Statutory regulations provide that where a person has another occupation, as in this case, from which the remuneration or profit is more than 10/- a day or its equivalent he cannot be regarded as unemployed unless at least 78 employment contributions have been paid in respect of him in a given period of three years prior to his claim.  In this case the profit from the farm exceeded the statutory maximum and the claimant did not satisfy the contribution requirement mentioned.  He appealed against the disallowance of his claim and an appeals officer, following an oral hearing, upheld the disallowance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware, of course, that the statutory limit is 10/-a day, on which the man, his wife and ten children will be able to live very highly.  Is the Minister aware that this man travelled 27 miles per day to work on the bogs when he could get employment? If he were not in need of employment, would the Minister think that he would do that?  Is it not a shocking situation where a man with 11 persons to support, in addition to himself, is refused unemployment benefit, although he is entitled to it, because of the fact that he has 10/- a day income?</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is hard but his income is calculated, I think, at £260 per annum.  His allowances in respect of nine children under 16 years of age are £10 11s a month, which is not a lot but is something.  Another aspect is that he is not an applicant for unemployment assistance, although he is <Col N="14" /> qualified to apply for unemployment assistance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister <Col N="15" /> for Social Welfare (a) if the increase of 5/- weekly was to be given to all old age pensioners; if not, if he will state precisely what conditions are applied to exclude many from receipt of the increase; and (b) what items count as income in computing an applicant's means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>As announced in the Budget in March, 1966, and as the House has been informed a number of times since, the increase of 5/- was to be given to old age non-contributory pensioners with no assessable means. The power enabling the Minister to make such increases is section 2 of the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1966.</P>
      <P>The rules for calculating means are set out in the Seventh Schedule to the Social Welfare Act, 1952.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that the Minister's original statement was widely interpreted by old age pensioners to mean that those in receipt of the full pension would receive the increase of 5/- and has it not transpired that, in fact, one out of every ten old age pensioners has qualified to receive it, and does the Minister not think that this was a mean fraud on the body of people who are entitled so to interpret the explicit statement?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

      <P>The £¼ million, which is all I have available, will, however, finance an increase of 5/- a week, from 1st November next, for persons with no means&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <P>These comprise pensioners whose means were assessed at nil on the investigation of their claims at the latest re-investigation and those who consider that they are entitled are free to apply for re-assessment, as so many may have done at the time these figures were compiled.  Arising out of Deputy Norton's supplementary question as to whether home assistance counts as means, I cannot give him a definite answer but it appears to me that home assistance is given if people are destitute, more or less, and have not any means.  It is a type of <i>post factum</i> assistance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>When I reported progress last week, I was referring to a matter which is of some serious importance to the parents of children in urban areas, particularly in areas that have been expanding rapidly.  I referred to the fact that over the years there appears to have been a lack of the necessary co-operation between the Minister for Education and those concerned with the provision of school buildings.  We have repeatedly, in the perimeter areas of the city of Dublin, a situation where large residential estates have been completed and the families that moved into them had <Col N="24" /> two, three or four children of school-attending age.  They found when they moved in that there was no school in the immediate neighbourhood to which the children could be transferred.  The problem may be a problem of planning as far as the Minister is concerned. It appears to me from the reply given to a Question which I had on the Order Paper that the problem is not only a problem of planning but a problem of education as far as the Minister and his Department are concerned.</P>
      <P>The primary step one must take before one does anything is to convince oneself that what is required is necessary, is reasonable and should be possible.  The Minister stated, in reply to my question on Tuesday, 29th November at column 1708 of the Official Report:</P>
      <P>It will be appreciated, therefore, that while the Department begins to carry out its survey of the school accommodation requirements immediately firm proposals of house building are available it is understandable that there must be a time lag between the actual building of the houses and the schools since some delays must inevitably arise in the school managers' procuring sites and taking out title to them and for other reasons.</P>
      <P>Thousands of Dublin families have, over the years, had the experience that because the Department were prepared to accept the situation, children have to travel two, three, four, five or six miles to school because there is no school in their immediate neighbourhood.  The primary reason for that defect in our educational system is the failure of the Department to accept the principle that the education of our children is a little more important than making a mistake and building a school with two or three additional classrooms which may remain empty for a while.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Successive Ministers have blandly accepted a situation in which parents have been faced with the problem and the difficulty of finding some temporary school for their children, with all <Col N="25" /> that that involves&mdash;taking them to the bus, getting them on the buses, sacrificing time to meet them at lunch hour, and sacrificing more time to meet them in the evening.  That situation arises despite the fact that in nearly every case the Department would have had quite accurate forecasting of the eventual need in the area.  The Department have indulged in the extraordinary exercise of counting the heads of the children in the area before taking steps to ensure adequate classroom accommodation is made available. When I say &ldquo;adequate&rdquo;, I should qualify it with the word &ldquo;barely&rdquo;.  The result has been a situation in which children have not attended school for prolonged periods and that at a time when a break in their education can have a very serious effect on that education.  Even at this very moment the Minister talks about the difficulty in acquiring sites and the time lag between the actual building of the houses and the construction of the school.  Might I refer the Minister to one project, which was the darling of one of his colleagues?</P>

      <P>The Minister is the man to whom we must look in this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is responsible because, under the law, children are subject to compulsory education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the law and the Minister has to enforce the law.  The Minister must, therefore, accept responsibility for undue and unnecessary delay in planning, or anything else, in respect of providing schools for our children.</P>
      <P>Like many in this House, and outside it, I confess I am really no expert on education.  There are a number of experts and there are a number of people who think they are experts.  I do not number myself in either category. My concern is that we have a continuing high proportion of children who receive no education beyond 14 years of age.  I welcome the Minister's intention to raise the school-leaving age to 15 and I should like to know when this will come into operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is expected it will be brought into force in 1970.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>Will it be January 1970?  Will it be June 1970?  Will it be December 1970?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should imagine it will be the beginning of the school year, September 1970.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to pin the Minister down.  I have no doubt the date of operation will be dependent upon the provision of adequate school buildings, the training of additional teachers, and so on.  I do not know if the Minister is satisfied that there will be sufficient teachers to deal with the additional number of children retained in school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another problem which <Col N="27" /> arises from the raising of the school leaving age.  It may not be a problem with which the Minister is concerned but it is a problem with which the Government ought to be concerned.  I would say 100 per cent of the children who leave school at 14 do so because of economic circumstances; their families need their earnings as messenger boys, as factory workers, and so on. These families will be faced with certain economic difficulties if the school leaving age is raised.  We are all agreed that it is most desirable that it should be raised but the problem to which I refer is one to which the Government should direct their attention with a view to seeing what relief could be afforded to these families.  We all agree that no child should be deprived of schooling and it is being made law now that a child will have to go to school or be subject to certain penalties.  This may involve a certain amount of hardship on a number of families.</P>
    <P>Another matter on which I should like to comment briefly is post-primary education and the level at which grants will not apply.  It has not been made quite clear by the particular figures in the Minister's introductory speech why these figures were chosen at the particular level; possibly to cover a large number of fee-paying schools, some of which have indicated they will be considering increasing their fees.  That would mean, in those cases, that as far as the pupils are concerned, the education would not be free.  There may possibly be a development of a certain amount of status consciousness between those schools providing post-primary education and those which will qualify for the grant.  This would be regrettable, because our aim should be to make sure that full education is available, just as the cost of school books will be provided, as referred to in the Minister's introductory speech.</P>
    <P>We all agree that the provision of books has been a particular problem. Part of the problem arises from the very frequent change of the books in use in the various schools.  The experience has been&mdash;even where books were continously in use&mdash;that pupils <Col N="28" /> found it very difficult to obtain them. There are cases&mdash;I am referring now to private schools&mdash;where, sometimes, books used as text books were not in print and were not readily available to the pupils attending those particular institutions.  With regard to the general schools, there were a number of cases where, say, two or three boys or two or three girls in the same family, with fairly close age relationship, found they could not operate on the normal basis, that when the older child moved on to a higher class, the next child could take over the books, at little cost to the parents.  They discovered, when the next child moved into the class from which the older boy or girl was moving on, there was a whole series of new books.</P>
    <P>This has occurred too frequently. What the particular purpose is, I do not know.  It has been particularly evident with books in Irish&mdash;possibly to encourage the authors but, after all, the primary concern must be to make it possible for the pupils to familiarise themselves with the text books and avoid unnecessary expense. If it is found that a text book is quite suitable for a particular age group, why is it necessary&mdash;when other children of the same family enter that age group&mdash;to have entirely new text books?</P>
    <P>I notice, in relation to the provision of books for certain pupils in post-primary schools, that the Minister thinks the best person to decide who should get the books free is the headmaster. How will a headmaster satisfy himself in this matter?</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not tied to the headmaster necessarily.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>We recognise that in his introductory statement the Minister was quoting from the NIEC Report when he said that in the absence of a modern approach to education, we will have a situation in the years to come in which a continuing proportion of our people will receive very little education, or only a basic education, and will not be found to be capable of being trained for advancement in technical or professional knowledge to any degree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="31" /> I do not think the Minister involved himself in the controversy that has become the plaything of politics in recent months so I will get back to a point he made.  I do not expect him to answer me now.  The Minister is at liberty, in dealing with any contribution made by a Deputy, to refute a statement made or to answer a question, if he so desires.  The Minister has indicated that the headmaster of a school will establish some form of means test to decide when school books should be supplied free.  Surely the obvious thing would be to supply all books in a particular grade, and there should be no test under which the headmaster will say that one pupil will be supplied with school books and another pupil will get 50 per cent or 20 per cent supplied.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>School books are costing £100,000 and if we gave them to everyone it would cost £400,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that would be a very useful way of spending money?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be a very good thing.  If the Deputy will permit me, does he understand that when he speaks of 25 per cent of the school books being given at the discretion of the headmaster, that in actual fact there are schools in Ireland in very poor areas where 100 per cent of the books will be free, and there are other areas where people are comparatively well off in which no school books will be given out free because they will not be required?  Twenty-five per cent is the estimated national average.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the protection of the Chair.  I think the Minister should remove from his mind any suggestion that the headmaster should be expected to select which pupils should be supplied with free school books.  I should like the Minister to indicate when he is replying if he is satisfied with the provision of schools, and if he is satisfied with the size of the classes in many primary schools. If he is not satisfied, will he indicate what major steps he proposes to take in that regard?  There is still too much overcrowding.  If the Minister, like some of his colleagues, had taken a trip to the constituency in Waterford, he would have found that there is very serious overcrowding in the schools in the town of Tramore.  Children have to go to schools a considerable distance away because of overcrowding in the local schools.  Some of the children are trying to get their education in schools which are in an unsatisfactory, if not a dangerous, condition.</P>
      <P>I want to deal now with the establishment of regional and vocational colleges.  There are some areas in the country where industries now exist and where there is a need for the training and retraining of the workers in those industries.  I should like an assurance that in any case where such circumstances exist, the Minister will ensure that the educational authorities will co-operate to the fullest extent&mdash;if necessary, by the establishment of special schools, or the acquisition of ground&mdash;in providing an opportunity for the workers to be trained in new techniques, and thereby prevent them becoming redundant through lack of adequate training.</P>
      <P>Now I come to the question of free transport for children.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is indicating that he, the Government, the community, are prepared to pay one <Col N="33" /> hundred per cent of the transport cost of children who have to travel three miles and more.  I should like to point out to the Minister that the cost of transport to children who have to travel two miles, perhaps four times per day, is also very heavy.  Of course that would not arise if the Minister were doing his job and provided schools within two miles of their homes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been discussed. The Minister might examine it in conjunction with the question of free transport.  He should consider the position of children in built-up areas who have to travel two miles to school. Why should he draw an arbitrary line, giving free transport to children who have to travel three miles and refusing to give it to children who have to travel two and threequarter miles? Why do you not provide free transport for these children, many of whom have to travel four times per day&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>My apologies.  Why does the Minister not tell us how this magical three miles came about?  Is it a limit of the Minister's imagination? I ask the Minister very seriously to provide free transport for children in urban areas who have to travel two miles.  Not only have the children to travel but in many cases one of the parents or somebody else must go to collect the children.  This is necessary because of the Minister's failure to provide schools close to where they live.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>Whether it is the by-elections or the atmosphere created by them, certain Deputies have been inclined to take this debate out of its setting and sort of pitch it into the line of battle.  The Deputy who has spoken has been a Member of this House for a long time and he made a statement to the effect that during 28 years a certain personality neglected education.  That is not so, of course. We would be foolish to sit on those benches and listen to a speech of that sort without saying that that statement is not a factual one.  Time and again the Government to which the Deputy referred received a mandate from the people for their educational programme and time and again advances have been made on this side as well as on many sides of our programme as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Education always figures fairly largely in our considerations.  I suppose the fact that it has come into more or less greater prominence at this stage than ever in the past is due to the way the world in general is progressing and to the need there is in this country to look ahead in order to try to equip our young people better to face the world, not merely here at home, but abroad.  I suppose there is also the fact that we have to look to the Common Market and the wider atmosphere <Col N="36" /> in Europe and the fact that the industrial side, the agricultural side and every side of our programme demands more education.  Every man or woman entering either into industry or entering the teaching profession needs to be better equipped for the position he or she holds.</P>
    <P>It cannot be said that either the present Taoiseach or indeed Taoisigh in the past neglected this side of the programme.  I need only quote briefly from the speech the Taoiseach made on the motion nominating the members of his Government.  I quote from column 1183 of the Official Debates of Wednesday, 16th November:</P>
    <P>The Government's aims were set out very comprehensively a few months ago and I do not think I need delay the House this evening by repeating them.  If they should need to be amended in any respect because of new developments, this will be made known from time to time, according as the need arises. I need only say now that my constant concern will be to preserve and strengthen this country's independence and individuality, recognising, on the one hand, that there will be or can be little progress in the political, social and cultural fields unless we are making satisfactory economic progress as well, and on the other, that material progress alone would be barren indeed if it were not accompanied by the moral and intellectual development of all the individuals comprising our community.  In view of its importance in both these respects, I accept it as my duty that despite other claims on our resources, education will be adequately supported. Secondary education has been provided, at a low cost to parents, largely as a result of the devotion and sacrifices of religious orders. There can be no such thing as free education; the community must be prepared to pay one way or the other for whatever improvements are required, both in regard to greater facilities for post-primary education and readier access to further education for those who can <Col N="37" /> benefit from it.  The important thing is to see that inability to pay whatever cost is involved in such education will not debar any child who can benefit from it from receiving it.  That will be one of the immediate objectives of this Government.</P>
    <P>That, as I said, is a statement from the head of the Government made here in this House in good faith.  I do not believe the Deputy who has just spoken can doubt his sincerity or the sincerity of the Government in this matter.</P>
    <P>We are all well aware of the pressing needs in the primary stage of education.  I merely take a few points which relate mainly to the primary and vocational ends because I suppose, coming from a rural area, those are the subjects I am most familiar with.  It is stressed on all sides that in this respect we should always strive to reduce the size of the classes. As a further aid, and indeed a very important one, we should strive towards providing better training and more teachers, better schools, the allocation of higher grants for heating and cleaning schools, the raising of the school leaving age and, in general, extending the opportunities for more education to what could be deemed to be the whole schoolgoing population.</P>
    <P>It should be admitted in this House &mdash;I think the Minister fully recognises this fact&mdash;that all personnel engaged in the teaching service should be encouraged to take part in the planning of education so that there will be, shall we say, a general level of agreement on ways and means as to what can best be done to enhance the ability of the pupils to assimilate the knowledge being imparted in the schools and, not merely this, but to inculcate in them a desire to apply this knowledge in after life.  I would ask the House to bear in mind that unless the pupil has this desire, all effort on him will be wasted and unless the pupil recognises that the knowledge acquired at school is to be used in after life, then time is wasted.</P>

      <P>There are different opinions on this matter.  I have my own opinion, but all one can say is that it is to be hoped that the report will issue and that we shall be able to act upon it.</P>
      <P>The fact is, as the Minister pointed out, that travelling grants are being made available for pupils living over 15 miles from post-primary schools. That is an advance.  The new and improved methods of appointing vocational teachers will certainly be an advance.  We are all aware of the drawbacks and difficulties which attended the appointment of vocational teachers heretofore.  The building of regional technical schools and the new methods of teaching Irish in primary and post-primary schools will certainly lead to a great surge forward on the educational side.  The methods designed to spread adult education, a very important part of the scheme, by means of television and other modern means of communication, and the comprehensive schools, are further advances.  The fact that the fee will be wiped out for pupils attending such schools is encouraging and will be an aid both to the pupils and to the parents.  All those steps show that we are making progress on the educational side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To come from the general to the particular, I mentioned earlier the modern methods of imparting knowledge.  One great method is the use of audio-visual aids in primary schools.  For some time past, the interest taken in these aids in primary schools has been noticeable. One also noted the criticism of the general position which issued last year <Col N="39" /> from the INTO Congress in Killarney. As I understand the position in regard to visual aids&mdash;and I have been looking into the matter as I am interested in it&mdash;a special grant is provided for new or improved schools towards the cost of school requisites which may include certain audio-visual aids such as a tape-recorder, record player, or film strip projector.  The scheme is administered through the free grant scheme for school requisites.  The general principle behind the grant is good.  The provision of such a grant is not only desirable but essential.</P>
    <P>However, on examination, it can be seen that the scheme has several shortcomings. The scheme was originally intended to provide a basic free stock for new schools of maps, blackboards and so on.  There is no doubt that those appointments are a first claim for any new school.  Surely, however, the scheme is handicapped by the amount of the grant made available?  This applies particularly to rural schools where the average enrolment exceeds 125, which would be a reasonably-sized school.  The Minister is aware of the scale of the grants, which is roughly as follows: where the average enrolment is 50 or under, the grant is £16; where the enrolment is from 51 to 75, it is £18; where the enrolment is from 76 to 100, it is £20; and where it is in excess of 100 to 125, it is £22.  When one takes current costs into account, it will be agreed that the scale falls far short of providing this desirable equipment.</P>
    <P>Over and above this, if a school has to purchase maps and other essential items, there is no money left to purchase audio-visual aids.  In this regard, even a small film strip projector will, on average, cost from £22 to £30.  A screen could cost anything from £5 to £20 while the fitting of blinds to a classroom could cost £20 to £30.  With the free stock grant, a special grant up to £35 is available for the purchase of cookery utensils and equipment in girls' schools.  One could make the point, therefore, that the grant for all the visual aids should be treated separately as in the case of the grant <Col N="40" /> for cookery equipment and that the whole basis of this grant should be changed so that the Minister would be able to make available special grants to those schools towards the purchase of all the visual aids.  Those grants could be of the order of 75 per cent, say, of the cost up to a maximum of £40 and should be made to the managers in my opinion of three-teacher schools and upwards.</P>
    <P>The idea of confining the grants to the schools with three teachers and upwards is that it will be possible to utilise such equipment to the greatest extent in such schools where, for example, there is no question of the amalgamation or retention of this type of school.  When the question of smaller schools has been settled, those units could be made available to them also.</P>
    <P>If one puts forward a proposition in this House or elsewhere, one should always try to count the cost.  If we examine the position, we see that there is a total of roughly 1,600 schools with three teachers and upwards.  For this information I refer the House to paragraph 9.17, page 247, of the report, <i>Investment in Education</i>.  If we assume that all those schools apply for the grant&mdash;that would be completely out of the question, of course&mdash;the total amount would not exceed, I think, £63,000 or £64,000.  If we take it by easier stages we could split it up so that the scheme of grants would be spread over, say, five years, if we take an average of five counties to be included each year, or on the same basis as the present grant scheme for libraries in national schools is being implemented.  It is understood that this library scheme will be completed in the near future, next year or the year after perhaps, and it could be, therefore, suggested, and I think I am at liberty to suggest, that a scheme of grants for all the visual aids should follow on immediately the library scheme is completed.  Spread over a five-year period, it would meet what many educationists believe is a long-felt want in our system of primary education.</P>
    <P>To go back to the report, <i>Investment in Education</i>, on page 250 we see that <Col N="41" /> only about five per cent of our national schools have film strip projectors.  We must, therefore, infer that the present position is poor.  If we are to keep ourselves reasonably in line with other desirable advances in other sectors of our education system, I would ask the Minister progressively to consider the provision of those aids on such a system as is advocated or, indeed, any other better system the Minister might be able to formulate.  Managers of rural schools would welcome a move like this which would be calculated to bring us farther along the road to a better primary education level.</P>

      <P>As I said when I rudely interrupted Deputy Larkin, I have listened to and was studying all the views put forward by the Members on all sides of the House.  I will take note of any constructive points that have been made and if they can help in any way in improving further our educational system, I shall certainly incorporate them in any proposals I may have at a further date.  While I am Minister for Education, the major consideration will be what is good for our children, and everything else will be secondary to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the debate itself, there has been some confusion in the public mind.  My speech was a speech on my Estimate. It so happened, for reasons best known to themselves, that just prior to my introductory statement on the Estimate, the Fine Gael Party chose to introduce their proposals for education. I am very glad they did because, as I said some time ago, it was an <Col N="42" /> extraordinary thing that in this country we could have a political Party, the chief Opposition Party, going before the public in successive elections without any policy whatsoever on education. They produced their Just Society document and in that they had no policy set out with regard to educational matters.  They then panicked. They saw what importance the public at large attributed to the education of their children.  They saw it was of paramount political importance as well as of social importance, and hence we had this hurried document.</P>
    <P>As I say, there was confusion in the mind of a great deal of the public and also among some commentators, political commentators and those who write on educational matters.  They have not differentiated between my Estimate speech and the Fine Gael policy on education.  Mine, of course, was not a policy statement, and I did not claim that it was.  It was an acceptance that there were certain basic defects, due in the main to an inequality of opportunity for our children, and this was one of the first tasks with which I was confronted, the fact that there were, indeed still are and will be until 1st September next, many thousands of children who are debarred from entering post-primary education, due to the inability of their parents to pay.</P>
    <P>Getting back to the comparisons between my Estimate speech and the Fine Gael policy document, I should like to remind Deputies that it was a predecessor of mine, Deputy Dr. Hillery, who initated in October, 1962 the survey which has become the bible so to speak of all educationists, and particularly of the Fine Gael Party.  It was he who initiated <i>Investment in Education</i>.  This was carried out by Irishmen, in the main, and a contribution, for which we were very grateful, was received from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development as the project was under the Educational Investment and Planning Programme of that organisation.  They did give us a certain amount of technical support and information on comparable or related developments in <Col N="43" /> other countries with which they were conversant but, as I say, in the main, it was carried out by Irish people.  We owe a tremendous debt of gratitude to the steering committee, of which an assistant secretary of my Department, Mr. Seán Mac Gearailt, was chairman, and to the survey team under Mr. Patrick Lynch.  They gave of their time and produced this tremendous document and two other documents of equal breadth and depth, annexes and appendices thereto, in the comparatively short time of about two years. This team could well set a headline to other bodies&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in the expeditious manner in which they carried out their task.  I should like to mention what exactly was achieved by the <i>Investment in Education</i> team, and particularly that most of the information, statistics and observations have been &ldquo;cogged&rdquo; by the Fine Gael Party in their very detailed policy document. We do not criticise them for that, but when people have suggested in the press that mine was not a statement of policy, I should like to stress that it was a member of the present Government, a previous Minister for Education, Deputy Dr. Hillery, who initiated this procedure whereby <i>Investment in Education</i> was published and made available the information on which the Fine Gael Party's plan was based and these discussions have taken place.  I would bring this to the attention of all commentators dealing with these matters in journals, on television and radio.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the first chapter of this publication they went through the whole Irish educational system without trying to hide any of the defects which might have appeared to exist.  They were quite factual in everything they said.  In Chapter I the whole system, starting with the general background, was dealt with.  They considered national schools, secondary schools, the special schools, the reformatories, teacher training colleges, non-aided primary schools, non-aided <Col N="44" /> secondary schools, vocational schools, agricultural schools, universities, other third level methods of teaching, non-aided religious schools, participation rates and part-time education.  That was all done in an exemplary fashion.</P>
    <P>I was in Paris recently at a meeting of UNESCO.  A Minister for Education in another country, which I shall not name, told me that this report pioneered by Ireland had won tremendous attention in other European countries and had set a headline for the manner in which it was carried out.  It is a great compliment to us in Ireland that we have been the pioneers in this development.</P>

      <P>Chapter II of <i>Investment in Education</i> deals with forecasts of population and in the following chapters they deal with forecasts of pupil enrolment, in junior cycle, senior cycle, third level and part-time education.  In a very comprehensive way they deal with the projected requirements and supply of teachers and schools.  This was of tremendous help to us.  What was the outcry on 10th September when I made my speech at the NUJ dinner in Dún Laoghaire?  The first cry was: &ldquo;Where are we going to get the money?&rdquo;  That is not a difficulty to Fine Gael now.  They say it will not require increased taxation but will come from the buoyancy of the revenue.  Then we had the cry: &ldquo;How can you give free education up to intermediate level?&rdquo;  Mark you, on 10th September my commitment was up to intermediate level with assistance up to leaving certificate level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>We did not hear anything about the leaving certificate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>In the next paragraph, I said on 10th of September that financial assistance would be required for parents who wished to continue their children's education up to leaving certificate.  Now that my scheme has been announced, we are <Col N="45" /> catering for 75 per cent of the pupils going to day schools up to leaving certificate level.  Then they asked: &ldquo;Where is he going to get the schools?&rdquo; and: &ldquo;Where is he going to get the teachers?&rdquo;  That was the negative approach.  This inequality of treatment of our children was crying out to high heaven for rectification.  I am very glad that in the dying months of this historic year we are at least in the process of fulfilling one part of the Proclamation by giving equality of education to all our children, although the Proclamation is still a long way from being fulfilled.</P>
      <P>To get back to <i>Investment in Education</i>, not one word of tribute was paid to the detailed work of those who prepared this document and made available the information which, in certain instances, is quoted <i>verbatim</i> in the Fine Gael document.  <i>Investment in Education</i> goes on to deal with the projected requirements and supply of teachers and schools, the cost projections of the different grades&mdash;primary, secondary, vocational, comprehensive, colleges of technology, universities&mdash; and they deal with the problems of teacher training and other State educational expenditure.  They give a summary of their views at the end of Chapter V.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Part II of <i>Investment in Education</i>, they deal with the educational sector; flow pattern and output; the participation now and the anticipated participation in the future in the light of the experience gained.  They took as a base the intermediate certificate candidates in 1963.  They deal with leavers from the junior cycle in the secondary schools.  They deal with the senior cycle, leaving certificate; matriculation requirements; comparison with England and Wales; entrants to universities; those who left full-time education before taking the leaving certificate; the other senior cycle leavers.  They went on to deal in great detail with the vocational schools continuation courses, day group certificate, and the number that left these courses. They gave the reasons they attributed to why they left.  They dealt with national school leavers and other <Col N="46" /> schools and provided a summary at the end of the chapter.</P>
    <P>In Part II of this second section they went into great detail in respect of participation in education and anticipated participation.  They dealt with social groups in Ireland; town and rural areas; the differences between the counties; a survey of those who leave school at an early age and they gave the background of the social groupings at national and secondary school levels.</P>
    <P>One of the most important sections of this document is Chapter VII, which deals with manpower policy in Ireland at present and in the years that lie ahead.  They deal with the compatibility of manpower requirement with population data and the trends which exist.  They deal with the methods they used for forecasting, so that educationists who write on this topic would have a base for constructive criticism and discussion.  They deal with the historical approach.  Before one can discuss education in Ireland one has to understand the history of our educational system, the history of our national schools, how they came into being, why the religious orders play so prominent a part in our educational system, the history of our universities, how they came to be set up, the 1908 Act and its ramifications, how the constituent colleges of the National University came into being, the historical background of Trinity College, one of the most renowned universities not only in Europe but indeed in the world.  They give the manpower projections for the future, what would be the requirements when we get into Europe and what was the vital work to be done in the apparently very short interim period.  They deal with the compatibility of manpower requirements with the estimated population in 1971, the highly qualified manpower which would be required and which we lack at present.  They give a revision of the estimates which had been made up to now.</P>
    <P>In Chapter VIII, a most fascinating chapter, which is again referred to in the Fine Gael document, they give a comparison of requirements and supply by educational levels.  This was all set <Col N="47" /> out here in great detail and referred to in great detail, too, by Fine Gael.</P>
    <P>Then, in Part III, we have statements on the present use of our resources in national schools; the cost aspects; the present distribution of teachers in Ireland in national schools and the distribution of schools generally; the current costs and the capital costs and a very truthful analysis of the benefits as the team see them; the examination performance, with statistics setting out results; the age standard distribution of pupils, the school curricula and criticism of the school curricula and criticism of the primary school with some of which I am in thorough agreement. All of these headings, in some instances or in all, were used by Fine Gael which was a great compliment to the survey team and to my colleagues, in setting up this project.</P>
    <P>I have denounced and condemned the primary certificate examination in Ireland but Fine Gael have announced that their plan is to abolish <i>in toto</i> the primary certificate.  I will not say it is a retrograde step but I do not think it is a very wise decision.  The conception of the primary certificate, as we know it at the present time, is diabolical. Certain decisions must immediately be taken which will ensure that the curricula are revised and the method of setting the examination papers is reviewed.  I propose, there, that the members of my Department will sit down with the teachers, who, after all, are in the field, so to speak&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;we hope, by the principal of the school.  There are such things, of course, as the unfortunate <Col N="48" /> position at the present time where there is, particularly as far as the Irish language is concerned, far too much emphasis on grammar.  I have already announced that it is my hope to ensure that homework for children of ten years of age and under is cut out. We have already tackled this problem. We recognise that it is terriblv important to get to the root of things at the start of a child's career.</P>
      <P>Coming back again to <i>Investment in Education,</i> there is a very interesting chapter on the facilities and amenities in our existing national schools.  There is a tremendous chapter on the building of national schools generally and there is comment on some of the unwise policies which might, with certain changes, be to the benefit of the country as a whole.  We read of the school building programme of the future. There is an exhaustive breakdown on teacher training, what defects in the present system appear to be evident to the team and what improvements could be brought about: what numbers are required.  Then, at the end, we have the summary and conclusions.</P>
      <P>In Chapter 10, they deal fully with post-primary education.  There is a full chapter on the secondary schools, the distribution of the schools, the distribution of secondary school teachers, the qualifications of secondary school teachers, the benefits&mdash;and then they summarise.  They went on, then, and dealt with the whole facet of vocational and technical education.  They dealt with continuation education, the location of schools, the distribution of teaching resources, the quality of teaching, the pattern of curricula, unit costs, technical and apprentice education and then, again, they summarise and there are the conclusions.</P>
      <P>Then&mdash;here again referred to by Fine Gael without any tribute or mention of source of origin, so to speak&mdash; there is this tremendous chapter on the financing of Irish education in national, post-primary and third level establishments.  Chapter 12 covers the whole field of educational organisation and development with paragraphs on manpower, participation, efficiency and finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="49" /> In Chapter 13, we find the recommendations of the team for reorganisation in the Department of Education itself.  There is the question of the Development Branch which they so strongly came out in favour of and which in fact has already been set up. Chapter 14 deals with aiding educational development in the emergent countries.  Chapter 15 deals with education and economic progress. The language was not too simple but, here again, this is a most important chapter in showing to a pattern, in no uncertain manner, if it could be put into ordinary everyday parlance, what a tremendous investment for a child it was by a parent to put it on for further education after the compulsory school leaving period had been arrived at.  Then, at the end of it, they dealt with the issues and problems emerging from the information which they had gleaned.  In addition, there are two volumes of annexes and appendices, two volumes the equal of this volume, <i>Investment in Education.</i> Annexe A deals with the training of teachers of all levels&mdash;art teachers, domestic science teachers, manual instructors (woodwork and metal work), and physical education.  There is a breakdown of the tables as existing and the requirements anticipated by them.</P>
    <P>Annexe B deals with our reformatories and industrial schools.  Then, in Annexe C, we have possibly one of the most important chapters.  I think we are all very keen that achievements should be rapid and substantial so far as the special schools for the mentally and physically handicapped are concerned. A great deal has been achieved but there is still a lot to be done. Annexe D, on the secondary tops, was fascinating to me.  At present, there are about 8,000 pupils in the secondary tops, that is, national schools which go on with post-primary education to a certain degree.  The fees they charge are low.  Consideration is given to accommodation and capacity; the curriculum and the effect of secondary tops on national schools; the very high quality of pupils coming out of these schools.  It is a very interesting observation by the team.  Then, of course, they <Col N="50" /> deal with the non-aided primary schools.  They deal with statistics relative to the work of an educational development unit now set up in my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I know, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, that the points I am hammering home are not very pleasing to Deputy Dillon.  For his information, I have shown in no uncertain way that the information contained in <i>Investment in Education</i> and the appendices and annexes thereto form the basis of our future educational policy.  It was, indeed, &ldquo;cogged&rdquo; in the main by the Fine Gael Party in their pseudo Fine Gael document without paying any compliment whatever to the steering committee and survey team.  Indeed, they were critical of one particular member.</P>
      <P>I have made my points and I would commend those who are interested in education to study this tremendous document.  It is not light reading and would want to be read over and over again.  Some of the recommendations have been adopted by my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The difference between the Fine Gael Party and the Government is, as I said in my Estimate speech last week, that we are carrying out the proposals but as far as Fine Gael are concerned, it is so much pie in the sky and they have not the responsibility to implement these proposals. We have that responsibility.  We are, therefore, facing up to the fact that any proposals made by us will have to be paid for by the Irish people and the money will not be got from such doubtful sources as the buoyancy of the revenue.  Indeed, I throughly <Col N="51" /> agree with Deputy Dillon in his most constructive contribution.  I say that in a most sincere way, Sir, about Deputy Dillon's speech on this Estimate.  He gave a fair summary.  A paraphrase of what he did say is: where is all the money for these different social services to come from?</P>
      <P>Of course, this is a major problem but we will have to face up to it. When I was Minister for Health, exactly the same problem arose about the cost of increased and improved services.  The Labour Party and Fine Gael are always talking about health services on the basis of the insurance stamp.  I was against the stamp for health but I was quite willing, if we had to, to accept the principle of insurance.  It meant putting health on to the social welfare stamp.</P>
      <P>I shall relate what I am about to say, Sir, to this Estimate in a moment.  The difficulty I saw was whether it was all right for the State to contribute one-third, the employers to contribute one-third and the worker to contribute one-third.  The difficulties in health related to the self-employed, particularly to farmers, paying what could be considered very heavy contributions. After all, a farmer has a son and a daughter working for him on the farm. He is the employer and he pays that contribution.  He will also have to pay the contributions for the daughter, the son, and so on.  It is a problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have considered the problems mentioned by Deputy Dillon of the cost in the future, where the money will come from, and I have shown that there will be continuity year by year in our educational programme, as well as everything else.  It is possible that with the best will in the world, a great social development, such as that which with my humble plans, so to speak, will mean to education, could be stymied or held up in a certain year, if things were difficult or if there were urgent strains on the economy.  I have under consideration, which of course will be subject to the agreement of the Minister for Finance, a scheme whereby in Ireland some day we can have all social development tied by a stamp. It will include social welfare as at present, <Col N="52" /> possibly health and possibly education.  This would be worthy of examination in order to achieve the continuity of which I speak.</P>
    <P>Labour and Fine Gael always say health should be worked out on a comprehensive insurance basis and there is a certain merit in this by way of meeting the absolute difficulties that outweigh the benefits.  Nevertheless, we ought to get our people, and all Parties, to agree that social welfare, health and education could be considered under a type of social insurance development stamp, or a social development stamp, or some such method, in order to ensure that continuity grows, as Deputy Dillon said, year by year.</P>
    <P>This scheme, which I now put before the House for very favourable consideration, will not cost less, I must admit, in the years that lie ahead but the rate of contribution and the contribution for general education must increase if we are to have, to put it crudely, economic survival in this country in our approach to and our ultimate joining with Europe.  I should like to reiterate that, while I have attacked the Fine Gael Policy, so to speak, for taking so much of my Department's document into their policy statement, I have seen one or two points in the Fine Gael document which appeal to me and I shall certainly utilise them.</P>

I differ from the Labour Party policy in one instance.  They think that further education should depend on the ability of the child.</P>

      <P>Everyone considers, including me, that the Labour Party framed their proposals on the ability of the child.  I do not want to make too much play on that because they did at least propose an approach to free education for certain less well-off children and they recognised the problem was critical.</P>
      <P>It is an important point and, speaking in particular to one who is looked on as the upholder of all the great Parliamentary traditions of the past, Deputy Dillon, I do not think it is good enough to interrupt me and to say, &ldquo;You may bet your life you will steal a bit of our policy that appeals to you.&rdquo;  I think a Minister should if we are to have Parliament functioning as it should.  I do not mind saying that if any man, woman or child will submit a policy or some suggestion which would benefit our children I will have no hesitation in using it, from whatever source it may come.</P>
      <P>Our primary consideration is our children.  In Ireland, we may differ on certain political aspects of the method of implementing a policy.  We may differ as to how schemes are to be paid for.  Fundamentally, there is no difference between any of us with regard to the provision of improved and increased educational facilities for our children.  Every Party in the House subscribes to the view that these are fundamental.  We may differ as to method&mdash;nothing else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one matter which I did not refer to at the outset, because my address, as the public, unfortunately, do not understand, was a pure Estimate speech.  I should perhaps, as Deputy Larkin mentioned, in due course, perhaps, produce a more thorough document on the hopes and ambitions of the Department of Education and have it debated in <Col N="54" /> the Dáil.  The document which has been produced, <i>Investment in Education,</i> is a type of White Paper, so to speak.  It has certainly been a guideline and basic document for us to work on for the future.  All these things are not decided overnight.  I suppose that in 50 or 60 years' time, when there will be none of us in the House, there will be Ministers for Education and people in the Opposition debating education and suggesting improvements in the system.</P>
    <P>I should have liked to have referred to a matter which is agitating our minds in the Department, that is the schools medical service.  I was very close to that problem when I was in the Department of Health.  The schools medical service at the present time, to use a mild term, is most unsatisfactory. We are having discussions with my colleague, the Minister for Health, and his officials to see if we can have an improved and more enlightened service. We may talk about great developments and about transport but, if the children are not healthy, we are not doing our job properly.  It struck me as Minister for Health as most appalling that in the case of the poorer children, when defects were discovered in their teeth on the occasion of the dentist's visit to the national school, the rate of extractions was very high.  The waiting period is tragic.  If a child is in agony and is very poor and has to wait a considerable period before he is treated, that is very serious.  We have not yet solved that problem.  If one of our children develops a toothache tomorrow morning that is bad enough but, because treatment is paid for, he can get attention in a matter of hours. The poor child has to go through the school medical examination and has to queue up and, most tragic of all, where a tooth could be saved, as in the case of our children, it is extracted.  The system is impersonal.  This is where more co-ordination is needed between my Department and the Department of Health.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely that is fantastic nonsense?  Any poor child in this country who gets toothache can go to the hospital nearest to him and will be looked after.</P>

      <P>Deputy Lindsay spoke at length.  I think I have covered most of the points he made as far as the authorship of this document, <i>Investment in Education,</i> is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of small schools was mentioned by Deputy Lindsay.  He has his point in regard to them.  I should like to say, as far as the closing of one-teacher and two-teacher schools is concerned, that I have no doctrinaire outlook in the matter.  I have to face the advice tendered to me by everyone, by my officials and other educationists. We are all agreed about how right Deputy Dillon was in the past that, <Col N="56" /> educationally as well as economically, the advantage of the improved higher grade of education available to a child in the larger type of school is irrefutable and undeniable.  Nevertheless, it would be a bad thing to say, across the board, we are going to close all the one-teacher and two-teacher schools in Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>This would be bad. To use that medical card phraseology, each case should be dealt with on its merits.  In every case the question of the closing of a school requires the most careful examination.  The average attendance at a school may be declining substantially, owing to its geographical location.  There would be local knowledge.  There could be discussions with my officials, one of my senior inspectors, with the reverend manager and the parents, on the basis that local knowledge had come to us that while the average was low and the case looked bad for the retention of a certain small school, nevertheless there was hope that a factory was coming in or there was some development going on.  There again it is often possible to postpone a decision.  What I really want to say is that there will always be cases for the retention of small schools in certain cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy Dillon will bear with me&mdash;next September, I am bringing up all schools which, at the present time, charge fees of under £15. Strangely enough, there are schools in Ireland which charge fees of £5 and under.  There are 387 pupils in Ireland today whose fees are under £5.  There are 4,315 pupils in Ireland today whose fees are between £5 and £10.  There are 18,749 pupils in Ireland today who are paying fees between £10 and £15.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall come to that. The Deputy is perfectly right&mdash;at a tremendous sacrifice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly, but not by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>No, by certain members of religious Orders who plough back their salaries, for example.  Therefore we have a total of nearly 23,000 pupils paying under £15.  I have seen comments in the newspapers and I have been asked about this £15.  What I am doing is bringing up all the fees of those 23,000 pupils under £15 to £15 and saying: &ldquo;You were giving just the basic elements of education; if you cater for the following minima, we will bring you up to £15.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>On the question of the £25, there are 19,500 or 20,000 pupils in Ireland paying between £15 and £20 and another 10,000 paying between £20 and £25. Between £25 and £30, there are another 5,000.  Before I announced this scheme, we wrote to every secondary school and asked them kindly to fill up a questionnaire, as they did, to set out what fees they were charging in the current year.  If a school wrote back and said they were charging a fee of £20, next September we will give them the £20.  If they were charging £16, we will give them the £16.  I know that people ask: &ldquo;Why do you not give £30 or £25 across the board?&rdquo; I agree, but this at least is a start, and it is costing over £1,600,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="59" /> A friend of mine said to me the other day: &ldquo;I am paying £60 for my child; will I be in?&rdquo;  This is the wrong approach.  We say to the man who is paying £60 that it is not a question of his being in or out.  Free education will be available, and if the man who is paying £60 at the present time finds it a hardship on him, then we will have a school where he will not be charged any fees.  I know perfectly well that in my own city of Limerick&mdash;I do not have to go beyond that&mdash;there will be certain schools within these fee limits which next September will be full to the door.  What the people do not realise is this: I am not giving at this stage a choice of school.  I am not saying to the Reverend President or Rector or head of the school: &ldquo;You will take in A, B, C, or D&rdquo;.  Remember the State does not own the secondary schools in Ireland.  For historical reasons, they are private property, so to speak.  The State pays capitation grants for the several pupils in the junior and senior schools; we pay, after the basic salaries are paid, the entire teachers' salaries in the secondary schools, religious and lay, but we do not own them.  Fine Gael according to their document, particularly as far as diocesan colleges are concerned, assume that the State owns these schools.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>We commented on the fact that because of them, education was provided cheaply for a lot of people.  Under this system, can a person opt for the school he wants to attend?  Can he opt for a particular school or must he go to one&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a very reasonable question.  There will not be a choice of school next September, but there will be free education available.  A parent may not be able to get the child into a particular school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to that. That is one of the first questions I asked my officials.  It is one of the first questions I was asked by my colleagues in the Government.  I was also asked where I would get the teachers.  May I say that the whole of Ireland is not going back to school next September? Unfortunately, and I say this after due consideration, I doubt if the demand next September will be so great that it will overwhelmingly tax our existing resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In our secondary schools?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I am not unduly worried either about the availability of teachers or the accommodation problem. Naturally there will be growing pains.  A mother will want to send her child to a particular school, but there will be no place available for him in the school because it will be full to the doors.  Without any scheme, this is actually happening at the moment.  The point is we will create a situation in which every child will be offered free secondary education.  It may be argued that this will create a difficult problem but one must remember that it is now possible to go through vocational school without taking any technical subjects whatsoever.  One can now do purely academic subjects in a vocational school.  I do not say there will be many instances of that, but it is possible that it will be the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>New buildings will have to be provided. In my opening speech I told the House that we created 23,000 odd new places in primary schools alone.  That will have a bearing on the problem.  I admit it is a problem, but it is not an insurmountable one.  It is not incapable of being solved.  I do not expect any child who wants to continue his education next September, without cost to his parents, to be denied that opportunity.  I admit entrance to a secondary school of choice will not be possible next September, but in the years that lie ahead, the position will improve.  The graph will be rising all the time from next September onwards and I hope it will rise very steeply as the years go by, with particular emphasis <Col N="61" /> on vocational education and comprehensive schools.</P>
    <P>Before I leave the subject of accommodation, I believe we have not given sufficient consideration to the full utilisation of our existing national schools with a view to their participation in post-primary education.  There are approximately 8,000 pupils in what are called the secondary tops at the moment.  There is a high percentage of national teachers fully qualified to teach post-primary pupils.  One of the tasks to which my officials are bending their energies at the moment is the utilisation of the existing primary schools. For instance, instead of having children leaving the primary school at 12 years of age, it should be possible to bring in a vocational teacher once or twice a week; that solution is worthy of consideration and will, I think, play a big part in our future educational development.</P>
    <P>I might mention, in passing, that a case was brought to my notice this morning.  It is not a typical example, perhaps, but there are no less than five classrooms idle in a national school at the moment.</P>

It was suggested by some speakers that Government policy in regard to comprehensive schools was not as enthusiastic possibly as it should be or as it was in the first flush of appreciation of the potentialities of that particular concept.  That is not so.  We have already finished Shannon, Cootehill, Carraroe, and the plans for Glenties are being prepared.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann is of opinion that the Electricity Supply Board should not increase its charges to domestic consumers by seven per cent in view of the undue hardship which this price increase would create together with the inflationary situation which such an increase would initiate; and also considers that the ESB special charges should be abolished.</P>

      <P>When speaking on this motion last week, I was referring to the speech of Deputy Seán Dunne, which appeared to me to have strayed very far from the details of the actual motion before the House.  This whole motion appears to me to be rather typical of present Labour Party thinking, <Col N="63" /> if such it can be called at all.  The best they can put before the House is a suggestion that whatever extra charges have to be paid they have always got to be paid by somebody else&mdash;this mythical person who just does not exist.  We have got to face the hard fact of life, that is, we must pay for what we get.  There is no doubt that over the years the Electricity Supply Board has supplied electricity to a rapidly increasing number of homes at what, by European standards, is a very low rate of charge.  Granted, there have been increases, but we have got to remember that the cost of generating electricity has been steadily increasing throughout the years and, with the increasing number of users of electricity, the capital expenditure by the Board has had to be almost astronomical in order to keep pace with increasing demand.  Admittedly, some of the capital costs have been covered by borrowing rather than by revenue but nobody can borrow without servicing that loan; that loan must not only be serviced by way of payment and interest but there must also be a sinking fund for the eventual repayment of the loan.</P>
      <P>I know homes where electricity is a very valuable commodity indeed, where the income is very low and where every conceivable economy has to be used to keep the bill within the scope of the income.  This is the case with, for instance, single old age pensioners living in a room or a flat.  I have come across cases where the electric light is scarcely used at all and where an old person may use it just for a period of having tea and then sit in the dark for the rest of the evening. But these cases are very rare and, in the greater number of homes&mdash;even in those homes which we describe as being in the lower income group&mdash;I have never seen any evidence of any effort to economise on the use of electricity. It is far more common to see electric lights burning in the house quite unnecessarily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not believe that the ESB bill is anything like the ghastly burden which some of the speakers have made <Col N="64" /> it out to be.  I think we can get confused, too, by the reference to a seven per cent increase.  Let us get that down to hard facts and figures&mdash;that is 7/- in each 100/-, 7/- in each unit of £5.</P>
    <P>Now, I wonder how many homes have a monthly bill of £5?  If they have a two-monthly bill of £10, that probably is unusually high.  More often, of course, they may be working on a weekly basis, but seven per cent means only an increase of 7/- in each £5 or 14/- in each unit of £10.  Put that way, I think to say that this, in itself, would create undue hardship on the average home is a gross exaggeration; similarly, to say it would create an inflationary situation is also exaggeration.  These are not arguments.  They are not reasoned statements of fact.  They are mere explosions of emotion with no basis at all.</P>
    <P>Reference is made also to the ESB special charges; they should be abolished and everybody should be connected without any additional charge.  Here again is the mythical somebody else who will pay the cost of running electricity mains across the country, for the whole question of negotiation, the right to erect poles across somebody else's land and for the maintenance&mdash;sometimes in very exposed positions&mdash;of the ESB lines. It is, unfortunately, necessary that these things have got to be paid for by somebody but I cannot believe the Labour Party really mean that the ESB special charges should be abolished and that the ordinary rate to domestic consumers should be increased by something more than seven per cent in order to keep ESB operations on a normal economic basis.  I know it does sound, possibly, popular for people to keep on saying prices should be kept down; nobody should be charged for this, that or the other.  My experience is that the Irish people are not as easily fooled as the Labour Party would like to believe.  Our people are becoming increasingly realistic&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>They only want to know <Col N="65" /> the facts and, when the facts are put clearly before them, they are prepared to accept them and to carry on.  The ESB is engaged in a very difficult operation, not only with the maintenance of its existing supply but also in the constant planning for new generating capacity.  The fact that it has to spend so much money on new generators is something in which we, on this side of the House, take considerable pride because it is made necessary only by the fact that the standard of living of our people is, mercifully, still rising and that people are now in the position that they regard electricity as an absolute necessity, not only for ordinary domestic use, but for agricultural and industrial use as well.  We have come so much to take it for granted that we find it difficult to cast our minds back to the days when the average home had no electrical equipment, except, perhaps, at most a few electric light bulbs.</P>
      <P>The average wage earner's house now contains a very considerable amount of very useful electrical equipment and for that I, for one, am absolutely delighted, because this equipment makes life much more worthy of living for the average housewife. No one can say it is an absolute necessity.  We have come to regard it as a necessity by reason of the general trend of events.  Even if it is an absolute necessity, I cannot visualise for myself any home where seven shillings in each unit of £5 charged will be an intolerable additional burden.  If it is a burden, it can be avoided altogether by&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>These remarks demonstrate absolutely clearly that the one thing which the Labour Party do not want debated is this motion.  I am not surprised that every conceivable irrelevancy is being brought in, in a desperate endeavour to cover up the fact that they have not a leg to stand on.  No case whatever has been made for this motion.  I am all in favour of everyone getting the maximum facilities from the Electricity Supply Board, but not for nothing.  If there are these hard cases to which I have referred, the only way we can relieve those cases is through social welfare payments: by paying them enough by way of old age pensions, and so on, to enable them to cover their bills.  We cannot start framing a new system of ESB charges on the basis of isolated cases.  I have not heard so far any evidence of any <Col N="68" /> particular cases of hardship where this seven per cent will produce an intolerable burden.  I have not heard any suggestion as to how the income from the special charges is to be met if these charges are abolished in their present form.  This is just a propaganda move designed to fool people who, I am glad to say, have grown up far too much to be fooled by it.  If even yet there is a member of the Labour Party &mdash;one of the signatories to the motion or anyone else&mdash;who can give some hard facts, I will be delighted to hear them.  I defy them to do it, but at least if they try, I will consider them.</P>

      <P>Is there not a striking incongruity in the situation that a State-sponsored body are invited to increase their charges by seven per cent, at a time when the Government are warning every wage earner in the country to restrict his demands for increased wages for the national good, are warning every shopkeeper&mdash;I am sorry Deputy Booth is leaving the House; I want to say a few words about him&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>At a time when the Government are warning every shopkeeper, whatever burden he has to bear, that his prices must not rise, and warning every manufacturer that the greatest contribution he can make to the national welfare is to reduce his costs of production, the householder, the small shopkeeper and the manufacturer are all invited to accept cheerfully from a Government-sponsored body an increase of seven per cent in the charges to be levied for electric power.  Deputy Booth's striking contribution to the debate is that if there is any householder who is suffering hardship from this impost, he can relieve himself of that hardship by turning out the lights.  We all know that, but do we think it reasonable at this time that we should call on everybody in the country who finds the seven per cent increase too substantial a burden to counteract it by turning out his lights?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="69" /> Deputy Booth spoke of our rising standard of living.  A rising standard of living is a good thing but surely it is not indicative of a rising standard of living to say to those people to whom this new differential will make a material difference that the remedy is to turn out the lights?  That seems to indicate a falling standard of living. Inflation presents itself too often in this House as an abstraction, an economic abstraction which is very hard to relate to the daily lives of our people. I have never heard it more eloquently described than it was by Deputy Booth: if you cannot pay for the light, turn it out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>And those who can pay can keep it on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should explain to Deputy Booth how he reconciles his advice to the ESB to increase their charges by seven per cent with his advice to everybody else to maintain stability in prices.  There is only one lesson I have learned in my business life and it is that the larger the volume of turnover, the lower your margin of profit needs to be.  Does anybody know of any commercial enterprise in the world which had to record in their annual report that their turnover had reached record proportions but that the result was they had to raise their price?  I suggest that any commercial enterprise which made that announcement would at once be reported to the Department of Industry and Commerce and a public inquiry would be held as to how this could conceivably come to pass.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are thousands of small shopkeepers throughout the country to whom Deputy Booth's proposed economy is not available because, though theoretically we could still do our business in rural Ireland and elsewhere by candlelight, the competition of the supermarkets would soon elimipate them.  I do not suppose that any of the great British combines who are buying up businesses in this country to destroy the small shopkeepers would be in the least disturbed if the local shopkeeper were constrained to accept Deputy Booth's advice and turn out <Col N="70" /> the lights or turn out half the lights. The supermarket would put on twice as many lights, on the ground that the process of eliminating competition in its area could be expedited if the lights went out in the small shopkeepers' premises and the lights were multiplied in the supermarket.</P>
    <P>The supermarkets are not a bit worried about five years or ten years but the small individual enterprises in the country, struggling against competition of that kind, are offered no better consolation by Deputy Booth than the advice that if they find this additional burden unbearable, they should turn out their lights.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;Economise&rdquo; was the word I used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite.  Deputy Booth is a most rational and prudent man. His advice to small shopkeepers was: &ldquo;If you have 12 lights, turn out six.&rdquo; But the supermarket has 36 lights and this merely expedites the elimination of the small shopkeeper.  Seeing that this happens to be part of the policy of Fianna Fáil at the present time, I do not suppose it will unduly disturb them, but there are thousands of families being reared in Ireland in relatively small shops the proprietors of which, though unknown to Deputy Booth, are quite respectable people.  Their only aim has been to raise a decent family by their own labour, to educate their children and to live on a very modest standard of living.  They are finding this progressively more and more difficult.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Booth that seven per cent extra on the electricity bill will not radically alter the economics of large international groups who set up supermarkets in this country. They will take it in their stride just as they took the turnover tax.  We are to understand that 2½ per cent of this increase is related to the turnover tax.  That does not bother the supermarkets. In fact it is an additional instrument in their hands for the destruction of the relatively small business units who have not got the margin or the reserves or the development finance, which is the polite phrase, with <Col N="71" /> which to carry losses while the competition is being destroyed.</P>
    <P>We have become so high-falutin under Fianna Fáil direction that we are beginning to forget where we all came from.  Most of us in this House have come from the country towns and provincial cities.  A great many of us have come from the suburbs of Dublin, but whether we have come from the suburbs or the provincial cities or country towns, who among us has not seen the gradual preliminary crucifixion and ultimate elimination of the small businessman?</P>
    <P>Do we approve of it?  Do we desire it?  Do we welcome it?  I consider it to be a disaster.  As you raise the costs of the small businessman and make him more vulnerable to competition&mdash; he is already fighting for his existence&mdash; you are expediting the process of his elimination and advancing a process which is resulting more and more in the gradual acquisition by foreign interests of the entire distribution system of the country, making no new contribution to the real welfare of our people and creating an enduring drain on our balance of payments.  It is important that Deputies should see the direction and the significance of this slow process of erosion.  I deplore it, and I warn the Minister and the Government to which he belongs that they are travelling along a path which will disrupt the society to which we all belong.  I am afraid some of them want to do that, but some of them do not.  I do not think Deputy Booth understands the problem.</P>

Deputy Booth knows something about the automobile trade.  Would Deputy Booth call it reasonable if the Ford Motor Company set a price for a car on the basis of producing 1,000 units and then asked for a seven per cent increase when they were producing 1,000,000 units?  Would he not say to the Ford Motor Company: &ldquo;Come, this is absurd.  It was one thing to ask for seven per cent on the price for this motor vehicle when you were producing 1,000 units.  Now you have reached 1,000,000 units and you want to charge the same.&rdquo;  When they got to 9,000,000 units would the Deputy still think it reasonable for the Ford Motor Company to say: &ldquo;We want a seven per cent increase in prices.&rdquo;  Would he not ask: &ldquo;What was all the capital investment for?&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I have.  One must not blame them for being a little ashamed and I do not blame them for being ashamed.  I do not blame them for telling one story out of the right hand corner of their mouths and another story out of the left.  I have watched them for 30 years and they have not got facial paralysis yet.  I should like to ask the Minister for Transport and Power and Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, as he now is, to explain in very <Col N="73" /> simple language to the people of this country why it is not only permissible, but essential, for a Government-sponsored body to increase their charges at this time by seven per cent when every other body which has to bear exactly the same charges, exactly the same increases in the cost of labour, exactly the same increases in raw materials and exactly the same increases in every charge which the ESB have to meet, is expected, as a national duty, not only to refrain from increasing its prices, but, if possible, to reduce them?</P>
      <P>The whole theme of Fianna Fáil propaganda at present is that every exporter and every manufacturer in this country has a national duty to reduce his costs and bring down his charges.  We are warned, if we are to meet the competition of the Common Market, into which we hope to sail some day, when de Gaulle permits Britain to carry us in on their coat tails, we must bring down our production costs?  Does the Minister for Transport and Power seriously maintain that the proposal to increase the cost of power by seven per cent, to increase the cost of light by seven per cent or to increase the cost of heating by five per cent will contribute to the task of cutting down the cost of production for industry in this country?</P>
      <P>I attended session after session after session at Strasbourg with my colleague, Deputy Michael Carty.  He will tell you that the Council of Europe and its economic committee were continually talking about the insidious and disastrous consequence of taxing sources of power and pointing out that such taxation on the cost of power filtered through the whole economy and bore most heavily on the consumer and reduced the competitive capacity of the manufacturer in any country where such increases were allowed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How does the Minister for Transport and Power reconcile the propaganda of his colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, with the course he recommends to the Electricity Supply Board?  How does the Minister for Transport and Power say <Col N="74" /> to every shopkeeper in Ireland who he knows, as he must know, is struggling for his life against the growing impact of the foreign-owned supermarket, which is deliberately seeking to wipe him out as a preliminary to establishing monopoly in his particular area, that he is to reduce his illuminations while the foreign combines increase theirs?  The small man, as described by Deputy Booth, is called on to economise, not as Deputy Booth says to go over to the candle, but to economise by reducing his light. How does the Minister for Transport and Power say to the ordinary householder in this country: &ldquo;I am asking you not to make fresh demands for adjustment in wages and salaries which you may need.  I expect you to exercise the moderation and restraint required by the economic situation in which we find ourselves at the present time.  I must do my part and see you are not asked to carry any additional burden &rdquo;?  At the same time, he announces that the ESB are to increase their charges by seven per cent.</P>
    <P>This is something which Deputies, with such a simple mind as Deputy Booth, fail to comprehend.  The ordinary consumer of electric light and power in this country is not finished with the seven per cent when he switches on the light or switches off the light in the kitchen.  The affluent person to whom Deputy Booth refers when he speaks of the person who has embarked on the extravagance of a washing machine instead of sending her clothes to the laundry, as Deputy Booth does, is not finished when she lifts her clothes out of one tub and puts them into the spindrying machine. If she were a shrewd person, she would put them through a hand-operated mangle and save the money spent on the spindryer.  She would save the seven per cent extravagance on the purchase of the spindryer on her bill if she used a hand-operated mangle.</P>
    <P>But the detergent she puts into her washing machine is going to carry its share of the seven per cent.  Everything she buys is going to carry not only the turnover tax appropriate to it but the seven per cent on the power used to make it.  Does anyone here seriously <Col N="75" /> believe that a manufacturer who is going to pay a substantial sum, represented by seven per cent of his entire costs for heating, lighting and power, is not going to pass it on?  He is going to ask the question I am asking: why should I be asked to absorb it when the Government-sponsored body itself says that it will not absorb it?  If the ESB passes it on to me, I will pass it on to the wholesaler and the wholesaler will pass it on to the retailer and ultimately the retailer will pass it on to the consumer. Of course, at every stage, trade being what trade is, there must be a suitable mark-up.  It does not matter if I as a merchant buy a parcel of goods; I do not count the cost of the raw material that went into the goods, what the wood cost, what the rubber cost, or what the brass or steel cost, or what the power to make it cost.  I take the global price and mark it up at wholesale level and pass it on to the retailer and eventually the consumer will pay for it.  I do not suggest that for what the consumer paid £1 heretofore he is now going to pay 22/6.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>After Deputy Dillon's fluorescent contribution, we have to get down to facts regarding this matter.  Deputy Dillon and others talked about inflation.  The Government have never said that firms should reduce profits and fail to put aside sufficient sums for depreciation and maintenance of plant, if they were facing higher costs.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce never proclaimed that.  They never proclaimed that any industry for a period of years should make losses.  That would not have been to the advantage of the workers or of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies know perfectly well the history of inflation in this country. They know from 1958 to 1961 the record of increases, increases of earnings and of wages, incomes and of profits, and that from then onwards, despite all the advice given to the people, and through their own capacity and democratic rights for collective bargaining, incomes increased faster than productivity.  This has been made clear frequently by Minister on every possible occasion, beginning with the Minister for Finance in 1962.  They have been asking for restraint in this matter but where a free democracy operates, this could only be done voluntarily.  The Government were faced equally with increased costs of Government as a result of the inflation that took place.  We are not the only country in the world facing inflation. Other very respectable communities have broken loose from the observance of the rules, such as the Netherlands, which is facing a crisis which is more serious than others.  I will not even talk about the position in Britain where Conservative and Labour Ministers have lectured on the same basis, accompanied by most of their independent economists, about what would happen if incomes continued at too rapid a growth over production.  We have reached the point where we have to make the same recommendation, that industry cannot be without the right amount of resources for paying <Col N="77" /> dividends and repaying principal and interest on loans.  We never said it should be.</P>
    <P>In the case of the ESB, this is a cumulative result of a long period of increasing costs, when in fact, as the House knows, charges have not been increased since 1960.  During the whole of that time, at least from 1962 onwards, costs have been increasing.  It is not only costs within the country.  The goods that the ESB purchase have gone up in price in very considerable measure and we are not responsible for the cost of imported goods.  Therefore, the inflation has not only come from within but has come from without. Everybody knows that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not want to speak on this matter because it is before the Prices Advisory Body and I felt it was <i>sub judice</i>.  I know that according to the rules of this House, the Prices Advisory Body, when examining a situation like this, is not regarded as a judicial body and therefore motions like this can be discussed. Since everybody on the other side has been charging the ESB with making a wrong decision, I would have at least to give some reasons why the ESB has been committed to increased charges and to give the background to the situation.  I suppose if my remarks and those of other Deputies are balanced together, the Prices Advisory Body will still be able to make a reasonable judgment when it comes to examine the whole question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of things which contribute to the increases in the ESB charges.  One of them is represented by the increase in the cost of turf supplied to the ESB.  That again is due to increases in costs, the same as in the ESB.  As Deputies remarked, the turnover tax which was paid for by the ESB for a very long period&mdash;and the ESB was almost unique among large institutions in not passing on the turnover tax&mdash;has also, because of increased costs, to be paid for now by the consumer.  I should make it clear that the ESB is a non-profit making <Col N="78" /> body and it is expected to pay, taking one year with another, or one could put it in a slightly looser way and say that the ESB can judge the situation over a number of years and restrain any increase in charges until they become absolutely imperative.  I have no power, actually, under the laws of this House, to prevent the ESB from increasing their charges.  In fact, however, as I meet the Board regularly to discuss every pertinent question in connection with the national economy as a whole, the Second Programme for Economic Expansion, and matters such as rural electrification, naturally they do come to me when they consider it necessary to increase charges and now, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, by direction of the Government, has power to have an inquiry made into their increases.  I want to make clear the statutory position which has been approved by the House.  But we have other methods of control.</P>
    <P>To come to the reasons for the need to increase charges, as stated by the ESB, the ESB estimated that the deficit, as at 31st March, 1967, would have been £1.5 million, assuming a generating increase of nine per cent. The deficits which the Board expects to incur for the following years were, in 1967-68, £1.9 million; 1968-69, £1.75 million, and in 1969-70, £1.75 million. One of the main causes of the deficit in 1966-67 was the anticipated steep rise in fuel costs.  The reason for the abnormally high increase in the current year arises from the fact that fuel costs in the previous year were abnormally low. Heavy rainfall in that year resulted in greatly increased output from hydro-electric stations in conjunction with increased production from oil stations, because Bord na Móna had a very bad year and the Board were able to reduce fuel costs and, as a result, they finished the year with a small surplus of £240,000.  I am talking about 1965-66. If it had been a normal year, with the usual amount of rainfall, the loss would have been £800,000.</P>
    <P>It is not the intention of the Government, and I do not believe it would be the intention of any Party in office, to allow the ESB to engage in losses of <Col N="79" /> those dimensions in future years, losses of around £1.75 million for each of the next three years.  The ESB is bound by this House to pay its way. Nothing could be more serious than for an institution like that to make losses. Indeed, it would shake the confidence that investors have in the ESB.  It is a very fine thing that the ESB can secure capital from the market itself, independent of the Government, for part of its requirements for generation and transmission. I certainly intend that they will continue to operate as an efficient company, not making profits, and ploughing back whatever small surpluses they have into development and for that reason they must take action, just the same as any other companies, as a result of the inflation which has come partly as a result of choices made by the people and partly as a result of conditions abroad.  A massive inflation is taking place in countries from which equipment comes to the ESB.</P>
    <P>I have given two causes for the increase in the cost of electricity.  Then, of course, there is the inevitable result of the ninth and tenth rounds of wage increases and of the £1 per week increase recently.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not told us what fuel costs increased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>They added £720,000, £361,000 and £416,000 respectively to the total labour bill.  The average revenue from sales of electricity is approximately £22 million and the increase required to offset those wage increases would be, for the three different rounds, 3.2 per cent, 1.6 per cent and 1.85 per cent.  The ESB does everything possible to maintain its efficiency.  It has engaged in work study and other studies to ensure that work is done as efficiently as possible, but naturally, in common with other manufacturers and other firms, when wages go up, if the costs cannot be met by a sufficient increase in productivity to offset them, there must inevitably be some increase in prices.  Deputies know that is just a commonplace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="80" /> One of the interesting things about the whole position of the ESB is that the cost of living since 1947 has gone up 85 per cent but the increase in overall charges by the ESB, which took place in only three years, 1951, 1956 and 1960, were 14 per cent, nine per cent and five per cent.  The overall increase in charges is far less than the increase in the cost of living, partly for the reason stated by Deputy Dillon, that consumption has increased enormously and that has enabled the ESB to forgo making increases of the kind that could be seen and have taken place in other industries and services.</P>
    <P>There is another element also involved. People are using so much more current, so much more power now than formerly, that if you allow for the actual usage of current by domestic consumers and the fact that you pay less as you use more current, once you have paid for the first group of units, the average price per unit increased from 1.83 pence in 1949-50 to 1.96 pence in 1965-66, an increase of only nine per cent, whereas, as I have indicated, the cost of living went up by 85 per cent.  So that although the total bill to the ESB consumers has gone up in that period by a certain amount, the actual cost per unit, if they are using more electricity, has hardly increased at all.</P>
    <P>One can give another example of that.  The highest average cost of electricity per unit occurred in 1958 when it was 2.17d.  This was only 15.6 per cent above the average cost of electricity per unit in 1950 whereas the cost of living had increased by 46 per cent.  Those figures are not just statistics that can be cut up and distorted; they are basic figures.  They show that the ESB costs have been kept down while there has been a massive increase in the general cost of living not only here but in other countries and that the ESB cost to the consumer has not risen in the same measure.</P>
    <P>So far as the effect on industry is concerned of the increase, to industry as a whole, under these electricity charges that are being levied, I can give the figures.  I do not think Deputy</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="81" /> Dillon need worry unduly, although I agree that there is a multiplier effect in connection with all costs.  According to the Census of Production, the gross output for all industries in 1963 was £679 million.  The cost of electricity used by industry in that year was £5 million and it represented .7 per cent of gross output.  On that basis the proposed increase will represent an addition of an average of about .05 per cent to total costs.  I wish all other costs affecting industry were as small as that.  That is not a serious increase in costs.</P>
    <P>There are some industries where very large amounts of electricity are used and where there is slightly greater effect.  These include, for example, cement.  About five per cent of cement costs are electricity costs.  An increase of seven per cent by the ESB then represents an increase in overall costs of about .35 per cent.  Again it is not an excessive increase, although it is one we would like to avoid.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies suggested that the ESB has some kind of hidden reserve. The only real reserve the ESB has is the balance in the profit and loss account at 31st March this year which stood at £243,000.  The Board has certain other reserves earmarked for specific purposes.  They include a contingency reserve of £1,500,000; plant self-insurance, £500,000, and other reserves of £75,000.  It is essential for the ESB to have a very small sum of money, in comparison with their total turnover, so that if there was some special condition operating which would very materially raise their costs or reduce their revenue in any year they would be able to balance their accounts.  It would be wrong to deprive them of that contingency reserve, most of which is fully committed in one way or another to be invested in new and replacement capital.</P>
    <P>Compared with the cost of other fuels, the prices for electricity are not unsatisfactory.  The price of electricity per unit in 1966 was 30 per cent above the 1939 price, while the price of gas has increased by 16 per cent since 1960 and by 184 per cent since 1939.  That <Col N="82" /> does not mean that the gas producers are profiteering.  It means that they operate in different conditions; their expansion has not been nearly as great. I am merely giving the figure in order to show that the cost of electricity has risen very slowly compared with the cost of other services and products.</P>
    <P>We made investigations into comparative costs of electricity in various countries.  It was very difficult to get an exact comparison because we had to work out the cost of electricity in a given situation, for a given kind of house, in relation to a specific turnover. The OECD worked out some figures for this country and they showed that the cost of electricity is not high in comparison with other countries.  It stands well in comparison with that of other countries and certainly is not high in comparison with British costs. I may add in regard to some of the ESB operations that experts come over from other countries to see how they do their installation work because some of it is done with marked efficiency.</P>
    <P>It is true that we could operate the ESB by allowing it to increase charges in very small jumps of one, two or three per cent over short periods.  However, anybody with any common sense will know that for an organisation like the ESB that would be impracticable. It should be noted that increases have taken place on only three previous occasions since 1947 and in each case the ESB made a fairly good prediction of how long that increase would last. Of course, in this case there has been very marked inflation in the past two years and as a result this increase is necessary.  This will cover the ESB over a number of years provided inflation is reasonably controlled, not only in Europe but in this country. It is essential to make some kind of increase that will operate over a period.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lindsay asked whether charges could be reduced by savings which the Board could make by eliminating advertising.  Deputy Lindsay said the Board was a monopoly and did not need to advertise.  That is an outdated concept, as most Deputies know.  Everything is advertised these days, even milk and butter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers </NameTxt>
      <P>The ESB is bound by section 19 of the Electricity Supply Act to encourage the purchase and the use of electricity.  The Board has permission under the statute to do that.  Its total sales are increasing by an average of nine per cent.  Its advertising is slanted towards selling electricity in valley periods, and I do not think it would be wise for it to discontinue advertising, which is the lifeblood of a service of that kind, for all sales which could markedly increase consumption to the advantage of the ESB.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mullen asked why the Minister did not give notice of the proposed increase.  The answer to that is that the annual report of the ESB, which was laid on the Table of the House on 27th July, 1966, stated that an application for an increase of seven per cent had been submitted in accordance with the Prices Acts, 1958, 1965, and the matter was extensively covered by the press.  Therefore, there was a warning of this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lindsay also suggested that telephones are supplied in this country without any special service charge and therefore the ESB should not have special service charges.  The rental rates for telephones correspond with the service charges of the ESB.  In the telephone service the rental rate is supposed to pay the cost of providing the poles, wires, circuits, junctions and the automatic exchanges, and of maintaining them.  The cost of the call is supposed <Col N="84" /> to correspond with the cost of supplying a call.  That corresponds to some extent with the position in the ESB.  The telephone service has a rental charge which is somewhat equivalent to the ESB service charge.</P>
    <P>Part of this motion deals with the abolition of the special service charge. I have dealt with this at very considerable length on previous occasions.  I made it clear, first of all, that there was not a respectable electricity authority of which I know that does not have these two types of charges, one in connection with the consumption of electricity and the other in connection with the provision of the sum necessary to discharge the servicing of the capital invested in a particular ESB connection, the annual depreciation required to replace the equipment in due course, the maintenance and service charges involved, and a contribution to the overheads of the company such as head office accountancy, and so on.</P>
    <P>That is virtually the universal method of charging for electricity, and it would be greatly to the disadvantage of the community if the ESB attempted to make one overall charge and not to have service charges.  I think everybody knows that the normal fixed charge is related to the size of the premises.  The smaller the size the lower the fixed charge.  When the premises are remote from the main centre of distribution the cost of connection has to be increased. The position at the moment is not unsatisfactory.  Of the 377,000 houses which are to be supplied under the rural electrification scheme, 54,500 were still to be supplied on 31st March, 1966.  Of these about 27,000 can be supplied without any special service charge or with a charge, in the case of a small house, of a very few pence per day; 11,000 can be supplied at a special service charge of not more than 50 per cent of the normal fixed charge and the remainder require extra service charges of between 50 per cent and 200 per cent of normal service charges. Therefore, it is a fact that the great majority of houses can be connected to the system without having to pay excessive special service charges.  The Government have done the best they <Col N="85" /> can by increasing the rate of subsidy from 50 per cent to 75 per cent in the 1962 Electricity (Amendment) Act, subject to a maximum of £75 per house. They also provided this subsidy for the backbone lines to enable the ESB to provide electricity service in the more remote rural areas.</P>
    <P>The losses on rural electrification in the passing year were £1.3 million. That has to be met by the urban domestic consumers.  In our circumstances it is a reasonable contribution. I should not like to see the urban consumer faced with a very much larger burden of what could be called cross-subsidisation. Of the 320,000 houses that have been connected 22,000 pay special service charges.  If these were abolished, as is suggested, the extra cost would be immediately £350,000, bringing the cost of the rural electrification system to well over £2 million a year.</P>
    <P>There must be some limit to what the taxpayer can be expected to pay in rural electrification subsidy.  We have done the utmost we can under the circumstances. No doubt, when the present rural electrification campaign is completed some time between 1970 and 1972, the matter can then be reviewed again to see whether any steps can be taken.  But for a country with our income per head to have 83 per cent of the rural dwellings joined to the system can be regarded as a fairly good achievement.  As I said, there are about 12,000 houses very remote from the system.  The capital cost of connecting them would be £5 million, and out of all proportion to the cost of dealing with that group of houses where supply can be given at a reasonable amount, either at normal service charge or with a small increase which can be afforded by most people.</P>
    <P>Lastly, I want to point out to the House that nobody has suggested who should pay if the charges are not increased or if the increase is found to be unreasonable by the Prices Advisory Body.  Who should pay? Should it be done by taxation?  Would the House like to vote extra taxes to subsidise the ESB?  Do they believe that the ESB, of all State companies, <Col N="86" /> is one that would benefit by being subsidised by the taxpayer.  Since most taxpayers are consumers also, is the whole thing not rather ridiculous?  It would seem to me that to substitute for an increase in charges an increase in taxation would be most undesirable. Would anybody who knows the past history of the ESB, which is an efficient and splendid organisation, like to see it saddled with this subsidisation, if it can be avoided?  We subsidise the ESB by providing the interest and principal for rural electrification.  It is far better for it to work as a commercial organisation in the interests of the public.  I have explained to the Dáil in considerable detail the reasons for the increase.</P>

      <P>I should like to bring down the matter of ESB charges to the proper level.  We have been talking here as if the ESB was losing money hand over fist.  We had the Minister telling us how much the ESB was likely to lose next year, the year after and the year after.  But, having seen what was suggested in the Second Programme and what actually happened, we are not inclined to give much credence to his figures.  The Board's income at 31st March, 1966, was £24,160,830.  The Minister told us it was about £22 million.  It was something over £22 million in the preceding year.  In 1964-65, the ESB deficit was £90,537.  The surplus for the year ended 31st March last was £243,153. Therefore, we are talking about an organisation that made £250,000 profit up to 31st March last.  These are the people looking for a seven per cent increase in their charges.</P>
      <P>When the Prices Bill was going through this House, the then Minister for Industry and Commerce promised that before a price rise was approved, he would investigate it.  In this case something different happened.  The Minister authorised an increase of seven per cent and then agreed to have it investigated.  This is a scandalous misure of ministerial power.  The ESB should have been asked to make a case.  I know the Minister would say a case was made for the increase. However, on the figures I have given, I cannot see that case.  Since it has not yet been published, it would appear as if the case is not a very good one.</P>

      <Col N="88" /> We heard a lot about the ESB needing money and about how hard the ESB found it to carry on the work it was required to do.  On page 24 of its 39th annual report, there is set out: temporary cash investment, £6,500,000 &mdash;and a short term loan of £2,858,981 was taken up.  Would the Minister be able to explain at some time in the future why an organisation that had a temporary cash investment&mdash;I assume this is the money lent to the Government&mdash;of £6,500,000 needed to get a short term loan somewhere else of almost £3 million?  Perhaps the Minister might care to answer that point at some future date.</P>
    <P>I should like to know if it is not correct to say that this seven per cent they are looking for has been brought about, among other things, because of the turnover tax.  The two and a half per cent turnover tax, of course, is wrapped neatly into this seven per cent.  The Government, I assume, imagine that by putting it into a general demand for a seven per cent increase they are avoiding the possibility of people pointing out that the two and a half per cent was the result of deliberate Government action.  The amount shown here as having been collected and paid in turnover tax does not, in my opinion, represent at all the entire amount on which turnover tax should be paid.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the price per unit sold here and pointed out what it was costing.  Deputy Dillon referred to the extraordinary fact that in this organisation the costs went up according as output increased.  The position is that in 1930 the average price per unit sold was 2.66 pence.  In 1962 it was 2.12 pence.  In 1963 it was 2.08 pence.  In 1964 it was 2.06 pence.  In 1965 it was 2.01 pence and in 1966 it was 1.96 pence.  Yet we are told that the poor ESB are not able to make ends meet and must, therefore, increase their charges by seven per cent all over.  I have not the time to deal with the question of the special service charge.  The Minister and myself have had many a battle on this matter.  I still think it is as unnecessary as when it was first introduced.  People <Col N="89" /> living, not on the mountains or on the islands, but within a few miles of towns and cities cannot get electric current because the service charge they are asked to pay is so high that they are unable to meet it.</P>
    <P>With reference to the different costings for the different types of fuel used, there is one rather unusual thing here: it is in the Economic Research Institute publication, August, 1966.  There is a reference on page 12 to the costs of the different fuels, the plant factor and the order of use.  The order of use, I assume, is that the ESB have decided that order which will give preference as far as possible to native fuel though this is not so in numbers 2 and 3, the Ringsend and Marina stations, where, in fact, the oil stations are being used. I do not know why this is so&mdash;there may be a reason for it.  However, because a preference has been given to native fuel, the cost to the Irish taxpayer is £240,000 in the year 1964-65. I agree that preference should be given to native fuel but I want to answer a point made by the Minister.  He posed the question that if the consumer does not pay for it then who pays. CIE have got a fairly substantial subsidy to meet something like that: we know who pays for it.  Similarly with Irish Shipping and with the air services&mdash;but, of course, they are used by different people.  These are the ordinary people in the country and it would not do to pay an extra subsidy to them: it would be too bad as they would not appreciate it.</P>

      <P>When Deputy Booth was defending the seven per cent increase, he made suggestions about the way in which it could be offset by domestic consumers.  He said they should economise.  This is in complete contradiction to the ESB policy.  I understand that the ESB have been doing everything possible to get the consumers to use more electricity.  If Deputy Booth is giving the Party line and expressing the views of the Minister, then I gather we shall see a cessation of the radio and television advertisements <Col N="90" /> for electricity, the closing of their showrooms and the removal of all the gadgets which the ESB urge people to buy so as to use electricity. This is something which I find it difficult to understand.</P>
      <P>I notice that when the Minister was defending the situation he made mention of the cost per unit as compared with an increase in the cost of living. As I see it, he failed to relate the cost of the unit to the increase in consumption by domestic consumers.  Admittedly, he talked about consumption by people who operate industry but I am sure it is fair to say that domestic consumption has increased down the years.  Naturally it goes on to increase particularly as we extend electricity to various parts of the country and also having regard to the opportunity afforded to people who have electricity in their homes to use the various gadgets which the ESB advertise.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the fact that the annual report of the ESB was placed before this House quite some time ago which gave one the opportunity to make comments and suggestions.  Something could have been done in that connection, possibly, but my complaint, having regard to the ESB report, is why the Minister should neglect to seek an increase then rather than impose it first and seek permission for it afterwards. Surely the Minister had ample opportunity to set about getting permission for that increase?  We have said from these benches that the Minister has a penchant for telling people, particularly working class people, how to behave in regard to wage movements and other matters.  Surely, when the Minister had the opportunity of displaying order, he should have set about displaying order?  He should have made application to the Prices Commission for permission to increase prices.  The increased price has now been applied and it is a certainty that it will remain which turns the investigation into a farce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are lots of points that can be raised in connection with this whole matter but what is being said in defence of it is very difficult to follow, <Col N="91" /> particularly when we bear in mind the one-sided view expressed by Deputy Booth.  I submit that there are many ways in which the ESB could make savings rather than imposing an increase of seven per cent in their charges.  They may have to impose an increase to meet the cost of getting out flashy documents such as this report on the operations of the ESB over the past year.  I think that that type of usage of public money is absolutely unnecessary having regard to what we are now told about the stage at which we are operating.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">

      <P>The opportunity is not there for that type of thing.  The plea is made that we have not enough money to continue and that we need more money.  This is something which the domestic consumer finds it difficult to understand.  Furthermore, there is the demolition of ESB premises in Fitzwilliam Street and the building of new ones.  These projects could, perhaps, be carried out at a more opportune time.  In the light of the picture being painted at the moment, this is not an opportune time for this sort of spending.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a lot of comment, I suppose, about a circular, referred to in the newspapers, which has been issued to parents in the Dublin area.  Lest the impression might get abroad that many schools issue such circulars, I should like to assure the House that our evidence is that only one such school is involved and the headmistress of this school, in a moment when she suffered from either inverted snobbery or delusions as to what might happen when direct grants are paid by the State in lieu of fees, rushed out with this unfortunate circular.  She said to parents:  &ldquo;We are charging £20 at present; if you wish to remain out of the scheme, I will have to charge you £33; £11 a term, £1 over the suggested figure of £10 a term, £30 in all; put a circle round &lsquo;yes&rsquo; or &lsquo;no&rsquo; as to which you want.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I wonder did this lady not realise that if she wished to have her school that way, she could still charge the £20 and remain out?  Of course, parents will have something to say to all this. Does this headmistress not appreciate from my opening speech&mdash;and it was widely reported&mdash;that there is nothing in my scheme which will take from the autonomy of the secondary schools. How far can we go with such muddled thinking?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to remark on discussions by various local authorities about scholarships in future.  A number of people are asking&mdash;and I suppose it is a reasonable question&mdash;why if we will have free education from the 1st September, 1967, provision is being made for scholarship examinations in 1967?  Scholarship examinations are governed by legislation.  It will be necessary to introduce amending legislation in order to discontinue scholarship schemes and to determine what is to be done in relation to education with the money hitherto provided for scholarships.  There is also the fact that pupils have been preparing for scholarship <Col N="93" /> examinations since the beginning of the year and at this late stage it would be psychologically wrong and unjust to prevent them from competing for a scholarship if they so wished.</P>
    <P>I have also had to take into account the Gaeltacht pupils who depended on scholarships for post-primary education. It is most important to note, and I trust local authorities will take note of it, that when scholarships disappear as they will after 1967, that Gaeltacht or other pupils need have no fears. They will be far better provided for than at the present time.</P>
    <P>Deputy Carter made a plea for additional audio-visual aids in national schools.  I should like to assure him that we have already taken steps which will more than answer his plea.</P>
    <P>Deputy Larkin asked a question about providing as soon as possible for schools in newly built-up areas.  I have great sympathy with the case the Deputy makes and all I ask him is to use his influence with the Housing Committee of the Corporation in order to obtain for my Department as soon as possible the likely population increase involved in any building project. We are keeping in close touch on this matter.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the Fine Gael aspect of free education in their programme.  Capitation grants are evidently to be increased by £14 for the intermediate certificate and £19 for the leaving certificate.  Where income from fees is less than, or equal to, income from additional capitation, then they offer free education to all pupils, and where additional capitation grants are less than the total fees in day schools that accept the scheme they must offer a proportion of free places, say, a minimum of one-third.</P>
    <P>The selection of children for free places must be confined to children whose parents cannot afford this type of expensive education.  The selection has to be left to the school.  I quote from the Fine Gael policy on page 40 of the document.</P>

      <P>Leaving the selection to the school ensures that poor children will never get inside the doors of these schools because the poor child will not apply and it will ensure also that clever pupils will be creamed off to the expensive schools, if they can comply with the Fine Gael policy.  The Fine Gael policy proposes a similar arrangement for boarding schools as for day schools but supplemented by maintenance grants to cover the cost of board.  Incidentally, I think they forgot to cost this item.  This is on page 39, paragraph 112.  They have a blank for this cost.</P>

It is very difficult to believe that this is the same Senator FitzGerald as the person who, in the publication <i>Business and Finance,</i> of 2nd September last, advocated, if he advocated anything, that capitation grants should be withdrawn altogether from these high-fee boarding schools and that the moneys thus saved be devoted to the education in other schools of the intelligent children of poor people.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the explanation is that while Senator FitzGerald is capable of some social thinking, the Fine Gael Party is not and never will be.  This is quite amazing.  In September, Senator FitzGerald&mdash;I quote from <i>Business and Finance</i> of 2nd September&mdash;had this interesting observation to make:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is no wonder, then, that the income tax payer who gets married has his purchasing power increased by about £50 a year by the State&mdash; while those too poor to pay income tax are left to support two on an income inadequate for one.  It is no wonder that the unskilled worker with several children has his income increased by £16 when another child is born&mdash;while the better-off person paying income tax at the full rate <Col N="97" /> has his purchasing power raised by £68 on the occurrence of this happy event.  No wonder too that while the poor parent seeking a post-primary education for his clever child has little chance of securing one of the small number of scholarships available for such cases, the better-off parent who can afford to do without his child's earning-power and to pay school fees gets a double subsidy from the State in the form of grants that reduce by almost threequarters the fees he pays, as well as the income tax allowance that is not available in respect of the children of poorer parents, who are unable to continue at school.</P>

      <P>There is an interesting, constructive editorial in the <i>Irish Independent</i> today, which I did not get an opportunity of reading until teatime.  They mention very topical and reasonable questions.  They refer to free books.  Surely, it is socially more acceptable to have the scheme for free books administered through the headmasters of schools, who can do it in a quiet, unobstructive way rather than by means of a State-administered means test.  A similar scheme has been in operation for many years in the national schools.  Of course, hand in hand with this measure, we will have to improve the provision for free books in national schools because not only is it inadequate, <Col N="98" /> to put it mildly, but some teachers down the years have had to put their hands deep into their pockets to pay for the books of poor children.</P>
      <P>I have been asked why I have not included all pupils in the free books grant.  I am still talking about the editorial.  There are two basic reasons for my not doing so.  The first relates to cost and the second and possibly the more important is that I am convinced that free books should be supplied only where the provision of them would be a hardship on the parents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to my plan removing an incentive to economy in the secondary school system, surely the opposite is the case.  My plan, in effect, says that if you want to benefit from it you must keep your fees within certain limits.  Heretofore there was no brake on the fees which schools might charge.  Still on the <i>Irish Independent</i> editorial, I cannot accept the proposition that my plan falls heavily on schools which have kept their fees low. I dealt with this point earlier.  The setting of a minimum of £15 is designed precisely to get away from such a position. There are very many secondary schools whose fees vary between £5 and £15, and they will now get £15. Furthermore, and this is most important, many schools, which, on paper, charged a fee of £20, collected, in fact, an average of £12 10s.  Recently a school was opened in a certain part of the country by one of our most distinguished citizens.  He said: &ldquo;This school charges a fee of £20; the average collected is nearer to £10.&rdquo;  The religious Order running the school have to remit nearly 50 per cent of the potential fee because the children are too poor to pay it.  The point I am making is that the State is saying: &ldquo;Now, your fees are £20 or £25, or whatever the figure is, for every pupil in your school.  You will not have the cost of collection; you do not have to remit anything.&rdquo;  Therefore instead of the average being £10 or £12 10s., if their fees are £20, they are getting a full £20.  In fact, it is reasonable to suppose that schools charging £30 to £35 could be expected to come into this scheme.  There is no basis for <Col N="99" /> any allegations that my plan will fall heavily on such schools.</P>
    <P>Still on the <i>Irish Independent,</i> the editorial casts doubts, in a very nice way, on our ability to provide post-primary facilities.  Past performance in this regard should remove any fears that exist.  Back in 1955, there were over 56,000 pupils in secondary schools. In 1965, we catered for 93,000 pupils. In 1955, there were 20,000 pupils in vocational schools and in 1965, over 33,000 pupils.  Therefore we can proceed confidently on the basis that as additional accommodation is required, it will be provided.</P>
    <P>Deputy T.F. O'Higgins spoke about the Department of Education.  Fine Gael have set out by proposing a school committee to cure ills which do not exist.  School curricula and syllabuses, I should like to tell them, have never been framed by other than university professors, inspectors and teachers.  Ministers and administrators merely exercise a general control and are guided by the professional advisers when it comes to those curricula and syllabuses.  In other words, they are proposing a cure for an ill which does not exist.  There is, within the Fine Gael Party, an ex-Minister for Education.  If nobody else in the Party was aware of it, surely he would have informed them of this if he had been asked?</P>
    <P>I was glad that Deputy Mrs. Desmond adverted to the initial difficulties which are likely to arise with regard to the provision of transport. In the Fine Gael plan, they had a suggestion that they would provide transport for those over five miles from the school, and then it was subject to a means test.  It is quite impossible to run transport on a means test.  Ours is 100 per cent free; there is no means test; and it applies to children three miles from the school.  Deputy Larkin suggested it should be closer to the school.</P>

      <P>Would he apply the same thinking to school books?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley </NameTxt>
      <P>I should very much like to do so, but it would cost £400,000 to have them entirely free. As against that, there is a responsibility on parents who can afford to pay.  We calculated 25 per cent as the figure of pupils who might require free school books.  There is a responsibility on parents, if they can pay, to pay.  Administratively, it is easier to give a contribution for school books.  As I said, there was in some newspapers this idea that 25 per cent was an unfair figure, that there might be a higher percentage.  I possibly did not explain it correctly.  In some of the poorer areas, 100 per cent of the books will be free.  In certain poor areas of the cities and remote rural areas where the children are very poor, children of very small farmers, labouring men, road workers or people with seasonal employment, books will be free.  Of course, there are other areas where there would not be any necessity to give free books.  We calculated that the national average would be around 25 per cent.</P>
      <P>I feel it would be a retrograde step to set up a section in my Department to administer a means test for the books.  I feel the headmaster can consult with the other teachers on the background and income of a family and we will not be very strict about the manner in which he decides who should and should not get free books. I agree it would be a consummation devoutly to be wished to give all the books free and possibly in time that will occur, because they are very costly nowadays.  One of the first things I asked when I went into the Department imbued with enthusiasm was: &ldquo;Why are you always changing the texts.  Is this a racket for the publishers?&rdquo;  There are different sides to every story.  I asked a teacher.  He said: &ldquo;I have a hard enough job to do.  If I had to do Macbeth or Hamlet for the rest of my life, it would affect my mind.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>That shows how human I am.  It is a pity some of Deputy Mrs. Desmond's Party also did not follow her headline.  Anyway, I should like to say to Deputy Mrs. Desmond that we will have some teething troubles in providing this transport service but I should like to assure her that we are laying out our plans already.  We do not intend to allow ourselves to be bogged down by any minor difficulties that may arise.  It is a big problem of course.  While I did not refer specifically to career guidance in my opening speech, I should like Deputy Mrs. Desmond to know that we are building up in my Department the psychological service which will be necessary to undertake such guidance on a wide scale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies Lindsay and T.F. O'Higgins referred to the problem of the slow-learning child.  Both of them asked what the Government were doing about this child.  This shows up the general attitude of the Fine Gael Party in regard to education.  Both in the Fine Gael document and here in the House, they have waxed eloquent about the needs of those children in the matter of special education.  Surely somebody must have told them and their advisers that about a year ago my predecessor announced publicly the setting up of a committee to study this problem?  The committee, as everyone knows, is composed of teachers, psychologists and officials of my Department.  I shall have the report of the committee within the next few months.  The terms of reference of the committee were to investigate the causes and extent of <Col N="102" /> educational backwardness and to make recommendations in regard to the courses suited to these children and the training of teachers to teach these children.  When I have studied the report, I shall be able to take practical steps to help these children instead of just talking about their difficulties.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lindsay asked was there any difference between what I said to the National Union of Journalists about free post-primary education and my statement in relation to making such education available.  I assure the Deputy any difference there may appear to be is merely verbal.  My intentions have not altered.</P>
    <P>Deputy James Tully alleged that the policy in relation to small schools was merely an excuse for delaying the building of schools.  Let me repeat once more the facts: last year 130 new schools were built and 121 major improvement schemes were carried out. This was far and away the biggest school building programme accomplished in the history of the State; 60 short of 24,000 places were provided, which represents 1/20th of the total required in national schools.  In this context the Deputy's allegation, I am glad to say, is without foundation. When speaking of school building, Deputy Tully should not lose sight of the fact that during the six-year period of the Coalition Governments, of which his Party was a member, only about 300 schools were built.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully </NameTxt>

I shall have their findings next month. We are very grateful to this committee and I pay tribute to the valuable work they have done.  I expect to have plans and bills of quantities prepared and, in 12 months' time, I hope to put these out for tender and, at the end of 1968, or early 1969, these eight colleges should be almost completed.  This is one of our most important priorities. Deputy Lindsay said that no exhaustive survey of post-primary&mdash;&mdash;</P>

On the 16th of this month I am meeting the five associations comprising all the various interests involved in secondary education for discussions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the information we have received and on the school enrolments, existing and projected, we are basing our county surveys.  I referred in my opening statement to these surveys and indicated the counties to which the results of these surveys have already issued.  We have collected an enormous volume of information, the processing of which will take some time and, as <Col N="104" /> the survey in each county is completed, copies are sent to the various educational interests in the county and having had time to study the documents, meetings for discussion will be arranged with them.  Indeed, the first meeting actually took place in Kilkenny a couple of days ago.  A meeting is scheduled in Carlow on the 12th of this month, in Letterkenny on the 14th and in Portlaoise on the 19th. Out of these discussions the final plan will emerge for the expansion and co-ordination of post-primary education facilities to meet current and future demands.</P>
    <P>Deputy James Tully claimed that the grants to the Meath Vocational Education Committee had been cut by £7,000 in April last.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley </NameTxt>
      <P>And, as he says, by £3,000 in August.  I want to give him the facts.  The total expenditure of the Meath Vocational Education Committee in the year ended 31st March, 1966, was £105,000 odd.  The financial scheme sanctioned for the year ending 31st March, 1967, authorised an expenditure of £112,000 odd and provided for an income for the year of approximately £118,000.  Instead, therefore, of a cut in its resources, the Meath Vocational Education Committee have in 1966-67 £7,000 more to spend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">

      <P>If Deputy Tully will let me finish he will, perhaps, better understand the position.  Instead of a cut in its resources the Meath Vocational Education Committee in 1966-67 have £7,000 more to spend than they spent last year.  In addition, they have sufficient income to clear a debit balance, which stood at £5,311 on 1st April, 1966, which is not a bad situation at all in which to be.  Does Deputy Tully know about the solvency grant we gave to Meath?</P>

      <P>It was in this context that the amount of the solvency grant for 1966-67 was finally fixed at £10,800, instead of £13,800, as originally estimated and the point to be borne in mind in this connection is that these additional grants are intended to produce solvency and not a credit balance at the end of the year. The committee's resources for 1966-67 were £118,000 which includes grants from the Department of a total of £61,000, including the solvency grant and £48,000 contributed from local rates, and the balance was made up of sundry items, for instance, tuition fees and sales of produce.  Of course, tuition fees are now being abolished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The committee scheme which was submitted in November, 1965, showed that there were 74 whole-time teachers employed.  The enrolment in the committee schools then was: whole-time continuation 959 on the register and attendance, 774.  The apprentices on day release were 45, and the attendance was 39.  Other part-time courses were 267 and the attendance was 225, and evening courses on the register were <Col N="106" /> 785 and the attendance, 467.  The financial scheme, as sanctioned, provided for the appointment of four additional whole-time teachers.  It was appreciated that the enrolment and attendance figures I have just given would show an increase for 1966-67 and, on 2nd August of this year, the committee were asked to have a total examination made of the manner in which the teaching sources were deployed so as to make the most use possible of those resources.  They were informed that the Department would be glad to be advised in due course of the result of this examination and I am not aware that any case has been made following this examination for additional teaching staffs.</P>

    <P>I was questioned by several Deputies on the ever-rising graph of the national school building programme.  In 1955-1956 the total expenditure on national schools was £1,216,000 and this consisted of 46 new schools and 24 major improvements.  In 1965-66, the total expenditure on national schools was £3,644,000; 130 new schools were built, 121 major improvement schemes and pupil places for 23,940 pupils were provided.</P>
    <P>I trust I have referred to most of the more important points discussed in the debate.  I might possibly not have been as exhaustive as we might have hoped on this occasion but in the times that are in it, I trust that is understandable.

Therefore, the net amount to be voted now on this Excess Vote is £1,441 and I should like to explain to the House that this excess was due mainly to unanticipated expenditure in connection with the Centenary Exhibition of the National Gallery held at the end of 1964.  It was considered that this expenditure could be met from the grant-in-aid to the National Gallery and, therefore, a supplementary Estimate was not considered necessary.  In fact, the surplus from the grant-in-aid on 31st March, 1965, was £2,705 15s 8d. The auditors, however, refused to sanction expenditure from the grant-in-aid for the purpose of the Centenary Exhibition and, accordingly, the sum of £1,441, the amount of the excess less the surplus of appropriations-in-aid, must be obtained by way of Excess Vote.  This Excess Vote is, therefore, purely to meet an accounting position.</P>
