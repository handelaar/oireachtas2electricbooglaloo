    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Lynch) Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>To avoid any misunderstanding, I should say at the outset that, while the purpose of this legislation is to facilitate the transfer to a new Irish company, The National Bank of Ireland Limited, of the Irish business of the National Bank, the legislation will become effective only if the shareholders of the National Bank approve by the necessary majority of the proposed transfer.</P>
      <P>These two companies signed an agreement on 20 January, 1966 providing for the sale to the Irish company as a going concern as from 31 December, 1965 of all of the under-taking attributable to the business carried on in the State and in Northern Ireland comprising about two-thirds of the bank's total business.</P>
      <P>The National Bank was established in 1835 by Daniel O'Connell, its first Governor, to provide a banking network in Ireland.  In 1854 an office was opened in London to provide the bank with direct access to the London money market and membership of the London Clearing House.  This office became the Head Office and Registered Office in 1882 when the company was incorporated under English Companies Acts.  Other branches were opened in England and Wales mainly in centres where customers of Irish birth and descent could be served.  The bank is thus essentially an Irish bank but its legal status is that of an English company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent years it had become apparent to the bank that this situation was becoming increasingly difficult to reconcile with present day requirements. The differences between financial and business conditions here and in Britain affect not only a bank's day-to-day <Col N="1763" /> business but also official requirements as to liquidity and credit policy. The bank, as a London clearing bank, is obliged to maintain strictly defined liquidity ratios laid down by the British authorities which are not necessarily appropriate to its business in this country.  The rapid expansion of the Irish economy in recent years also makes it increasingly desirable that banking business within the State should be more directly under Irish control.  For these reasons the Dublin and London boards of the bank had for some time been exploring ways and means of bringing about a division of the bank, so that separate organisations for the two sections could be formed.</P>
    <P>The arrangements provide for the purchase by the Bank of Ireland of all the share capital of the new Irish company and the acquisition by the National Commercial Bank of Scotland of the share capital of the reconstituted National Bank which will retain the business in England and Wales.  Agreements to this effect have been entered into by the banks concerned. The new Irish company will continue as a separate entity but will be a member of the Bank of Ireland group.  The consideration for the acquisition by the Bank of Ireland of the share capital of the new Irish company is £12.2 million&mdash;£6.2 million in cash and £6 million in a new issue of Bank of Ireland loan stock.  The Scottish Bank will pay £4.75 million for the share capital of the reconstituted National Bank.  Total payments to the Bank's existing shareholders will thus be £16.95 million. Nearly two-thirds of this amount will be paid to residents of the State.</P>
    <P>The scheme of arrangement, prepared under the English Companies Acts, will require the approval of the shareholders and is being submitted for a decision at a general meeting of the company to be held in London on 24 February, 1966.  The necessary resolution will require a 75 per cent majority of the votes cast, each share entitling to one vote.  An order of the High Court in London sanctioning the <Col N="1764" /> scheme will then be necessary before it becomes effective.  The scheme is also expressly conditional on the enactment of legislation in this country not later than 31 March, 1966, substantially in the form of the Bill before the House.</P>
    <P>The Government support the proposal to transfer control of a significant part of Irish banking business from Britain to this country.  This change is in the public interest.  The implementation of official credit policy to suit the requirements of this country will be facilitated.  The proposals should also help in the rationalisation of Irish banking and lead to a more economic and efficient service for the community. Finally, the Irish Exchequer will benefit because profits formerly assessed to tax in Britain will in future be assessed to tax here.</P>
    <P>Since the early 1960s the rapid rate of growth in the economy and the increase in external trade has encouraged foreign bankers to take a more active interest in the country. Some overseas banks have opened offices in Dublin.  The Northern Bank has been taken over by the Midland Bank and a number of merchant banks are now operating here.  The Central Bank, in its report for 1964-65, drew attention to this extension by external banks and other financial institutions of their activities to this country and to the undesirability of any substantial growth of external participation and control of Irish banking activities.  The transfer of the control of the Irish business of the National Bank is a welcome reversal of this trend.</P>
    <P>An alternative possibility considered by the bank was the establishment of a wholly-owned Irish subsidiary company controlled from London but this was rejected as impracticable and inadequate. While such an arrangement would have some of the advantages of the proposed scheme and would solve some of the problems inherent in the present situation it would not have been favoured by the Government because of the maintenance of control from London.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides, among other things, for the transfer from the <Col N="1765" /> National Bank to the National Bank of Ireland of accounts of customers, of securities held by the bank for loans and advances as well as securities held for safe keeping.  It also provides for the transfer of staff and the continuity of their pension rights. The main problem relates to the transfer of secured accounts without disturbing existing priorities where securities are shared by different parties.  In the case of overdrawn accounts it would be necessary, in the absence of legislation, to obtain the consent of individual customers to the transfer of accounts and also agreements or letters of consent to the transfer of any securities so as to make them available to cover advances by the new bank.</P>
    <P>A stamp duty liability would arise in an artificial way on the arrangement to transfer credit and debit accounts. There is no provision for setting one off against the other.  The operation amounts to little more than a bookkeeping transaction.  In the circumstances, the charging of duty on the gross amount of loans and advances would not be justified and provision for the exemption is included in the Bill. These considerations do not apply to conveyances of real property and the appropriate duty is being charged on such conveyances.</P>
    <P>The Bill, if enacted, will not become effective until an order is made by me. This procedure is necessary so as to ensure that the Act will not come into operation unless the scheme of arrangement is approved by the shareholders. I propose to make an order bringing the Act into operation at the appropriate time in advance of the 31st March, 1966.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Bill for the approval of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>We on this side of the House in the Fine Gael Party have always been concerned in relation to our banking service and the manner in which credit and credit policy should be controlled in the national interest.  Our views in this regard were made abundantly clear in the last general election.  It is proper to <Col N="1766" /> point out that an effort was made in the course of that election to suggest that there was something inimical to the national interest in our credit and banking policy.  It is worth recalling the unfounded allegations made in that regard by the present Government Party when we find today, in seeking support for this Bill, that the Minister suggests, very properly, that this Bill is necessary in the national interest to ensure that the direction and control of credit within the State should be strengthened.  That is an important aspect of the Bill that should commend itself to the House.</P>
      <P>As the Minister has pointed out, there is some danger in the present situation that we may have an incursion of other banking interests affecting our economy.  If that did take place, and it is facilitated to some extent by the fact that our laws in this regard make it easy for other banking interests to come in here, it would constitute a situation in which the control of banking and credit policies might not easily be within the effective jurisdiction of the Government.  That danger was pointed out in the last Central Bank report and it is a matter which I know causes concern to many people.</P>
      <P>One effective way, apart from legislation, of preventing such a development is to ensure that we have a sufficiently strong banking service in this country. The Irish commercial banks have always played a proper and sound part in the development of the country. They have become long-term lenders which is not a very usual service in banking, but they have provided that service in the past.  One of the difficulties has been that it has become more and more apparent that we may have too many small banking interests and, as the economy develops and competition becomes acute, the danger is that the essential service required may be affected by competition from abroad.  It is in that light that this proposal must be judged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The National Bank is a very familiar bank to this country, one that has very strong ties with the national life.  It is true to say that originally <Col N="1767" /> there was very considerable anxiety when this proposal became public.  The National Bank conducts its business in Britain, the North of Ireland and in the Republic.  It is a bank that, while it has a strong historical association in Ireland, is an English-based bank and it has suffered from the difficulties that, being an English registered bank, it is subject to the official regulations of Britain which, to some degree, are not appropriate to its Irish business.  Under this proposal the Irish business carried on by the bank will now be controlled by an Irish company and the bank itself, its assets and business here, will become part of the Bank of Ireland group. That will enormously strengthen that group and will, I believe, enable that banking interest to provide a service competitively with banking interests from abroad.  In those circumstances the proposal is, I think, in the national interest and for that reason it should have the support of the House.</P>
    <P>I do not want to say anything about what the proposal means to the shareholders of the National Bank.  I do not know enough about that.  I understand that the Minister is expressing no view in that regard and, so far as the proposal here is concerned, that is, whether the merger will take place and to what extent, it is still a matter entirely for the shareholders.  While the Bill does not specifically say so, the Minister has told us that he will only make an order bringing it into operation if the proposal is acceptable to and accepted by the shareholders.</P>
    <P>In relation to the actual terms of the Bill, there are certain questions I shall raise at a later stage.  I am not quite satisfied with the provisions of section 2.  That section could be strengthened, I think, to cover existing arrangements with and dealings between the customers of the bank and the bank itself.  These are details we can discuss on Committee Stage.  In principle, and in the circumstances now obtaining here, I think this Bill is a proper one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not wish to oppose this takeover.  It has certain advantages from the point of view of <Col N="1768" /> the national economy in that it will strengthen the banking system here.  It will take control from London and place it in Dublin.  That is a good thing. The fact that in future taxation on profits will be payable to the Exchequer here is a very good thing.  I am not aware of how much will be involved or how much the revenue will benefit, but it is a welcome step in the right direction.</P>
      <P>I am not entirely happy about one or two aspects of this takeover.  First, it will reduce still further the already very limited amount of competition in the banking field.  Assuming this merger goes through, the Bank of Ireland will now control itself, the Hibernian Bank, the National City Bank and the National Bank.  This will bring us considerably further along the road to monopoly.  I am not sure that this will be in the interests of the man in the street who wishes to avail of the banking service.  It is already difficult enough to secure overdraft facilities from the banks.  The amount of competition between one bank and another is very limited and, with the banks extending their sphere of influence, we will be placed in a position in which there will be virtually no competition in the banking system.  From the point of view of the man in the street I do not think that is a good thing.</P>
      <P>I am not entirely happy amout the move in this direction.  We are continually told about the advantages of free competition by those who believe in private enterprise.  I imagine that those who advocate free competition would include bank directors.  We are told that it is free competition that ensures value to the public because the law of supply and demand operates. We seem to be getting away from the principle of free competition in this and that is one aspect about which I am not happy.  It should be put on record that this trend, if developed further, should be considered in the light of the interests of the people as distinct from the interests of specific groups.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another aspect about which I am not happy is the compensation it is proposed to pay the shareholders. <Col N="1769" /> Banks are in a very privileged position in that they do not have to declare the real value of their assets and do not declare what their real profits are.  This is information most vital in this present takeover.  Yet, the only people who have any idea of what the value is are the directors; the shareholders of the company, who are the real owners, are not given any information. Whether it is a good or a bad thing that the banking system should, in normal times, be allowed to operate in secrecy is not something we should discuss now.  But I think it is, to say the least of it, a pretty poor show. Indeed, the way in which the banks maintain public confidence is in itself a high tribute to the public.</P>
    <P>At a time like this, however, when the shareholders' assets are being sold, it is in the interests of the owners of the business that they should be in the position of knowing exactly what the business is worth.  They have not been supplied with this information.  From the correspondence in the papers recently, and judging by discussions with those interested, this has left the shareholders a little unhappy.  I think it is a pity the directors were not compelled to disclose this information. After all, the directors have a vested interest in being taken over.  They themselves are being taken over as well as the bank and some of them will end up as directors of two banks. There was not then much incentive to the directors to fight this and get the highest possible price.  That is an aspect that should be brought to the attention of the public.</P>
    <P>The third point is that I understand the staff of the National Bank are not entirely happy either about all this. They queried this takeover at the meeting in London.  They believe they have not had proper assurances as to working conditions and prospects of promotion under the new takeover.  These are things that should have been spelled out in much clearer terms by the directors. The Government should, I think, insist on the directors making this much clearer to the employees than they have seen fit to do so far.</P>
    <P>Finally, it has been decided that the venue for the proposed takeover, if it <Col N="1770" /> goes through, will be London.  We have not been given the number of Irish shareholders involved but I should imagine that the vast majority are Irish.  This meeting will be held in London and it is quite obvious that very few Irish shareholders will be present to ask awkward questions. While this may be very convenient for the directors, it is a pity that some arrangement was not made to hold the meeting in Dublin at which the Irish shareholders could attend and look after their interests.</P>
    <P>This thing has gone through far too smoothly and very little interest has been taken as regards shareholders of the bank or employees of the bank or how this is likely to affect the man in the street when he goes to get further overdraft facilities.  I am sorry the Government did not see fit to ensure that more information was made available, and that greater details were not sought from the directors of the banks as to what way things are.  This measure will obviously go through and I suppose, in principle, it is acceptable because it will benefit the Irish banking system and the Irish Exchequer.  However, as I have said, there are other aspects about which I am not happy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been rightly said that this bank has played an historic part in the financial life of this country.  I do not think there is anybody in this House who does not regret the passing of the National Bank, because, in effect, that is what is happening here.  The National Bank will no longer have a separate existence, except in name, but will become a subsidiary of the Bank of Ireland.  I am in full agreement with the last speaker that there should be competition.  Competition is the life of trade and the very difficult financial circumstances that exist at present and the difficulty in obtaining credit will be accentuated if there are to be fewer banks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This bank was founded over 100 years ago by Daniel O'Connell for the purpose of establishing free trade between the two countries.  Free trade, <Col N="1771" /> I take it, is a policy of the present Government.  This seems to be a retrograde step.  I do not see any objection to this bank being registered in London, nor do I see any advantage being gained by what is happening now.  It is true to say that the principal customer of the Bank of Ireland is the Government.  Government funds are lodged in the Bank of Ireland, and the Government, of necessity, must have considerable control over the Bank of Ireland.  I have always regarded the National Bank as being a separate entity in that it had a definite financial policy of its own, and that must now cease to exist.  I am one of the people in this House who favour private enterprise.  I always have favoured it and will continue to do so as long as I am in public life, and I do not think the unification of this bank with the Bank of Ireland is a service to the public as a whole.</P>
    <P>I am not a financial expert nor do I hold any shares in the National Bank, although I have dealt with them myself; they have been my bankers and those of my family for generations. I believe there is dissatisfaction among the shareholders&mdash;that is the impression I have gathered from talking to people&mdash;that the property of the National Bank has not been given its full valuation.  I speak subject to correction; perhaps the Minister has financial advisers beside him to inform him on these matters.  I am told that the valuation placed on the real estate of the National Bank, considering the period in which it was built, is too low. It is absolutely untrue to suggest that a bank that was built 40 or 50 years ago maintains the same valuation.  Of course it has greatly increased in value.</P>
    <P>I am also aware of the fact that there is considerable anxiety among the staff of the National Bank in that they cannot be assured of continuity of employment.  Where a bank becomes a subsidiary of another bank, it has obviously been done for the purpose of economy, and employees cannot be assured that there will not be a considerable cutting down on the employment in the said banks.  I have been approached myself by officials of the <Col N="1772" /> National Bank.  I was approached the other day by somebody who told me he had had an opportunity of getting a job outside this country and could I guarantee that he would still be retained in employment in the bank here. I could not do that.  I am not a director of the bank.  I could only tell him I thought it was possible there would be some cutting down of the staff at some later date.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I just want to pose the question of credit.  Very near where I live, the town of Gorey, there are two banks.  We have never had more than two banks.  There is the National Bank and the Bank of Ireland.  When people sought credit from the Bank of Ireland or the National Bank&mdash;as I say, competition is the life of trade&mdash;they were seeking credit from two rival concerns and, if they were credit-worthy, they could get the best of terms from one or the other.  When they seek credit in future, it will not be from two banks but from one bank. That is the answer to this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the House has treated this Bill objectively.  Even though there have been some criticisms, they have been justifiable criticisms.  I should like to repeat that this is an enabling Bill.  As Deputy O'Higgins rightly pointed out, this Bill will be effective only if the necessary majority of the shareholders vote in favour of the transfer of their shares from their existing holding to the new company. It is necessary, as Deputy O'Higgins pointed out, that we strengthen our own banking institutions in this country rather than enable what bank business we have to be taken over by outside interests.  There are very many inquiries and overtures as to the possibility of acquiring bank interests in Ireland by outside interests, and it is for that reason, in particular, that I welcome this move by the Bank of Ireland.  It is true that the greater the extent to which the bigger banks take over the smaller banks here the greater is the tendency towards monopolistic practices, but I assure the House that the Government will keep a close eye on this matter.  As well as that, there are other quite substantial banks still <Col N="1773" /> operating in the country.  There is a solid group of Corkmen who will not let the Bank of Ireland get away with too much as far as credit facilities are concerned.</P>
      <P>The suggestion has been made that some of the shareholders feel apprehensive as to whether the value they are getting is good value.  In reference to that, I can only say that while I and the Government made no special inquiries, nor were we required to do so, at the request of the boards of the three banks concerned, the Bank of Ireland, the National Bank and the Scottish Bank, an internationally known firm of chartered accountants named Cooper Bros. and Co. of London were retained specifically to express an opinion as to whether the offer made for the shares of the National Bank was adequate and they without any equivocation said that the offer made was certainly good value for the shares.  Of course it is a matter for the shareholders themselves to be satisfied or otherwise, as I said, and 75 per cent of them will have to vote in favour of the transfer.</P>
      <P>In regard to the venue at which this meeting is to take place, I assume that since the National Bank itself is an English-registered company, any meeting of this nature would be required under the English Companies Acts to take place in London.  I do not think anything would necessarily arise on it in any event because I doubt if any substantial shareholder will be denied an opportunity of going to London for the purpose of the meeting or, if there is a number of small shareholders, that they would have any difficulty in selecting somebody to represent them there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards aprehension, if any, felt by the staff&mdash;Deputy Esmonde said that they were apprehensive, and so did Deputy Norton&mdash;I am not aware of it.  Nobody made any representations to me about it but there is specific provision in the Bill to safeguard the interests of the staff.  In this connection I might say that the premises of the National Bank as they now exist will be maintained and the staffs will be maintained in them.  I do not say it will <Col N="1774" /> necessarily be the same staff; I suppose they will be liable to transfer from one building or town to another as they are at present but, by and large, I believe the interests of the staffs will be safeguarded.</P>

      <P>I have no information on the latter question.  The value of the shares was referred to in the document that was circulated.  The market quotations were given at page 8, paragraph 4.  I do not think it necessary for me to go through them. The shares are quoted as at 30th June, 1965 right up to January, 1966 and so I think there is ample cover to indicate the trend of the market in these shares.</P>

    <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £95,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1966, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Education (including Institutions of Science and Art), for certain Miscellaneous Educational and Cultural Services and Sundry Grants-in-Aid. </P>

      <P>Last night I made some reference to the disgraceful speech by Deputy Oliver Flanagan.  I do not want to dwell unduly on this but there is one further comment I want to make, that is, that at one point in his speech Deputy Flanagan quoted from the Official Report the text of a question he put to me last December. When he came to give his version of the reply, he put down the Official Report, despite requests from this side of the House to quote from it, and proceeded to quote from a newspaper report of some months later which was corrected the following day and which was known to be incorrect.  I mention this because it occurs to me it was worth the while of everybody concerned with this question to consider why some of the most outspoken critics of the policy in regard to small schools, such as Deputy Oliver Flanagan, should feel themselves obliged to descend to such unscrupulous tactics.  One finds it difficult to escape the conclusion that there is a certain lack of confidence in the merits of their case.</P>
      <P>When we come to consider the question of closing small schools, there are two main aspects of the matter to be considered.  First, there is the question of whether small schools should be closed and, secondly, the question of the mechanics of carrying this out and in particular the efficacy or otherwise of a transport system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1776" /> Now, if we consider first the question of whether such schools should be closed or not, I want to make it quite clear that this decision was not arrived at lightly, that it was announced here in Dáil Eireann and that it was arrived at as a result of the years of experience of the inspectors of the Department of Education.  I also want to make it as clear as I possibly can that the decision implies no criticism whatsoever of the teachers in small schools.  An attempt has been made to misrepresent the position and to suggest that I and my Department in arriving at this decision are criticising standards of teachers in small schools.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  I know that some of the best teachers in this country are teaching in small schools.  If they were not, these schools would probably have been closed a long time ago.</P>
    <P>What I am saying is that we are handicapping good teachers by making them teachers in one- or two-teacher schools, that if they had the facilities of larger schools available to them, they could do much more for their students than they do at present. Indeed, the fact that they have done as well as they have in such difficult circumstances is of itself a very considerable tribute to their ability as teachers.  The main reason for the difficulties that arise in small schools is quite obvious, that is, that in a one-teacher school, you have one teacher handling six, or possibly seven classes; in a two-teacher school, one teacher is handling, say, three classes at the one time, each of them doing a different subject at the same time.  It is true that the classes are much smaller than in other schools, in most of the small schools anyway, but the question is: does this compensate for the fact that the teacher is trying to conduct three or more classes at the one time?  Is it not obvious that we are not giving the teacher a fair chance in asking him or her to do this?  This is the basic reason for the closing of small schools but the question then arises: this is all very well in theory but does it work out in practice in this way?</P>
    <P>Any evidence we have shows that it does.  We have been told here of the many people who are the products <Col N="1777" /> of one- or two-teacher schools who have aquitted themselves very well in all walks of life.  There is no doubt that this is true but I have not heard many dwelling on the many thousands of children who have come from these schools who have not done well. After all, our concern should be with all the children and not the particularly bright and talented ones only.  We all know of cases of children who have come from schools such as this who did not get a fair chance. Somebody pointed out here that unfortunately many of these people are those who will most likely have to emigrate, and had to emigrate heretofore, and this is true.  We do not hear about them, or what happens to them, or at least we do not hear very much, but I have, since I embarked on this policy, had a number of letters from emigrants in Britain, people who had attended small schools which are in process of being closed.  They described the conditions under which they were educated in terms which were frightening.  Subsequently I checked in the Department and verified that such descriptions were not inaccurate.  The general burden of such letters was: &ldquo;Do not be put off; keep on and close that school.  My only regret is that it was not done 25 years ago when I was there.&rdquo;  I do not say that this is representative of all small schools but it is at least as representative as the argument about those who have done very well coming from small schools.</P>
    <P>It is suggested that this decision has been arrived at by me who am a city man, who knows nothing about rural Ireland.  I do not claim to be an expert on rural Ireland but I do know a great deal more about it than many of the critics give me credit for.  Furthermore, I am advised in this matter by people who have had long experience of education, some of whom are products of one- and two-teacher schools.  I have available to me the experience of approximately 60 inspectors who are visiting these schools daily, who know what is going on in these schools from day to day.  We have found that the majority of the school managers with whom we have consulted in regard to <Col N="1778" /> the closing of schools have been in favour of closing these schools.  These are school managers in rural Ireland, managing schools in rural Ireland.  Are these completely out of touch with what is happening?  Are the inspectors ignorant of what is going on in the small schools?  Let us have a little reason in this matter.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the report <i>Investment in Education</i> and an effort has been made to decry the findings of this on the basis that they are bounded by economic considerations. It is quite true that the general terms of reference are economic but it is very difficult when one studies a matter such as this, with reference to education, to stick entirely to economics.  The findings of this Report in regard to small schools are summarised in Chapter Nine, paragraphs 79, 80 and 81:</P>
    <P>As regards the possible benefits which result from this pattern it was seen that large schools perform best at the scholarship examinations, irrespective of location.  The large schools can provide special preparation for the examination and there is no evidence that this is counter-balanced by the more favourable pupil/teacher ratios and smaller school classes in the smaller schools.</P>
    <P>There are some indications also that the progression of pupils is slower in the smaller schools, so that on balance pupils of the smaller schools take longer to complete the full course.  The reasons for this are not immediately clear but are not apparently due entirely to differences in age of starting school.</P>
    <P>While we have no information on the structural conditions of the various sizes of schools, it will have been noted that small schools have far less satisfactory sanitary and drinking facilities, a high percentage of open fires, a minimum of special equipment and audio-visual aids and virtually no special rooms.  And yet, per pupil place they are more costly to erect and the costliest to maintain. It was also observed that the pupil of a smaller school was likely <Col N="1779" /> to have a narrower range of subject available to him. </P>
    <P>I am not aware of any reasoned attempt by anybody to dispute those findings.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to interrupt the Minister, but would he care to refer to paragraph 9.38 on page 243, in regard to the keeping back of pupils, in which it is stated:</P>
      <P>...if the extra &ldquo;delay&rdquo; is expressed in terms of the proportion of pupils who were not already delayed by the end of the first standard, it will be seen that the rates are the same for the small rural schools as for the large urban schools. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but I think there is a technical calculation involved here which we would have to discuss in more detail.  The summary of that conclusion is as I have given it:</P>
      <P>There are some indications also that the progession of pupils is slower in the small schools, so that on balance pupils of the smaller schools take longer to complete the full course. </P>
      <P>That is a summary of the findings. The Deputy is aware that this is rather a technical matter, but the summary is one that can be understood by anyone without technical knowledge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I was saying, I was not aware that anybody has attempted to dispute these findings on a factual basis.  I might add there is a reference there to pupils in the smaller schools normally having a narrower curriculum available to them.  I wonder is it generally known that the requirements of the Department of Education in regard to smaller schools are less than in the case of larger schools?  For instance, algebra and geometry are optional in these schools.  They are taught in some of them and not in others.  I do not know when this regulation was introduced. I assume it is of long standing. Why was it introduced?  Is this not further evidence of a recognition by all concerned that the difficulties involved for the teachers were such that one could not reasonably expect the <Col N="1780" /> same standard from them as in larger schools?</P>
    <P>Deputies who are members of county councils probably have experience of deputations coming representing teachers in small schools asking them to make sure that a sufficient proportion of the scholarships awarded by the county council were reserved for small schools.  The teachers made the case, and rightly so, that they could not possibly be expected to compete with the larger schools.  This argument has been accepted by practically every county council in the country.  While we are on this subject of scholarships, I would like to clear up a good deal of confusion which has arisen, some of it I think not exactly by accident.  I have never made the argument against small schools that they did not do as well in scholarship examinations as large schools.  I have never made that argument.  People who were opposed to my policy made the argument that the small schools did better.  In fact, that is not true, as is shown in this Report.  My attitude in this matter has always been that the gaining of scholarships is not clear evidence of the level of education given in a school.  Therefore, I would not be prepared to use this argument either way, whatever the findings were; but may I appeal to those who are prepared to use it at this stage at least to have regard to the facts as established in this Report showing that the smaller schools do not do as well in obtaining scholarships.  This calculation, I think, does not take into account the reservation of scholarships for small rural schools.  I am not using that argument and I never have, but anybody who wants to use it should at least have regard to the facts.  If they want to say that this finding is not true, there is an onus on them to show in what way it is wrong factually.</P>
    <P>We know that most of these small schools were built one hundred years or more ago when conditions in this country were very different from those obtaining today.  Transport was very much more primitive.  The roads were not in anything like the same conditio <Col N="1781" /> tion and the standard of education required generally was not as high as it is today.  The standard of comfort in schools was not as high as required now.  These schools were quite suitable for the era in which they were built.  But we are now in 1966 and we have got to face up to the problems involved for us.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the implementation of this policy as far as I and my Department are concerned.  We were satisfied that the small schools in general were not of educational advantage to the child as compared with the larger schools.  Therefore, we had to consider how we should approach the problem of replacing them.  The decision I took in this matter was that where one- or two-teacher schools were to be replaced, in other words, where a new school had to be built or a major improvement scheme carried out, we should review the position in that area to see whether we could avoid building a small school so that we would serve the educational interest of the children better by transferring them either to an adjoining school&mdash;where we would have at least a three-teacher school or bigger, if possible&mdash;or perhaps to a central school in the parish.  Any other course would mean that we would be going ahead building small schools and, at the same time, saying these schools were not as effective educationally for the children as larger schools.</P>
    <P>I do not see how we could possibly justify that attitude.  This would condemn many more generations of our children to an education which we believe is not as good as what we can give them.  I could not feel justified in condemning generations of our children to that.  I regard it as my duty, as Minister for Education, to try to obtain the highest possible level of education for our children.  It is because of that decision that, based on the reasons I have given, it has happened that a number of schools which were to proceed have stopped.  I ask anybody who accepts the argument in regard to the greater efficacy of larger schools if any other policy is justified.</P>
    <P>We have been given various arguments <Col N="1782" /> in regard to these small schools but I doubt if anybody has attacked the problem properly.  There are a number of small schools in this country, recently built, with modern facilities, with good teachers, and it is possible to say: &ldquo;Those schools should not be closed&rdquo;.  I have not heard anybody say this.  Perhaps the reason is that they know we do not intend to close such schools.  I want to make it quite clear that this policy will take many years to reach fruition.  It applies in the case of two-teacher schools only where the existing school has to be replaced.  Schools recently built, with decent sanitary accommodation and with good teachers, are in no danger whatever of being closed down in the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>What surprises me, I must say, about some of the reaction to this policy is that one might imagine that this is some completely revolutionary change. What are we doing except transporting children, in the normal case, a matter of, I suppose, about four miles, and, in the normal case, within their own parish, to another school?  One would think, to hear some of the statements made, that we were transporting them to Van Diemen's Land, to a completely alien environment.  It is time that this problem was viewed in perspective. This is no revolutionary change.  This is merely a small step in the endeavour to raise the standard of education available to all the children of Ireland. We find that, if we do this, we can get very much better value out of our teaching force.</P>
    <P>Let me give an example.  We have one area we came across in which we have, within a five-miles radius of the focal point which is the local village, 11 national schools with 15 teachers and a total of 225 pupils.  Seven of these 11 schools are one-teacher schools.  A number of them are due to be replaced.</P>

      <P>Can there be any justification in 1966 for continuing that situation?  Surely this is a waste of teaching talent and surely there can be and has been no real dispute about the one-teacher schools?  Surely the obligation is on us, if we want to do something for the children of this country when we get the opportunity of replacing the schools, to put an end to that kind of situation&mdash;and this is not an uncommon situation.  Let us view the situation in the correct perspective, not in a haze of sentiment.</P>
      <P>Now in dealing with this problem, I am well aware of the social implications. I disagree entirely with those who say that this policy is striking at community life in rural Ireland, particularly in the West.  In fact, I can say the contrary.  I say that unless we are prepared to give decent facilities to the children of this country, particularly in rural Ireland, they will not stay: their families will not stay.  Why should they?  Why should they put up with inferior conditions?  No amount of sentimentalising about this will change these people's opinions.  They have a right, as far as we can give it to them, to get the same kind of school facilities as are available to children in other parts of the country and, as far as I am concerned, anything I can do to give it to them I shall do.</P>
      <P>This suggestion we have been hearing that we are taking away facilities is a complete misrepresentation of the position.  What we are trying to do is to improve the facilities and to give a decent chance to the children of rural Ireland.  I want to make it quite clear that this policy was embarked upon solely for educational reasons. Any other reasons, be they social or economic, must be subsidiary to that, as far as I am concerned.  But, in so far as social considerations come into it, I believe that, socially, this is much to the advantage of rural Ireland. Economically, it is to the advantage of this country as a whole and to the particular parishes concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The case has been made that this will cost extra money to these people who are affected.  That is quite untrue. In fact, they will pay less money. <Col N="1784" /> Instead of having to pay the local contribution for a one- or a two-teacher school, they may have to pay no local contribution or, if they have to pay one for a central school, the cost will be very much less.  Transport is being provided entirely at the expense of the State.  It is quite untrue to suggest that there is any extra cost involved for these people.  From the point of view of the taxpayer, this is more economic.  This is not, as I said, by any means other than a subsidiary reason but I know of no reason why any Government or any Minister should be ashamed to save the taxpayer money.</P>
    <P>In our approach to this problem, our method of work has been something like this.  A school comes before us, a one- or a two-teacher school, which is in very bad condition and is due to be replaced.  An inspector is given a map of the area showing the surrounding national schools and all the details of the enrolment in those schools and of the number of teachers involved. He goes to the manager of the school concerned and discusses with him whether it would be feasible to provide for the education of those children in one of the adjoining schools, if it is in good condition; and if, by amalgamating, one would create a viable school of at least three teachers, preferably more, he examines the area as to the condition of the roads, as to the likelihood of transport being available.  He finds out and pinpoints on the map where each of the children in that school lives to see whether it would be feasible to provide transport.  He then submits a report to the Department giving all these details of his inquiries. The matter is very carefully investigated in my Department and any case of doubt or difficulty is referred to me personally.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned earlier that we have found as a result of these investigations that the majority of the managers concerned favour this policy. I want to stress that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask the Minister are they the managers who are consulted with regard to specific schools now being examined?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.  As the House will see from what I have said, we endeavour to treat each case, and we do treat each case, on its own merits having regard to the situation in the locality.  There have been a number of cases of one- and two-teacher schools which we have investigated and in which we have decided that a new one- or two-teacher school should be built.  I mention this because there appears to be some impression that there is a blanket decision that any of these schools that come to be replaced will not be replaced.  That is not so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given the reasons why we approach the problem on the basis of dealing with schools about to be replaced.  This of necessity means some hold-up in the schools but I want to point out that in many cases <Col N="1786" /> where we decide not to go ahead and build a school and, instead, to transport the children to a nearby school which perhaps was built in recent years, the children, as a result, are getting into decent conditions much faster than they would be if we were waiting for the building of a conventional school, which would be a matter of a few years.  Furthermore, the area concerned does not have to pay a local contribution.  So that, while there may be some delay, in most cases the advantages involved for the area far outweigh the disadvantages of the delay.</P>
      <P>As I have said, we are treating each case on its merits.  In some cases where we have decided to go ahead with small schools, there have been reasons such as that the roads over which the children would have to be transported are unsatisfactory or may be satisfactory but may be impassable in winter.  In other cases we have done this where there was only one school in the parish and that was a two-teacher school.  In some such cases in Deputy Jones's constituency, we have said: &ldquo;Go ahead; build a new two-teacher school&rdquo;.  I am mentioning this because I want to make it quite clear that these cases are treated on their merits but that our overall approach to it is that, where feasible, we will not build more one- and two-teacher schools because we believe it is not in the educational interests of the children.</P>
      <P>Reference has been made by some Deputies to the schools of minority religions.  I could not help being amused by some of the references because it looked to me as though the speakers thought they were producing a new idea which had not occurred to me or to my Department.  I want to assure them that we are well aware of this problem.  I also want to assure them that we have discussed it in detail with the representatives of the Church of Ireland.  Deputies might be interested to know that the authorities of the Church of Ireland have themselves prepared their own scheme of closure of small schools and amalgamation, without any prompting from us.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it for the same reason as they have closed a number of their churches?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>They have this difficulty, but one of their main difficulties is that they feel that if their children continue to be educated in small schools, in the course of time the standard of their education will be far below the standard of education available to the majority of people in this country and, therefore, they are very concerned about the problem.  I want to assure the House that we are well aware of the problems involved and that we are working in close collaboration with the Church authorities of the minority religions in this matter.</P>
      <P>I have stressed that we endeavour, where possible, to keep the children affected as a result of any transfer which is contemplated within their own parish.  We go to considerable lengths to ensure this but it is not always possible.  There are exceptions. You will come across cases where there may be five or six small schools built around the boundaries of a parish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Or one school built in the corner of three parishes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>This kind of thing happens also.  In such cases the only reasonable way to deal with it very often is to transfer the children to a school in an adjoining parish.  These are exceptional cases but, of course, we all know that there are many children attending schools and parishes other than their own at present, without any amalgamation or directives from the Department of Education, so that this is not any revolutionary situation in this country.  As I say, it is exceptional.  We endeavour to avoid it where possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should make it clear that there are alternatives open where we close a school.  I mentioned that it may be possible to transport the children to an adjoining school which was recently built.  There are some cases where it is possible to do this without any addition to the existing school.  I can think of one particular case to which I will <Col N="1788" /> refer later.  It was built six or eight years ago as a three-teacher school.  It is now only a two-teacher school and there is one room vacant.  There is a school within two and a half miles of that which is due to be closed.  This is a two-teacher school about to become a one-teacher school.  In that case we are moving the children from the old school to the one two and a half miles away where there is a vacant room and we do not have to add to that school.  In other cases it may be necessary to add to an existing school and in some cases it may be necessary to build a new central school.</P>
    <P>Where a central school is required, it will be a school of at least four teachers, and it will take some time to build it.  In the meantime, where conditions are bad, we are going to alleviate them by doing some repairs or by providing prefabricated classrooms. There seems to be some misconception about the size of central schools.  Some people visualise children being taken out of one- and two-teacher schools and being sent to schools where there is an enrolment of thousands of children. This is ridiculous.  It is just not feasible.  We are moving the children a distance normally of about four miles and we just do not have this kind of population.  It is not going to happen and we do not want it to happen.</P>
    <P>The ideal would be to have one teacher for each class.  In the vast majority of cases, we will not be able to achieve that.  We will only be able to get some of the way towards it. There is no question of transporting children from one- and two-teacher schools to huge schools.  I mentioned a moment ago the case of a school which was a two-teacher school and is about to become a one-teacher school and to be replaced and that we would move the children to a three-teacher school which is now only a two-teacher school and where there is a room vacant.  That case is in County Clare.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few bad ones left.  I mention this because Deputy Murphy from Clare spoke last <Col N="1789" /> night on this subject and it would be fair to summarise what he said as being that he felt that the closing of small schools was inevitable.  He did not make it clear whether he was for or against it but he said he was dissatisfied with the transport arrangements. He mentioned this case without saying where it was.  He said that we had closed a school and that there was no transport provided.</P>
      <P>This is a justifiable comment by Deputy Murphy but I would like him and the people of that area to know that we have been willing at all times to pay 100 per cent of the cost of a transport service.  The only reason there is not a transport service there is that the manager has refused to arrange it.  I want to apologise profusely to the children and to their parents for the inconvenience caused to them.</P>
      <P>I was asked whether I had consultations with the INTO.  I think certain confusion may have arisen about this. I want to make it clear that I discussed this matter with representatives of the executive of the INTO.  While I realise that the matter has not yet been discussed at the INTO Congress, which will not take place until Easter, the representatives of the executive made it clear to me that they had no objection in principle to the closing of smaller schools.</P>
      <P>It should be clear by now that as a result of what we are doing, we are going to have better use of our teacher power.  In the case I mentioned where we have 15 teachers in 11 schools it is obvious that amalgamation there would release a minimum of three and perhaps four teachers.</P>

      <P>Yes; I want to deal with that.  In practice, what happens is that the teachers from the school which is being closed normally move into the amalgamated school.  They do not lose in any way as a result. Any allowances they have or would have had they retain.  If, as a result of the moving, there is an extra teacher in the amalgamated school, we retain that teacher there until a vacancy arises in the district concerned.  Then that teacher is asked to take that post. So far there has been no difficulty in that regard.  Usually you will find that there is some teacher near retiring and that there is automatically a vacancy. We do not anticipate any difficulty in this regard but there can be no question of any teacher being redundant as a result of this plan.  This will not happen and we will get much better use of the teaching power available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>No, we do not.  I said there was another aspect to this.  It is the question of transport.  We heard a great deal about transport.  We heard it was bad for the children, bad for their health, bad for them educationally. I am not sure, indeed, if it was not even suggested that it was bad for them morally; it was imposing grave hardship on children, particularly younger children, and causing grave concern to parents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make it quite clear now that I can well understand that people who have no experience of this kind of transport would have genuine reservations and would want to get information. <Col N="1791" /> Whenever I have had the opportunity of dealing with such people, I have endeavoured to give the information at our disposal as a result of the experience we have had.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that we ought to deal with this on the basis of a pilot scheme.  We had a pilot scheme for many a long year in regard to transport and, for many years, the Department has been subsidising transport services to national schools.  We have hundreds of such services all over the country.  We know how they work.  We know that the arguments put forward here do not apply in practice.  Deputy Briscoe was assailed last night as being a city man who knew nothing about rural Ireland.  I have been similarly assailed both inside and outside this House.  The strange thing is that these self-appointed and self-professed experts on rural Ireland, particularly the experts on the educational scene in rural Ireland, either do not know what is going on in rural Ireland on the educational scene from the point of view of transport or, if they do know, then they are quite dishonest.  If they do not know, they should stop calling themselves experts; if they do know, they should tell the truth.</P>
    <P>We had some statements here last night on this from Deputy O. J. Flanagan.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>He told us about the terrible dangers and troubles inherent in transport.  I want to draw the attention of the House and of Deputy Flanagan to the fact that there are transport services being operated within his constituency to quite a number of schools.  I will give the names of some of them.  The list is not exhaustive: Camross, two services; Kiladooley, two services; Ballyroan; Castlefleming; Offerlane; Abbeyleix South; Clonenagh; Oxmantown; Charleville; Luggacurren; Rathdowney; Banagher parochial; Moneygall; Bilboa</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1792" /> We heard, too, similar criticisms to those voiced by Deputy Flanagan from Deputy Coogan.  He might like to know&mdash;I assume he does not know it at the moment&mdash;that there are subsidised transport services being operated to national schools in his constituency, some of which are as follows: Eagles Nest; Ballinafad; Ros Cathail; Camus; Caiseal, two services; Letterfrack; Roundstone, two of them; Cornamona, two of them; Clarán.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins also told us about the terrible dangers in transport.  She may like to know that there are transport services, subsidised by the Department of Education, operating to national schools in her constituency, some of which are as follows: Brownsgrove; Mountbellew; Killyan; New Inn; Eyrecourt; Magh Eanaigh; Lehrin, Belclare; Kilnadeema; Aughrim; Killconnell, Corrandulla.</P>
    <P>I want to ask these critics what transport services have they gone to see in operation?  They have spoken of the concern of the parents.  Have they asked them whether they think their children are suffering as a result of this?  Have they asked them why they send their children on this transport? Have they wondered why it is that I regularly receive representations from Deputies of all Parties to extend and improve and create new transport services?</P>
    <P>I challenge any of these critics to get up in public and propose that the Department should abolish these transport services.  Let me say that a number of young children are carried and none of these terrible consequences about which we have been hearing has resulted.  I challenge the Fine Gael Party to put down a motion asking the Department to do away with these transport services.  If these people believe one half of what they said yesterday they have no option but to abolish these transport services because of the terrible injustice and hardship inflicted. If, however, they do not want these transport services to be abolished, then I do not think they can deny to anybody that they did not mean one word of what they said.  They cannot have it both ways.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1793" /> There is an obligation on anybody who professes to want to discuss this matter seriously, who professes to be interested in the welfare of our children, to examine the facts.  These transport services are operating all over the country and people can find out for themselves how they operate. If they want to criticise a transport service on the basis that they know there are defects, on facts they have and can talk about, that is one thing. But nobody did that.  They told us about all the theoretical defects in these services.  They made no effort whatever to rely on any facts, for the good reason, of course, that they know these services operate quite satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>What concerns me in all this is the fact that there are parents who will be involved in sending their children on these transport services, who have no experience and no knowledge of the services; all their fears are being played on by irresponsible people who are either ignorant of what is going on in the educational sphere in rural Ireland or who, knowing the truth, deliberately conceal it.  It is time the people, particularly the people of rural Ireland, the future of whose children is at stake, realised the kind of tactics being used to oppose this policy.  It is time they realised that their natural doubts and reservations are being deliberately played upon and fanned, not out of any regard for their children but for motives, motives about which one may speculate.</P>
    <P>I want to assure such parents that our experience in operating hundreds of services all over the country over a long number of years has been quite satisfactory.  None of the terrible things we were told about has happened. We have never had any complaints. Children involved in these transport services are out in the weather much less than if they were walking to school.  They are home earlier than they would be if they were walking from school.  Young children remain back in the school playing but under the supervision of the teacher and go home with their older brothers and sisters.  Every effort is <Col N="1794" /> made to organise the transport service to pick up children at points as convenient as possible to their homes. They do not have to assemble at the site of the old school, as was suggested, and the vast majority are out from home less and they are out in the weather less.</P>
    <P>What is the difference between the transport services we have been operating for years and the ones which will operate as a result of an amalgamation of schools?  The difference will be that the ones operating in the case of amalgamation of schools will be completely free while the others involve a reasonably substantial local contribution. They operate in exactly the same way otherwise.  Everything that can be done should be done to expose the hypocrisy in regard to the criticism of transport services by people who should know better, and, if they do not, they have the obligation to find out the facts.  I trust that Deputy Flanagan and his colleagues, if they believe one half of what they said about these transport services, will go to the parents of the schemes being operated in their constituencies and tell them they believe that in the interests of their children these schemes should be stopped.  Let them see what reaction they get.  They will find out then what parents think of having their children transported to school.</P>
    <P>Deputy Jones referred to my speech in introducing my Estimate in which I suggested the setting up of an advisory body and he said he thought that I intended to refer this problem of smaller schools to such an advisory body.  However, he did not advert to the fact that when I was introducing that Estimate and talking about this, I said that one of the reasons I wanted to set up such an advisory body was this&mdash;I am quoting from the English translation of what I said:</P>
    <P>There does arise a certain difficulty in relation to consultation, for consulting with a large number of bodies.... must inevitably give rise to heartbreaking delays. </P>
    <P>One of the heartbreaking delays is exemplified in the fact that this <Col N="1795" /> advisory body has not yet been set up. I communicated with all the bodies concerned and most of them have replied stating that they are willing and happy to take part in it.  However, I have not received replies fully from all the bodies yet, and this is the reason this body has not been set up. I will concede freely to Deputy Jones that, on re-reading what I said, I find it is possible to interpret it in the way he interpreted it.  I do not think it is necessary to interpret it that way but it is possible to do so.  It was not intended by me to wait until this body was set up and then to refer this problem of smaller schools to them, because I believe the matter is urgent and vitally urgent.</P>
    <P>I believe the case for the policy I am pursuing is clearly established. I believe that it is self-evident if one starts off on the basis of what is in the best interests of our children and in the best interests of nobody else, or is this going to hurt the feelings of people who went to school there themselves, whose parents went to school there and who want their children to go to the school?  I understand that.  I do not decry it, but I cannot put this before the welfare of our children.  I must go ahead as a matter of urgency to put this policy into effect if I am to discharge my duty to the children of this country, particularly those of rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>The suggestion that we should embark on pilot schemes in regard to this is attractive enough in theory, but in practice what does it mean?  It means that in most places we are going to have to replace one- and two-teacher schools.  We are not going to go ahead and build new ones until&mdash; I do not think it is unfair to say&mdash; the most reactionary elements in our community eventually see the benefits of this policy.  In the meantime we are going to have built, perhaps, some hundreds of small schools, certainly 100 small schools, which must be carried on over some generations.  The children attending these schools are going to be condemned to an inferior education and, with the developments that are taking place, the gap will <Col N="1796" /> tend to widen as time goes on between education available in small and larger schools.  I am not prepared to condemn these children to these conditions in order to pacify the most reactionary elements of the community.  If anybody feels that an injustice is being done to these children by moving them to a school within a few miles of the school they are attending, an injustice such as would counterbalance any advantages involved in attending larger schools, the onus is on such people to prove it and to convince the public that this is so.  This has not been done.</P>
    <P>It has been alleged that in closing these schools we are removing children from a rural environment into an urban environment.  This is not so in the vast majority of cases, but there may be exceptions.  There are a small number of exceptions where there is a school which is due to be closed and which is within a couple of miles of a town or a village, the next school to it being perhaps eight or ten miles away.  In these cases it is not possible to avoid bringing the children in, but, remember, we are talking about children attending a school within about two miles of a town.  Are we to imagine that they never go into that town, that they are never influenced in any way by that environment?  On the other hand, we had a school that was due to be closed within two miles of a town but there was another school about three miles further out into the country to which the children could be moved.  We proposed to do that and I was accused of moving them further out into the country away from the amenities that should be available to them.  Whichever way we go, there will be objections.  My policy is to avoid bringing children from rural schools into town areas in any case where this is possible and that is the vast majority of cases.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of this that deserves to be mentioned and it is that teachers benefit usually quite considerably from the fact that they are in contact daily with colleagues and can discuss their problems as teachers with them.  Clearly this is not possible for a teacher in a one-teacher school and it is limited in two-teacher <Col N="1797" /> schools.  This is an advantage which should not be overlooked but I want to make quite clear that most of the one-teacher schools are in remote areas&mdash;not all, but most of them&mdash;and that some of them find it extremely difficult or impossible to get trained teachers.  They get somebody who has passed the Leaving Certificate, but has no training as a teacher, on a temporary basis.  They cannot even hold them and they change from month to month almost and are left for periods without any teacher.</P>
    <P>I think it was mentioned by Deputy Jones that in some of these areas it is difficult to keep the younger teachers, that the principal teacher is usually settled, living in the area.  I may be wronging Deputy Jones&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Some Deputy on the Fine Gael side said this and that particularly the young teachers wanted to move off to Galway city and perhaps attend the university and so on.  The case was made that if you close a school like that and transfer to another, the man who is settled and living in the area will not be prepared to travel to the new school and that you will lose him.  You will have a turnover in younger teachers in any case but it was suggested you would lose the settled men also.  This seems to me to be a misreading of the situation. We are talking about relatively short distances.  I cannot see a teacher established in such an area getting out simply because he has to travel three or four miles to school whereas formerly he could walk across the road. If the younger teachers are going to keep moving, surely the damage caused by this turnover is going to be less in the larger school than in the small one?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am particularly pleased that the controversy over this policy seems to have produced an unprecedented concern with the rights of parents because I have been for a long time advocating the rights of parents in Irish education. I have felt, and I have said so in public, that deliberate efforts were <Col N="1798" /> made to exclude parents from education, and if this controversy does nothing else but forward the rights of parents in education, it will have done a lot of good.  There is talk about consulting parents but nobody seems to advert to the fact that we have no system which enables us to consult parents.  I shall deal with that later but I want to draw attention to that fact.</P>
    <P>Some suggestions were made that the report <i>Investment in Education</i> had said that in the working out of new strategies, pilot areas should be selected.  I think this is a misreading of the report and that this is certainly not suggested in regard to the question of closing small schools.  The word &ldquo;strategy&rdquo; has a different and somewhat technical meaning in operation in research and I think it is in this sense it is used in the report.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I to infer from that that strategy is used as a term dealing with economic investigations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I have already spoken about the transport provided under this scheme being free.  I want to make it absolutely clear that it will be free to the children and the parents and it should not be confused with the ordinary system of transport which, as I said, has been in operation for many years and which does require a local contribution.</P>
      <P>Deputy Briscoe gave a quotation from President Kennedy which is quite apt and applicable to us and cannot be repeated too often, to the effect that the progress of a nation can be no swifter than its progress in education. We should all remember this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins urged that the west of Ireland should be excluded from this policy.  Did she realise the implication of that plea? In saying that, she was, to my mind, urging that the west of Ireland should be excluded from any improvements we can make in our educational system.  Does she honestly think that if the rest of the country had almost exclusively three-teacher or larger schools and was getting the benefit of transport services, the west of Ireland <Col N="1799" /> would be satisfied with the situation, that this is what they want?  Does she not know that they would feel they were being deprived, even if she does not accept this as I do, of the educational benefits of this policy?  If she considers the matter, I do not think she could seriously continue with that plea.  As far as I am concerned, since there is a heavy concentration of these small schools in the west of Ireland, the need for this policy is greatest in the West and the children there are most in need of the benefits which we can confer on them.  That is what I intend to do.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lindsay said that he thought it a pity that education should become a matter of controversy.  I agree with him in one way but in another I do not because, first, we all know that if progress is to be made in any sphere, it inevitably provokes controversy. Secondly, in so far as we have controversy in education, it means that people are taking an interest in education and inevitably are learning more about it.  In this country such a development could only be a welcome one.  We have suffered far too much in the past from a lack of interest in and an apathy towards education.</P>
    <P>There has been some talk about the obligation on different people to speak out on this matter and on Deputies to represent the views of their constituents, all of which statements are quite true, but I wonder has much thought been given to the obligation which rests on me as Minister for Education to do what I believe to be right and what I believe to be in the best interests of our children.  Being firmly convinced of that, is it suggested that because opposition appears and pressure is brought to bear, I should deviate from what I believe to be right?  I have an obligation, too, and I intend to discharge it.  Deputy Lindsay said that the closing of one-teacher schools was a recognition of the depopulation of the West.  This is true. It is a factor, but it is time we faced facts and realised that the kind of organisation as regards schools and other things which was suitable to the West 100 years ago is not necessarily <Col N="1800" /> the best type of organisation today with a much smaller population and a higher standard of living.</P>
    <P>There are, of course, other factors in this as I have mentioned earlier, the complete change in the conditions as regards roads and the standard of education now expected.  The plea has been made that we should maintain a rural bias as far as possible in rural schools.  I entirely agree with that.  I do not feel that we are doing enough in that direction but I think that a positive approach to it is within the school itself.  I should like again to plead that we keep this thing in perspective and not talk about changing the whole environment of the children because we move them a distance of four miles or so within their own parish.  This kind of exaggeration is of no help in trying to see all the very serious problems involved for us in giving our children the best educational system we can afford.</P>
    <P>Somebody raised the question of insurance in regard to transport.  I want to make it clear that there is full insurance and that that is part of the cost which is covered.  Deputy Lindsay said he thought some of the difficulty in this matter might have been caused by the fact that I met only some of the Hierarchy and not all of them. Now, I do not want to bring the Hierarchy into this debate at all as was done by some other speaker, but since Deputy Lindsay said this, I feel I should make it clear that I have already disclosed in public and explained why I felt at liberty to disclose that I had received a letter from the Hierarchy and I quoted what I said was the key sentence from it.  That sentence makes it clear that there is no question of the Hierarchy being opposed to this question in principle. It is unthinkable that one should say that each case should be considered on its merits and at the same time, be opposed to it in principle.  The two things do not go together.  I am not quite sure, however, what Deputy Lindsay had in mind but I want to make it clear in so far as I have met a deputation from the Hierarchy that the composition of such deputations, in my view, is a matter for the Hierarchy <Col N="1801" /> and nobody else.  I do not think it is a matter for me, for Deputy Lindsay or anybody else other than the Hierarchy to comment on the make-up of any such deputation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Burton repeated an argument which has come up from time to time, that the closing of a school will result in a depreciation in the value of property in the area.  I find it difficult to take this argument seriously, but since apparently it is put forward seriously, I should like to point out that surely if one is advertising property for sale as being near church and schools, then one is no worse off if one says that it is near a church and that free transport is available to the school.  As I said, I find it difficult to take this argument seriously.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gilhawley made what I thought was a reasonable speech. Naturally, I suppose I thought that because he was agreeing with me, but he is a principal of a two-teacher school and it is of some significance in the circumstances of this debate, with his Party taking the line they did, that he as a principal of a two-teacher school, should take the line he did.  He spoke of the social value of schools in a rural community.  It seems to me that there is a good deal of&mdash; putting it at its best&mdash;wooly thinking about this.  I should like to ask Deputies how many rural schools or what proportion of them are used for any community purposes other than the holding of the school?  Do we not know that the vast majority of them are not used for any other purpose? But where such schools are used for community purposes, this would be a factor that we would take into account in assessing whether a school should be closed.</P>
    <P>If we close a school, this does not mean that we demolish the building. The building will still be there and available for community purposes.  It is said that this is not the same thing, that the teacher has gone and that the teacher was the focal point.  As I say, I have been accused of not knowing anything about rural Ireland, but I know this much, that more and more <Col N="1802" /> what is happening is that the teacher drives up in the morning, opens the school, conducts the school during the day and is gone immediately afterwards. This is happening on a widespread scale and developing more and more, and it is inevitable.  I do not blame the teachers at all.  They are entitled, if they feel they can have greater amenities for themselves and their families in an urban area, to have them.  However, we must recognise that this is a fact of life in rural Ireland today and not try to fool ourselves by talking about the teacher and the local school being the focal point when in many cases this is not true and is becoming increasingly less true as time goes on.</P>
    <P>I wonder whether, when Deputy Lindsay was talking about transport, he felt it was a greater hardship on young children to have to walk two or three miles to school in the rain, and perhaps sit in damp clothes than to be carried by bus for a distance of four or five miles?  It seems to me it is something that very few of the children or parents concerned would agree with, all the more particularly when they see this in operation.  Our experience has been that, when this kind of scheme has been operated, within a short time we have had proposals from the adjoining parish for amalgamation and free transport.  There is some significance in this.  I venture to suggest that, as the policy we are implementing begins to be demonstrated, the problem we are going to have in the Department, and the problem Deputies opposite will have, is that of being inundated with requests for amalgamation and free transport.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lindsay spoke about Ballymacola national school.  This is a one-teacher school in very bad condition. It has 29 on the roll.  The average attendance is 20, about 60 per cent. The normal percentage for attendance is between 85 and 90 per cent.  If Deputy Lindsay lived in that area and if his children were dependent on Ballymacola national school for their education, he would do his damnedest to get me to close that school within 24 hours.  I want to urge that we should <Col N="1803" /> approach this problem by reference to the standards we want for our own children and not the standards that are held up to us as being quite suitable for the children of rural Ireland.  If we would not be satisfied with them for our own children, we should not be satisfied with them for the children of rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>I want to conclude by referring to the Fine Gael attitude on this whole matter.  I sympathise very sincerely with Deputy Jones in this position.  He is a man for whom I have the very highest regard.  When he was making his speech on this matter, I felt&mdash;this may have been imagination on my part&mdash;that he was embarrassed.  If he was embarrassed, it does not surprise me.  Indeed, it would surprise me if he were not.</P>

      <P>Good; I am disappointed that the Deputy was not.  My opinion of him was somewhat higher.  The position is that Deputy Dillon, as Leader of the Fine Gael Party, repeatedly advocated the policy we are pursuing and no member of the Fine Gael Party ever repudiated this.  Then Deputy Dillon ceased to be Leader of the Fine Gael Party.  When I spoke about this matter on July 21st last and said we were going ahead with it, we had some discussion here in the House.  Deputy Meaney has referred to this, but I think it will bear repeating.  Having outlined what we were doing, I ended up by saying, at column 1969 of Volume 217:</P>
      <P>I do not think I need dwell further on that matter, except again to appeal to Deputies, when the objections come, as they will, to remember that the educational interests of the children concerned are involved and not to allow sentiment to stand in the way. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A little further on in the next column, column 1970.  Deputy P. O'Donnell, the former spokesman for the Fine <Col N="1804" /> Gael Party on education, said:</P>
    <P>This is what Fine Gael have advocated on many occasions, as the Minister has pointed out.</P>
    <P>Mr. Colley: Deputy Dillon pointed it out, as Leader of the Party.</P>
    <P>Mr. P. O'Donnell: I did, too.  We will always find the individual school and have no option but to make representations when requested but the policy adumbrated by the Minister is one that Fine Gael have been advocating.</P>
    <P>Mr. Colley: I feel that I will have the full support of Deputy O'Donnell in any such case.</P>
    <P>Mr. P. O'Donnell: You certainly will. </P>
    <P>When those statements were made, Deputy Jones, the present Fine Gael spokesman on education, was present sitting beside Deputy O'Donnell and he did not attempt to repudiate them then or since until quite recently.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I grant the Deputy that, but I am afraid it is not good enough to say, as Deputy Jones said yesterday in response to an interjection from this side of the House, that this was not Party policy but merely a statement of personal opinion.  If the Leader of a Party repeatedly advocates a policy and if a front-bench member, a former spokesman on education, sitting beside the present spokesman on education, repeats that as being Party policy, what is anybody to accept but that it is Party policy?</P>

      <P>The winter edition of <i>Studies</i> for 1965 contains a review of the Report <i>Investment in Education</i> by Senator Garret FitzGerald, who is, I understand, a front-bench member of the Fine Gael group in the Seanad. Indeed, it is no secret that he contributes considerably to the formulation of Fine Gael policy.  On page 372 of that edition of <i>Studies</i> he says, having reviewed this Report:</P>
      <P>The case against these small schools on economic and educational grounds is thus a powerful one, especially when account is taken of the information given on the poor facilities and narrower range of subject offered in these small schools and above all of the possibility of releasing several thousand badly needed teachers to improve teacher/pupil ratios in the larger schools, if the small schools were gradually closed as they become obsolete. </P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I want to make quite clear is that there can be no doubt as to what the Fine Gael policy was in this matter in July, 1965. There may be a little doubt, but not much, as to what it was around Christmas last when this appeared but suddenly we find that there is a change.  I was not quite sure, when I listened to Deputy Jones, just what the change was.  It seemed to me that he and some speakers who followed him were trying to have both sides of the argument. I do not fault him for that, if he can get away with it: it is very satisfactory for a political Party to be <Col N="1806" /> able to do that.  It seemed to me that he was not directly opposing the policy: on the other hand, he certainly was not agreeing with it.  But, then, subsequent speakers, particularly Deputy O. J. Flanagan, made it quite clear that the line was total opposition to this policy.</P>
      <P>There was some suggestion from Deputy Jones, Deputy Lindsay and, I think, some others, that there should be a full local inquiry before schools close.  I do not know whether the Fine Gael Party just thought this up as a gimmick and said it out without thinking of its implications or whether they thought out the implications and, having done so, wisely decided not to talk about them.  The House will notice that no member of the Fine Gael Party went any further.  He did not endeavour to spell out what he meant. I should like to endeavour to spell it out a little further to see what would be meant.</P>
      <P>First of all, who is to be the person to conduct such an inquiry?  On what basis is the decision to be made?  Is the situation to be that all the parents of the children at a particular school decide for or against or that the majority of them decide it?  Presumably it is obvious to the Fine Gael Party, if this is any more than a gimmick, that any question of amalgamation involves at least two schools, very often more. The case I mentioned earlier of an area with 11 schools, 15 teachers and 225 pupils would clearly be one where six or more schools might be involved. If the parents in one school say: &ldquo;We want it&rdquo;, and the parents in another school say: &ldquo;We do not want it&rdquo;, what is supposed to happen then?  Is it seriously suggested that anybody could run an educational system on that kind of basis?  I am not sure whether this was put forward as a gimmick or whether, the implications having been thought out, they were wisely left unsaid.  The Fine Gael Party cannot be serious in putting this forward or they would have spelled it out in more detail and told us the view they would take on some of these questions I have raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1807" /> I feel that the attitude of the Fine Gael Party on this policy requires some little thought to get the correct description of it.  I have heard various words used to describe it.  I have heard the word &ldquo;contemptible&rdquo; used.  I myself think the most appropriate adjective or epithet is &ldquo;pathetic&rdquo;.  We have this situation that their policy was fixed and publicly announced, presumably because they believed it was in the best interests of the children, and suddenly, when some pressure comes on, they scurry like rats for cover.  This is not the first time the Fine Gael Party have been known to scurry for cover.</P>
    <P>The efforts of the Fine Gael Party in the past have not induced confidence in many people.  Some people had, I think, hoped that, under new leadership, there might be a different approach.  But, unfortunately for the Fine Gael Party, this seems to be an inherent weakness in the Party and as long as this exists, they cannot ever hope to gain the confidence of the Irish people.  How can they expect people to have confidence in a Party which adumbrates a policy, to quote Deputy P. O'Donnell, clearly and unequivocally and suddenly runs for cover when pressure comes on?  Did they believe it to be in the interests of the children or did they not?  Where do the interests of the children come in now?</P>
    <P>I feel that there is an element of calculation of short-term political advantage involved here possibly also and again, as they have done in the past, I think the Fine Gael Party have miscalculated on this.  Not alone have they demonstrated once more their inability to deserve the confidence of the people but I think they have also miscalculated in that, as I said earlier, their problem in the future will be that so many of their constituents will be looking for the implementation of this policy rather than the opposite. I can assure them that, when that time comes, I do not intend&mdash;and I doubt if any member of my Party intends&mdash; to let the people forget the line which was adopted by the Fine Gael Party on this matter.  I doubt, as I say, if, <Col N="1808" /> in these circumstances, the Fine Gael Party have made the right political calculation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>We can discuss it later. One other matter that the Minister may care to comment on is in regard to the area where he mentions seven schools and 15 teachers, that the normal average staffing regulations are that a five-teacher school could carry 192 to 264 pupils; a six-teacher school could carry 245 to 319 pupils and a three-teacher school could carry 80 to 139 pupils.  Would the Minister care to say what might happen to the teachers over and above the number required? Would they be kept on a diocesan panel or moved elsewhere from the diocese or to other parts of the country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

      <P>After a long debate on housing, this is not the time to go into any great detail or to speak at any great length but in relation to the motion put down by members of my Party, I wish to make some comment.</P>
      <P>From the days when Deputy John A. Costello was Taoiseach there was a great divergence of opinion between the Fianna Fáil Party and the Fine Gael Party in relation to the provision of housing.  The Fine Gael Party felt that this was investment of a productive nature and that, in fact, the setting up of industrial projects to employ people and the adaptation of existing industries depended not only on the investment to be made in the industry itself, not only on the opportunity for profit, but also on the proper housing of the employees therein and the provision of this housing as quickly as possible and in a way that would encourage the proper type of employee to make himself available for such undertakings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Divergence of view resulted because the Fianna Fáil Party always believed that when money got scarce or in time of crisis one of the things that could be reduced and cut down in size as far as employment was concerned was the housing industry.  Of course, in the short term, politically the Fianna Fáil Party in this regard are probably right in their view because it is possible to cut down the housing industry to size in times of crisis because the workers therein are divided into two classes.  There are the people who have a craft or a trade and who can usually emigrate and get a job somewhere else and they are invisible as far as unemployment figures in Ireland are concerned. There are the labourers who are accustomed to sudden knocking-off in times when a building may be finished or when there is a financial crisis.  Building labourers will move <Col N="1813" /> from one job to another, from one employer to another, and accept this as part of their way of life.  They do not like it but they know they must accept it.</P>
    <P>We in the Fine Gael Party hold that there should be a constant and planned building programme and that this should not fall down because of any financial crisis or any political situation. If forward planning had been done by the Government and if the budgets, not only for 12 months, but for years ahead had been considered by the Cabinet, it would not have been necessary in the years after 1957 to reduce house building, and disemploy many people, who emigrated, and leave so many of our people without the houses, without which they also will emigrate.</P>
    <P>Our young people of today are somewhat different from even those of ten years ago.  Liverpool is quite close and with a £5 note in your pocket, you can be there in the morning and have something left over for bed and breakfast.  This means that when we talk about the employment of our people, the expansion of industry, about the people being happily employed on the land, we must also think in terms of houses.  I believe that Fianna Fáil have not done their job in this regard and did not think about housing in the proper light and that, in consequence, there has been considerable emigration.  The Fine Gael line that housing is an integral part of the creation of jobs, of capital formation and the employment of our people on the land is correct and Fine Gael are also correct when they say that housing is absolutely necessary for the forward movement of the nation.</P>
    <P>The old pattern of the Fianna Fáil approach to housing was followed in the years following the crisis of 1957. The publication <i>Housing Progress and Prospects</i> of November, 1954 gives figures in Appendix I on page 36 which show how this old pattern was followed.  In the crisis year of 1957, the number of houses built was 10,969. In 1958, when Fianna Fáil undoubtedly had a financial crisis to deal with, they followed the old pattern and one <Col N="1814" /> way of dealing with their problem was to reduce the number of houses built. That is a simple thing to do.  In 1958, the number built was 7,480; in 1959, it was 4,894; in 1960, it was 5,992; in 1961, it was 5,798; in 1962, it was 5,626; in 1963, 6,867; and in 1964, 7,431.</P>
    <P>The old Manchester school of economics obtruded itself here.  This was a big factor in the emigration figures over that period.  Not only did the Government refuse to give sufficient money for new houses to local authorities at that time but they did something else; they produced a line of thought which for political purposes and to a superficial observer might seem to be the proper one.  They said that the stock of houses should be preserved and that where reconstruction was possible, there would be no question of rehousing.</P>
    <P>They dragged in section 19 of the Local Government Act of 1931 whereby a person who is living in a house in bad condition could be told to reconstruct it.  If that person refused to do this, the landlord could be made do it and if he refused, the local authority could go in, raise a loan, reconstruct the house and place the repayment on the landlord.  This would seem to the superficial observer to be the proper thing to do in time of financial crisis but to one with my experience of urban and rural housing, this was disastrous.  My constituency is practically evenly divided between urban and rural areas and I am aware that this policy resulted in houses with mud walls being adjudged as houses from which people should not be put into new houses.  These houses were never reconstructed because no county council engineer or anybody else could attempt to reconstruct them.</P>
    <P>The figures for houses reconstructed during the period I have mentioned are also given in <i>Housing Progress and Prospects.</i>  In 1957, the number was 8,147; in 1958, it was 7,167; in 1959, it was 7,202; in 1960, it was 8,207; in 1961, it was 9,744; in 1962, it was 8,989; in 1963, it was 9,961; and in 1964, it was 10,107.  All during the period until 1964 the number of houses <Col N="1815" /> reconstructed did not rise by any remarkable figure.  That policy of Fianna Fáil was a failure and the failure was a further reason why our people did not build new houses and did not stay in the country as they should have done.</P>
    <P>In 1965, through extreme pressure on the Minister, largely by myself, we have had a large number of houses being built in Drogheda and Dundalk but at the present moment there are young men and women who have been married for four or five years, with three children, living in one room in Drogheda and Dundalk.  This is not due to the Government's mistakes of last year but to the mistakes made since 1957 because Fianna Fáil believed that in a time of crisis the thing they could cut was housing.</P>
    <P>In the next few days we will be considering a Supplementary Estimate for the Department of Industry and Commerce which contains a sum of £5,000 for an industrial survey of Drogheda.  That happened because in the NIEC Report there was discussion on the problem as to why industrialists could not get workers at a time when there was a large number on the live register of unemployment.  When that survey is produced we will find that one of the reasons why industry could not get workers is that the workers could not get houses.  The Minister, in one of the best things he has done, has provided for housing for executives of industry through the National Building Agency.  These houses are built by their own firm through grants provided by the Agency which has its own staff of architects, engineers and the rest.  The houses are built and handed over to the firms for the use of their executives.</P>
    <P>If that is the position for executives of industry who have much larger salaries, how much more should it be the position for the unfortunate workers on the floor?  I want to suggest to the Government that one of their big failures was that in their efforts to expand employment in the Second Programme, which in any case is only a set of target figures, in their efforts <Col N="1816" /> to expand employment in industry and agriculture, they have failed because they did not in time produce a similar programme of expansion in houses. This is one of the Government's big failures, a failure that is not isolated from general Government policy, a failure that has inter-related with it the duty of the Opposition in this House to point out to the Government and to the people these failures and mistakes.</P>
    <P>It would be churlish of me if I did not say that one of the best things the Minister has done was the setting up of the National Building Agency. It would also be churlish of me if I did not say that the small farmers grant was a good thing.  As a result of that, the small farmer who is eligible is being given money for the reconstruction of houses in rural areas and to build his own house at a lower cost than if he were provided with a county council larger-type house or cottage. This gives a man the opportunity of being master of his own house and, so to speak, in his own castle from the very first day, provided that accommodation is built where he wants it.</P>
    <P>There is a certain restriction.  Farm workers who may have had a bit of cash because other members of the family have gone into employment may have difficulty in getting sites.  That is a precluding factor in a number of cases.  It is always wise to give credit where credit is due; this is one of the best things Fianna Fáil have done and I sincerely hope the position will not be changed at any stage because of exigency.  The unfortunate thing is that, so long as Fianna Fáil remain in office, bad housekeeping will be the order of the day and there will, therefore, be future exigency.</P>
    <P>I do not want to delay the House, but this motion is absolutely essential. It arises out of the evidence every Deputy has in relation to his own constituency.  In Louth there are people who have been waiting six and seven years for county council cottages.  We have had this hold-up because of the 1957 delay and this whole policy has infiltrated into county managers and their officials and even into county councillors.  I am the only county <Col N="1817" /> councillor living outside Drogheda town and my position is that I have not got a site from Tullyallen to Baltray on which a house could be built for a farm worker.  Two years ago we could not get sites.  I proposed that we should move for compulsory acquisition. Nothing happened.  Then I said: &ldquo;Right; we will have to do something about this.  I will give the sites.  They may not be in the right place, but it is a good field and they would be good sites.  I will give it at the price.&rdquo;  I was told houses could not be built on the site because it was not near a church or a school. Two friends of mine had actually been considering building private houses on this site.  All this has resulted because of the intricacies involved and the things that have been perpetrated upon an unsuspecting public from the point of view of delay.</P>
    <P>I charge the Fianna Fáil Party and the Minister with causing delay in that area.  I see young married people living in hovels and I hope that these young people will remember; it is my job to make sure they do.  I wish the Minister would do now what the Minister for Education did, namely, check on statements made by this side of the House and find out whether they are right or wrong, find out whether, in fact, an excellent site was refused and whether anybody believes this is anything other than deliberate delay on the part of the Government, a Government who subscribe to the Manchester school of economics theory that when you have not got the money, the one thing you can stop, and get away with, is housing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I should like to point out that on two occasions recently I have heard a statement made&mdash;the second occasion a few moments ago when Deputy Donegan was speaking&mdash;which I should like to take this opportunity of correcting. Deputy Donegan gave the impression&mdash; perhaps he did not mean to do so&mdash; that there is a shortage of labour in Drogheda and employers are finding it difficult to get people to work in factories.  That statement has done a great deal of harm.  It was made on an <Col N="1818" /> earlier occasion by a man who is not actually in public life, but who is, like Deputy Donegan, a public figure.  It is wrong that that impression should be created.  The impression is that employees in Drogheda should be confined to the town.  There are enough borders in the country without building another one around Drogheda for the purpose of keeping those in the country districts, who need employment, out of the town.  Deputy Donegan and others like him should remember that.</P>
      <P>There are two matters involved here &mdash;the Housing Bill, 1965, and the Fine Gael motion.  The Housing Bill we have discussed pretty thoroughly already.  The Bill is not as perfect as it should be, but there are certain provisions which should improve prospects generally.  In sections 16 and 17 the date of operation is given as 1st July, 1965.  I appeal once more to the Minister to make that 1st October, 1964, as it is in other sections of the Bill.  It is a mistake to have two different dates and the Minister should make sure that he does not adversely affect the small number of people who will be affected if the date is July, 1965.</P>
      <P>When we were discussing the Bill on the last occasion, the question of the vesting of labourers' cottages arose. By means of amendments Nos. 106 and 107, which the Minister subsequently withdrew, the Minister attempted to have a certain change made.  I thought that change would adversely affect the right of a vesting tenant to have his house properly repaired, and the Minister withdrew the amendments.  Would the Minister go a bit further?  If he wants the amendments included, would he introduce them in the Seanad, but leaving out any reference to structural condition? It is to that reference that I object.  If he is not prepared to do that, I should prefer him to leave the Bill as it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to housing in general and to the motion before the House, the important thing is to remember that, as the years go by, more and more houses are needed.  There are two reasons for this: one is that some houses, due to age, are no longer fit for habitation and the second is rising <Col N="1819" /> standards.  People require a better standard of housing than they did 20 and 30 years ago.  In the past seven or eight months, particularly since last July, there has been a complete hold-up in housing.  That is a situation the Minister should now attempt to rectify. When the credit squeeze was introduced, the first thing affected was the housing programme.  I can give the Minister&mdash;I have done so on a number of occasions by way of question&mdash; certain aspects of housing in my own constituency.  To begin with, we require at the present moment approximately 145 rural cottages.  We have screened sites.  We have reached the stage at which quite a number have been put out for tender, but no houses can be started unless we get money from the Department.  The Minister made it pretty clear last week that any money available will be money for the year 1966-67 and that we cannot expect any money before the 31st March this year.</P>
    <P>Secondly, there is the question of group grants.  We have groups in Old-castle, Athboy, Duleek and Laytown. We are ready in almost every case to start work and we find we cannot start, first, because we have not got the money we require to develop the sites and, secondly, because there is no point in trying to start even if we had them developed, because the money does not seem to be available.  Again I presume the Minister will make an announcement for the 1966-67 financial year which may or may not include money for that type of work.</P>
    <P>These are all people who are in urgent need of rehousing.  All those on the list are people for whom the Meath County Council have responsibility to find accommodation and find it quickly. Some of them have been a number of years on the list; others have only come on it within the past 12 or 18 months, but all of them are living in either condemned or overcrowded conditions and must be rehoused.  Would the Minister not agree that it is unfair that the county council should be told that the matter is under consideration and kept under consideration month after month?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1820" /> With reference to Slane, where it was proposed to build a group of 12 houses over a year ago, the Department approved of certain lay-out plans and subsequently decided that some of the things suggested in the plans did not fit in with the old-world style of Slane village, and bit by bit, at intervals of several months, they communicated with the county council until eventually they agreed to sanction, on certain conditions, four houses where 12 were urgently needed.  Does the Minister think that is the way to deal with a rural housing obligation?  If four houses would have been sufficient, would the local authority not have suggested four sites at the start, and not 12?  I agree we should try to beautify our countryside and keep it beautiful. However, I do not think there is anything more beautiful than a decent house for a working man where he can live in comfort with his family.  It is a great mistake to suggest there should be open spaces in an area like Slane where there are thousands of acres of woodland, fields and a river around the village.  To suggest that it was necessary, in order to make the scheme work properly, that there should be open spaces within the village is ridiculous.</P>
    <P>To come to the question of SDA loans, Meath County Council started a campaign a few years ago to try to persuade people to avail of the loans and grants to rehouse themselves.  The scheme was very successful and quite a number of people availed of it.  The Minister made reference yesterday to the practice which grew up of people presupposing that they would, in the normal way, qualify for a loan and proceeding with a house without having it cleared.  That was the practice in Meath, and in every case the grant from the Department and the supplementary grant from the county council was subsequently paid, and if the SDA loan was required, it was applied for and was paid to the people who were building the houses.  This did mean that in many cases the county council had not to build houses for people who were badly housed but were able to encourage these people to build their own houses.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1821" /> Last year, 1965, many houses were built but towards the middle of the year it was found that money was becoming short for loan purposes. This was not a question of grant.  This was a question of loan money which would be repaid in full and the Department found they had not got the money and started easing off.  I agree that a certain amount of responsibility must fall on the county council because they had promised money to people who subsequently were not as fast at taking advantage of the money as they should have been.  The result was that there was between £30,000 and £40,000 on hand, but it was bespoken to people who were in process of erecting their houses.  Subsequently applications was made to the Minister's Department for another £100,000 for SDA loans.  At that time Meath County Council had applications amounting to £94,500 in their files in relation to the money which they had already promised.  When the Minister received in September last the application for the loan, he acknowledged it.  He acknowledged every telephone call and every letter, and the matter was under consideration.  Until last week it was still under consideration and then the Minister gave a further advance of £30,000 and stated in an accompanying letter that that was the amount which was going to be advanced this year, giving as his reason that it was the quarterly average which was being spent by Meath County Council and stating that no further advance would be made until 1966-67.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister appreciates what this means but I shall try to explain to him.  Meath County Council, having in their files applications for £95,400 in respect of SDA loans and having got £30,000, have a balance of £65,400 which normally would be due to people who are building their houses.  If the Minister does not give any more money until after 1st April, it means that that £65,400 is already spent before the next financial year comes in, and we know what that will mean to next year's housing programme.  I know one cannot get blood from a turnip.  If the money is <Col N="1822" /> not there the Minister cannot give it to us.  However, this situation was brought about because Government Ministers and, in particular, the Minister for Local Government, in this House insisted until a very short time ago that there was adequate money available for housing.  Anybody who asked me or any other public representative in Meath County Council what was the situation was told: &ldquo;The Minister has given us an assurance that there was no shortage of money for housing.&rdquo;  The result was that these people went ahead with their plans, and nobody can blame them if they come back to us and say: &ldquo;You told us there was money for housing&rdquo; and it is cold comfort for us to say: &ldquo;The Minister for Local Government told us the money was there&rdquo; because apparently it is not there.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister has made up his mind that the programme for next year is going to be cut and cut drastically, without saying that he is going to do that.  If he agrees to give only the same amount of money as he has given for this financial year, it means that the programme must be cut drastically because there are plans in Meath for £65,400, and goodness knows what the situation is in other counties where there may be very much more than that bespoken by the councils.</P>
    <P>I was under the impression that the Government programme for house building would be expanding year after year and that those who needed houses would be able to build their own houses, particularly under certain sections of this Bill which does give encouragement to people to build who normally would not be prepared to build.  No matter what sections are in the Bill, houses cannot be built without money and if the money is not available, the situation will be bad.  It would have been far better if everybody had faced up to the facts six months ago and let the local authorities be circularised to the effect that the money would not be available.  If the Minister &mdash;he promised to do this some time ago and I hope he will do it&mdash;is now prepared to say the amount of money he proposes to give, not as a first <Col N="1823" /> instalment but the entire amount of money that can be made available to any local authority for the year 1966-67, at least we can be honest with the people seeking loans and say whether or not they can get them.  That is the least we can ask of the Minister and I ask him to do that as quickly as possible.  It gives me no pleasure to raise these matters in the House but because of the not inconsiderable embarrassment caused to myself and other people, I feel it my duty to do this.  If we do not get it cleared up now, it will happen again.</P>
    <P>As regards repairs to houses, I do not quite agree with Deputy Donegan. While there is no doubt the number of houses repaired is not as great as we thought it would be, there has been an increase.  Again, local authorities have been attempting by way of loan to help out with repairs where people wanted to repair their houses but had not enough ready money to do it themselves.  Once again we are up against it because we find in Meath that we are £16,000 short of the money we had promised people who wanted to repair their houses.  We have asked the Minister who has said neither yes nor no.  We have been paying out the supplementary grants to people repairing and to some of those who have been building houses.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether this was accidental or deliberate but over the past six or seven years it has been noticed that Departmental sanction for house-building and repairs seems to be getting slower and slower.  When Departmental sanction does not come, naturally the local authority are not in a position to pay the supplementary grant, and so the poor devil who builds or repairs a house and reaches the stage when he thinks he has finished, and is perhaps being dunned by both contractor and supplier for payment for goods and services, may find he cannot get the grant because the Department's inspector has not approved the house, has not reached it, or perhaps there is a shortage of inspectors or a shortage of staff at O'Connell Bridge House.  He cannot get the supplementary grant because <Col N="1824" /> the Department grant has not been approved and he cannot get the local authority loan because it cannot be paid out until the grant is approved. Again there has been considerable embarrassment caused to decent people who felt that at last they had the opportunity of repairing or building a house for themselves and now find that through no fault of theirs the whole thing is held up.</P>
    <P>The same thing has happened in regard to water and sewerage grants also covered by the Bill, except that in this case a bit of a twist has been put on it.  A few years ago the Department notified local authorities that they were not responsible under SDA loans for grants for water and sewerage schemes and suggested that the council treasurer be approached with a view to obtaining money.  I do not know if it is true of the behaviour of all council treasurers and all banks but my own experience is that if you have plenty of money to your credit, there is no difficulty with the treasurer, but if you happen to hit a hard time and need money, the treasurer is awfully sorry but he cannot oblige.</P>
    <P>I think something must be done because it is too bad that where a local authority may have a substantial credit balance in the bank, earning very small interest, and suddenly require more money than they have to their credit, the treasurer says he is sorry but because of the credit squeeze or because of a dozen and one other things, he is unable to make the money available.  I do not think the Minister can do anything about this.  I wish he could, because I think, since the matter is one which so vitally affects local government, the council may feel that some attempt should be made to get this matter straightened out. I am not suggesting it should be taken in directly under SDA because I suppose they would say they had not got the money.</P>
    <P>This situation is becoming more acute.  At present we are told there is a proposal to plan the building trade and that it should be possible to have it stabilised so that there will not be big fluctuations of employment and no employment, but the industrial <Col N="1825" /> analysis of the live register for mid-January, 1966, gives details of building and contracting and works of construction in the following figures: on 14th January, 1966, on general building and construction and repair work, there were 5,742 males and 20 females unemployed.  I think the Minister will admit that such a number registered as unemployed in a particular trade who should, because of the fact that houses are needed, be in full employment does not reflect much confidence in the building trade.</P>
    <P>Experience has, or should have, taught this country that if a building job closes down and there is no immediate prospect of re-employment, the people concerned will not stay around on the exchange; they will go across to Britain where employment seems to be available for them at short notice.  This aspect of the situation should be remembered by the Government because on a previous occasion, of which the Government are prepared to remind us as often as they possibly can, something similar happened and the building trade operatives left the country and it took many years to get them back again.  I believe if they have to go again, they will not come back because casual employment is no use to a man, particularly a man who can earn a good living across the Irish Sea.</P>
    <P>Perhaps that is what we want: if it is, then we are going the right way about it.  I honestly believe that if the Minister is sincere about the question of houses, he must plan now.  He must let everybody know the amount of money available and in no circumstances must the Government say that there is an amount of money available which subsequently proves to be not available.</P>
    <P>There was a recent increase in SDA loans and while I have heard people saying that 10/- in £100 is not much, nevertheless 10/- in £100 on a number of hundreds of pounds over a 35-year period is quite a substantial sum.  We must make up our minds that housing is so important that there must be a new approach to it.  Some of the continental countries have for a long time operated <Col N="1826" /> a system whereby no grants are made available but instead loans are subsidised and only cost about one-half per cent.  While I am not suggesting to the Minister that this is the solution to his problem, it is a solution worth considering.</P>
    <P>When this whole question of housing is being discussed in this House, many of us are inclined to throw our minds back to the problem of costs.  I should like to know if the Minister has made any attempt to find out if excessive profits are being made from the erection of houses.  It would appear that every time there is an increase in wages which may represent an increase of £20 or £30 per house, the contractor puts on an extra £100 for insurance, just in case he is going to lose out on it.  At present we see local authority houses which two years ago cost £1,200, now costing £1,750, and private houses which are similar to those council houses are being quoted at £2,500 and £3,000.  Even in country districts this situation seems to exist.</P>
    <P>The Minister must make an attempt, as he should be able to do, to find out whether or not the profits on the erection of houses are excessive.  He must also make up his mind that an effort will have to be made to ensure that when grants are given by his Department, or by a local authority, they will assist people building houses and not swell the profits of the contractors. That is another problem which must be faced up to.  The majority of contractors are decent people who are attempting to give good value for money but there are too many sharks in the industry and there are too many who, if they find an unfortunate person badly stuck for a house and needing one built in a hurry, will attempt to collect as much as possible, far more than they are entitled to collect from that person in ordinary honesty.  The Minister should take a hand in this and it should be the easiest thing in the world to find out if excessive profits are being made.  This particularly affects those of small means who are attempting, through SDA loans, to provide houses for themselves.  Finally, I repeat that the Minister must now let the local authorities know what money <Col N="1827" /> is available for next year and he must also attempt to bridge the gap between what they had been promised for this year and what money was made available to them by the Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Tully and Deputy Donegan used a similar phrase in relation to the Minister when they said: &ldquo;If the Minister was serious about the housing situation.&rdquo;  Of course the Minister is serious.  This Bill is one indication of his concern about the housing problem and the defects which existed and which are now being remedied in the Bill.  In addition, he established the National Building Agency which was a further indication of how serious the Minister considered the entire building operations of the country.  That can be further gauged by the fact that he carried out a comprehensive examination of new techniques and developments prior to introducing the Bill to see where local authorities could get better value at a lower cost.  There is also the fact that in regard to housing in Dublin, the Minister, when he found that Dublin Corporation were unable to come to grips with the problem, decided to move in and to have developments carried out and have 3,000 houses built in three years.  Above all Ministers who have handled this problem, he deserves credit for what he has done in a short space of time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am particularly concerned about housing in Dublin city.  Deputy Donegan mentioned some matters in connection with building in Dublin city and in this regard there are one or two comments I should like to make.  As far as the building programme now in progress in Dublin city is concerned, almost a record number of houses were handed over in December, when a total of 184 houses were completed during adverse winter conditions.  This is an indication of the high rate of building at present.  At their last meeting, the corporation accepted a tender for a further 357 houses which is in addition to well over 1,000 houses already in course of construction.  There is also the fact that the Ballymun construction is proceeding <Col N="1828" /> according to plan.  One would think, listening to Deputy Donegan, that no housebuilding was proceeding in the country at all, that people were looking for £5 notes to take them to Liverpool.  I think he mentioned that for £5 one could go to Liverpool, get overnight lodgings and get a job.  That mentality is probably a carry-over from 1958 which the Deputy mentioned earlier but that is not the case today.</P>
    <P>The scaremongering to terrify building workers and small contractors is purely to gain political advantage. The position is not as serious as has been suggested.  There are problems to be faced and they will be faced. This Government faced bigger problems than the present crisis and no doubt dealt with them adequately, and the fact that they still have the confidence of the people is an indication of that.  This problem is a recurring decimal as far as the economy of this and other countries is concerned.  We will face up to our responsibilities and we will find when we have tackled this that there will be great things in store for us.</P>
    <P>We have laid the foundations in this new Bill and the Minister is to be congratulated on it.  Indeed, the members of the Opposition are also to be congratulated for their examination of the problems involved.  Constructive criticism is always welcome and Deputies such as Deputy Tully, Deputy Clinton and others have made a substantial contribution to the Bill.  We have a Bill now.  We have the machinery and, when money becomes more plentiful, there is no doubt that the building programme will reach a point it has never reached before.  The rate of building this year is higher than last year, and last year was a record year.  The final figure, notwith-standing the present financial position, will be more revealing than some people are inclined to think.</P>
    <P>Almost everyone building or reconstructing a house will benefit from this Bill.  Local authorities are now getting the necessary assistance to overcome the problems of the past. The Bill gives a number of substantial reliefs.  Local authorities can now reconstruct existing houses with the <Col N="1829" /> aid of grants.  That is something very welcome in Dublin city, where families have grown out of all proportion to the sizes of the houses they occupy. This relief, in itself, should help to reduce the housing needs.  The corporation have concentrated on building a substantial number of five-roomed houses.  With housing schemes containing as many as 45,000 tenants, it is inevitable that there should be a large number of transfers because of overcrowding in the existing houses. These transfers further delay the allocation of houses.  If a person is transferred from one house to another, a period of from six to seven weeks elapses before another tenant comes in.  Therefore, every transfer can delay the housing of one tenant by six or seven weeks.  That, spread over 42,000 tenants, means that some people on the waiting list are put back for a considerable period.  The Bill will eliminate that and reduce the waiting list in some degree because vacancies can now be allocated straight away.</P>
    <P>There is reference in the Bill to high-rise flats.  In Dublin we have a peculiar problem.  We have built out as far as we can without going into the adjoining counties.  The answer to that problem is high-rise flats.  The fact that they can be built near the city centre will alleviate distress among people who have to travel a distance to and from their work.  At present we have perimeter areas seven or eight miles from the centre of the city and a considerable time is spent travelling to and from them.  All members of the corporation, irrespective of Party, will welcome the development of high-rise flats.</P>
    <P>Local authorities are now permitted to include newly-weds in any scheme of housing priorities they may draw up.  There was some vagueness about this up to now.  Some authorities operated schemes for newly-weds, but others did not.  That situation has now been changed.  Further benefits are the payment of the two-thirds subsidy in respect of housing of the aged and the fact that persons with incomes of up to £1,445 with dependants are entitled to a supplementary grant from the local authority.  These are substantial <Col N="1830" /> improvements, particularly the supplementary grants.  We know the difficulties experienced in the past because of the ceiling set and the fact that dependants were not taken into consideration. The new provisions will bring relief to a substantial number of people.  It is people in that bracket who are buying their own houses.</P>
    <P>I will not deal in detail with all other changes in the Bill but merely comment on one or two of them.  We have experienced over the past number of years an upward swing in the demand for houses.  That upward trend continues, but, when the improvements made in this Bill are carried into effect, I believe that situation will be arrested, and I do not believe it will be very long until it is.</P>
    <P>Almost all the Fine Gael speakers mentioned the housing position in 1958. The Labour speakers did not concentrate on that year at all.  At that time people were emigrating and running away.  Deputy Donegan talked about emigrants to the port of Liverpool with £5 in their pockets.  That may have been the position then because unemployment had reached such a high level that people were running out of their homes.</P>

      <P>This was a carry-over from the deplorable situation left by the Coalition.  I should like to welcome the Bill and to say that all the improvements made in connection with supplementary grants, old people and newly-weds will be evident when it becomes effective.  I am sure that, when we examine the housing position in the years to come, we will see that the time spent in discussing this Bill has not been wasted.  A certain amount of credit can be claimed by all Parties, the members of which, by their forthright expression of approval or disapproval, have played such a part in formulating the Bill.

      <P>There are a few things I should like to mention.  Before I move on to them, I must say I could not help thinking, while Deputy Dowling was on his feet, of a particular friend.  For the life of me, I cannot understand why Deputy Dowling mentions all the good points in this Bill.  Basically, it is a consolidation of all the previous Bills, with slight adjustments in grants.  Listening to Deputy Dowling praise the Minister for Local Government, I began to imagine Deputy Dowling in the sittingroom or office conversing with a constituent who had a housing problem. I wonder, having listened to Deputy Dowling today, what the expression <Col N="1832" /> on the face of that constituent would be if he repeated the same things in his office or sittingroom.  I wonder if that constituent would go out and say &ldquo;I have got my house&rdquo;.  I doubt very much if Deputy Dowling would express himself in the same manner to one of his constituents as he did in this House a few minutes ago, so much so, that I actually praise Deputy Dowling now for backing up his own Minister, knowing in his heart and soul that the whole thing is a lot of cod.</P>
      <P>We can talk from now until Doomsday about building houses and about the different schemes that are available to people to rehouse themselves. Talk is cheap.  What we want now and what the people want in Ireland is action.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle represents County Donegal.  He knows the constituency of South-West Donegal which is very similar to the North-East constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Deputy not to bring the Chair into this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to.  I want to use the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, as a very responsible person in this House, to bear out what I am about to tell the House as being the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.</P>
      <P>We have at the moment in Donegal a serious housing situation.  People who were waiting for the local authority to build houses for them came to realise after two or three years that it would not be done for them.  Then they go, on their own bat, to borrow money from friends across the water or the bank.  They apply for an SDA loan.  They calculate that, between all the money they can borrow and get themselves, and with the grants which would be available to them, they can build their house but find that they have committed themselves to such an extent that they cannot meet their commitments due to the fact that the present Government have not given local authorities money to pay supplementary grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have, and no doubt the Leas-Cheann Comhairle has, too, gone into <Col N="1833" /> the county council offices in Lifford to inquire about supplementary housing grants.  Some few months ago, we were told, &ldquo;There is a slight delay. Certain papers are not in order&rdquo;.  That excuse is now gone and we are being bluntly told that there is no money. Why do the Minister for Local Government and his Parliamentary Secretary not get up and admit that fact in this House?  Why do they repeatedly mislead the people?  Why do they repeatedly make promises of new housing schemes, SDA schemes and other schemes, hoodwinking the people and making them believe that they will build houses?</P>
    <P>In 1956, in a year of crisis, when Deputy Dowling and some of his colleagues on the then Fianna Fáil Opposition benches were very much louder in their criticisms than members on these benches are today, 9,837 houses were built in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>That was a year when the Fianna Fáil Party criticised the inter-Party Government for being in a financial crisis.  Why were they in a financial crisis?  One of the reasons why they were in a financial crisis was because they built houses.  The <i>First Programme for Economic Expansion,</i> which the present Government introduced in 1958, recommended to them in relation to houses, that that great social need would soon be solved. By deliberate policy, the present Government have refused to build houses because their <i>First Programme for Economic Expansion</i> pointed out to them that it was a bad investment. The thinking was that it would be much better to build luxury hotels.  If Deputy P.J. Burke were here now he would tell us that it would be a better investment to buy Constellation aeroplanes or Boeing Jet 707s.  Yes, it is good to do these things but, in my ethics, first things come first.  It is a very bad principle to buy aeroplanes and to build luxury hotels for the wealthy, lazy foreign millionaires who use this country as a playground if our <Col N="1834" /> own people must be made to suffer for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>You did not buy them.  You sold them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I might remind the Deputy that, if we sold them, we built houses.  Deputy Dowling has just told this House a story.  If he tells a similar story to the next constituent who comes into his house or office inquiring why there is such a delay in the housing situation, the expression on that constituent's face should be interesting. We have a scheme in Donegal known as &ldquo;the cottage scheme&rdquo; where the applicant produces a site and the county council will build a cottage on it.  We have had many delays.  We have had so many delays that I raised the matter on numerous occasions in this House, so much so that I had to use the public press to spotlight a grievance of a particular applicant in Donegal. But the new crisis is that the county councillor is now writing to the contractors and asking them: &ldquo;Why is there such a delay?  Why do you not get on with the work?&rdquo;  The simple truth is that the contractors cannot get money from the county council to pay their suppliers.</P>
      <P>Numerous small contractors come to me inquiring: &ldquo;Why can I not get money?&rdquo; and no doubt the same people, or people like them, go to the Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  We go to the county council and we are told: &ldquo;That will be paid.  It is on top of the file and it will be paid on Friday week.&rdquo; When we come in, a fortnight later, we are told: &ldquo;The local clerk of works had to go out to inspect the job but it is now on top of the file and will be paid on Friday week&rdquo;. This has been the pattern for so long that the local contractors cannot honour their debts to the local suppliers.  The local suppliers feel the financial pinch just as much as the present Government and the contractors do and they cannot get extended credit from the general suppliers.  We now find ourselves in a vicious circle which has stemmed from the present Government who, from 1957 to 1966, have refused to build houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1835" /> We heard much talk at the general election about the building of houses. We heard that 45 or 50 houses were to be built in Milford, only to discover that there was no such move afoot at all.  Now, Fianna Fáil members of the council come in and advocate that more houses should be built. Prior to the election, they would not admit that there was such a housing crisis.  This is the codology that sickens me about new legislation in this House.</P>
    <P>There is one other point which I would like to make before the House moves on to questions.  The recent Town Planning Act has presented problems which have a delaying effect on people who wish to build houses for themselves, knowing that the local authority will not provide a house for two or three years.  The Minister should instruct local authorities to expedite all town planning applications in respect of persons who wish to take upon themselves the duty of a local authority and the duty of a Government.</P>

      <P>I propose, with your permission Sir, to circulate in the Official Report a statement giving the information requested by the Deputy, in so far as it is available for the years 1947 to 1964 inclusive. In view of the lack of detailed data for 1938, it has been necessary to combine the groups &ldquo;Industry&rdquo; and &ldquo;Other services&rdquo; which were shown separately in the reply of 15th December last.  Comparable figures for the years 1939 to 1946 inclusive, are not <Col N="1836" /> available, nor is it possible at this stage to give corresponding data for the year 1965.  As has been noted in the previous reply, the Central Statistics Office does not endorse the basic method of computation used.</P>

    <P>The question of improving landing facilities at Clare Island and Roonagh was raised in June 1962 by the interdepartmental committee on island problems set up by my predecessor. Expenditure from State funds on these projects was subsequently approved in principle by the Government, the final decision, however, to await completion by the Office of Public Works of plans and firm estimates of cost.  On the basis of this additional information, the Central Development Committee, which now advises the Government on island problems, agreed in July, 1965 that the expenditure involved in the provision of landing facilities at Clare Island and Roonagh was warranted. In view, however, of the present capital position it has not yet been found <Col N="1845" /> possible to make a financial allocation for these works.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister bear in mind that hundreds of innocent citizens have suffered serious injury and loss due to traffic accidents arising out of the non-maintenance of roads and footpaths?

Proposals for interim revisions of their differential rents scheme which the corporation have submitted to me, and which will apply to all lettings, including Ballymun, provide that where additional works or services are provided for tenants, a charge may be made there-for, but I understand that no decision has yet been made as to what effect, if any, this provision will have in relation to lettings at Ballymun.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The planning of a general scheme for periodic testing of mechanically propelled vehicles under section 18 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, is proceeding.  Consideration is, however, being given to the introduction first of a system of &ldquo;spot checks&rdquo; on vehicles in use on the public roads. I propose, in the new Road Traffic Bill at present being drafted, to seek powers for this purpose.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that there has developed in Dublin a racket in selling dud secondhand cars and that this has caused a number of accidents?  It has also caused considerable hardship to many people caught out by these sharp practitioners. In order to avoid these dangerous vehicles going on the road, would the Minister, as a matter of urgency, introduce even a limited scheme to ensure that no secondhand vehicles will be sold unless there is a certificate of fitness available for them?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of any newly-developing situation in regard to secondhand cars but, even if this were so, the difficulties are formidable and the matter might not be readily dealt with in a way that would meet the case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the difficulty the Minister would have in endeavouring to find out the gravity of this problem because of the ancient doctrine <i>caveat emptor</i> which prevents these things going into court and whereby people have to accept responsibility for their own mistakes in the <Col N="1858" /> buying of secondhand cars.  However, I can assure the Minister that this is a growing traffic, an extremely dangerous one and one at which he should take another look.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare the number of applicants for unemployment assistance in County Donegal who have (a) their means increased and (b) their means decreased, as a result of the new method of assessing means based on poor law valuation introduced on the 1st January, 1966.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Boland) Kevin Boland">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>The new method of assessment referred to in the question is provided for in section 8 of the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1965.  It applies to means derived from the beneficial occupation of land and came into operation on the 3rd January, 1966 in specified congested areas which include the county of Donegal.  Under section 10 of the Act, landholders who received unemployment assistance or were granted a qualification certificate during the year up to that date, that is, smallholders who might broadly be described as existing recipients of unemployment assistance, were entitled as from that date to have their farm means calculated on either the new basis or the old basis, whichever was the more favourable to them.</P>
      <P>As regards (a) in the question, no smallholder applicant for unemployment assistance who was entitled to the section 10 concession has had his means increased as a result of the new method.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to (b), means have been decreased in the case of 285 smallholders in County Donegal to whom the concession applied.  In addition, 172 qualification certificates on the new basis have been granted since the 3rd January, 1966 to smallholders in County Donegal who were not entitled to the concession, that is, who were not in the existing recipient category, and 76 further cases of this kind are under attention for decision.  While it <Col N="1859" /> is not possible to say so with certainty, it is very probable that the means assessment made in these 172 new cases would represent a decrease in means as compared with the old &ldquo;factual&rdquo; basis of assessment.  Otherwise, the smallholders concerned would, presumably, have been recent recipients of unemployment assistance and thereby eligible for the section 10 concession.</P>

      <P>The pilot survey referred to in my reply to the Deputy's previous question on 16th June, 1965, has indicated that, in general, large buildings have a potential use as radioactive fall-out shelters.</P>
      <P>It will be appreciated, however, that the selection, adaptation, equipping, control and administration of shelters of this kind on a large scale would be costly and would need a considerable staff.  The main value of the pilot survey is that it justifies further study of the shelter potential of large buildings and of the various ancillary problems.  Because of the cost and other factors involved, it is not possible to say whether or not such shelters will be a feasible proposition.

      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply and the exhortations from the Minister and the Government to private persons to bear the cost of providing home protection, would the Minister ensure that the Government are not lacking in taking the necessary steps to provide protection, particularly as in the event of a sudden radioactive fallout, tens of thousands of people in this city will be unable to reach their homes before the real danger commences?  On that account there is a very strict responsibility on the Government to give this priority so that there will not be tens of thousands of people doomed in the streets of this city.</P>

Does he really think that tens of thousands of people in this city are not going to be stranded on the way home in the event of radioactive fallout when the streets of the city would be choking, when the Department are not providing any shelter at all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Defence how many persons in receipt of the Old IRA special allowance have recently had such allowance reduced on account of an increase in social welfare benefit in January last; and if it is the policy of his Department to reduce Old IRA allowances when social welfare benefits are increased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>It is estimated that, in all, about 850 special allowances have been affected by the recent increase in disability benefit which it is presumed the Deputy has in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As has been explained frequently, the purpose of a special allowance is to augment the means of members of the Old IRA and kindred organisations who are incapable of self-support by reason of age or permanent infirmity and whose means from other sources are below a certain level.  If the other means increase, there is nothing unreasonable in principle in reducing the special allowance.  Nevertheless it <Col N="1863" /> is the practice not to take increases in social welfare and similar benefits fully into account.  Some of them are totally disregarded and others partly.  As I stated on the 1st instant in a reply to questions bearing on this matter, one-half of disability benefit has always been assessed as means for special allowance purposes and consequently an increase in that benefit has always involved an adjustment of a special allowance.  Since, however, only one-half of the increase is assessed, the overall income from public funds is increased.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the indignation that has been aroused as a result of these veterans of the War of Independence being treated in this fashion, especially in this Jubilee Year of the 1916 Rising? Does the Minister not agree that it is contrary to the spirit and intention of this House in passing the Social Welfare Acts recently that anyone in receipt of a State pension should sustain a reduction as a result of increases in social welfare benefits?  Does he not consider it a shame and a flagrant insult to the men concerned that what was conceded by the Minister for Social Welfare, on the one hand, should be withdrawn by the Minister for Defence, on the other, and in the circumstances will he amend the niggardly means test whereby this sad situation came about?

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Although sheep prices recently have not been at the record high levels reached in the early part of 1965, they compare favourably with those obtaining in the early part of 1964, which was a good year for sheep. Wool prices recovered somewhat in 1965 from the relatively low level in the second half of 1964 and have remained steady since.</P>
      <P>Sheep and wool prices of course depend primarily on conditions in export markets.  In the case of sheep the recent Free Trade Area Agreement with Britain provides for substantial improvements for our sheep and lamb industry, namely, (1) the reduction from three months to two months in the British waiting period for Irish stores to qualify for guarantee payments, (2) the abolition of the ¾d. per lb. differential in the guarantee payments for such animals and (3) the application of the British guarantee payments to 5,500 tons of Irish carcase lamb per annum.</P>
      <P>I may mention that I have recently arranged to have an expert study made to see what further improvements might be possible for the benefit of the sheep and lamb industry.</P>

      <P>The total cost of hireage was £996 5s. 6d. (111 vehicles).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In many postal areas it is not necessary to hire vans or other vehicles at Christmas as the extra <Col N="1876" /> services required are provided by using the official vans more intensively or by the Department's regular mail car contractors at no extra cost, under the conditions of their contracts.  Where these facilities are inadequate postmasters are authorised to hire any vehicles required at the cheapest rates obtainable having regard to the service to be performed.  In the majority of cases the vehicles hired are hackney cars.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department has had discussions with representatives of the Catholic Clerical Managers Association in regard to the question of the closing of one-teacher schools.  I had discussions with representatives of this association in relation to the closing of smaller schools both one-teacher and two-teacher.  The matter subsequently formed one of the subjects which was discussed by officers of my Department with a joint deputation from the Catholic Clerical Managers and the Irish National Teachers Organisation.  I am satisfied that further consultations with the Catholic Clerical Managers Association are not necessary.  The consultation with individual managers is a continuing process and is being done at local level in each case according as the question of the replacement or improvement of a small school arises.  Without going through all the inspectors' diaries for a period of months it would not be possible to give the number of individual managers who have been consulted to date.  I am satisfied that the work involved in doing this would not be warranted.</P>
      <P>I am also satisfied that the implementation of the new policy in no way interferes with the fundamental position which has obtained in regard to the management of schools In fact the new policy goes much further than the existing arrangements in endeavouring to establish the parish as the unit in connection with primary education.</P>

There is not and there never has been any question of abandoning two-teacher schools which were recently erected or renovated.

      <P>In connection with the several replies the Minister has just given, is it correct to say the general policy is that parochial schools will in every case be substituted for any schools that are closed?  There is no question of amalgamating parishes for the purpose of providing one school to take the place of one or two schools being closed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>No, there is no question whatever of that.  As I explained to the House in some detail, we are endeavouring, as far as is humanly possible, to confine any amalgamation of schools within a parish.  I have explained there were exceptional cases where this could not be done, but they are exceptional and a relatively small number.  We are making particular efforts to ensure as far as we can that children who are being transported to another school will be kept within their own parish.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has spoken of the necessary gradual nature of this change.  Can we rest assured <Col N="1886" /> that where there is in existence a thoroughly unfit two-teacher school, structurally speaking, this general programme of reform will not be used for the purpose of failing to replace that school when the necessity for replacement is urgent for the welfare of the children?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes; I think I have already assured the Deputy on a number of occasions that this is so.  As I explained earlier today in the House, it is true that a number of schools which were due for replacement have been held up for some months for the investigation to take place.  But I have also pointed out that, as a result of this, in many cases the children concerned are being or will be housed in good conditions in schools very much faster than they would have been if we proceeded to replace the schools.  Apart from the delay which must necessarily follow in the examination of the position of any particular school, there will be no delay in school building because of this policy.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make some observations before this vitally important matter of the Housing Bill is disposed of by the House.  I suppose it has been repeated <i>ad nauseam</i> during the course of the debate that the Dublin housing problem is the major one in the country.  This is evident, and I do not think anybody needs convincing on the matter, by the number of questions on the Order Paper over the years as to the steps being taken or not being taken to deal with that problem.</P>
      <P>Today, in reply to a question by Deputy Mullen, the Minister opened a window on how serious this situation is.  He said that, at the moment, there are in urgent need of housing in Dublin 800 families consisting of five persons in one room, 1,676 families consisting of four persons living in one room and 1,165 families consisting of three persons living in one room.  In the course of my regular visits to the corporation, I was informed yesterday by the official in charge of housing allocations that production at the Ballymun scheme has been very disappointing and because there has been a virtual halt on the hand-over by the contractor to the corporation over the past three weeks or possibly a month&mdash; because, in fact, Dublin Corporation have no new dwellings coming into their possession&mdash;the housing authority in the city now find themselves compelled once more to give priority to families consisting of eight persons in one room and, when they have been dealt with, families of seven persons in one room will then be taken up and, after them, families consisting of six persons in one room so that, I am told, it will be several weeks and possibly months before families consisting of five persons in one room are reached.  So much was promised and so much was expected from the Ballymun scheme but progress so far has been very disappointing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1893" /> This great delay is an inevitable result of a lull or stoppage in house production.  Families will increase in number, naturally.  A family consisting of a man, his wife and three children today may well consist of a man, his wife and four, six or even seven children tomorrow, all depending on the will of the Almighty.  Everything points to a very grave and critical situation in this city and when one mentions that the city is so badly affected, it follows that the county area and Dublin County Council must also be vitally concerned because the overflow of the problem reaches out to the boundary limits of the administrative area of the county.</P>
    <P>How far the Bill will help to resolve this grave situation is something which we shall see by results.  We know there is a vast problem.  Any members of the House who, like myself, have the opportunity of regular contact with housing applicants must be worried and at times must indeed be anguished, if they have any feelings in them at all, by the cases which confront them.</P>
    <P>I suppose that in other days, the Government and the local authorities dealing with housing were quite justifiably concerned with the problem principally as it affected families living in unfit, dangerous and unhealthy dwellings.  The emphasis in this city has changed very much from that situation over recent years.  The really agonising housing problem in Dublin city and county now concerns families living with in-laws in corporation or county council houses or cottages.</P>
    <P>There is some fundamental law of nature, as we all know, which requires that a family should have its own abode and that no other family can occupy or share that abode if their is to be peace.  This is particularly true where there is gross overcrowding as, indeed, we have in the city.  We have many cases of young people getting married, being encouraged to get married with the best of goodwill by there parents and finding it impossible to obtain any kind of living accommodation.  In other years, before the levelling of Georgian Dublin began, it was possible for such <Col N="1894" /> families to get a room in a tenament and to exist there for a while until eventually housed by the corporation, but, of course, practically all the tenements are now levelled.</P>
    <P>As a matter of interest, I may say, in passing, that one would have to travel a long way in Dublin now to see a tenement house.  All this is good and reflects credit on the Dublin housing authority.  It has side effects which add to the problem in that it eliminates any other means of accommodation for these families, with the result that such young people getting married have no alternative but to live with their parents on one side or the other.  Families grow and housing space becomes more and more restricted. Tensions develop.  The more people have to live in close proximity with each other, the more they discern each other's faults and the more the unpleasantnesses of human nature come to the surface.  Eventually, with the growth of such sub-tenant families, one comes up against problems of enormous dimensions, so much so that one has to spend Sunday morning interviewing people in this housing bracket, as some of us do.  It is impossible at the end of a couple of hours not to feel utterly depressed at the thought that there is so much human misery and that one can do so little about it.  The frustration felt by the average practising and much-abused and maligned politician cannot be beneficial to his health.  It is certainly not beneficial to his mental health.  It is liable to make one short-tempered and lose one's patience with the housing authority and, indeed, with the Minister who has the over-riding power as far as housing authorities are concerned.</P>
    <P>The housing of sub-tenants is the principal problem in Dublin city and county.  There are a vast number of sub-tenants, some of whom it was hoped would be relieved during the current year.  I remember early last year, when first mention was made of the Ballymun project, being assured, in good faith, I am quite satisfied, by officials of the corporation that it was probable that houses would be available <Col N="1895" /> in some numbers at any rate&mdash;not great numbers&mdash;before the end of last year at Ballymun.  Of course, as we know, houses have not even yet become available in Bailymun, certainly not in such condition that people can occupy them.  I am told that houses are completed there but there are all sorts of complaints as to the condition of the houses, as to the fact that they are not properly finished. There are complaints as to the impossibility of approach to the houses.  The roadways are covered with muck which makes it impossible for people to get near them.  In most cases services have not yet been installed.  So that, in effect, we have not got any houses in this scheme which was held out to us as being not just a solution but an early solution to the problem as it then was.</P>
    <P>The problem has worsened in the meantime with the increase in the number of marriages and the increase in the size of sub-tenant families, especially in the area for which I am speaking particularly, Ballyfermot and that district.  The problem has worsened and hopes have diminished. Having been assured last year through the press and other means, in good faith, as I say, by their representatives, that there would be relief for them, when they find themselves in this situation now, it is no wonder that such citizens begin to lose faith in the Government, whether it be local or central, and begin to imagine that no trust can be put in the words of politicians, that they mislead people and do not care about their problems, that it is all a cynical game.  The truth is that very often a politician is very deeply concerned and is frustrated by circumstances over which he cannot exercise very much control.</P>
    <P>I hope this Bill will do something&mdash; it does not hold out any great prospect of doing very much&mdash;to advance the day when houses will be available for all those who require accommodation. May I add that I hope the houses made available to the citizens will not be presented at such prohibitive rents as are now suggested by the Dublin City Manager?  Mention has been made of <Col N="1896" /> rents of a level of £4.15.0&mdash;in or about that figure.  It would seem to me to be losing all touch with reality to impose such charges on workingclass families. One must always remember that, regardless of talk about large sums of money being earned collectively by a family and the allegations concerning large sums going into one house, in modern times children who earn money save at least portion of it and have to save a considerable portion of it in order to be able to get married.  It is completely unreal to imagine that a child who is earning a week's wages gives every halfpenny to the parents as, indeed, was done and had to be done for economic reasons in other times. In our father's days and to some extent in the days of people of my age group, it had to be done because the wages were very small and the total family income was only enough to keep the loaf on the table.</P>
    <P>Times have changed and young people are earning higher wages because of the work of the trade unions down through the years and improved working conditions.  There are families who as groups earn large amounts of money collectively but it is unreal to suggest that the earnings are pooled and that differential rents should be based on the assumption that they are pooled.  That is unjust and unreal and does not take cognisance of the fact that the boys and girls in a family have a very natural inclination to get married and, in order to do so, must save for furniture and so on. The better, more energetic and thrifty among them save with the object of making a deposit on a house.  How they face that prospect in this day and age baffles my imagination.  The deposit that must be found now by any couple seeking to purchase a house by way of a Small Dwellings Act loan or a loan from a building society and paid over to what can only be described as housebuilding racketeers, is in the neighbourhood of £400 to £450.  It takes a great deal of selfdenial to accumulate that sum of money from scratch.  It takes a great deal of time and will power to watch it grow until it is sufficient to put into the grasping paw of people who are <Col N="1897" /> battening and making grossly unjust profits in the housing industry as a result of the demand for housing which these young people are creating.</P>
    <P>These are facts which concern the House and which I hope the Bill will impinge upon to some extent.  I do not see how the Bill can affect the matter of house prices.  As long as the Government permit inflation to develop in the price of houses so long will the Government be justly accused of not doing its duty by the people.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned that people who want to buy their own houses and who save in order to do so should get every encouragement.  Unfortunately, they are not getting it at the moment.  I know of a number of cases of people proposing to get married who say: &ldquo;What can we do? Where can we possibly get £400 or £450 to deposit on a house?  We have no hope of getting a corporation house or flat.  What is there for us but to go to England?&rdquo;  You say to them that it is just as difficult to get accommodation in England as it is here and they tell you that experience has shown that it is not.  They point to many cases of families who have left here and gone to various parts of England who after some time suffering the great hardship arising from lack of accommodation have succeeded in getting housing accommodation at a much more speedy rate than they would get it here.</P>
    <P>This all adds to the problem and points to the absolute urgency of the need to tackle the matter.  I have talked about it until one becomes physically weary.  I know the officials of the corporation who are charged with the responsibility of administering the Acts and the regulations are just as concerned as public representatives.  I am not going to suggest, although it might be good politics to suggest, that the Minister is not as concerned as others.  Any person knowing the problem and having any kind of human reaction must be concerned with it.  We are not getting the results.  We are in the same position now in Dublin city and county as we were 12 months ago. We had the hold-up in the county area <Col N="1898" /> of the Swords houses.  The reason was that money is short.  That is not good enough.  Money may be short for other purposes and it could be argued that we could economise in other spheres of activity but we certainly should not economise in the matter of housing. There should be power taken to obtain money for housing in whatever way that is necessary.</P>
    <P>It may be said that that would require increased taxation.  We in this Party do not baulk at that issue.  If we can be sure that money has to be raised by taxation for the provision of houses, or for any other worthy social welfare scheme such as an increase in old age pensions or anything of that nature, we do not sidestep the issue. We are quite prepared, provided we are satisfied that this is what the money will be spent on, to face up to the possible unpopularity that flows from supporting such proposals.</P>
    <P>Apart from taxation, there must be other methods.  Certainly, the high interest rates which are permitted by the Government to be charged to persons borrowing from building societies or from banks or from any other source of usury are a scandal and a shame. Steps should be taken by the Government to bring interest rates down. In house purchase as such the rate of interest chargeable on loans constitutes a very big factor in the eventual grossly inflated price which the unfortunate purchaser has to pay over a period of possibly 30 to 35 years.  It is now estimated that a person purchasing a house at the present time, putting down a deposit of £400 or £450, will have to face outgoings of anything from £6 to £7 a week for the next 30 years.  How people can face that prospect or the kind of salary they will need in order to be able to face it is beyond my understanding.  That kind of debt and that kind of obligation has about it a ring of disaster and despair.  The Government should take steps to control at least the interest rates and to exercise any other controls necessary in order to bring down the cost of houses for such people.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister to clarify a point for me when he is <Col N="1899" /> replying.  It is a technical point relating to houses built by Dublin Corporation for newly-weds.  It has been stated to me by sources in the corporation that the present system whereby newly-weds are given houses and allowed to remain in them for five years and must then be offered alternative accommodation and removed from houses which are called newly-wed houses, will end with this Bill and that persons who have been living in such houses in Ballyfermot, for instance, for the past five years will be allowed to remain there, and that in future newly-weds will have to be provided for in new houses being built in schemes such as Ballymun.  I would be obliged if the Minister could clarify the legal position in that regard.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned Dublin city.  The needs of Dublin county are equally urgent.  I have not refrained from exercising my tongue on Dublin County Council, although, perhaps, it might be said that it is easy talking about a body of which one is not a member.  If I were a member of that body, I would say the same thing.  The record of Dublin County Council in the matter of housing is something on which they cannot pride themselves. The number built in that area in the past five years is extremely small. Those were the wasted years when there should have been a comprehensive housing programme in operation. If that programme had been in operation we would not now have a situation in which we have 2,000 applications before the county council for houses.</P>
    <P>In the Swords area, which was the subject of numerous Dáil questions and on which there was an Adjournment Debate to which members of all Parties contributed, the position remains to some extent obscure.  We are told that sanction is available for a scheme of 180 houses but we do not know for certain when money will be available to allow the scheme to go ahead or whether it can be started right away or not.  I would implore the Minister to clarify the situation again for the benefit of the huge number of <Col N="1900" /> people around the Swords district who are living in desperately bad conditions and awaiting accommodation from the county council.  What I have said about Swords can apply to every other area around the county, Rush, Balbriggan, Clondalkin, Lucan and Dundrum. One could go through the county parish by parish and there is in every district a housing problem which cries out to heaven for remedy.</P>
    <P>I want to ask another question relating to unfinished estates.  We were assured last year when the Town Planning Act was being passed by the House, that this whole problem, which is of many years standing and which is caused by reason of estates being left by developers in a deplorable condition of commonage and neglect, would be dealt with under that Act. We are now informed by the law agent of the county council that the Act in so far as these estates are concerned does not have retrospective effect and that the local authority has not got the power to go in and do the necessary work as the clearing up of dumps, the filling in of ditches and levelling out of commonages and to bill the developer with the cost.</P>
    <P>We now understand that this is not possible in any retrospective sense.  If that is so, the Act is vitiated as far as Dublin County Council is concerned. Will the Minister tell us now that he proposes to repeal that Act and to bring it back with a provision so as to give power to Dublin County Council and other local authorities throughout the country to go in on such estates and to give the Act retrospective effect.  If he will do that and do it quickly, he will save me and others the trouble of taking up the time of this House with a private Bill. Otherwise, we will have no alternative but to bring in such a Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>This Fifth Stage of this Bill and the motion by the Fine Gael Party drawing attention to the decline in housing provides an opportunity for Deputies to bring the problems of their local authorities before the House, the Minister and the Government.  I am glad to avail of that opportunity today.  Deputy Dunne mentioned that <Col N="1901" /> no new dwellings were handed over to Dublin Corporation by contractors in the past three or four weeks.  I would be a happy man if I could say the same for Kilkenny.  No new dwellings have been handed over there for the past four, five or six years.</P>
      <P>The Minister may blame the local authority, and he has so blamed them, for not going ahead with the work but I do not think he is justified in this.  I was looking through his White Paper <i>Housing Progress</i> and <i>Prospects</i> and I was interested in it as a member of a local authority, being a member of both Kilkenny County Council and of Kilkenny Corporation. I notice that in the year 1947-48 the total number of houses built by local authorities was about 600.  At that time we were at the end of an emergency and housebuilding had not got back into its normal flow.</P>
      <P>If we come further on to the year 1951-52, we find that there was an average of over 7,000 local authority houses built in that period.  That shows that the Government of that time appreciated the necessity for providing good houses for the people through the local authorities.  When we come to the year 1961-62, we find that the average number of local authority houses built was 1,200.  That is a very big reduction.  In the <i>First Programme for Economic Expansion,</i> the Government said that the housing needs of the people, in general, had been met at that time.  The fruits of that policy are there now.  The people know that their housing needs were not met or even half-met.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should be attacking the Minister and having a go at the Government for their failure in housing.  I do not intend to do that.  I am more anxious to see that we get houses than to get any kudos out of an attack on the Minister.  I will be content if I can do anything today to improve the prospect of more houses for my native city and county.  There has not been one site taken over by Kilkenny Corporation since the present Government came into office.  At that time we had a site which had been taken over with the sanction of the Minister's predecessor <Col N="1902" /> and it took over four years to get sanction for the building of houses on it.  We had to prove the necessity for the houses and many other things.</P>
    <P>At present there is a scheme of seven houses for old people in Kilkenny before the Department for sanction.  The tender for these houses has been with the Department for some time but not for too long a period.  If those houses were built, it would free seven corporation houses for families of older people whose children have grown up and left them and who are anxious to move into a smaller type of house.  There are also proposals for four bungalows. I appeal to the Minister to sanction these as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Last year the National Building Agency came down to Kilkenny and took over about nine acres, which they purchased from the county council, in order to build 70 houses on the border of the city.  Everybody was pleased with this development and 20 or 25 corporation tenants applied for SDA loans to build houses for themselves. That would have relieved the housing position.  Unfortunately, the financial crisis intervened and these houses were put on one side.  We hope they will get the finances to go ahead in the coming year.</P>
    <P>Only last Monday I was speaking to the MOH about two people badly in need of houses.  One is a man whose wife was sent to a sanatorium.  A month later one of the children followed her there.  I told the MOH that if something were not done, the other two children would also end up in a sanatorium.  The second case is that of a woman living at the top of a fourstorey house.  There is a new landlord who wants the house for his own use. She has been pressing me and all the other members of the corporation for a new house.  I recommended these people to the MOH and he said they would be only too delighted to give these people houses but just lately they gave a house to a man who had three in family and others objected because this family had only recently come to town.  However, the conditions were such that he actually saw the children <Col N="1903" /> literally wasting away.  They would all be in a sanatorium, or dead, if their position were not alleviated.</P>
    <P>I cite these cases in order to arouse the Minister's sympathy and that of the Government in relation to the housing position in Kilkenny.  First-hand information may help them to give the necessary sanction.  I told the MOH I would be speaking on this motion and he asked me to do all I could to impress on the Minister the need for sanction at least for the seven houses for the old people and the four bungalows, because that would relieve to some small extent the present desperate situation.  I told him I would do that, and I have done it now.</P>
    <P>We had a sworn inquiry in Kilkenny on the 8th of this month.  There are 87 families living in unfit houses; there are 60 families in overcrowded conditions; and there are 41 requiring houses.  In a short time the Minister will have this evidence and I trust it will rivet his attention on the dire need for houses in the city of Kilkenny.  I understand there are plans in the Department for a further ten houses and plans being prepared for a further 19 houses.  Although 188 houses are required, these at least would relieve the really bad cases.  I appeal to the Minister to give this matter his sympathetic consideration.</P>
    <P>The situation is pretty much the same in the county council area.  There are two schemes on the borders of the city, one at Newpark and the other at Assumption Place for ten and 18 houses respectively.  Last October or November, I asked the Minister what the position was with regard to these and when sanction would be given. I was told that the Department was in communication with the Kilkenny County Council.  At the next meeting of the county council, I asked what communication had been received from the Department and I discovered that the only communication was a bare acknowledgement that they had received the plans.  When the Minister replied in the manner he did, I took it that developments were taking place and the Department was querying <Col N="1904" /> some matters.  Is an acknowledgement a communication in any sense of the word?  I would prefer the Minister to be straightforward.  I felt very small when the county council told me the nature of the communication.  There was no communication of any consequence.</P>
    <P>There is a tender with the Department for 12 houses for Graiguenamanagh, houses which are required very badly.  In practically every village in the county there are plans either formulated or actually sent up.  There are eight houses in Mooncoin, four houses in Stoneyford, ten houses in Goresbridge and a scheme also for Ballyraggett at the lay-out stage.</P>
    <P>In the past, if a small farmer of £5 or £10 valuation was badly in need of a cottage, the county council could build it for him and include it in the next group sent for sanction.  They can no longer do that because a circular was sent out stating they could not build cottages, or anything else, until the loan is sanctioned.  Shortly there will be an application to the Minister for sanction for 70 cottages, which are very badly needed.  In one case a man is living in an out office, and a very poor out office at that.  Since the issue of that circular, the county council's hands are tied.  After that meeting of the county council, I rang the Department asking about sanction for the houses in Newpark and Assumption Place and the answer I got was that there was no point in sanctioning them because there was no money.</P>
    <P>Should the building of houses not be a much more important thing than the building of roads?  Could the heavy end of the Road Fund not be transferred to the building of houses?  What should come first?  Is it houses or roads?  I know the Minister would have to make certain arrangements in order to transfer that money, but I appeal to him to do something to alleviate the present desperate position. There will be £9,000,000 or £10,000,000 going into the Road Fund this year.  I would appeal to the Minister to transfer at least half of that to housing during this emergency and the Government and the Minister can <Col N="1905" /> decide when it can be paid back.  Can you imagine any Government spending thousands upon thousands of pounds straightening a bend in the road while people are in dire need of being housed?  There is also the point that recently we had a White Paper from the Minister for Health in which he proposed to make available free choice of doctor and various other things.  Is it not the first requirement of health that decent housing conditions be provided?  What is the point of providing hospitals for people when what is vitally needed is proper places for them to live?  It reminds me of the situation in which the county medical officer of health found himself recently when he had to transfer children out of an unfit dwelling because he said they were wasting there.  A housing scheme is more important than a health scheme and I would appeal to the Minister, financial crisis or no financial crisis, to consider this matter seriously and see that houses are provided.</P>
    <P>We all realise there is a financial crisis and I do not intend to discuss what brought that crisis about.  However, I would ask the Minister, by adopting the suggestion I made in regard to the Road Fund, to give priority to houses rather than to roads. I would ask him in the coming weeks to give sanction to Kilkenny Corporation in respect of 11 houses urgently required and to the county council in respect of 28 houses, which would relieve the out-and-out hardship that exists there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill has certainly got a fine-combing and we are grateful to the Minister for making these necessary amendments.  I should like to recommend to him that he should ensure closer co-operation between the Department and the local authorities because we will not reap the fruits of this Bill unless this co-operation and harmony exists between the Department and the local authorities.  We in Cork have had many problems in regard to housing.  We were faced with a shortage of labour in the building trade, a problem which still exists in our city.  We were also faced with the problem of not having sufficient land <Col N="1906" /> for building but, since the extension of the borough boundary, the land is available and I would ask the Minister, when allocating money for housing, to keep that aspect in mind in relation to the Cork Corporation.</P>
      <P>We all appreciate the Minister's concern for the newly-weds and old people, as evidenced in this Bill.  These are sections of the community who have been deprived of housing over the years.  Naturally where there is prosperity, one can expect a great demand for housing.  We in Cork are becoming highly industrialised, and we have an ever-increasing population.  Therefore, one can quite understand the demands being made on the local authority for housing.</P>
      <P>The last speaker said we should take money out of the Road Fund.  I am sure he is not advocating unemployment. There is very little use in having houses if you have not people to occupy them.  I do not think the Deputy meant that.  I would not be at all in favour of cutting down on the Road Fund and bringing about unemployment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>I do.  I do not intend to engage in any crossfire, but I am sure that, whatever moneys will be made available by the Department, housing will be given priority and that the local authorities will make the best use of these moneys.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter to which I should like to refer is the failure of managers to introduce a tenant-purchase scheme. I often wonder why they are fighting shy of this.  The trend nowadays is for people to want to purchase their own homes.  In Cork there are quite a large number of tenants who would be prepared to purchase their own homes. We have had a pilot scheme for one <Col N="1907" /> side of the city.  This was not satisfactory but, nevertheless, the manager should insist on providing this facility for tenants.</P>
    <P>This Bill is welcome in Cork and we are anxious to go ahead with the scheme in whose adoption in Cork the Minister played a very big part by coming to explain it to us, namely, this new system building.  We have in mind now the building of 600 flats such as are here in Dublin, and I hope the Minister will keep that request from the Cork Corporation in mind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. T. O'Donnell Mr. T. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to avail myself of the opportunity provided by the debate on this motion to make a few comments on this very important question of housing.  Over the past four years, whenever an opportunity presented itself, I have drawn the Minister's attention particularly to the situation existing in the constituency I represent.  This motion draws attention to the decline in the number of houses being built in recent years and the serious consequences resulting from the present restrictions on finances available for housing.  In the White Paper <i>Housing Progress and Prospects,</i> there is adequate evidence in the statistics produced to prove the decline in the output of houses in recent years. I do not want to delay the House by going into details of those statistics; they have been quoted many times here in recent years and there is no doubt that there has been a serious decline in the number of houses built.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Speaking for my own constituency, Limerick city, the latest information I have is in the replies given to me by the Minister a week ago in which he informed me that there were 1,148 families in the city living in unfit dwellings.  He also said that the present number of applicants for new houses in Limerick was in the region of 700 or 800.  That is a serious situation and one of which not alone I but every public representative, in both Dáil and local authority, in Limerick, is acutely aware.  The pattern in Limerick city in recent years has been the same as the national pattern.  There is an acute <Col N="1908" /> housing shortage because there was a considerable reduction in the number of houses built per year since 1957. There were two financial years since then, 1959-60 and 1961-62 in neither of which a single house was built by Limerick Corporation.</P>
    <P>The latest figures available for the past 12 months seem to indicate that in the current financial year, Limerick Corporation will have provided roughly 200 dwellings, but this is entirely inadequate when we take into account the fact that there are almost 1,200 families in unfit dwellings.  There is serious overcrowding.  I have seen numerous cases where two or three families are living in one dwelling, up to 14 people under one roof.  I have seen five people sleeping on mattresses on the floor of one room.  This is a situation I have mentioned on numerous occasions and I feel in conscience bound to mention it again.</P>
    <P>The situation in Limerick city is utterly deplorable.  There has been a slight improvement in the output of houses in the past 12 months.  The Minister visited Limerick roughly a year ago and had discussions with Limerick Corporation and local representatives.  He made some suggestions for tackling the problem.  At that time he seemed to favour the introduction of system-building, something similar to the Ballymun scheme.  He suggested that two or three local authorities in the area&mdash;perhaps he had in mind Limerick Corporation and County Council, Clare County Council and possibly North Tipperary&mdash;should combine and pool their building resources. Nothing seems to have come of that.  I am concerned with the fact that week after week I have a queue on my doorstep of unfortunate people seeking houses and I can do nothing about it.</P>
    <P>In previous debates on this question, I tried to find out who in fact was responsible for the situation we have had in Limerick for the past six or seven years, a situation in which during two financial years no house was built. About six months ago, speaking on the same subject, I was critical of the Department of Local Government but the <Col N="1909" /> Minister, in replying to that debate, left me under no illusion that he would not accept the blame when in fact the Limerick Corporation are to blame for the situation.  As I said on many occasions, I am not concerned with who is to blame but I take it the Minister is the final authority on the matter of housing and, as I said, if Limerick Corporation are not doing their job, it is up to the Minister to take appropriate action.  On the other hand, if there are delays in his Department, it is also within his power to rectify the position.</P>
    <P>The solution of the housing problem not only in Limerick but in Dublin, Cork and other areas also, will be a formidable task.  I see in the White Paper, Part 3, paragraph 25, that it is stated that the output in 1963-64 was over 7,500 dwellings.  The situation in regard to our needs would require an output of 12,000 to 13,000 per year. It also states that an output of about 14,000 per year by 1970 will be necessary.  As things are going at present, there does not seem to be an earthly chance of reaching that target. I do not profess to be an expert on building&mdash;I know very little about it&mdash; but I know the misery and hardship and all the inconvenience which so many families are suffering in the city of Limerick because of lack of building.</P>
    <P>There was a very strong reaction to the Minister's statement on the occasion of his visit to Limerick last year. There was a good deal of controversy regarding the question of system-building and the danger of redundancy among building workers.  I think it was suggested at the time that the most rational approach to this problem was that discussions should take place with the trade unions.  I do not know whether any such discussions have taken place but I am perturbed by the slow rate of progress.</P>
    <P>The second half of the motion refers to the serious consequences resulting from the current restriction on finance available for housing.  Week after week we have had questions tabled by various Deputies drawing attention to the fact that the financial restrictions in recent months have been holding up building schemes in various places. <Col N="1910" /> I have before me a copy of a resolution passed by Limerick City Council on 8th February last stating:</P>
    <P>That having regard to the present position regarding the availability of finance to the Corporation for the making of loans and grants under the Housing (Loans and Grants) Act, 1962, and the fact that there is a waiting list of persons seeking approval for loans, we ask the Minister to receive a deputation consisting of the Mayor, the Dáil Deputies for East Limerick, including the Minister for Health, and the City Manager, to discuss the position. </P>
    <P>So there is a problem there which bears out the argument in this motion. It was unfortunate that the credit squeeze and the economic situation we have should have come at the time they did come because there was some evidence, in Limerick at any rate, and in other parts of the country, that we were on the verge of a breakthrough in solving the housing problem.  Now, all the evidence is that we are further away than ever.  I urge the Minister, particularly on behalf of the hundreds of families in my constituency who are in urgent need of houses, to take whatever steps are necessary to solve this problem.</P>

      <P>The sad thing about housing is that so many people are so very pleased with themselves about what has been achieved.  It is very sad because, in fact, we have no record at all about which to be complacent. The simple facts are that our contribution to housing is by far the worst of 30 countries in Europe, and of 31 countries, if you include the United States.  Those countries include those torn by strife, like Cyprus, and countries with ill-advised systems such as communism in East Germany, and they include every type of political, economic and social set-up.  One thinks of our boast that we are doing enough for housing and cannot do more; yet we find ourselves down at the very end of a list of 31 countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To read the Government's White Paper, like other White Papers issued by this Government, one would think <Col N="1911" /> that all was well and that only a little improvement was necessary and we would have paradise on earth.  The official publications of the United Nations, to which I intend referring extensively for the purpose of drawing the attention of Deputies to them, indicate categorically that we have the worst record of any other country whose figures are published by the United Nations.  These figures are based upon the population of any country in any given year so that the figures are fair.  They are related to demands at any given time.  What I think is particularly significant is that these reports show that Ireland, apart from being the worst supplier of houses, is also the worst about supplying statistics.  Again and again, one finds in these reports that other countries less developed than ourselves, not free for as long as we are, and less sophisticated than we, are able to provide detailed statistics which we are unable to provide.  That is one of the reasons why in the course of the debate on Amendments to the Housing Bill, we besought the Department of Local Government and local authorities to obtain a true statement of the housing situation.  The fact that they are reluctant to do so, associated with the fact that we have the worst record, tells its own story, one that we have not yet appreciated&mdash;the gravity of the problem.  As yet, we do not know its extent and on that account we have not yet adopted the proper means of resolving it.  Perhaps we do not want to know the answer because we suspect it is very much worse than we have pretended it to be.  The Government White Paper is as excellent a piece of whitewashing of a social and moral problem as any unscrupulous Government produced. We find that the White Paper, even apart from the few generalisations, provides no statement in regard to the housing stock in the country.  It hazards some guesses about the percentage of housing stock which they say is older than this century but there is no realistic assessment.  That, I suppose, is one of the many reasons why they have not given the United <Col N="1912" /> Nations any figures for housing stock and we find ourselves alone among 31 countries not furnishing to the United Nations any figures of the number of houses we have for our people.</P>
    <P>We find also that the 1965 Report of the United Nations can give figures of the number of people employed in the housebuilding industry in all countries, with the exception of Ireland since 1961.  One wonders what is wrong that our Statistics Office and the Department of Local Government have not been able to advise the United Nations about the number employed, in the same way as other nations have. Is it that we are ashamed or is it that we have yet to make an accurate assessment, although we do glibly quote figures at home from time to time?  Apparently any figures we use for home consumption are not produced for abroad, or are not acceptable because their basis is open to considerable question.  We find also that we are the only country that is unable to give the United Nations a price index for the input and output of houses.  All other countries are able to give information as to the cost of the input of wages, materials and other components of housing, and other countries are able to give accurate figures for the output of the combination of all these resources and components, but, again, we apparently are unable to give this information, or if we give it, apparently it is not acceptable because it is not based on the criteria acceptable to an international and impartial body such as the United Nations Organisation.</P>
    <P>These are essentials which we must bear in mind before we even try to consider or discuss what the housing situation is here.  We find that we have not got reliable information, that there is no preparedness on the part of the Minister to get this information, because he vigorously rejected our amendments to the Housing Bill which would have provided this information by making it mandatory on the Minister and the local authorities to supply it in future.  Apart from that&mdash;&mdash;</P>
