      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>(1)  That&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  in the case of dances, and goods sold and services provided in connection with dances where payment for such goods or services is included in the payment in respect of admission or is a condition for admission, tax shall be ten per cent of the taxable turnover of the accountable person and the amount of tax chargeable shall be paid in accordance with regulations to be made under Part VI of the Finance Act, 1963 (No. 23 of 1963),</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  for the purposes of this paragraph taxable turnover shall be the total amount of money received or receivable from persons admitted to a dance in respect of admission, together with, in case goods are sold or services are provided or both goods are sold and services are provided, in connection with the dance, and payment therefore is <Col N="1444" /> not included in the payment in respect of admission, the total amount of money received or receivable in respect thereof.</P>
    <P>(2)  That&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  every person who intends to promote a dance or a series of dances shall notify the Revenue Commissioners in accordance with regulations to be made under Part VI of the Finance Act, 1963, of his intention to do so,</P>
    <P>(b)  a person who contravenes the foregoing subparagraph shall be liable to a penalty of twenty pounds,</P>
    <P>(c)  in a prosecution for an offence under this paragraph, it shall be presumed unless the contrary is shown by the defendant that he did not give the appropriate notification to the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>(3)  That&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the proprietor of any premises shall not promote a dance therein, or allow a dance to be promoted therein by any other person, unless he has received notification from the Revenue Commissioners that they have been notified in accordance with paragraph (2) of this Resolution,</P>
    <P>(b)  a person who contravenes the foregoing subparagraph shall be liable to a penalty of twenty pounds,</P>
    <P>(c)  in a prosecution for an offence under this paragraph, it shall be presumed unless the contrary is shown by the defendant that he did not receive the appropriate notification from the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>(4)  That&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  an authorised officer, on production, if requested, of his appointment, may enter any place where dancing is proceeding, and any place ordinarily used for dancing, at any reasonable time, with a view to seeing whether the provisions of this Resolution and of the regulations as to tax in the case of dances are being complied with,</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1445" /> (b)  any person who prevents or obstructs the entry as aforesaid of an authorised officer shall be liable to a penalty of twenty pounds,</P>
    <P>(c)  in this paragraph &ldquo;authorised officer&rdquo; means an officer of the Revenue Commissioners appointed by them to be an authorised officer for the purposes of this paragraph.</P>
    <P>(5)  That all penalties under this Resolution may, without prejudice to any other method of recovery, be proceeded for and recovered summarily in the same manner as in summary proceedings for recovery of any penalty under any Act relating to the excise, and, notwithstanding subsection (4) of section 10 of the Petty Sessions (Ireland) Act, 1851, summary proceedings under this Resolution may be instituted within three years from the date of the incurring of the penalty.</P>
    <P>(6)  That subject to this Resolution, the rules of the court concerned for the time being applicable to civil proceedings shall apply to proceedings pursuant to paragraph (2), (3) or (4) of this Resolution.</P>
    <P>(7)  That nothing in subsection (3) of section 47, subsection (3) of section 48 and sections 49 and 53 of the Finance Act, 1963, shall apply in relation to dances or goods sold or services provided in the circumstances mentioned in subparagraph (a) of paragraph (1) of this Resolution.</P>
    <P>(8)  That this Resolution shall not apply in any case in which the number of persons to be admitted to the dance is limited to one hundred and the payment on admission does not exceed four shillings.</P>
    <P>(9)  That in this Resolution &ldquo;dance&rdquo; includes a ball.</P>
    <P>(10)  That for the purposes of this Resolution the expression &ldquo;moneys received&rdquo; in paragraph (a) of subsection (1) of section 47 of the Finance Act, 1963, shall be construed as including &ldquo;moneys receivable&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1446" /> (11)  That, subject to the foregoing paragraph, this Resolution shall be construed together with Part VI of the Finance Act, 1963, and Part VI of the Finance Act, 1965 (No. 22 of 1965).</P>
    <P>(12)  That the foregoing provisions of this Resolution shall come into operation on the 1st day of May, 1966.</P>
    <P>(13)  It is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that this Resolution shall have statutory effect under the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1927 (No. 7 of 1927).</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say if the requirement in paragraph (c) of subsection (2) is new?  The paragraph says:</P>
      <P>(c)  in a prosecution for an offence under this paragraph, it shall be presumed unless the contrary is shown by the defendant that he did not give the appropriate notification to the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
      <P>Is that a new approach to these matters, that a person is assumed to be guilty?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The Resolution as it stands is drawn in an onerous fashion and will take effect in that form.  However, between now and the Finance Bill attention will be given to the drafting of the obligations imposed by the Resolution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The normal procedure in cases of this sort is that a person's innocence is presumed until he is proved guilty rather than the reverse, as is the case in this Resolution as drafted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>First, there is in this Budget a contribution in aid of the old age pension for which the Minister may legitimately claim finance must be found.  It is about as grudging a <Col N="1447" /> concession as could be made; but he defends that on the ground that he has no money and he turns to this turnover tax on dancehalls to provide him with the revenue.  No doubt, as the Leader of the main Opposition has indicated, in those circumstances we will not oppose this because the revenue must be found somewhere.</P>
      <P>I want to say in interpolation that two matters arise from that claim by the Minister for Finance to which reference should now be made.  First, it is not true&mdash;and I think on reflection the Minister will agree with me that it is not true&mdash;when he says he is not budgeting for a surplus.  He is budgeting for an expenditure of over £250 million this year.  In that Budget he has made no provision for overestimation at all. It is true that in the financial year just closing he has achieved a miracle of spending not only all he provided in the Budget 12 months ago but all the customary reserves for overestimation. I do not believe even the present Government could achieve that performance two years in succession.  If they do, they will have achieved a record that no Government of this country has achieved in the past 40 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not arise on Financial Resolution No. 10.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>My submission is that this sum is only £15 million.  The Minister requires £¼ million to meet the concessions he has made.  It might be said this alone meets the entire charge.  In fact, on a Budget of over £250 million the Minister has in addition to this £150,000 the inevitable element for over-estimation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to direct the attention of the House to something which has escaped the attention of most Deputies here, that is, the method by which this dance tax is imposed.  If Deputies will look at the Minister's statement they will observe on page 7 when he comes to dancing he does not say he proposes to reintroduce the tax on dancing.  What he says is that he &ldquo;proposes to raise&rdquo;&mdash;note the word&mdash;&ldquo;the turnover tax on dancing to ten <Col N="1448" /> per cent.&rdquo;  I ventured to prophesy when this turnover tax was first introduced in this House at the rate of 2½ per cent that it would rise.  The Minister said yesterday the Government gave careful thought to an increase in the turnover tax right across the board to get them out of their financial difficulties and recoiled from such a procedure. I want to warn the House they are giving in the form in which this tax is imposed their first consent to an increase in the turnover tax. Bear in mind if you choose to introduce this tax on dancing again in the form of an increase in the turnover tax, you are giving in principle approval to an increase in the rate of the turnover tax.  If you can tax dancing today by this device, tomorrow you can tax food and clothes the day after and gradually go over the whole gamut of commodities affected by turnover tax.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If I may borrow this copy of the Financial Resolutions, I want to direct the attention of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle to Resolution No. 10.  May I read it for you, Sir? The heading of the Resolution is: &ldquo;Turnover Tax&rdquo;.  We cannot reach the stage in Dáil Éireann when a Resolution entitled &ldquo;Turnover Tax&rdquo; cannot be discussed as a turnover tax. That is what it is called.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Resolution reads:</P>
      <P>(1)  That&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) in the case of dances, and goods sold and services provided in connection with dances where payment for such goods or services is included in the payment in respect of admission or is a condition for admission, tax shall be ten per cent of the taxable turnover of the accountable person and the amount of tax chargeable shall be paid in accordance with regulations to be made under Part VI of the Finance Act, 1963.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I go into a dance tomorrow and get a paper hat, there is ten per cent turnover tax on the paper hat.  If I go to get my supper at the dance, there is ten per cent on my supper.  If I go to a dance and forget my dancing shoes and have to get them there, there is ten per cent on the shoes&mdash;ten per cent on the hat, ten per cent on the supper, ten per cent on anything else. I warn the House this is not dance tax.  This is an amendment of the turnover tax.  I think I know the reason why, and I want to remind the House lest old acquaintance be forgot.  I want to read to the House the attitude of the Fianna Fáil Party to dance tax. You, Sir, say I may not talk about turnover tax generally, that this is dance tax.  I am greatly influenced by your view and so I turn back to find out what Fianna Fáil think of dance <Col N="1450" /> tax, and I am glad to be able to quote Miss Kathleen Morris, who was the General Secretary of the Dancehall Proprietors' Association.  Who should know more?  She wrote to every dancehall proprietor in Ireland about the Fianna Fáil attitude to dance tax. They were in the process at the time of removing £9 million subsidy from food.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>May I point out to the Deputy that the history of dance tax does not arise at this stage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>You are telling me I must talk only about the dance tax, that I must not talk about turnover tax.  I am keeping to that ruling.  Miss Morris told us:</P>
      <P>At a special meeting ... held on 8th instant it was decided to communicate with the Fianna Fáil Party, they being the Party responsible for the abolition of the Dance Tax in 1946 and having since vigorously opposed the reimposition of same by the Coalition Government, requesting them to inform the Association of their intentions regarding the abolition of tax should they be returned to power.</P>
      <P>Let us give credit where credit is due. Fianna Fáil are consistent.  They do not propose in the Financial Resolution a dance tax.  It is a turnover tax. The Fianna Fáil Party are scrupulous, very honourable.  Miss Morris continues:</P>
      <P>I am to inform all members of the Association that I have received what the executive consider to be a favourable reply&mdash;</P>
      <P>From whom, do you imagine?</P>
      <P>&mdash;from Mr. Lemass on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party, a copy of which you will find enclosed.</P>
      <P>Following receipt of this reply from Mr. Lemass a further executive meeting was held today, the 15th instant, when the meeting confirmed their pledge of support to Fianna Fáil.</P>

      <P>This is not in order on the Resolution.  The <Col N="1451" /> Deputy will get an opportunity of going into the detail into which he is going on Resolution No. 12.  It has never been the practice to have detailed criticism of the taxes at this stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

      <P>Very well.  However, I warn the Taoiseach and the Fianna Fáil Party that this is the kind of reaction which you might expect to hear from me in regard to dance tax. <Col N="1453" /> I would have written to Deputy Booth, who would doubtless have approached the Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party, in the following terms:</P>
      <P>I have received your letter ... which has been considered by the Fianna Fáil Party committee.</P>
      <P>of which I would then be a member&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>The committee's view is that the entertainments duty on dances is an undesirable tax.  As to its abolition in the present financial year, however, a decision must necessarily await the detailed examination of the Budget introduced in the Dáil immediately prior to its dissolution, but it would be the intention of the Fianna Fáil Party to repeal it as soon as practicable.</P>
      <P>In view of this intimation of the committee's attitude, I assume it will not be desired to pursue the request for an interview with me.  It will be appreciated that I could not add anything to what is conveyed by this letter.</P>
      <P>That is the kind of letter Deputy Booth might have expected to receive from me if I were Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party.  Thank God, I am not.</P>

      <P>But that letter, or something very like it, was signed by the Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party. Now, I do not blame the members of the Fianna Fáil Party when they are presenting Resolution No. 10 feeling a little embarrassed by the recollection of the correspondence which the Leas-Cheann Comhairle has ruled we can return to in particular detail when discussing the General Financial Resolution.  We will.  But, in the interm, I hope the Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party will repair to the Library; Deputy Booth was, I think, anxious for the reference.  It is volume 130.  He can himself search the volume for the column itself.  A close perusal of the contents of the whole volume will be very instructive to him.  It is an earlier Budget introduced by the Fianna Fáil Party.  Mark you, Sir, it is an <Col N="1454" /> interesting thing that the Fianna Fáil Party went out on their ear very soon after the Budget to which I have made reference.</P>
      <P>This is a tax to which I do not object if it provides for the relief of those on whom the burdens of this Budget will fall, but I believe that the yield of this tax, plus the other revenues that will come in course of payment, would have permitted the Minister to do more than he has, in fact, charged himself to do.  I do not know how far a Party can become utterly demoralised.  I think Fianna Fáil have travelled pretty far along that road and I think the House should watch the lengths to which this Party can go under the stress of the demoralisation under which they now labour.  It is two years since I first warned this House of the way Fianna Fáil were heading.</P>

Now I want to warn the House that the introduction of this Resolution, headed &ldquo;Turnover Tax&rdquo;, so certainly as we are standing in this House, forcasts the next bolthole to which Fianna Fáil will slink as they sink further and further into the financial chaos they are bringing about in this country, and I want to warn them&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Do not make interjections if you do not want sharp answers.  I do not want to hurt any of you, particularly those of you who are but newly come to this House.  I have been <Col N="1455" /> a long time here and I warn you now that this is the first time any proposal has been made in this House to increase the rate of turnover tax.  Time and time again, when this House starts on the slippery slope towards a bad development, we always do it at the expense of some body, or some thing, which is unpopular.  Now nobody here will weep for the dancehall proprietors; everybody in the House is inclined to say: &ldquo;God knows, with the people coming out through the windows, they can well afford an increase&rdquo;. But watch.  You are taxing dancehall proprietors but the method you are employing is the turnover tax.  I am warning you that the method you employ today is opening the door to an increase of the turnover tax not only on the dancehall proprietors, who everybody feels can bear it, but it is opening the door for the increase of that tax on every section of our community.</P>

Whatever happens to this country happens to those of us who are inextricably tied to this country.  We are all in grave danger of going down.  I warn Dáil Éireann that this is a panic-stricken Government. Remember, the Minister has envisaged the possibility&mdash;I do not think it will arise&mdash;of an autumn Budget.

      <P>I do not think the Minister has adequately dealt with the point made by Deputy Cosgrave in relation to clause 2 (c) of this Resolution. This House should not make things too easy for the Revenue Commissioners in this regard.  I can well understand the situation where a man is found with a salmon.  In these circumstances, under the fisheries code, he must prove his innocence; but there is no analogy in this particular case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be quite easy for the Revenue Commissioners to approach this matter in another way.  The Minister is aware that, in other statues, it is provided that a certificate issuing from the Department under the name of an officer shall be <i>prima facie</i> proof of a certain thing.  I appreciate that the Revenue Commissioners might have difficulty with their proofs.  I do not think we should adopt the dangerous and easy expedient of saying that a man is guilty until he can prove <Col N="1457" /> he is innocent.  It could quite possibly arise that the Revenue Commissioners would have lost the notification.  In these circumstances, it is unfair to some unfortunate person to say: &ldquo;The Revenue Commissioners have been careless.  You must prove yourself to be innocent.&rdquo;  The Minister would be well advised to consider deleting this and inserting another provision such as that which I have mentioned, that a certificate would be regarded as <i>prima facie</i> proof.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Maybe Deputy Barrett did not hear my reply to Deputy Cosgrave.  The Resolution is, of necessity, very tightly drawn to ensure enforcement.  I said that, between now and the drafting of the Bill, consideration would be given to the possible softening of the regulations and also that particular attentions would be given to the question of obliging the Revenue Commissioners to acknowledge immediately notices required of the dancehall proprietors under sub-paragraph (c).  I do not think I could go beyond that at this stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I will, certainly.  In reply to Deputy Dillon, the dancehall tax, as such, when it was in operation, was generally regarded as being hardly any more, by way of benefit to the Exchequer, than the cost of its administration. To my recollection and having examined the debates to which Deputy Dillon has referred, the main purpose of the abolition of the dancehall tax was just that.  But there was another purpose, as well, in that there was wholesale evasion of the tax as it was then operated.  I think almost every Member of the House here would have personal knowledge of the attempt to evade the old dancehall tax. I remember going to dances in my young days, not being erudite enough in these matters to look for the stamp on the back of the ticket and, having paid my admission fee, being handed at the office a complimentary ticket which I handed to the man at the door.  I was a party to the evasion of <Col N="1458" /> the tax but I did not realise what I was doing.</P>

However, I say that very few Deputies can deny some personal knowledge of the type of practice to which I refer.  As well as that, there were officers of the Revenue Commissioners going around the country visiting these dances and they had to be paid to be kept in the field.  As a result of the abolition of the dance tax, that staff was withdrawn and its energies were devoted to other Revenue purposes.  Since those days, dancing has become more sophisticated.  Certainly the halls in which the dances are now being held are bigger.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully subscribe to that point of view and I had the proposition examined in great detail.  The first question that arose was whether <Col N="1459" /> the tax as it formerly existed should be reimposed.  That would have meant recruiting the type of staff that was employed for the purpose of enforcing the dancehall taxation in former days which cost a considerable amount of money and which could perhaps again cost as much as a reasonable tax would bring in and would be a futile exercise as far as the Exchequer is concerned. Therefore alternative ways of collecting the tax were examined and this was found to be the most feasible, the increasing of the turnover tax already on dancehalls from 2½ to ten per cent.  I admit that the income from it is modest but I can assure the House that I examined the matter in detail to ensure the maximum intake and the most effective enforcement.  That is the position as far as this turnover tax is concerned and it has no sinster significance of the kind attributed to it by Deputy Dillon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am obliged to confess that the Minister is a skilled debater and has a disarming way of meeting criticism.  It is well that he recognises that emphatic criticism involves no personal affront.  I think there will be general agreement that it is not a source of revenue to which a hardpressed Government must seriously turn in present circumstances.  I understand the Minister's explanation of his reluctance to turn to dancehalls but I must be permitted by the Leas-Cheann Comhairle to ask why he should be permitted to explain that if I was not permitted to elucidate&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister was fully entitled to explain the reason for his change.  In the light of the Minister's explanation of the reason for his turning to this tax rather than what we used to call the dance tax, I may say I regard this as an extremely dangerous precedent for the House and one of which Members ought to be warned.  I agree with the Leader of the Opposition that, in the circumstances, this is a tax to which we should consent; but it is a tax on dancing on which I have warned the <Col N="1460" /> House most solemnly against the principle of an increase in the turnover tax and I warned the House most solemnly that if this principle were extended, chaos would ensue.</P>
      <P>I am obliged to the Minister for his explanation of the circumstances in which he determined to resort to turnover tax.  It does not alter my view in the least of the very grave dangers attending the principle enshrined in his device but I agree with him that the tax on dancing is a suitable source of revenue, when you have nowhere else to turn to provide even so wretched a provision as 5/- for such old age pensioners as can prove themselves to be utterly destitute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>We are supporting the imposition of this tax mainly because of the fact that we believe it is something which can bear extra taxation, and also because of the fact that the money being collected can be used to relieve even the very wretched poor, which is the description which most fits those who will benefit by this extra 5/- per week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one thing which I suggest the Minister might consider in relation to this dance turnover tax&mdash;call it what you like.  There is the danger of starting an increased turnover tax under any heading.  I am sure the Minister is aware that for a number of years a situation has been allowed to continue in this country which is definitely dangerous, the situation in which, particularly in country areas, dancehalls and ballrooms licensed to hold a limited number of people, say, up to 1,500 or 2,000, are crammed full with 5,000 or 6,000 people who cannot find standing room.  It is all right saying that the Government will collect from them.  I hope the Government will not relax any of their levies or try to cut down on tax at these dances because I honestly believe that eventually there must be a serious accident if this is allowed to continue. I know that some local authorities have recently been attempting to enforce the law but, unfortunately, too many of them are too lax about it. The tendency might be to feel that the more who attend, the more the <Col N="1461" /> Government will get out of it; but there is a very serious fire hazard in a number of these halls.  It is just too bad to find 5,000 or 6,000 people crammed into a hall which is licensed to hold only 2,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the problem Deputy P. Belton has in mind is this. A person pays for admission to a dinner dance in an hotel; he sits in the ballroom and will be required to pay ten per cent on drinks purchased during the course of the evening. But, if he leaves the ballroom and goes to another part of the hotel, there will be a 7½ per cent reduction on the price.  If this is to be related to tax on a dance held in a particular premises, how is the hotel owner to differentiate?  Is he to lock <Col N="1463" /> everybody into the ballroom until they leave the premises any time a person enters the premises for the occasion of a dance?  If not, the effect will be that people will leave the ballroom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought it was understood that it is the inclusive charge for a dance and, if the dance involves supper or dinner, the price of the supper or dinner would be in the inclusive charge which would be subject to turnover tax.  But if, as happens at dances, people sit at the table and have not got their supper or dinner as part of the charge but will order a bottle of wine or gin or whiskey, that is completely outside the ten per cent turnover tax charge.  It will be paid in the ordinary way and will not be affected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Minister says is not very clearly stated in paragraph (1)(b) which says:</P>
      <P>for the purposes of this paragraph taxable turnover shall be the total amount of money received or receivable from persons admitted to a dance in respect of admission, together with, in case goods are sold or services are provided, or both goods are sold and services are provided, in connection with the dance, and payment therefore is not included in the payment in respect of admission, the total amount of money received or receivable in respect thereof.</P>
      <P>Unless the meaning of the English language has changed, this paragraph means that the ten per cent will have to be paid on every cigarette, every cheroot, every drop of intoxicating liquor, every bowl of soup and every cup of tea purchased at a dance, over and above the normal admission subscription, as long as these articles are purchased in connection with the dance.  If persons leave the dancehall and go to the hotel proper and purchase these, the ten per cent will not have to be paid, but if they are bought in the dancehall, they will be liable to the ten per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy will <Col N="1464" /> look at subparagraph (b), he will see that if these things are sold in connection with the dance and payment for them is not included in the payment in respect of admission, the tax will be paid on the total amount received in respect of the dance.  This section means that the cost of the services so provided would be chargeable to turnover tax.  It could be that the admission fee to a certain function would be a nominal one, but having paid that, the person entering would be obliged to pay inside 15/- or 20/- for a meal.  If that were the condition of entry, the total charge would be subject to turnover tax.  If you pay a full admission fee which includes drink and food served inside, the tax will be on the admission fee.</P>

Speaking for myself, I must say that some of the best dances I was ever at were not intended to be dances at all.  If there is a gathering of people and there is a good pianist present and five or six people begin to dance, as very often happens, would that come under this charge?  If that happens, these people might find themselves in the soup.  A dinner addressed by the Minister could quite easily turn into a dance if there were a good pianist there.</P>

      <P>Generally, dinner dances are held by business organisations or by people who wish to make money for charity.  They are usually run on a non-profit basis.  All these people wish to do is to clear themselves. Surely the people the Minister is after here are the dancehall people for whom dancing is big business, dances at which there may be an attendance of 2,000?  The normal dinner dance is a non-profit making event and 60 per cent of them are run by charities or by business concerns.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1469" /> That section 2 of the Finance Act, 1894, shall be amended so as to apply to certain gratuitous benefits under superannuation schemes or arrangements.</P>
    <P>It may be necessary for me to explain this Resolution.  Deputies will remember that during the debate on the Finance Bill last year there was comment about death benefits arising in certain circumstances not being liable to estate duty, on the basis that if the death benefit is not enforceable on the part of the recipient, as in the case of some death benefits, for example, in the Civil Service, therefore it is not liable to be charged for estate duty purposes.  There was some adverse comment on this and this Resolution is to cure that situation.  It will bring in a rather wider field than civil servants, that is, the field in which there are death benefits as a result of any superannuation scheme or arrangement even though the beneficiary would not have the right of enforcement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a misconception. Superannuation schemes were always liable to estate duties.  Contributory schemes were absolutely liable to estate duty.  There was a doubt as to whether non-contributory schemes were liable, but if they were not, they <Col N="1470" /> were liable to succession duty which, in most cases, was more onerous than estate duty, with the result that those liable to death duty as a result of a superannuation scheme opted to pay estate duty rather than the succession duty which was more onerous.  Last year I brought in a provision relieving any benefit arising out of a superannuation scheme of up to £5,000 from assessment.  That was done last year and at that stage it was commented upon that certain superannuation schemes were not enforceable.  I assumed that I was meeting the wishes of the House generally by bringing in this excluded benefit in this Bill.</P>

      <P>That is not the purpose for which it is intended, even though it might do that incidentally.  I should like to repeat that death benefits were always liable to estate duty. Benefits arising out of contributory schemes were always liable to estate duty, and benefits arising from non-contributory schemes were regarded as being liable to estate duty, but if not, as liable to succession duty which was more onerous.  Last year I provided that the benefits arising from non-contributory <Col N="1471" /> schemes were, in fact, liable to estate duty to remove the doubt that existed before.  I excluded benefits up to £5,000 in value from being aggregated, and at that stage it was seen that there were certain benefits outside the scope of the net.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The gravity of the present position requires no emphasis from this side of the House.  The very phraseology of the Minister's Budget indicates that the country faces a most serious situation.  In fact, in the first few paragraphs he makes the extraordinary, and certainly unusual, statement that this year we are dealing with a supplementary rather than a new Budget.  That follows ten months after last year's Budget.  This statement was followed by the plaintive inquiry: &ldquo;What went wrong with the Budget introduced last May?&rdquo; The Minister then set out the facts of the situation and a statement in relation to the deficit and other factors affecting both capital and current expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that the Budget and all the facts disclosed in the numerous documents presented to the Dáil, including The Progress Report for 1965 and the NIEC comments on it, all proclaim the failure of the Government and indicate clearly Government mismanagement in respect of the economy and, in particular, <Col N="1472" /> financial mismanagement in regard to the capital programme and current expenditure.  We said before&mdash; and I want to repeat it now&mdash;that the economy of the country is fundamentally sound but the Government have mismanaged events and the Government alone must accept responsibility for that mismanagement in 1964 and 1965.</P>
    <P>The economic and financial position in 1964 was one in which there was unlimited credit available for all kinds of purposes, even some highly speculative operations.  That situation was encouraged and fostered by Government speeches, by claims that the economy was buoyant, by assertions that prosperity was readily available, that everything was rosy in the garden and that all people had to do to ensure a continuance of that situation was to vote Fianna Fáil.  We expressed, in the early part of last year, concern at the trend of events, recognising from the figures which were published, and the facts which were disclosed by them that the economy was facing a difficult situation.  The financial and economic indices did not warrant the confident assertions or the buoyant hopes that were so freely expressed.</P>
    <P>Prior to, and during the election campaign, we expressed the view that the time had come when the Government should adopt a definite role in regard to credit policy, that credit policy should be operated through the Central Bank and that, if necessary, additional powers might be required by legislation to strengthen the role of the Central Bank and give the necessary authority to act in the manner in which central banks elsewhere operate and have operated.  When that policy was published and during the election campaign very heavy criticism, undoubtedly criticism designed to scare people, designed to create the impression that we were in some way or other after the people's money, was expressed in most of the speeches, including a speech by the Taoiseach in Castlebar reported in the <i>Irish Press</i> of March 29th in which he said:</P>
    <P>If a Fine Gael Government were elected and its declaration of intent <Col N="1473" /> already made to control banks and bank credit that was the day when the flight of capital from Ireland would start.</P>
    <P>He went on to say:</P>
    <P>As Head of the Government for the past six years I know of no circumstances existing which would justify the Government taking control of the issue of bank credit.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil were re-elected and without any policy.  In fact because no direction of control of credit was issued from the Central Bank until it was too late not merely has there been a flight of capital but, for the first time in six years, the sterling assets last year dropped by £18 million.</P>
    <P>It might well be and we have expressed the view that in certain circumstances it would be in the national interest for productive purposes to deplete the sterling assets or to draw on external resources for those purposes but last year the reduction in those assets was not for that purpose but was to pay, or to help pay, Government debts and help to provide financial assistance for industry, agriculture, and in particular, and almost exclusively, to sustain the very heavy borrowing undertaken in order to maintain the public capital programme.</P>
    <P>There is now convincing evidence that not merely was our view correct but that on May 13th the Central Bank issued certain directives to the Chairman of the Irish Banks Standing Committee. Those directives indicated that the aggregate amount of credit extended by the associated banks should not expand in relation to our resources within the State as rapidly as during the year ended 31st March, 1965.  We had pointed out during the election and prior to it that all the indices warranted some action either by the Government or by the Central Bank.  For no purpose other than the political consequences involved in an election, the Government delayed taking action, refused to take the necessary remedies until July.  The Central Bank directive went on to say that the net external <Col N="1474" /> assets of the associated banks in 1965 as a whole, together with the deposits in the Central Bank in respect of current and deposit accounts in the State, should not be lower than 22 per cent.</P>
    <P>In the Second Programme, it was laid down that the level might alternate between 27 per cent and 31 per cent.  Without any prior announcement or warning, that ratio was departed from.  The shortage of capital invested last year and the difficulty of securing loans show a complete lack of confidence in the Government.  One of the criticisms made was that that lack of confidence started a flight of capital. Without the policy being implemented, the Government last year found that not only had they difficulty in financing the programme but that they had, in fact, to seek loans on the most onerous of terms.</P>
    <P>I direct the attention of the House to the fact that the failure has not been on the part of any of the non-Government sectors in the economy. The failure is due to the Government's failure to conform with the headlines laid down in the Second Programme where it was stated in paragraph 102, that the primary responsibility rests with the Government for creating the condition conducive to the achievement of the programme.  What has happened?  The community have done their share.  Employers and workers have agreed on the principles of an incomes policy to which the Government have recently become converted but have so far done nothing to implement. Productivity has risen faster than that required by the Second Programme; savings, forecast in the Financial Report at Table 25, are expected this year to reach £127 million compared with £82 million in 1963. an increase of more than 50 per cent in three years compared with an increase in national output of 29 per cent.  This situation has resulted from Government mismanagement and the fact that the Government misjudged the indicators.</P>
    <P>I do not know, and I suppose it will never be told&mdash;certainly not for some time&mdash;what happened in the last 12 <Col N="1475" /> months.  As far as one can judge, there are two wings lending advice to the Government and the Minister for Finance, an economic section and a financial section under the Department of Finance.  The economic section deals in a watertight compartment with the economic indicators, the steps necessary and the requirements to be fulfilled in order to implement that programme.  The financial section is solely concerned with raising money. It does not matter how onerous the taxation, how severe the rate of extraction, how exhausting the operation may be as far as any sector of the economy is concerned in order to achieve the maximum revenue without any regard or consideration for the effect on the economic aspect of that operation.</P>
    <P>During all that time, while the Government have been free in offering advice to different sections, the Government have allowed in recent years the capital and current expenditure to outstrip the resources available to pay for them and quite recently directives were issued, in particular by the Minister for Health to health authorities, to wipe out deficits that have accumulated, to take steps to repay these deficits forthwith.  At the same time, the Government, in which Ministers have collective responsibility, have had an accumulation of Budget deficits in recent years.  In 1960-61 it was £730,000, in 1961-62, £710,000, in 1962-63, £4.8 million, in 1963-64, £2.2 million, in 1964-65, £4 million and this year £8 million&mdash;a total for the last six years of £20.5 million, an average during the last four years of almost £5 million per annum.  Is it any wonder that the people lack confidence, that they have become anxious and have taken steps to withdraw their savings, that one of the problems facing the Government last year was a fall in small savings of £5 million? There was also a fall in Departmental funds of £4 million and £5½ million had to be repaid for Exchequer bonds, all indicating a heavy draw and the fact that sections of the community had to get money in order to finance <Col N="1476" /> the agricultural, industrial and business operations under their control.</P>
    <P>One of the very serious situations that have arisen is the fact that last year, of a total of £28.4 million of additional credit created, £28 million was hogged by the Government and local authorities.  One of the facts that are disclosed when one reads the profusion of documents from the Department of Finance with comments on them by the NIEC is that the Government themselves do not pay any attention or do not advert to the advice given in these documents.</P>
    <P>One of the factors disclosed in the Capital Budget is that National Loans yielded £21.3 million of £68.1 million, leaving £46½ million to be sought from the banking system and foreign sources instead of £20 million or so as had been expected, a figure already above the outside figure of £18 million envisaged in the Second Programme. The statement goes on to say:</P>
    <P>Payment of interest and repayments of principal increase the debit side of the Balance of Payments and exports must be correspondingly increased in order to avoid adding to the balance of payments deficit.  In having recourse to external borrowing, the Government will be concerned to ensure that the proceeds are applied to productive investments and not consumption.</P>
    <P>That is not so.  The dollar loan sought in the US and the Deutschmark-Sterling loan sought in Germany on the most onerous terms sought by any Government on any occasion in any financial market in the world have been secured solely for the purpose of repaying debts and not for productive purposes, so that the advice given, the comments made with all the weight that should be attached to a Department of Finance publication, the views expressed by the Central Bank, are all ignored so far as the Government are concerned, but circulars are sent round to health authorities and local authorities that they are to confine the deficits that are arising.  Why have these deficits arisen in local authorities?  Because of the effect of turnover tax on their <Col N="1477" /> financial needs, on their expenditure, on the cost of running these authorities.</P>

      <P>One of the justifications which were advanced and, which in fact, had a very impressive ring when the turnover tax was introduced, was that the traditional sources of revenue were incapable of carrying any more taxation, that revenue from such traditional sources as beer, tobacco and cigarettes, spirits and petrol, was exhausted.  Deputies will recall&mdash;and it is not too long even for the shortest memory&mdash;that the turnover tax was introduced in 1963 and that tax is now bringing in £14 million or £15 million a year.  But in the 1964 Budget, within six months, this was the additional taxation that was imposed on traditional sources of revenue: £1¼ million on diesel oil; £2 million on tobacco; £1.1 million on beer and £400,000 on spirits.  That was £5 million extra revenue within six months from the traditional sources that were already exhausted.</P>
      <P>In the 1965 Budget they got another crack, although one-and-a-half years earlier they were supposed to be exhausted.  We had 3½d on 20 cigarettes; 2d on a glass of spirits; 1d on the pint of beer and 1/- on a bottle of wine, or £5.5 million extra in respect of traditional items.  That was £10.5 million inside 12 months.  This year there is over £6 million in respect of traditional sources and a total of £12.5 million altogether.</P>
      <P>Beer, which was supposed to be exhausted two years ago and could not bear any more, is taxed to produce £2.25 million this year; spirits, £1.1 million; tobacco, £1.1 million; diesel oil and petrol, £2 million, not to mention the effect&mdash;to which I shall advert later&mdash;of the increase in income tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the reasons the turnover tax was introduced, we were told, was that these traditional sources were exhausted. The position now has been reached that we have this colossal additional burden which is unwarranted and not justified.  Here again, I come to the observations of&mdash;if ever there was a misnomer it is this&mdash;the Progress <Col N="1478" /> Report for 1965, when progress in every direction was downhill.  The Progress Report said, in looking at the outlook for 1966:</P>
    <P>In making this projection, existing Budgetary policies are assumed, since one purpose in making the projection is to help to determine what budgetary changes may be required in 1966.</P>
    <P>It goes on to say&mdash;and this is the very important conclusion reached:</P>
    <P>The projected increase of 1¾ per cent in consumer prices is arrived at on the following basis.  The consumer price index in the first quarter of 1965 rose from 177 to 181 and it remained stable for the remainder of the year.  If it remains stable this would involve an increase of about threequarter per cent over the average of the four quarters of 1965. In the non-agricultural sector as a whole, the projected rise in output of four per cent and in total money incomes of five per cent would result in an increase of about a ½ per cent in the general price level.  In addition, import prices are expected to rise by about 1½ per cent and, since imports account for about one would involved a further rise in the general price level of about ½ per cent.  The combined effect of these factors would be a rise of about 1¾ per cent in the general price level.</P>
    <P>The conclusion which was reached in that Report and the comments made on it by the NIEC all accept that a rise of that amount could be sustained and might be justified, but, on top of that, the Government have now imposed as a result of the taxation involved in yesterday's Budget, a further increase of one per cent.  Is it not obvious that here again the Government have indicated guidelines, given advice freely to employers, trade unions, to traders and other groups in the community that prices should not rise?  The Government ignore that recommendation, refuse to accept the indices that are supported by the documentation issued by the Department of Finance and confirmed by a unanimous advice tendered in the <Col N="1479" /> Report and comments issued by the NIEC.</P>
    <P>One of the matters recently engaged in by Government spokesmen is the giving of free advice to different groups in the community, suggesting to the trade unions, employers' organisations, chambers of commerce, farmers, industry and to local authorities by circulars and directives issued by particular Departments, what should be done or should not be done.  Is it any wonder that any group in the community refuse to accept that advice and refuse to be influenced by it when the one group in the community who ignore all advice are the Government and the one group in the Community who are freer in giving advice and expressing comment to every section of the people are the Government and when they give advice to themselves in the form of a document published like this, they immediately afterwards ignore it in their Budget Statement?</P>
    <P>One of the factors that have been the subject of recent comment&mdash;indeed a great deal of concern has been expressed about it&mdash;is the state of industrial unrest or industrial relations. Recently, the Taoiseach went to some Fianna Fáil gathering in the Shelbourne Hotel and delivered himself of a number of ponderous platitudes on the industrial situation.  Nobody could take exception to the views he expressed or the comments he made, but one of the factors in the recent wage round discussions, one which was adverted to yesterday by Deputy O'Higgins is that the discussions between the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the employers' organisation indicated that so far as the claim made by the Trade Union Congress was concerned, it was made with an indication of a responsible attitude to the problems which affected the country, a recognition that the country could stand only a certain increase and that in that situation the claim made was made on a reasonable basis.  It may be that for individual industries, for individual trades, for particular undertakings, the claim naturally will have to be revised, and detailed negotiations and discussions may result in a different <Col N="1480" /> pattern of wage and salary adjustments in respect of that particular claim.</P>
    <P>One of the proposals we made during the last election which has been the subject of a very lengthy debate here as well as a very detailed and exhaustive recommendation by the National Industrial and Economic Council, was the introduction of a policy on prices and incomes.  We did that for the precise purpose which is recognised now by employers and workers and trade union representatives, that an orderly growth in wages and salaries was in the interests particularly of those directly concerned but also in the general interest of the economy.  During the election the Taoiseach, in a very emphatic manner, said that he wanted Fine Gael to explain their incomes policy.  In the <i>Irish Press</i> of 6th April, 1965, on the very eve of the election, there appeared the following report:</P>
    <P>The intention of Fine Gael, if elected, to introduce a system of regulating wage and salary increases, was strongly criticised by Mr. Lemass, in Mullingar, last night.</P>
    <P>He went on to say:</P>
    <P>We of Fianna Fáil do not believe that any system of this kind is workable. It has never been successfully operated in any country, except the Communist countries.</P>
    <P>I do not know what effect that had on the audience.  I imagine the only things influenced by it in Mullingar were the heifers.  Certainly it did not affect the audience.  The report continues:</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear that we are definitely against this.  If we are in Government we will not apply it. If we are in Opposition we will oppose it strongly.</P>
    <P>Only once in this country since we achieved freedom was there a wage freeze.  That was instituted by Fianna Fáil during the war.  The only other occasion on which there has been any attempt to indicate a wage or salary regulation was the recent directive issued on the eve of the Budget that people at a certain level are not to receive increases.  There may well be&mdash;<Col N="1481" /> and I do not deny it&mdash;a justification for a ceiling or for regulation in these matters but the only people who have sought to introduce regulation are Fianna Fáil.  The only criticism that can be made of the decision to do it is that the action in respect of incomes, wages and salaries, was taken too late. Obviously it is not understood properly by the Government because of the protracted and postponed introduction of it until a situation has been reached in which prices and incomes are chasing each other in an ever-rising spiral.  This is due to the fact that the Government when they introduced the turnover tax gave the green light in respect of wages and salaries and made no attempt to control prices.  Price control was introduced only when it became obvious that the price rises had entirely exhausted themselves.</P>
    <P>One of the factors responsible for the lack of confidence that has arisen here are the measures taken by the Government in recent years in respect of investments, in respect of certain Finance Act proposals.  In the 1963 Finance Act, a proviso was introduced for the first time which made it obligatory on the banks to disclose details of deposits and to make a return in respect of interest earned. Views have been expressed that this has had a deterrent effect, and although no precise figures can be given, there is a general view amongst bank managers and others in banking institutions that it meant a withdrawal of deposits.  This brings me to the point I have already mentioned, that the Revenue side of the Department of Finance, and the Government institutions, are concerned to extract the last penny and when the taxpayer has been bled white, to think up some new method to dehydrate what is left.</P>
    <P>The 1965 Finance Act introduced for the first time a proposal to aggregate insurance policies and other assets for death duty purposes.  Is it any wonder that the effect of these penal measures&mdash;measures which are entirely penal in so far as they affect all our people&mdash;at a time when one of the great problems at present for business men, farmers, and traders is the need for additional capital, for additional <Col N="1482" /> credit, in view of the inflationary effects of price rises, the cost of raw materials and the ordinary cost of running a business or enterprise, is to restrict the amount of capital which will be available?  Because for the first time insurance policies and other assets are aggregated for death duty purposes.  Is it not obvious that all these factors, the 1963 Finance Act provisions and the 1965 provisions regarding insurance policies and other assets, have all combined to leave no other way out for the private sector of the community but to reduce their operations and to seek elsewhere to get either an adequate return on their investments or an adequate method by which to finance their operations? One of the claims made for previous Budgets was the fact that the money was raised to pay for some specific service or undertaking, to give some benefit to some section of the community. That cannot be said on this occasion.  If there is one thing for which at least the Minister for Finance deserves credit it is for a disarming honesty in presentation.  It is not very typical of Fianna Fáil.</P>

      <P>If any practical proposal were involved in this, it would have our support.  If the Government had decided that extra moneys were required to assist the west of Ireland, had decided to revive the Local Authorities (Works) Act to provide employment in the off-season, or enable the drainage problem to be tackled even on a limited scale, they would have been justified.  There is nothing for health, although we have been through an exercise in recent weeks of discussing health even to the extent where people might be convinced that there is a proposal or some prospect of an improvement in the <Col N="1483" /> health services, and reluctantly the Government have come to accept the idea of a health scheme based on insurance. This year, faced with the extremely high rise in rates, the only relief&mdash;although it is not really a relief &mdash;is the proposal to transfer the added burden in respect of health charges to the central Exchequer.  There is nothing in the Budget for education.</P>
      <P>Then there is the final insult to the social welfare recipients.  On page 13 of his speech the Minister, again with refreshing candour, said:</P>
      <P>Though prices have not risen since May last, when I announced substantial increases in benefits in the budget, some social welfare recipients, particularly pensioners, would find life harsher as a result of this budget if no gesture of relief were made.</P>
      <P>What significant words&mdash;&ldquo;No gesture of relief.&rdquo;  And this gesture is postponed until November! Some of them will not live to get even the gesture.</P>
      <P>The facts disclosed in the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> indicate that any measures taken which would have a depressive and disincentive effect on the economy were not justified, that the assumptions were made on the basis of existing budgetary policies being continued.  That was formulated after a careful assessment of the situation and the recommendation was made that they should continue.</P>
      <P>Probably the most striking condemnation of the Government's failure has been in respect of employment. Table 5 of the Department of Finance Report gives the figures for employment. It is hardly necessary to remind Deputies of the Fianna Fáil plan and promise to provide 100,000 new jobs. Subsequent to that, after the Government had been re-elected, with all the statistics, information and data available to them, the programme was slightly revised.  The number of new jobs to be achieved by 1970 was 87,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now let us look at what has happened. Table 5 indicates that employment has now dropped to the lowest figure ever in the history of the country. <Col N="1484" /> In a year in which we celebrate the 50th anniversary of the 1916 Rising, we have fewer people employed than ever before.  Not merely is that so, but the flight from the land has risen to more than twice its former level.  There was a drop of 24,000 between 1963 and 1965 and a further drop of 14,000 between 1964 and 1965.  The NIEC comment, at pages 24 and 25 of the document, is that the total number expected to be at work in 1966 is approximately 1,046,000 compared with 1,056,000 in 1963.  Instead of providing additional jobs, we have lost 10,000.  Either the target was wrong&mdash; but this was never admitted&mdash;or the plans made to carry it into effect were defective.  The Report goes on to say that if the target is to be reached, it will require an increase of 22,000 jobs a year.</P>
    <P>I have asked before and I want to repeat: When is the Second Programme going to be revised with some advertence to reality and some adherence to the facts?  To quote from page 29 of the Progress Report:</P>
    <P>Past experience suggests that it will be extremely difficult to increase employment at this pace.</P>
    <P>Surely this is the understatement of the year&mdash;&ldquo;to increase employment at this pace.&rdquo;  When they cannot keep the people in employment employed, how can be it increased?</P>
    <P>As far as emigration is concerned, the rate of increase is about 10,000 per annum more than anticipated in the Programme.  This document states:</P>
    <P>It is clear from this review of progress in the first three years of the programme that the growth rates required in the rest of the period to meet the targets will pose a number of formidable difficulties, especially in the case of employment.</P>
    <P>The significant comment is made that although employment has increased in the Six Counties, although it has increased in Britain and the plans operated in these cases have resulted in increased employment, here, although the community has done its share&mdash; productivity has risen, savings have <Col N="1485" /> increased and employers and workers are generally agreed on a wages and incomes policy&mdash;everyone in this country except the Government have done their part, yet employment is still declining, emigration is increasing and the indices are that the numbers at work will further decline in the period ahead.</P>
    <P>One of the facts disclosed in the recent figures is that revenue was down, that there was a failure for savings to increase and to have a general buoyancy in revenue.  Although savings increased over and above what was projected in the Second Programme, those who had their money in the Post Office Savings Bank and in savings certificates withdrew it.  The Minister proposes to consider in the future a report of some committee or group to advise him on the matter.  Until then the only change proposed is an increase in respect of saving certificates.</P>
    <P>One of the serious effects of this Budget&mdash;contrary to the advice tendered in all this documentation&mdash;is the increase in taxation, in particular the increase in respect of income tax. The burden of taxation becomes greater on relatively static incomes. The increase in income tax under PAYE is in fact the equivalent of a wage cut.  There might well be some justification for an increase in income tax, if there were relief in respect of personal allowances, the married allowance, the dependent relative allowance, the housekeeper allowance or any of the other allowances under the income tax code.  These allowances have been the subject of much discussion in recent years on Finance Bills and on Budget debates.  There was a general acceptance and recognition by previous Ministers as well as Deputies on all sides of the House that the present rates of relief in respect of these allowances required to be revised. There is justification, because of the rise in the cost of living since these rates were last revised, for an absolute as well as a relative revision of them.  But this Budget imposes heavy additional tax in respect of income tax without any relief, with one small exception, a child allowance for <Col N="1486" /> children over 11 years of age.  The cost of that is trifling.</P>
    <P>I believe the proposal to increase income tax will have a deterrent and negative effect with consequences for the nation.  I adverted recently in this House to the need for a carefully planned order of priorities.  Here again the recommendations of the NIEC and the Progress Report on the Second Programme as well as pointing out the difficulties of financing the capital programme stressed the urgent need for an orderly approach to the arranging of priorities in respect of public expenditure.</P>
    <P>Some years ago a Building Advisory Council was established.  So far nothing has been heard from that except that a complicated questionnaire was issued to the building trade.  That advisory council was established not to represent the industry concerned or aspects of the industry.  Those appointed to it did not represent or were not authorised to speak for those whom they are supposed to represent.  That is no reflection on them.  Many of them are eminent in their own way.  But they were hand-picked and not for the purpose of representing the industry.</P>
    <P>One of the problems affecting the building trade and the economy generally is a succession of stop-go policies. We have the situation in which there is unlimited credit for building construction or any type of enterprise for a period.  Then, contrary to all the Government speeches about unlimited buoyancy in every aspect of the economy, whether in the public or private sector, builders, those engaged in the construction industry, those engaged in industry and agriculture, found a rapid and severe restriction of credit without notice, without warning, without any regard to the problems involved or to the repercussions on the industry or those employed in it.</P>
    <P>The Government now have, and certainly the country has, some idea of the gravity of the situation in respect of the capital programme, of the difficulty of securing sufficient money to pay for the programme of public expenditure. Remember, it was the Government exceeded their own limits in defiance <Col N="1487" /> of the targets laid down in the Second Programme.  If that programme requires to be revised, then it should be revised.  It should be publicly revised and not revised piecemeal, revising the capital end at one stage and finding then, after a few months, the employment targets have not been achieved.</P>
    <P>The effect of the attempts of the Government recently to secure sufficient money to finance this programme indicates general lack of confidence. Many of us remember some years ago when we availed of and used the Marshall Aid loan, used it for productive purposes, used it to drain land, used it for the purpose of the Land Reclamation Scheme, used it for the purposes of expanding employment and schemes like the Local Authorities (Works) Act, and we were criticised.  One of the advertisements published by Fianna Fáil was the sign of the pawnbroker to suggest that the country was in pawn.  Never in our time in Government, no matter what the difficulty, had we to hawk the credit of this country in every financial market in the world and then accept the most onerous terms a Government in this country ever had to accept, not for productive purposes, not for the purpose of putting people into employment, not even for the purpose of trying to keep them in employment, but for the purpose of paying debts accumulated by the Government.</P>
    <P>One of the recent developments so far as Government activity is concerned has been the quite remarkable growth of the Civil Service machine. I have always expressed the view, and I want to repeat it, that I believe in paying adequately all public servants.  It was we introduced Civil Service Arbitration and Conciliation for that purpose, in order to give a proper system of wage and salary adjustments to those employed in the public service.  However, in the state of this country with a declining population, with fewer people in employment, is there any justification for the Government to take, all over the city, the most expensive buildings in order to house more civil servants to direct fewer and fewer people, to administer <Col N="1488" /> the affairs of this country, with fewer people in employment, in order to provide services for those who are still here?  There is one justification. These buildings are being provided mainly on what is described as the &ldquo;never-never&rdquo; system.  We only pay the rent.  The capital cost is provided by other means, but it indicates a general approach of a reckless kind to the problems which affect the country, in so far as we are prepared to get other bodies to provide accommodation for increased numbers of civil servants in defiance of a very emphatic, very clear and a generally welcomed statement in 1957 by the then Minister for Finance that he was reviewing the Civil Service machine in order to see how it could be made more efficient and how the numbers could be reduced.</P>
    <P>There were leading articles in the newspapers complimenting the Minister on his foresight and on the manner in which he approached this problem.  Now after nine years we find the numbers have increased. There is a promise somewhere in this Budget Statement that the Minister for Finance intends to get some group together to consider the position.  I gather he intends to get the services even of some of those who have retired&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to consider the problem.  Whatever about what has been done in respect of the Building Advisory Council, if this is to be effective, let people be selected not on any personal basis but on the basis that they represent established organisations in the country and that because of their business experience, because of their standing in a particular industry or trade they have been selected by those in it to represent them or to act as chairman or in some other capacity for the coming year or whatever the period is. Let it be done on a proper basis. The suggestion that this can achieve a reduction in the number of civil servants is not warranted because the indications are that the policy of this Government is to festoon themselves <Col N="1489" /> with advice of every type, to bring out more and more data, advice, comments, recommendations, and having got them all, to ignore completely every recommendation and every advice.</P>
      <P>One of the pieces of advice that were given in the CIO reports was to take steps to rationalise industry.  I want to express appreciation of and commend the progressive approach of the distilling industry in this matter.  The recent announcement that three distilleries have decided to amalgamate brings to the forefront the fact that many groups in the community&mdash;and this is the latest example&mdash;have taken energetic measures and taken the necessary action to rationalise their procedure and to improve the industry concerned with a view to marketing, selling and, in particular, exporting. Very often attention is directed to investment in industry.  The distilling industry is one long-established that provides very valuable employment. It uses native raw material that sells a product of the highest standard, and all financed out of their own efforts and their own energies.  The fact that they have taken this decision is an indication of their awareness of the need to modernise and streamline their efforts, particularly with a view to the export trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have personal knowledge of the efforts these companies have made individually, by sending trade missions to the United States, to develop an export trade.  Occasionally comments have been made that sufficient effort was not made because of a lack of an energetic approach, a sufficient determination to seek new markets, without advertence to the fact that the principal competitor, Scottish distillers, with very large capital resources, have very considerable sums available for promotional activities and for advertising, and that relatively small individual concerns have to compete with these undertakings.  I believe that this proposal is one that indicates a progressive approach to the problem and a determined effort to seek new outlets.  It is for that reason that I regard the additional taxes in this Budget in respect of spirits and also <Col N="1490" /> in respect of beer as detrimental.  In regard to beer, here again we have native industries using native raw materials, dispersed throughout the country and paying good wages, in the main, to male workers.  These are the industries which are now being taxed without any relief.</P>
    <P>One of the recent inquiries into the price of drink directed publicans to reduce prices by 2d, even though, in many cases, prices had not been increased. That inquiry was dishonest in the light of the recent Budget decision.  It was dishonest because it meant only a temporary postponement of the increase and that increase is now being garnered not by the people immediately involved in the trade but by the State for revenue purposes.</P>
    <P>One of the facts disclosed by all the information that has been published and the recommendations contained in the NIEC comments, as well as the Department of Finance report on the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i>, is that the economy would and could right itself if it were left alone.  If no depressive action were taken, if no additional penal taxes were put into effect, if there were no interference at Government level with the recovery that could and would take place, if the Government stood aside, then the economy would right itself.  That is the basis of the recommendation made and the basis of the advice given.</P>
    <P>One of the facts evident from recent Government activity is that they have mismanaged the economy and that they have misjudged the indicators and the indices.  They have failed to give the lead.  They have failed to provide the incentive.  They have failed to give that air of confidence so essential if this country is to right itself.  I have repeatedly expressed the view&mdash;I repeat it now&mdash;that our people are capable of rising to the challenge, and not only the challenge of the present but of the future, and they are as capable now, probably more capable than ever before, of meeting difficulties and surmounting them.  Many of them are better educated, better trained, better <Col N="1491" /> equipped than ever before.  Our people have now as good a sense of patriotism as they ever had in the past and they are prepared to apply that to the needs of the nation as well as to the needs of their particular locality.</P>
    <P>One of the excuses and one of the justifications for this Budget will be balance of payments difficulty.  That will be followed by the phrase: &ldquo;Well, you know, the same situation has developed in Britain; they are having balance of payments difficulties, too.&rdquo; The unthinking may fall for it, but there is a very clear distinction: British balance of payments difficulties are due almost exclusively to heavy defence commitments east and south of Suez.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to suggest now that the lack of confidence which pervades this country at the moment and which is of quite serious dimensions in many spheres, which has been demonstrated by the withdrawal of private investors, by the need for the Government to repay Exchequer loans, by the feeling <Col N="1492" /> that there is a lack of leadership, has been engendered by the clear demonstration that the Government feel frustrated, frustrated in face of mounting problems, frustrated by their own futility to deal with them.  We can give, and we will, what the country needs &mdash;the leadership necessary and the direction and purpose so essential for progress.  If it gets that, the country can surmount its difficulties and the people can be assured that we can go forward to a higher standard of living, to better prospects, to confidence not merely in ourselves but confidence too that an independent Ireland can provide its people with all that to which they are entitled.</P>

      <P>I am quite sure that in the years to come this Budget and the people who framed it will be known by many different names.  We have had Budgets in the past&mdash;the Hairshirt Budget, the black Budgets, the grey Budgets, and many others. This Budget is characterised by nothing so much as its absolute colourlessness. Apart from the fact that, as Deputy Corish said yesterday, the Budget is being used as an instrument to collect more taxes, there is no attempt in the Budget to try to direct the nation, to try to point the way for the nation and, in fact, improve its position, or get it out of the sorry mess into which the present Government have led it.</P>
      <P>The amount of money required to run the country in the next 12 months is truly staggering.  The method by which it is proposed to raise the extra money needed can only be described as scandalous.  Apparently the Government have reached the stage where they feel that, so long as they protect their own interests, they no longer have any responsibility for explaining to the country that the proper running of the country is a matter of interest to them. It is an extraordinary thing that when one goes through the list of taxes, one finds that the items which are taxed, with one or two exceptions, are ones which a few years ago the Government said should in no circumstances be asked to carry more taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1493" /> One remembers the many stories spread by Government Ministers and, indeed, by the Taoiseach himself over the past 12 months: first, the wonderful country we were living in, the fact that everything in the garden was lovely and we did not need to worry about our future.  That was in March and April of last year.  That was followed by the doleful statement that things were getting bad and the one bright spot all along the way was that the Minister for Local Government continued to say there was plenty of money for housing.  Now we find there is no money for anything.</P>
    <P>The most extraordinary thing about the whole Budget statement was the fact that the Minister made no attempt of any kind at any stage to refer to the question of employment or unemployment in this country.  It almost seemed as if those were bad words, words which, in no circumstances, he should introduce into his Budget lest he might be questioned at a later stage about the facts or figures he gave.  So he gave none at all.  He hopes, of course, that everybody else will, like himself, avoid the issue.  But he can be assured that the issue will not be avoided.  He can be assured that we want to know what has happened. Why has the situation deteriorated so badly?  Why has the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> gone completely on the rocks?  Why was there such a lack of foresight when this Programme was being prepared?  In this House I stated that I did not consider the Second Programme a real programme; it was something like <i>Old Moore's Almanac</i>; somebody wanted to make a few shillings and so somebody sat down and predicted &mdash;inaccurately, of course&mdash;what might possibly happen within the next 12 months.  The only difference was that, in this Almanac, the period was extended until 1970.  One after the other of the projected targets in the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> has come to grief.  The best thing to do now would be to forget that it ever existed.</P>
    <P>The situation where we had a proposed expansion of industrial employment to take up not alone the numbers <Col N="1494" /> leaving agriculture but, in fact, to absorb extra people before 1970 has now been completely reversed.  The number of people who are leaving agriculture has increased so rapidly that the people who have been absorbed in industrial employment represent only a fraction of those who are being forced to flee from the land because of the Government's inept handling of agricultural problems.</P>
    <P>Lest there be any idea that the next 12 months holds anything for agriculture, let me refer to Table 5 of Current Budget Tables, 1966, in which it is made quite clear that the estimate of Government expenditure in relation to agriculture for 1966/67 is down by approximately £1½ million and, in fact, that subsidies on butter, milk and milk products are the only items in relation to which there is any substantial increase, an increase of £1,906,000.  However, we note that bacon is to come down considerably.  Have we decided we will not be able to sell bacon any longer in Britain?  Have we decided that the pig must be forgotten, along with all the other Fianna Fáil promises?  In fact, the figures for the calved heifer scheme have dropped by £345,000.  There is a bit of a fiddle there.  I am quite sure the Minister and the Government were thinking of it when this was being prepared, because the original amount put into the Budget for the calved heifer subsidy, when it was being introduced, was something around £345,000 and, by some miscalculation, the figure was exceeded by over £2 million.  Now, the figure of £2,500,000 is left in.  I am quite sure the Taoiseach knows, the Minister for Finance knows and definitely the Minister for Agriculture should know, that the figure of £2,500,000 is not realistic and that, by the end of the year, when he comes to calculate, he will have a nice little bit on the side which he can use for something else.</P>
    <P>We have been hearing an awful lot about arterial drainage, from the draining of the Shannon and various rivers. According as Deputies died, the schemes moved from county to county and from constituency to constituency. The only one which seemed to hold its <Col N="1495" /> place was the Boyne.  May be we are a bit healthier there.  Not many of us died but at last we reached the situation where the Boyne was to be started in February 1966.  We now find that that cannot be done.  Some time in 1967, it might possibly start.  However, it is rather significant to see, in the figures here, that the amount which it is estimated will be spent on arterial drainage is down by £260,000 for the year. That does not look as if there will be any improvement or any increase in the amount of our arterial drainage to be done.</P>
    <P>Similarly, grants for poultry houses and equipment are down by £9,000 and forage harvesting equipment grants are down by £16,000.  Departmental capital expenditure on land and buildings is down by £169,000 and rural electrification is down by £650,000. The gem of them all, capital for the Agricultural Credit Corporation, Limited is down by £2,148,000.  Is that because the Agricultural Credit Corporation have been told they are no longer supposed to look to the Government for money to lend to the farmers? Must they now go out to farming and business interests in the country and attempt to borrow it themselves?  Is that why this has happened or have we reached the stage where the Government will now try to foist their own responsibilities on somebody else and ask them to carry them for them?</P>
    <P>Over the past six months, we have had a spate of speeches from Ministers, from Parliamentary Secretaries and from an occasional Fianna Fáil Deputy who ventures out into the deep water of industrial relations in this country and all of them have been stressing that there must be some way of settling the wage problem, that there must be some way of settling industrial disputes and, above all, that there must be some regulation by which the workers of this country will not be allowed to take more out of the national kitty than is in it.  After all this advice had been given, and after a number of discussions had taken place between what Deputy S. Flanagan, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, referred to, <Col N="1496" /> the other evening, as the &ldquo;ICTU&rdquo;&mdash;he did not refer to the other group as the &ldquo;FUE&rdquo;, the Federated Union of Employers&mdash;the Government stated that the economy of the country could not carry more than three per cent for the low-paid workers.  Everybody was wondering who came into that category and, the day before yesterday, the Government decided that the category was from £1,200 down.  Those in receipt of £1,200 up were not to be included but those in receipt of £1,200 down were to have not more than three per cent.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether those who talk about these things at dinners, dances, and so on, really appreciate the situation.  I do not know if they really know what it means, in cold cash, when one talks about a three per cent increase.  I am quite sure that there was a feeling among the £4,000 to £6,000 a year people who were recommending that this should be done that they were definitely saving the economy of the country. They were telling the Government what should be done and were ensuring that those horrible people who, in their view, were ruining the economy of the country by attempting for a number of years to get a living wage out of it would not succeed.  Could we not try to make the people responsible for this recommendation realise that there are hundreds of thousands of workers in this country whose wage is less than £9 per week? A very big number of them are working for between £8 10. 0. and £7 10. 0. a week.  Their social welfare stamp increased by 1/5d per week with effect from 1st January, representing about one per cent of their income.  If the Government say that they are to get only three per cent, it means, in real cash, only two per cent because they have already handed over one per cent of it to the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, since the last increase was granted, there has been an increase in the cost of living of almost 11 per cent.  If those people who are attempting to live and rear a family on a week's wages must now accept three per cent&mdash;and the 11 plus one <Col N="1497" /> is 12&mdash;they will be ten per cent worse off than they were when the ninth round of wage increases was negotiated. It must be awfully difficult for people who never knew what it was to have to count what money was required to run their house for the week to understand that those on a low fixed income have to count every penny and that 1/5d out of their wage packet is a substantial sum.  It means that in that week and for the weeks in which it has been taken, members of the family had to do without something which they needed in order that it could be paid.  Then the ridiculous nonsense we have from Government Departments speaking from the lofty heights, people who, as I have said, never knew what it is to need a week's wages, are prepared to pontificate and talk about the workers of the country ruining the economy.</P>
    <P>The position is&mdash;and the Minister for Finance might as well face up to it&mdash;that before the Budget was introduced, the three per cent which the Taoiseach was laying down was ridiculous.  After the Budget was announced, it was doubly ridiculous because there is not a chance in hell of the workers accepting three per cent for what they lost over two years and what he has imposed upon them within the past few hours.  We might as well face up to facts because it appears in this country, if we get people in high enough places to talk about things, the people will believe it will come true.  Now the cloud cuckoo land in which many people have been living is about to burst over their ears if they are not prepared to face up to the fact that the workers of this country are entitled to a decent living.  If they are not going to get that decent living, then the Government have another think coming.</P>
    <P>The whole question of whether or not the budget was imposing extra taxation on certain sections was discussed briefly last night.  Let me just run over this.  First of all&mdash;income tax. I do not know whether or not the gentlemen who were responsible for presenting this Budget to the House <Col N="1498" /> went to the trouble of checking on the figures which were available to them as well as to us over the past few months.  I put down a question here about income tax, which was answered last May.  I had a further question recently.  In May of 1938 some of my predecessors asked a question, and right down through the years, we can get the comparisons which are necessary to prove whether or not the ordinary worker in this country is paying his fair share, more than his fair share, or less than his fair share of income tax.</P>
    <P>The information we glean from those questions, together with other information which we got from other sources, was used in a debate here recently on a suggestion that the Budget should make some preparation to ease the tax burden on the lower-paid workers.  Apparently the people who prepared this income tax section of the Budget did not bother their heads checking the facts because they are simply these, that right along the way it has become very evident that the Government have deliberately increased the impost of income tax on the lower-paid, the least able to pay who have been asked to pay a bigger amount than those who are really well paid.  Perhaps that is human nature; perhaps the well-to-do will ensure that the less well-to-do, who have no influence on this, will be made to carry more than their share and, in that way, save themselves from paying their rightful share of tax.</P>
    <P>The 6d in the £, which in effect is what it means on ordinary PAYE, will be a very heavy impost on the people to whom I am referring here today. The man who is earning £6. 5s. 0d. per week will, in effect, have to pay, in future, 5/3d in the £ on all he earns over that figure.  Let me refer to the classical example&mdash;the man from the country who drives into the city every morning, leaving home around 6.30 a.m.; works a very hard day on a building site&mdash;and works on a job at which many people in this House would not last for one hour&mdash;and goes back home in the evening, reaching home at maybe 7, 8 or 9 o'clock.  If he is lucky, he may get from his employment <Col N="1499" /> at the end of the week a wage packet of £10 or £12.  He is a single man, possibly he looks after his mother who is not 60 or 65 years of age, and is not ill.  Maybe there are younger brothers or sisters who are not working and are still at the age when they require attention.  What does he get above £6. 5s. 0d. per week?  He pays income tax on every pound.  The fact that he has to run a car into the city does not seem to matter; he gets no rebate on that.  Just to show that the Minister for Finance has not forgotten him, he has added 4d per gallon to his petrol and 25 per cent to his road tax.</P>
    <P>That is the way the Government are prepared to treat the ordinary people. That is the classical example.  Anybody who likes to go out to the building sites in this city or in any big town will find hundreds of those people to whom I have referred.  If they do not work there, what happens them?  They go back on the labour exchange and then they are a charge on the State; but, while they are working, the State takes its pound of flesh and, apparently, is prepared to continue to do so.  The increase in the price of petrol is covered there also.</P>
    <P>To go back to income tax for a moment, the only thing which has been allowed is an extra £30 a year given as an allowance to the person who has a child or children, over 11 years of age, those who are attending school and those who are apprenticed to a trade.  Again, I do not know whether the Minister has taken into account what this means.  A sum of £30 at 5/3d in the £ is worth around £8 per year.  I wonder what extra it is proposed that such a person can do with £8 a year, particularly if it is the man to whom I have referred who has to drive in and out of town each day. He will already have to pay most of it on his increased motor tax for the year.</P>
    <P>Tobacco has been referred to and yesterday evening we had the greatest example of government-by-muddling I have seen for a long time in this <Col N="1500" /> House.  We had the Minister making his statement.  The Minister, I am quite sure, is a very decent man&mdash;and somebody referred to him as such here yesterday evening; we all know that&mdash; but even decent men can do things in a stupid kind of way.  He presented here yesterday evening, first of all, his Budget Statement and then the Financial Resolutions.  The Budget Speech was in ordinary plain language that anyone could understand and, without any shadow of doubt, there was a reference to the price of cigarettes and tobacco.  Cigarettes were increased by an equivalent of 2d per packet of 20 and a corresponding level on manufacturers' stocks, it was supposed, would bring in £1.1 million.  During the debate later on yesterday evening, the Minister was not quite sure, when he was asked, if this was 2d per packet, particularly when it was pointed out to him that in the cork and filter-tip cigarettes, there is very much less tobacco than in the ordinary cigarette.  Deputy Booth, anxious no doubt to be helpful, pointed out that it was the Financial Resolutions we were debating.  He was perfectly right but he seemed to think that was the only answer to it.</P>
    <P>What we wanted to know and what I want to know now is who gets the difference?  The Minister mumbled that it was 1.3d on the cork-tipped and, if this is true, there would be about three-farthings dropping to somebody else.  Do we take it, because of a classical piece of Government muddling, the tobacco manufacturers will pick up three-farthings per packet of 20 cigarettes?  If anybody says it was not intended to be so, I may say that I got a copy of the <i>Evening Press</i>, and not alone did they have the increased prices of the various commodities but they had a picture of an open packet of cigarettes, with a caption saying that they were up by 2d and these cigarettes were cork-tipped. Somebody was either making a mistake or trying to be very smart. This kind of thing should not be allowed in this House.  No Minister for Finance should come into the House with a Budget and ask the House to support it when he does not know what is in it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1501" /> The <i>Evening Press</i> did it very well. They had a heading: &ldquo;Pension increase of five bob&rdquo;.  Does the Government remember what happened the last time a similar heading appeared in the newspapers, when we had unfortunate people from all over the country writing to Deputies and Senators and everybody else they thought had any influence, asking why they were not getting the pension increase which was promised to them and which appeared in the newspapers?  There are still people in this country who evidently believe that because a thing is printed in the newspapers, it must be the truth, even if it only appears in the <i>Evening Press.</i></P>
    <P>The only people who will get this small increase are those who have no means.  What did the Minister say about it in his speech?  He said:</P>
    <P>Though prices have not risen since May last, when I announced substantial increases in benefits in the Budget, some Social Welfare recipients, particularly pensioners, would find life harsher as a result of this Budget if no gesture of relief were made.  I cannot, however, do very much with the extremely limited means available to me in spite of the increase in taxes.  The £¼ million, which is all I have available, will, however, finance an increase of five shillings a week, from 1st November next, for persons with no means, in non-contributory old age, blind and widows' pensions and in the personal and adult dependant rates of unemployment assistance.  It will also cover a similar increase from that date in the infectious diseases and disabled persons' maintenance allowances administered by the Department of Health.</P>
    <P>What the Minister said was that those who have an income, according to his Department, of less than £26 5s. a year and who are applicants for non-contributory old age pensions will get five shillings per week from 1st November next and that nobody else will get anything from this Budget.  When people are printing items in the newspapers they should take great care that <Col N="1502" /> they should not cause hurt and annoyance to the unfortunates to whom five shillings is a lot of money.</P>
    <P>The people in receipt of unemployment assistance and non-contributory widows' and blind pensions and those in receipt of infectious diseases and disability allowances, those of them who are still alive on 1st November, will be very grateful to get the additional five bob but the offer of five bob to a small section of Social Welfare recipients in a Budget which imposes taxation of the magnitude imposed here and which will make life harsher for those people can only be described as scandalous.  The hardship imposed on these people who will qualify for this five shillings must also be imposed on people who are in receipt of more than £26 5s, on the people who are in receipt of contributory old age pensions and who are in receipt of unemployment and disability benefit.  There is nothing given to them.  They will only have to struggle on.</P>
    <P>The Minister only had a £¼ million and the way in which he used it shows what the priorities are in the minds of the Government.  When everything had been done and everything they could take had been taken they suddenly discovered that a £¼ million could be given to some people.  They gave it to people who have nothing. That is what we have been getting from this Government over the years.</P>
    <P>With respect to the increase in the tobacco tax, we tried to get the Minister to agree that those who smoke plug tobacco should get some consideration but the Minister was not prepared to consider that.  He felt that they were not any worse off than the people who smoke flake.  I am quite sure that everybody in this House will realise that a normal working man will smoke 20 cigarettes a day.  That is an extra shilling a week which represents another one per cent of the three per cent increase in wages which the Taoiseach has been recommending. His three per cent is getting very small.</P>
    <P>He goes on then to increase the taxation on what Deputy Seán Dunne referred to many years ago as the <Col N="1503" /> poor man's pint.  I am a Pioneer myself, as most Deputies know, but because of that, I do not believe that nobody should take a drink.  Any man who can afford to drink, who can pay for it and who enjoys it should be able to have a drink in moderation. I do not see any reason why he should not but the suggestion that the man who likes a pint and wants to have it should have to pay extra for it, the suggestion that the Government should decide that they can find money in no other way than by taxing that very small luxury, is one that should not be made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to that.  The question of raising taxation by such methods is one of the things we have objected to down through the years.  We believe it is wrong to have this type of taxation.  I am sure the Taoiseach has not moved so far away from his constituents that he does not appreciate the fact that there are very many of them who enjoy a pint.  If these people have only one pint every night, they will now think a lot less of him because they have to pay extra for it.  The money could have been raised in some other manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tax on spirits has been increased. There may be some justification for that but I am informed by those who know more about it than I do that this increase is likely to have an effect on the amount of spirits consumed and on the production of spirits in this country. If that happens, it will be a very ill thing for the country in general.  The tax on table waters has been increased and this is on a par with the turnover tax on the ice cream and the box of matches some years ago.  When the turnover tax was introduced, Deputy MacEntee, who was so very noisy in this House last night, had a solution in so far as ice cream was concerned.  He said there was no reason why the amount of ice cream could not be reduced.  He said the same with regard to the box of matches.  He also said <Col N="1504" /> that matches could be dealt with by taking a few matches out of the box and again that advice which was not good was taken.  You cannot take a little out of a bottle of lemonade or a bottle of mineral waters.  It is like taking pennies from children's pockets.</P>
    <P>I have no comment to make on the tax on wines.  The firearms duty appears moderate.  The extra taxation on mechanically-propelled vehicles makes it appear that the Government are determined to push up the price of motoring to an extent where once again no one will be able to run a car except the wealthy.  At present we are very glad to know that most workers who have to travel any distance to work use mechanically-propelled vehicles.  It is a big struggle for them to pay for those vehicles but they must either have them, or not work.  I do not think the Government are helping those people in adding on one-quarter.</P>
    <P>I wonder would the Minister try to explain the justification for this increase? Why was it put on?  He must know.  All these people who run cars&mdash;and I am sure he meets as many as I do&mdash;complain that the taxation on a car, not taking insurance into account, is often more than the actual value of the car.  These people buy an old car.  They spend their spare cash on it, and then try to make it roadworthy. Now, for their pains, the Government say they must pay an extra quarter in taxation.</P>
    <P>We are in agreement with the Government in regard to the dancehall tax. We were opposed to the Government when the Taoiseach, who was then Minister for Industry and Commerce, told the dancehall proprietors that he was against a tax on dancehalls.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle drew a very fine line today between whether this is a dancehall tax or a turnover tax on dancing.  I feel that commercial dancehalls should be asked to pay this tax of a few shillings.  I see no reason why they should not.</P>
    <P>I was rather surprised to find that the amount which it is estimated will accrue from this tax is £150,000.  That appears to me to be a small sum.  I <Col N="1505" /> feel that someone has miscalculated. I am not &ldquo;with it&rdquo;.  I do not like the type of pop music which seems to draw crowds to the dancehalls, but despite that, I travel around and I see that the dancehalls are crammed with thousands of people who do not pay the 2/6, or 3/-, or 4/-, which the Minister referred to, but who pay as much as 10/- and 12/6, for the doubtful pleasure of squeezing into these halls and standing there all night listening to someone who cannot sing attemping to put across the most recent addition to the pop charts.  As I say, I am not &ldquo;with it&rdquo;, but it seems to me that the number of people, and particularly the number of young people, who pay to go into these dancehalls would represent a far greater amount than £150,000.  There is already a tax of 2½ per cent so this is an addition of 7½ per cent.</P>
    <P>The fact that the Government are now going to get some money from that source should not blind them to the fact that, in many cases, the law is being contravened, and 3,000, 4,000 or 5,000 people are crushing their way into dancehalls designed for less than half that number.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I remarked earlier that for some reason the Minister in making his speech seemed to fight completely shy of the situation in which this country is badly affected by unemployment and emigration.  I do <Col N="1506" /> not know whether or not that was deliberate.  The Minister seemed to think it might be a good idea, that if he said nothing about it, no one else would bother.</P>
      <P>The position is that despite all the talk we have had about incentives and improvements in the employment position, we find that the opposite is the case, and that the number of people leaving the country is again going up by leaps and bounds.  The position about employment is that over the past few years, overall employment appeared to be growing a little, but at a much slower rate than was envisaged in the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i>, but this year there has been a striking change for the worse.  During 1965 overall employment decreased by 7,000.  That means that 7,000 fewer men and women were in jobs here in 1965 than in 1964.  It is estimated that in 1966 we will probably see a decline of another 4,000.  That means there will be 4,000 less jobs in 1966 than there were in 1965.  It is only a short time since the Taoiseach and the Government were talking about all the jobs that were to be created.  I am sure the Taoiseach will remember that a figure of 7,800 extra jobs per year was envisaged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Between 1963 and 1966, we lost roughly 100,000 people through emigration. That means there are 100,000 fewer people in the country than there were in 1963.  This happened before free trade conditions started to operate.  What will happen after next July?  I am sure the Taoiseach will spend many a sleepless night if he thinks about these things.  If we cannot maintain the job position before free trade conditions set in, what will happen after they do set in?  The <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> envisaged a progressive reduction in emigration to a figure of about 10,000 a year by 1970.  What is the situation now?  In 1962, the figure for emigration was 21,000; in 1964, it was 26,700; and in 1965, it was 27,300.  I challenge contradiction on those figures.  I do not think the Government have anything to cheer about when these things are brought <Col N="1507" /> to their notice.  There does not seem to be any hope of an improvement and, as a matter of fact, things seem to be getting worse.</P>
    <P>When things appeared to be going reasonably well a few years ago, the Government claimed that that was a result of good government and when things began to go badly they told us that was a result of economic conditions abroad.  I am rather at a loss to know why, if they want to take credit for things which turn out well, they are not prepared to take the responsibility when things turn out wrong.  I can assure the Taoiseach that many people in the country are as anxious as I am for an answer to that question.</P>
    <P>I do not know what Government thinking on the cost of living is.  They want to take credit&mdash;and incidentally, Deputy Cosgrave who made an excellent speech seemed to want to take credit, too&mdash;for the fact that there is a type of price control in operation.  It seems to be conveniently forgotten by everyone that for years we have been trying to force the Government to have some type of price control set up, and the fact that eventually it was very reluctantly set up should at least be admitted by the Government.  They now say there has not been any price increase since last May.</P>
    <P>They seem to imagine they will be able to hold prices, with the exception of the Minister for Finance who said that an increase of 1¾ per cent might possibly happen as a result of his Budget taxes.  Now, I think the Minister for Finance was speaking with his tongue in his cheek.  He either did not know what he was talking about or he was trying to cod the country again because everybody knows prices have been going up and everybody knows that since the increase in the price of petrol is bound to increase the cost of distribution and with the increases in the various other items, beer, cigarettes, spirits, tobacco, to mention a few of them, those increases will be reflected in the cost of living and it will be only a short time until we have much more than the 1¾ per cent which the Minister said was likely to have <Col N="1508" /> to be paid out by the people who are trying to live on very small incomes.</P>
    <P>Since the last wage increase was granted, we know, according to the Government's figure, in June, 1965, the workers were able to buy four per cent less goods with their wages than in June, 1964, and in June, 1966, he is asked to accept a wage increase of three per cent.  I do not know whether the Minister or the Government have bothered their heads trying to work out all those things or whether they just put their fingers in the air and said: &ldquo;This figure we have; we will just do with it and see what it will be like,&rdquo; without actually considering what is to be done with the money.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health has been telling us he is going to introduce a new health scheme.  He tells us it will be introduced, according to the White Paper, in November, 1967.  Surely he must be aware that, in order to maintain the existing services, he will require money now?  Surely he knows what the situation is or does he again think, by bluffing, that the Government will allow the services to deteriorate and nobody will notice it?  The Minister for Education has been having a wonderful time arguing with himself whether or not he should have one or two-teacher schools or bigger schools.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>We have been told that the balance of payments is the cause of most of our evils.  Let me refer to something on which I am sure the Cathaoirleach will not be able to rule me out.  As far as the balance of payments is concerned, the price of cattle in Britain until now, whether it goes up or down, has had an effect on whether our balance of payments is on the right side or on the wrong side.  I am sure the Taoiseach is as well aware as anybody else who takes an interest in these things that a new element has been introduced and that we will shortly have exports from our mines which it is estimated will, inside the next few years, represent almost as much as our cattle trade is bringing in at the present time.  If this results in our balance of payments being on the right side, does that mean that everything in the country will be grand or what excuse will the Government use for things going wrong then?  Will they be able to find something new to rely on?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference was also made by the previous speaker to the fact that when the balance of payments is wrong in Britain it is wrong here and the fact that the defence commitments in Britain were such that they were responsible for the big deficit in the balance of payments.  Again, here we cannot claim any such thing.  As a matter of fact, we seem to be prepared to save money on our defence budget this year.  According to the current table, the defence budget is being reduced very considerably from £11,910,000 to £10,802,000.  I do not know whether that is to be saved on the FCA or whether it is to be saved on the reduction of the number of fat fellows in the Army?  The Taoiseach <Col N="1510" /> is aware, I am sure, that anybody who is overweight at the present time is politely told to get down his weight or get out of the Army.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to get into quarrels with the Chair.  With regard to the employment position, no official figures of overall employment in 1965 have yet been published but it is a fact that the number of persons at work has fallen but the number of males&mdash;this is the important thing&mdash; engaged in farm work in 1965 is estimated as having been 14,000 less than in 1964.  The average number of persons <Col N="1511" /> engaged in transportable industries for the first three quarters of 1965 was only 1,700 higher than in 1964. The changed appearance, as far as the country is concerned, is caused by the fact that the Government have lost complete control of the running of the country.  They are now sitting back, hoping like Mr. Micawber that something will turn up.</P>
      <P>I used to listen, in my earlier days, to the Taoiseach referring to the fact that prosperity was around the corner. I remember the <i>Dublin Opinion</i> cartoon with the Taoiseach making that statement on the pier at Dún Laoghaire and the people rushing for the mailboat around the corner.  The Taoiseach, of course, was right.  There was prosperity around the corner but he was not assisting our people in getting it.</P>
      <P>We in the Labour Party are prepared to stand up, as we did last year, for anything we consider to be fair and reasonable, but on this occasion the Government have made an attempt to put across on the country a Budget which is possibly the worst since the State was formed.  There has been no guideline given to the country as to how we are to get out of the morass. We have been told the country is in a bad way and the people with very little are being asked to pay more, but the well-off, the friends, are all right. They are leaning heavily on the people struggling to earn a living and in order to ensure that those people will not be able to express themselves as they often do, the Government have postponed the local elections until October and, I feel sure, they will again be postponed until June of next year. The sensible thing for the Government to do is to admit: &ldquo;We have not been able to run the country; We have made a bad mess of it and we want the people to decide&rdquo;.  I suggest to the Taoiseach that along with the Presidential election he hold a general election to decide if the policy which he attempts to put across on the House and the country is acceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate on the final Budget Resolution has begun today, somewhat later than we <Col N="1512" /> expected, mainly, I gather, because Deputy Dillon was anxious to deprive the Leader of his Party of the opportunity of making the opening speech on the general Budget debate. Of course, none of us now in the House is very much concerned with the internal feuds of the Fine Gael Party or the discourtesy they think appropriate to their Leader except when they erupt here and interfere with the business of the House.</P>
      <P>The financial measures announced by the Minister for Finance in his Budget Statement yesterday are in the opinion of the Government, essential for the economic and financial welfare of the State during this financial year. That is the justification for them and it is the only justification they need. That is what makes this a good Budget.  I do not mean good in the sense that it is popular.  Taxes never are.  I mean good in the sense that it is a sound Budget.  If the Government had for reasons of political expediency failed to take the measures on which we decided, then we would have failed in our duty and the situation this time next year would be very much worse, almost, perhaps, at the point of being catastrophic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies Cosgrave and James Tully today, like Deputies T.F. O'Higgins and Corish yesterday, seemed to suggest that the Government were imposing new taxation for the heck of it. Governments never or very rarely impose taxation unnecessarily and in our circumstances in this year, we do not think unnecessary taxation would be justifiable.  We are not budgeting for a surplus as was asserted in a headline in a morning newspaper.  We can, we believe, rectify the unfavourable trends which have developed in our national economy without the deflationary device of a Budget surplus. The purpose of the higher taxes which have been proposed and of which the Dáil has now provisionally approved is to raise money to meet the estimated cost of essential and desirable public services.  These taxes will raise all the money which is needed to meet the cost of these services in this year, and no more.  The alternative would be <Col N="1513" /> to cut down the scale of these services.</P>
    <P>I do not know if that is what the Deputies who have spoken on the Budget already are urging or whether they are just failing to face the realities of the problem facing the Government and the country at this time.  As far as we know from any firm declaration made on behalf of either of the Opposition Parties, neither of them want to cut down the scale of Government services.  Certainly, no Deputies from either side have openly advocated this, whatever their inner feelings may be.  In our view, it would be bad national policy to do so and there should be no ambiguity about our position in that respect.</P>
    <P>Neither are we budgeting for a deficit.  The revenue estimates which we have prepared are realistic and it is intended to avoid any significant addition to the expenditure now estimated for any of the Departments during this year.  Because of the realistic way in which the Budget was prepared, no provision for over-estimation would be justified in this year. In circumstances where the Government's capital programme requires in this year that all the capital funds we can hope to raise in or outside the country are required for the purpose of that Capital Budget, a deficit on the Current Budget would involve cutting down the scale of capital expenditure now envisaged&mdash;expenditure on housing, schools, hospitals, agricultural and industrial investments&mdash;and this, we do not think would be good policy.  We know we have framed the Capital Budget on fairly optimistic assumptions as to the capital funds that can be raised and we have so stated in the document published in the House.  This, of course, is another reason why a deficit or the risk of a deficit on the Current Budget would be unjustifiable.</P>
    <P>The Opposition Parties were aware in a general way, from the documents which the Government supplied to them, of the nature of this year's Budget problem before they heard the statement of the Minister for Finance yesterday.  They knew there was a gap <Col N="1514" /> of about £12½ million between expected revenue and the outlay envisaged in the Book of Estimates.  They had plenty of time to decide what their attitude was to be to that problem.  I do not know what procedure either Opposition Party adopt when deciding on their attitude to a Budget.  Maybe they meet together and consider the character of the problem and the line they will take.  Maybe they do not. Maybe it is every man for himself, but on the reasonable assumption that some number of Deputies in both Parties meet to look at the documents supplied by the Government, it was reasonable to expect that some consistent line of policy would emerge.  They could have either advocated cutting down Government expenditure further than we did by reducing the scope and scale of the services to be provided by the Government this year in order to avoid taxation, or they could have continued in their old course of advocating still further increases in spending, realising that it would involve even further taxation than the Government intended to propose.  They could instead have recognised the need for additional taxation in this year to balance the Budget.</P>
    <P>In effect, they did not take any of these courses.  They decided to gallop off in all directions.  This lack of policy, lack of consideration of the problem of the Government, was disclosed immediately after the Minister for Finance sat down yesterday by Deputy T.F. O'Higgins.  It was disclosed further today in the speech of Deputy Cosgrave.  Deputy O'Higgins began by denouncing the taxes proposed individually and collectively, then turned to criticise the Government for not proposing to spend more money on education and health and other services and ended up by asserting the necessity for a balanced Budget.  Do they know what it means?  If we are to have this type of discussion, one Deputy arguing against taxation to pay for the existing services and another arguing for an increase in the cost of these services, then no intelligent debate on this Budget will be possible in the Dáil. You can only have an intelligent debate&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>You can only have useful debate on major matters of public concern such as arise on the occasion of the Budget, when there is some clear divergence between the proposals of the Government and the ideas, if not the policy, of the Opposition Parties.  If they have no ideas or no policy, then no effective discussion is feasible.  So far at any rate from the two speakers we have had from the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party, we have not got any disclosure of ideas of practical significance in relation to the problem of the Budget or any conception of a method by which the Budget problem could be reduced or avoided.  We had only negative and misdirected criticism.  If not the taxes proposed by the Government to meet the Budget gap, what taxes?  If we are not to close the gap between revenue and expenditure by new taxes, what expenditures are we to reduce or what are we to cut out of the Book of Estimates?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not expect any Deputy of either Party to answer either of these questions. That would be taking too responsible an attitude.  I do not expect they could even agree among themselves as to the answers they would give to either of those questions. Taxes on alcoholic drinks, on tobacco, petrol, motor cars and dances are legitimate.  All these things are legitimate sources of Government revenue and have been so regarded for a very long time.  The only questions that arise for consideration by the Government or by the Dáil on the occasion of the Budget relate to the rate of tax which is most efficient, the rate of tax on these commodities which will bring in the most revenue with the least consequences <Col N="1516" /> on the sale or use of these commodities.</P>
    <P>The sale of alcoholic drinks and petrol and of motor cars have been going up steadily in recent years in this country.  No doubt there are some people who are concerned for social reasons about this upsurge in the amount of alcoholic drink consumed but I do not think the taxes now imposed by the Government are likely to pull down consumption of drink at all, or certainly not to any extent.</P>
    <P>The popularity of these public dances to which the turnover tax is being applied at a higher rate throughout the country is well known.  Deputies who in the past were arguing for the solution of Budget problems by raising income tax, Deputies in the Labour Party, this year voted against the increase in income tax.  Deputies opposite say, of course, that they are concerned about the effect of income tax upon the take-home pay of workers.  The level of income tax, even at this new rate, is still well below the rate considered appropriate by the Coalition Government in which these Parties combined.  Ten years ago the standard rate of income tax was 7/6.  Did any one of them then bemoan the effect of that high rate of tax on the take-home pay of people paying it? Not at all: they thought that was a justifiable rate and opposed, on occasion, the measures taken by this Government to reduce it.</P>
    <P>We have had little constructive discussion on this Budget from any source.  I read the papers this morning and I found two ideas expressed there concerning alternative taxes that the Government might consider&mdash;an absurd idea from the genius who writes the leading articles of the <i>Irish Times</i> that we could have balanced the Budget by taxing icecream and, incorporated in a very intelligent comment on the Budget by Mr. Rory Roberts, one of the joint secretaries of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, a suggestion for a capital gains tax.  A capital gains tax would be a legitimate taxation device and operates in many countries but I think we shall need to give very careful consideration to its <Col N="1517" /> suitability in the present circumstances in this country in the light of the need to stimulate a rising volume of private investment in productive activities of all kinds.  It would, in any case, yield no revenue in this year and therefore is irrelevant to the current Budget problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We shall make our decision known in due course.  Deputy Cosgrave appeared to be concerned, if that is the right word, about our decision to have recourse to foreign borrowing to maintain the level of our capital programme.  Foreign borrowing for development purposes is a normal activity of every country and the alternative to having recourse to foreign loans for the purpose of capital development is to cut down the programme. We do not think this would be a wise policy.  We know capital throughout the world at this time is scarce and dear, but so far as the Government are concerned, it is our policy to have recourse to external loans to a limited extent, to whatever extent is necessary, to maintain the capital programme until the growth of our internal resources of capital makes this unnecessary.</P>
      <P>I listened with considerable boredom to Deputy Tully.  Nobody of course expects consistency in any speech from a member of the Labour Party because they show themselves quite capable of demanding reductions in taxation and vast increases in Government expenditure in the same speech.  I was, however, surprised to find that the Labour Party attitude has changed upon one matter which they consider of fundamental importance, the tax on lemonade, because this tax which is now being charged is an increase on the tax imposed by the Coalition Government in 1956 which they voted for. Their attitude to lemonade has changed fundamentally in these ten years.  It is a matter of some interest to know that they can take some decision on some aspect of Government policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before the Government decided to finalise the Budget, we went very carefully through the Estimates for every Department and we cut down each <Col N="1518" /> Estimate on the basis of applying three principles.  The first principle was that of confining each Department to the minimum amount required to cover in this year the cost of committed expenditure.  The second was the principle of reducing expenditure in each Department only where the consequences upon economic development would be minimal, and the third was that we would undertake no commitment in this year either for new services or new expenditures involving substantial cost in this or subsequent years.</P>
    <P>Even on the basis of these existing commitments to which I have referred, the cost of the main development and social services will, in this year, be higher than they were last year, considerably higher than they were when the Budget of last year was being presented to the Dáil.  Disregarding in this context any Supplementary Estimates introduced during the course of the year, in this year the Government had to provide for an additional £4½ million for agriculture; approximately £3 million to meet the higher cost of the milk price supports and £500,000 for price supports for bacon; an additional £1 million approximately in respect of the agricultural rates relief.</P>
    <P>The educational services are up in this year by £3½ million and health is up by £2 million, in each case the higher cost arising this year being a consequence of the normal growth in the scale and cost of these services. The Industry and Commerce Estimate is up&mdash;I hope, temporarily&mdash;because the increase there is primarily due to the measures taken by the Government to offset the effects of the British import levies.  The main increase, representing more than half of the total additional amount which the Government have to find this year, arises, under the social welfare services.  Last year we decided upon substantial changes in the social welfare services. Some of these came into operation on 1st August and some on 1st January, but this year the cost of these changes in the social welfare services have to be met in respect of a full year, which means that we have to find for that purpose an additional £6¾ million or <Col N="1519" /> else pull back these changes in the social welfare services that we adopted last year.  I interpreted the votes which the Labour Party and the Fine Gael Party cast in this House last night as meaning that they would rather pull back these services, take back the money which we gave to the old age pensioners and to other social welfare recipients, rather than incur the political odium of providing the taxation which would make their continuation possible.</P>

      <P>You can explain it any way you like but that is how I interpret it.  It is because these five items that I have mentioned&mdash;the higher cost of social welfare services, the growth in the cost of the education and health services, and the provision that has to be made for agriculture, as well as the higher amount in the Industry and Commerce Estimate&mdash;total up to £18 million, and represent a greater amount that the Government have to provide by taxation, because the balance is being met by the normal growth of revenue, which is technically called revenue buoyancy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies should understand clearly why higher taxation is necessary this year.  The alternative to providing these amounts to meet the higher costs of these services was to cut down these services.  Which do the Opposition think was the right course?  We have no doubt in our mind; there is nothing but confusion and ambiguity in theirs. It is true that administration costs have gone up, but the amount of the increase in administration costs would have been met within the limits of the growth of revenue, the revenue buoyancy, so that no new taxation would have been required because of it. Indeed, if we were to maintain the level of the existing development and social services as we set them last year, then higher taxation would have been needed, even if there had been no increase in administration costs.  The pressure in the Dáil and throughout <Col N="1520" /> the country is always for higher spending on these services.  As I said, the increase in the cost of these services this year is consequent upon decisions taken last year, and in earlier years, and they were taken without dissent from any Deputy here.  As far as the Government are concerned, we believe that that was the right thing to do even if Deputies opposite are now getting cold feet about them.  We do not believe they should be reversed; on the contrary, we believe they should be made effective by providing the money to implement them.</P>
    <P>In operating the general policy of undertaking no extension in existing services, or establishing no new services which would add substantially to the cost of Government in this or subsequent years, the only exception we made, and it was a modest one, was in respect of social welfare services where provision has been made for an across the board increase of 5/-per week for adults without means, to operate from 1st November.  Deputy Tully was quite contemptuous about this.  Let me remind him that when his Leader, Deputy Corish, was Minister for Social Welfare, one half-crown over six years was all these people ever got, and no increase was given in any of the social welfare services except old age pensions.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Finance tried to make it clear yesterday that the Government would find it difficult to assert with confidence that the Budget he presented represents the total of the tax and expenditure changes that may arise during the course of this financial year.  Circumstances may necessitate a re-examination and the adjustment of the position during the year.  These circumstances are, first, the possibility of further rises in administration costs by reason of wage increases during the year, for which the Budget makes no provision. If such higher wages should seriously distort the accuracy of the Estimate for <Col N="1521" /> any Department, then further taxation proposals will be brought to the Dáil to meet them.  The second is the possibility of the development of further inflationary pressures during the year which would threaten the rectification of the external payments situation.</P>
      <P>The principle of an annual Budget, the annual presentation to the Dáil of the national accounts, the Estimates for the various Departments and the Government's proposals for taxation to cover the cost of these Estimates, is a sound one but in our present circumstances it would be foolish to tie ourselves too tightly to that principle so as to restrict our freedom of action in circumstances where serious national damage could be caused by delay or by inaction.  Because the Government consider that this year will be crucial, crucial in regard to the country's future progress, we will take in this year whatever action is required, in our judgment, to make the future secure and we will run no risks that it might be otherwise.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cosgrave said or implied this was the most difficult Budget ever presented to the Dáil by a Government.  It is not so.  The Budget in 1957 was a far more difficult Budget to prepare and present.  The 1957 Budget represented our legacy from the Coalition Government, the members of which, when they saw the difficulties of the Budget they had to prepare, decided to get out of office rather than face the problems presented. They went into the election in 1957 knowing they were going to be beaten.  They took that course rather than face up to the problems they had created.  We will not do that.  In so far as the people of the country gave us the responsibility of guiding the country through this difficult patch in our history we will endeavour to do that to the best of our ability without regard to the political consequences to <Col N="1522" /> our Party, hoping that when it is all over history will at least record we took the right action and by our action preserved our national economy and opened a better future for those who live in this country.</P>
      <P>In 1966 the Government are forecasting a rise in the value of national production of about £55 million, and a consequential rise of about £28 million on personal expenditure, of about £15 million on capital formation and a reduction in the external payments deficit to about £28 million.  The rate of growth of national production which we envisage this year is respectable by international standards.  It represents a higher rate of growth than is expected in some of the countries in Europe which have attempted to make similar forecasts.  But it is less than would be required to realise the targets of our development programme. If the targets set for 1970 are to be reached we will need a growth rate of about five per cent per annum for the remaining years of the decade.  This is not impossible, provided general conditions turn in our favour and we manage our internal affairs in all departments properly.</P>
      <P>These forecasts for 1966&mdash;let me emphasise they are forecasts, not prophecies and certainly not promises &mdash;are based on various assumptions, assumptions which are reasonable enough but which are unlikely to be uniformly or fully realised.  Like other countries, we are still only in the process of developing the techniques of economic forecasting.  Some fairly wide margin of error must still be allowed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true, notwithstanding this expected rise in the volume of national production in this year, we are unable to forecast a rise in total employment, the fall in the numbers occupied in agriculture being likely to equal if not exceed the rise in the number of people employed in industry and other non-agricultural occupations.  This is, perhaps, the most serious aspect of our national situation.  Even if the picture presents a continuing rise in overall productivity in the output per head of persons employed, which is of course essential to improve the level of <Col N="1523" /> general efficiency prevailing in the national economy, for its future development and to assist future wage increases, rising productivity must always mean that output will rise more rapidly than employment.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish asked yesterday why is it that this movement of people out of agriculture is continuing.  This is of course, a problem on which many views have been expressed and which has been the subject indeed of many expert inquiries.  It is a phenomenon noticeable in all European countries, not merely here.  Indeed, the annual decline in the number of people occupied in agriculture in Ireland is less than it is in other Western European countries.  It is occurring at a time when most farmers will tell you they have work on their land for agricultural labourers, if they could get them but they cannot.  It is to some extent an economic problem no doubt, but it is also a social phenomenon.</P>
    <P>A more rapid rise in total employment must be a main aim of national policy, not merely in this year but continually.  This rise in employment must be achieved entirely it seems, in non-agricultural activities.  Government policy must always be directed to this aim.  But the aim itself requires for its realisation a total national commitment to it, a commitment that transcends all sectional aims.  To bring it about to the fullest extent possible would require that the money that will be made available to the national community this year by rising national production should be utilised entirely or almost entirely to finance further developments in agriculture and industry rather than improve the income position of any section of our people.</P>
    <P>This country needs more capital for its development, and capital is made available simply by the process of not spending.  This, of course, is a counsel of perfection and is unlikely to be realised.  It is important, however, that everybody should attempt to understand that you cannot have it both ways at once and that rising personal incomes of all kinds mean a slowing down of the rate at which employment can be increased by new investment. <Col N="1524" /> This of course raises a question of national priorities which has not yet been fully settled or perhaps sufficiently debated.</P>
    <P>It is sometimes asserted as a criticism of the Government that we are not ruthless enough in restraining undesirable trends developing in the economy, particularly pressure to increase personal incomes or profits unduly or any other developments which might prejudice the expansion of employment and the realisation of other desirable national aims.  It is certainly true that we as a Government have been relying to a very considerable extent upon securing general consent for our development policies, on a widespread understanding and acceptance of the national goals as they have been defined by the Government, on the assumption of reasonableness in pursuing sectional demands, and an understanding of the need for higher investment to bring about future prosperity as well as a general willingness to make all sectional policies conform to overriding national needs.</P>
    <P>If this way of doing the nation's business does not achieve the results we all desire, I admit that this policy heretofore followed by the Government will be open to question.  It is, however, the policy in which we believe and which we wish to keep on applying. If a more ruthless policy, involving a wider extension of the area of activity coming under direct Government control and regulation or a strict regimentation of sectional behaviour in accordance with some predetermined national plan, is desired by the people, this has not been made apparent. It would be in conflict with the democratic principles in which the Government and this Party believe and in which, as far as is known, other Parties also believe.  As a general arrangement for managing the affairs of the country, an extension of the area under Government control would be most unattractive and probably unsuccessful.  This does not mean we will not do whatever is necessary to influence or regulate developments within the national economy.  I cannot now assert with any confidence that the aims of the Government in the present situation can be achieved by <Col N="1525" /> advice and exhortation alone.  Everybody in the nation knows we are passing through a difficult period.  Everybody realises that the Government have a difficult task in guiding the nation through this period.  We are not being helped in this task by the irresponsible attitude of the Opposition Parties.</P>

      <P>Methods of persuasion must, however, be utilised to the utmost extent before they are deemed to be inadequate and have to be supported by other methods, however temporary this support may be. Controls of any kind, even price controls, which are inconsistent with the normal working of a free market economy should be always considered to be temporary and should be relinquished, even at some risk, at the earliest possible time.  The policy of the Government is to maintain a free economy here and to create the conditions which will enable it to function normally.</P>
      <P>These remarks apply particularly in the field of industrial relations.  The settlement of conditions of employment of workers by a process of negotiation between trade unions and employers is accepted as the desirable procedure. This does not mean, of course, and should not be thought to mean, that the Government can be indifferent to the outcome where a danger is created that, by reason of unrealistic demands or reckless use of economic power by either side, the employment of many workers could be prejudiced or the prospects of increasing national production could be delayed or eliminated. Free negotiations should mean negotiations governed by common sense and with due regard to the interests of other workers as well as of the community as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The arguments sometimes advanced that the Government should adopt an attitude of total indifference to what happens in this regard is absurd, the idea that we should merely sit around to pick up the pieces and take the <Col N="1526" /> blame if things go wrong, which is occasionally advanced by some speakers here and elsewhere.  I do not know if those who make this argument are ever serious about it. Certainly if they have given any thought to the functioning of democratic government in a modern State, they will realise how groundless it is.</P>
    <P>The significance of this year's Budget is that the present level of national production is not yet sufficient to give us in this year the prospect of a major advance in the field of personal incomes in the public sector or a further advance in the social services, welfare, health, housing or education, without our being willing to give up, through taxation, some additional proportion of the national income to pay for them.  If we wish to reduce the pace of development in respect of these services to an extent that will match the normal growth of revenue and, therefore, avoid the necessity for any tax increases, we shall have to slow them down considerably, slow down the growth of all the charges upon tax revenue, including the level of wages and the level of salaries in the public service. Certainly so far as the social services, in the widest meaning of that term, are concerned, we do not consider it would be good policy.  It is not the policy of this Government.</P>
    <P>It is not unreasonable that a slightly higher percentage of the total national income should be taken by taxation for the financing of the development of Government services.  The proportion of national income taken by the Government for these services in this country is still well below the average for other Western European countries. However, if it is necessary to take a higher proportion in order to bring about a more rapid increase in production in future years or a more rapid elimination of the social evils that persist in our community, then we think it should be done, provided it is recognised that the extension of our educational system, of our health arrangements, of our housing system, all these things are themselves improvements in relation to our people's standard of living and that improvements in their <Col N="1527" /> standard of living can be better brought about by an extension of State activity in these fields rather than by higher individual spending made possible by lesser taxation.</P>
    <P>In one of this morning's papers there is a statement by the President of the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union, Mr. John Conroy, which says it is the aim of what he classed the Establishment to depress workers' living standards.  So far as he may be thinking of including the Government within that term &ldquo;Establishment&rdquo;, this statement is not true.  Our aim is to bring about a steady, continuing rise in the living standards of our workers as of every other section of our people, and our intention is to prevent this process being disrupted by unwise policies on the part of either employers or unions.</P>
    <P>It is sometimes suggested by people who take only a superficial view of our situation that our people, like others, lack any firm sense of national purpose or that national purpose is not being sufficiently clearly defined or is unduly obscured by individual and sectional considerations.  I do not believe that this is true.  I believe there is a much more widespread understanding of the work which has now to be done on the national plane than is sometimes assumed, as well as a much more widespread awareness amongst the people than there appears to be amongst members of the Opposition Parties in the Dáil of the dangers which shortsighted policies could create for the country at this time.</P>
    <P>The work that has now to be done, as we see it, lies mainly in the area of economic expansion, and it is our conviction that success in this work is essential to the development, even to the survival, of this nation and to the realisation of every national aim, certainly our social aims.  The major task facing the nation this year and for the coming five years is to get ready to take our place in a Western European system of free trade so that the adjustments can be made without undue difficulty and so that the prospects for further development which are held out will be fully utilised. <Col N="1528" /> We are not ready for this now and we would be deluding ourselves if we asserted that we were.  We never will be ready unless there is a wider understanding and a wider acceptance of what is required to be done now by industrial, trade union and farm leaders and by all other elements of the community. There is too great a tendency to divorce the intellectual recognition of the requirements of the situation from positive action to cope with it.</P>
    <P>This situation is not going to pass away, nor is free trade in the European context something from which we can draw back if we feel like it.  The consequences of trying to opt out would be even more disastrous and could indeed mean total defeat, leading to the disintegration of our nation or reliance upon international charity to keep us as a museum piece for some time.  We are not prepared to contemplate this future for our country and, as far as we are concerned, we will do everything in our power to avert it.</P>

      <P>The information requested by the Deputy is not available. The sur-tax statistics set out below may, however, be of interest to him.  They show as at the 31st August, 1965, the number of persons in various ranges of total income who were assessed to sur-tax for 1964-65.  The income taxable in that year would to a great extent have arisen in 1963-64.</P>

    <P>It is expected that a few hundred additional persons will ultimately be liable to sur-tax for 1964-65.</P>
    <P>It will be appreciated that the above statistics are based on total income as defined for sur-tax purposes and so do not, for example, include persons whose total income exceeds £2,500 but who, because of personal allowances, are not liable to sur-tax.  Thus a married man with two dependent children would not have been liable to sur-tax unless his total income exceeded £3,134.</P>

      <P>Substantial progress has been made in the mechanisation of Civil Service procedures and specially trained staff are constantly examining new possibilities of improvement.  The procedures mechanised include payrolls.  The centralisation of payrolls has been actively considered on a number of occasions but up to the present it has been found possible to make more rapid progress in improving efficiency by other means. The matter continues to be kept under review.</P>
      <P>Reference to the measures to achieve the maximum efficiency in administration will be found in Chapter 7 of the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i>, Part II.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been no decision to abolish the Special <Col N="1533" /> Employment Schemes Office.  It has however been found necessary to reduce the provision for the Office for the coming year and in order to ensure that the available funds will be used for the most needed works, and to avoid excessive overheads, it has been decided to merge the Minor Employment Schemes and Bog Development Schemes in the Rural Improvements Scheme.  For the future, therefore, grants for accommodation and bog roads and minor drainage works will be available only under the Rural Improvements Scheme.  Persons seeking grants for works of this kind may now make application under that Scheme.</P>
      <P>The reduced provision for 1966-67 unavoidably involves a reduction in the amount of employment of a casual nature provided by the office.  It is however considered essential in present circumstances that the criterion in the allocation of grants for these minor schemes should be the usefulness of the works in themselves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Gaeltacht (Mr. Faulkner) (for the Minister for Lands)</NameTxt>
      <P>Land Commission activities in County Galway are heavily concentrated and involve numerous estates and holdings. Many of the prosperties are of modest size and include remnants of Congested Districts Board estates, land surrendered by migrants and small residues of allotted estates.  The Deputy will appreciate that the extraction of the detailed information requested would entail a disproportionate expenditure of time and labour which would not be warranted.  Moreover the current season's land settlement programme, which has been gathering momentum in recent months, is now approaching its peak and will continue at this level for some weeks to come. This means that the position regarding lands take over by the Land Commission throughout the country generally is rapidly changing from day to day and the extensive information sought, if compiled as of now, would be very quickly out of date.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances, perhaps it would meet the Deputy's requirements to know that during the past five complete financial years, a total area of approximately 37,000 acres was distributed amongst 1,980 allottees in County Galway and that it is expected that an area in the region of 7,000 acres will be alloted in the current year.</P>

While the number of pupils has increased slightly in recent years, there is no evidence to suggest that the school would ever be more than a two-teacher school.

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not a great deal to add to what I have already said.  During my speech before Questions I gave the justifications for the Budget proposals, which appeared to the Government to be reasonable.  I tried to indicate the alternative courses on which the Government had to take a decision; the options which were open to them; the choice there was in closing the gap between revenue and expenditure by increasing the revenue or cutting expenditure.  I commented upon the failure of the Opposition Parties to face up in a constructive and realistic way&mdash;so far in this discussion at any rate&mdash;to the Budget problem of the country in this year.  I then proceeded to discuss the economic prospects for the year as they could now be forecast and I referred briefly to the good prospects as well as to those which are not so good.  I tried to relate the Budget and this economic forecast to the international situation into which the country is now moving. We realise very well that the changes which are required, not only in our economic organisation but in mental attitudes at all levels of activity, are considerable, even revolutionary.  But we cannot achieve the high targets at which we are aiming by pettifogging for the adjustments.  We have to prove ourselves to be as well fit to live in <Col N="1551" /> the conditions of the future as any other Western European country, and as well able as they are to adapt to new circumstances.</P>
      <P>I want to emphasise that in the opinion of the Government there is no reason for pessimism about the future.  We envisage a rate of economic growth this year, notwithstanding all the difficulties of the year, higher than many other countries in the world will attain and a great deal higher than was attained before the introduction of the Programme for Expansion. If we do achieve, in very difficult circumstances, the rate which has been forecast as possible we can be fairly certain that conditions will continue to improve and permit us to maintain this rate of growth in the future.</P>
      <P>It cannot be achieved, and I want to say this as deliberately and solemnly as I can so that the mind of the Government on the subject may be well known to everybody, unless the guide line set by the Government in respect of overall income increases is maintained.  A serious breach of this guide line could result in a set-back to all our hopes and to a serious worsening of the national situation. This is not new.  I have said this here before and I repeat it in order to make it clear to everybody who is seriously interested in the welfare of the people, whether farmers or workers or any other section occupied in this country, so that they will recognise this and seek to act accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we should fail in the test it will not matter very much on whom we will place the blame.  That is not very important.  What is important is that the reality of our situation should not be obscured so that every section of the people, farmers, workers, businessmen, industrialists and managers should know clearly with what we have to contend and should be willing to co-operate to every possible extent.  It is the Government's duty to publicise the facts of the national situation and never before in our history has there been such a spate of publication of details in this regard.  We have done everything possible to publicise the <Col N="1552" /> course of action which in our judgment can best help the country in this period of difficulty.  This is what we have done and this is what we are trying to do.</P>
    <P>The conditions which are essential for the nation's material and social progress envisage increasing competitiveness in every sort of activity, the raising of production both in industry and in agriculture, the expanding of exports so that we can pay our way in the world and sustain our living standards during the period necessary until our external balance of payments can be brought again under control. If we cannot get it under control, we face a grave economic crisis.  All this has been said before, but it must be said over and over again until the truth of the situation penetrates to every mind.</P>
    <P>The forecast for economic expansion this year is based on various assumptions. Not all these assumptions, such as those relating to normal weather for agricultural production or the withdrawal of the British import surcharge, can be altered in any way by our own actions but others can be so affected and those include the cooperation of all concerned in keeping aggregate incomes in line with the increase in the national production and the avoidance of grave industrial disputes. I felt a sense of frustration when I heard Deputy Corish relating this three per cent overall increase in incomes to the man with eight or ten pounds a week and trying to calculate what that increase meant for him in weekly terms.  If there is a desire that workers in the lower income groups should get reasonable increases, the possibility of giving such increases depends on the willingness of the people in the better off sections to refrain from looking for increases for themselves.</P>
    <P>We have fixed a line at £1,200 and we have asked that people over that limit should be willing to forgo seeking any increases in this year so that the benefits of the three per cent growth rate should be confined to those who most need it.  The only means by which the Government can <Col N="1553" /> make this assumption of growth of production come true, apart from continuous explanation and exhortation, is price control.  This instrument of price control is at the best a very uncertain and haphazard instrument but it is our intention to use it.  Prices have been stable since the spring of last year because since then the rise in productivity has outstripped the rise in incomes.  This is a position that can be maintained throughout the year and which will be maintained if everybody will co-operate with the Government in bringing it about.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins and Deputy Corish yesterday and Deputy Cosgrave and Deputy Tully today said that the Government have made mistakes.  I would not have the arrogance or complacency to say that the Government have not made mistakes.  In the past we have made many miscalculations and mistakes and probably will do so in the future but I do not think we have made any mistake about the aims we have set before the country. These are to put this country into good economic shape, to increase efficiency in every sector of industrial activity so that it can live in the highly competitive world in which we have to live, in which the old methods of tariff protection are no longer appropriate, to stimulate the growth of our national resources through the expansion of production and exports in agriculture and industry so that our people can seek and get increased standards of living.</P>
    <P>We do not intend to allow these aims to be frustrated by irresponsible actions on the part of any section of the community so long as it is within our power to prevent it.  We mean to ensure that these objectives will be achieved by keeping our national finances in order, by making sure that the Budget is balanced.  All these conditions are essential to our progress. That is why I say that this is a good Budget and one which will contribute to the welfare of the State.  That is what we set out to achieve and that is what I believe we have achieved.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach has vacillated between generalisations and <Col N="1554" /> petulant attacks on Deputy Cosgrave, Deputy Corish, and other speakers.  I suppose when someone has a bad case, that is the best he can do.  When someone is on defence, I suppose the thing is to attack, but it is necessary to attack with suggestions of policy and steps that will improve matters, and not with petulant criticism and bad-tempered snappy sayings which characterised the Taoiseach's contribution here today.  The line he took on at least three separate occasions during his speech was: &ldquo;What would the Opposition do if they were there?&rdquo; No less a person than Deputy P.J. Burke has taken that line in every Budget debate since I came here in 1954.  His suggestion was that if we voted against the changes, we were voting against increases for old age pensioners.  Well, this is 1966, and that dog will not fight because this is not a Budget in respect of which one can talk about the day on which it was decided to take certain measures.</P>
      <P>This Budget has been decided by the Government as a result of their own steps, their own efforts, and their own decisions over the past three or four years.  It is like getting married.  If you get married, you have to stay with it.  If the Government make wrong decisions and political decisions to preserve themselves in office rather than for the good of the country, then when it comes to a Budget such as the 1966 Budget or the 1952 Budget, they have to live with it.  When a man gets married, he has to live with his wife, and in this case unfortunately for the Government, it is not a happy marriage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government can be proved to have had many advantages over the past 24 months and they could have guided the ship of State towards calmer waters and towards the goal which the Taoiseach suggested has pride of place.  If one looks at the figures in page 32 of the NIEC report, Comments on Department of Finance Review of Economic Progress and Prospects for 1966, one finds that from 1963 until 1965 the national income increased from £830 million to £1,015 million.  The projection for next year is that it will increase by a small percentage, <Col N="1555" /> if one takes the percentage per year, to a figure of £1,070 million. That means, in fact, that there was a larger cake from which a slice could be taken by the Government, a slice that would pay for current expenditure and capital expenditure which could be regarded as investment in the future.  The Government did not take that opportunity.  The terms of trade were right.  Over the past three or four years, the things we had to sell did not decrease in value to any appreciable extent, and the things we had to buy did not increase in cost to any appreciable extent.</P>
    <P>I want to point to the difference between the situation in which we found ourselves in the economic crisis in 1956-57, and the economic crisis which the Government find themselves in this year.  The terms of trade at that time had gone completely against us. The things we had to sell were going down in value.  Cattle were selling at £5 10s a cwt.  While the price of cattle is not as good as it was last year, owing to the credit squeeze in England, you can get £8 a cwt. for cattle today. I got it yesterday.  Therefore there is no question about that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The price of cattle is down since last year.  I should like now to discuss the disreputable campaign of the present Minister for Transport and Power in 1956-57 when I sat here as a much younger Deputy, and day by day the then Deputy Childers came in here with a brief case in each hand and asked question after question about the price of cattle.  The <i>Irish Press</i> gave him headlines, and all over the country, cattle prices kept going down, and down, and down.  He had as much regard for the people of the country who might lose their jobs, and as much regard for the Exchequer which might find itself without money to do the things which needed to be done, as flies walking on a wall.  That is relevant to this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Today there is a decent Opposition on this side of the House, an Opposition <Col N="1556" /> who should not have been railed against by the Taoiseach in an effort to blind the people, and to completely camouflage the position which he him-self&mdash;and I intend to prove this&mdash;and his incompetent Ministers have brought about.  We were blessed in the past few years with a fair balance of trade, and this was an advantage to the Government which we did not enjoy, but it is an advantage of which this Government did not avail.  During this entire period, the national income was increasing, the terms of trade were right and we had this wonderful &ldquo;Let Lemass lead on&rdquo; feeling.  What was happening?  Total employment was constantly decreasing.</P>
    <P>Let us remember that we have not yet anything like an industrialised nation, but we have the greatest mine of wealth of any country in Europe and, that is, that we have the best labour force, in our boys and girls who are leaving the technical schools and even the national schools, available in Europe today.  The position is that total employment is decreasing. Let us look at the Progress Report for 1965 on the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i>.  On page 98, Table 5, we find that whereas our total labour force in 1961 was 1,108,000 people, while that figure increased in 1962 and 1963, and in 1964, reached 1,115,000, in 1965, it decreased by 7,000 to 1,108,000 people.</P>
    <P>If you want to say, as has been said by the Taoiseach today in a poor defence of his beggarly situation, that people are leaving agriculture, let us examine the position in relation to agriculture, forestry and fisheries. From 1964 to 1965, the numbers decreased from 352,000 to 338,000 and &mdash;let us be fair to the Government&mdash; that was a decrease of 14,000 people. The best we could do while pouring money out in grants and loans, while the finest labour force in Europe was constantly available, while the terms of trade were right and the national income was right, was to lose 7,000 people.  We had 7,000 fewer people to pay taxes and the Government and the officials who prepared the Budget had to see to it that those who were <Col N="1557" /> left would pay more.  I am reminded of a few lines of poetry:</P>
    <P>Ill fares the land to hastening ills a prey,</P>
    <P>Where wealth accumulates and men decay.</P>
    <P>That is what Fianna Fáil have done for us.  That is our present position with them.  The only other thing I felt was that there was hope because they say: &ldquo;Those whom the gods would destroy they first make mad.&rdquo;  Let us now realise that to buttress the strain on our economy, to make real industrial expansion and to employ our people, we have got to have a constantly expanding agriculture and a constantly expanding agricultural export. If there are fewer to eat the produce of agriculture it would seem to be easier to have more to export.</P>
    <P>What are the facts?  I am glad the Minister for Agriculture is sitting opposite.  If one turns again to page 108, Table 70, of the Government's Progress Report, one finds that during 1965 we had to import all the things we could have produced here, if the Minister for Agriculture had done his job and if the Minister for Agriculture knew how to do his job.  We had to import cereals and cereal preparations to the value of £7.1 million, wheat, at a time when a 14 per cent decrease was recorded in the acreage of that crop, to the value of £6.9 million. We had to import maize, which could have been entirely substituted by Irish barley, to the value of £2.6 million.  When we come to animal feeding stuffs we were not even able to show any reasonable performance in the feeding of our animals.  We had to import £6.8 million worth of animal feeding stuffs to feed the animals we rear on our farms.</P>
    <P>What is the position then?  The Minister for Finance&mdash;I quote from his speech&mdash;said with regard to the rise in the import of farm materials that there was a reduction in agricultural production.  I do not know about that, but the position is that net agricultural output fell by 1 per cent below the level of 1964.  I want to say again that the first need and the first prerequisite in expanding <Col N="1558" /> industry is to expand agricultural produce and agricultural exports.  This will ensure that we will not reach the beggarly position we are in today, in which we cannot support any more the capital budget necessary and the capital expenditure necessary if we are to employ our people mostly in industry here.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in introducing his Budget, said in relation to agriculture and many other things that he had nothing to give because he had given it all already.  That is not much use when the real fact is that the person working in agriculture has, in fact, a far lower income than the person working in any other sphere.  He said, on page 17 of his circulated speech, that he hopes that the ratio will be preserved.  What does this mean?  Does it mean that the people&mdash;they are leaving agriculture at the rate of 14,000 a year&mdash;will now be left by the Minister for Agriculture in a situation in which they have far less than people in any other activity in the country&mdash;a situation which will be preserved in 1966?  Surely this is the hub of despair.  Surely this is a situation in relation to which the Government have entirely failed.  If the Minister for Finance were not blatantly, with the hard-neckmanship that is now the trade mark of the Fianna Fáil Party, saying something that is obviously untrue, then things might not be so bad.</P>
    <P>I would like to turn now to the Progress Report again, to Table 21, page 116, where we find that in the projection for 1966 it is hoped that agriculture will get £7 million more income and the remainder of the community £30 million more.  If according to Table 5 the numbers employed in agriculture are 352,000 and the numbers employed in other activities are 705,000, then surely there will be twice as much an increase for any other section of the community as there is for agriculture. As long as that situation exists and as long as that basic flaw runs right through the whole economy, so long will we not succeed in employing industrial workers who will ensure for this country a decent state of livelihood where there will be £1 for everybody <Col N="1559" /> and not an outflow on the emigrant ship to the tune of 17,000 as happened last year.  Those are facts which cannot be refuted.  Those are facts which are a complete condemnation of the Government. They did not have the terms of trade or opportunity against them.  I wonder now what did my very good friend, and the Minister's very good friend, Mr. Rickard Deasy, say to the Minister yesterday afternoon.  I wonder now what is the position of the NFA who withdrew their rates campaign and who now find themselves sold out by the golden boy who was going to produce sovereigns?  What were the terms and what were the undertakings given?  There is an old expression to the effect that you can cod some of the people some of the time but you cannot cod all the people all the time.  I do not want to say that so august a body as the NFA were codded.</P>

At the same time, maybe the old rod can be bent in this case as easily as the younger one.</P>

    <P>This Budget, of course, fails entirely because it has no regard whatever for the humanities.  I heard the Minister for Finance yesterday suggesting there would be a one per cent rise in costs as a result of this Budget.  In fact, I heard a backbencher of the Fianna Fáil Party interrupt to say, when Deputy Michael Pat Murphy said that the oldage pensioner was entitled to his half-one: &ldquo;You could have no sympathy for anyone who takes a half-one.&rdquo; When people reach an age&mdash;they may have reared a large family, which is perhaps scattered to the four winds because God has not been as kind to them as to others&mdash;where they find themselves without savings or personal income and they have been used to having a bottle of stout, a cigarette or, <Col N="1560" /> like the Minister or myself, a half-one, it is quite improper, quite incorrect and quite inhuman to suggest, that because there is financial stringency here, there and everywhere and because the Government have made mistakes to the extent of £3 million in relation to applications for industrial grants, these unfortunate old people are not to have any of the little comforts of life any more.</P>
    <P>I do not believe there will only be an increase of one per cent in the costs, which the Minister for Finance says this Budget will bring, because he has been extremely clever in a political way and has spread the impost like jam on bread, all over it.  The impost will not appear so savage until three or four months time.  In regard to old age pensioners, last year Fianna Fáil made a circus ring approach to their problem.  They gave an increase of 10/- but it was paid only to old age pensioners whose income was less than 10/- a week.  As a politician, I am a GP as far as filling in forms of old age pensioners is concerned.  I do not know if the Minister does it.</P>

      <P>Up to the last Budget, when we were filling in forms, our purpose would be to ascertain whether a person had less than £53 15s. a year income.  If he had, he was entitled to full pension.  When you asked Maggie if she had 38 hens and a pig, she told you: &ldquo;Sure, the inspector will be around&rdquo;.  You then put down a figure of £38 and found it extremely hard, after the inspector's adjustment, to guarantee whether the person would get a full old age pension.  The files of the Department of Social Welfare are chock-a-bloc with forms filled in by Deputies saying that people's incomes were between £10 and £53 15s.  We were all caught out because after last year's Budget if they had more than £26 a year, old age pensioners got only 5/-.</P>

      <P>It was the people whose forms were filled up in a certain way.  Only a minority of old age pensioners, people who have absolutely no funds, no income of any kind, get a full pension.  We know what happened in the Budget last year.  Now I come to the present Budget.  If an old age pensioner has any income at all, he will not get the 5/- increase.  Any Deputy who has helped pensioners to fill in their forms will in future not put in a shilling but will allow the argument to proceed between the inspector and the applicant.  The Minister for Finance has told us that all this will cost £250,000.  That is the total sum this increase will cost in a Budget which will make this country considerably poorer.  This Budget will lose Fianna Fáil a bag of votes.</P>
      <P>Let us examine the cost of increasing old age pensions during the past few years.  Before the contributory old age pension was introduced, the cost of a halfcrown increase was £1.2 million. The contributory old age pension was introduced, properly, and it reduced the cost to £700,000.  I do not think anyone will dispute the fact that on this calculation a 5/- non-contributory pension increase would cost £1.4 million.  We have been told it will cost £250,000.  Arithmetic is my strong point and I can tell the people of the country that they need not have any arithmetic to tell to how many this £250,000 will give increases in pensions. I am delighted that Deputy Burke has arrived.  This time he cannot wonder whether we will go into the lobbies and vote against the old age pensioners.  Only one out of five will get this increase.</P>

      <P>The Minister said we were faced with a hard choice.  He said either we must raise taxation to close the gap in the current Budget, however distasteful that might be, or cut down on the public capital expenditure, which, in turn, would mean unemployment and lack of social development. In other words, we are to kill the fatted calf for the prodigal son who has gone out and drunk the proceeds.  During the past four years Fianna Fáil have squandered the kitty.  Do they expect that we, or the Labour Party, or the trade union movement will now say: &ldquo;We will not look for any more increases.  We will put on our white garment and cleanse ourselves&rdquo;?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am giving the Minister some of what we got from Fianna Fáil in 1956.  What we are giving them now is a very mild facsimile because ours is constructive and theirs was destructive.  Of course that does not bother Fianna Fáil.  They have destroyed most of what was good in the country We do not quarrel with the argument that the Minister has a choice.  The mistakes were his and so were the bad housekeeping and his decision to settle improperly a wage claim pending two by-elections, trying to ride a beaten horse and succeeding. It was his decision that put up prices. Now he comes along to the Labour Party and the trade union movement and the unfortunate man trying to keep his family on £10 a week but to whom the employer cannot afford to pay much more, and says that all he can get is three per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us examine this three per cent. A single man earning £10 a week is paying on £3. 15. 0. a figure of 5/3 under PAYE instead of a much smaller sum.  I must be careful of my figures since the Minister is an accountant. Does he expect the trade union movement to go hat in hand to that man and say: &ldquo;You must not look for more money, even though it is extremely difficult to pay these <Col N="1563" /> increases.&rdquo;?  I am not naïve enough to believe the union will not seek these increases or that we should all wash our hands and go away saying: &ldquo;We shall do with a little less.&rdquo; The job of the trade union official, to my mind, no matter what the Taoiseach said this morning by way of gilding the lily, is to get better terms and more money for his members and he does not do the job properly if he does not make an effort to do that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>No; I am coming to that point.  He can have his opinions as to what is a fair share substantiated by those who are employed by trade unions nowadays to work out the figures.  They employ quite a few economists.  He can have his opinions as to what is a fair share.  So can the employer and so can the Government and they will meet and bargain and look for more.  When it is all over, the trade union official will have got for his members that which they are paying him to get, which is the optimum he can get.</P>
      <P>We must face the fact that this three per cent the Taoiseach talks of, the business of doing this for Ireland, wrapping the green flag around us and invoking Kathleen Mavourneen is all eyewash.  When you come to the negotiating table, you find the trade union officials who are decent friends of yours and you are on the other side and it comes down to hard bargaining and that is that.  The Taoiseach need not think that it is anything else.  I can see Deputy Tully agrees 100 per cent with me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>At least somebody told the truth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point that must be faced is the treatment by the Government of the Agricultural Credit Corporation and the complete failure of the Minister for Agriculture to get for the farmers that with which they could have ensured more jobs in industry and <Col N="1564" /> more prosperity for the people.  I know the Minister will not contradict me because he knows that what I am about to say is true.  In the last financial year, the Agricultural Credit Corporation having been greatly expanded &mdash;let it be to the credit of the Government&mdash;was heading towards a projected total lending of £7 million.  At the same time, certain bank managers down the country were trying to push over people who were good clients largely to the Agricultural Credit Corporation, people who wanted to fund their bank debts or to buy land.  Let us also give the Government the argument that this was placing too great a burden on the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  I do not quarrel with the idea of the Government saying at that stage: &ldquo;You should not give money to purchase land or fund bank debts,&rdquo; but I quarrel with the fact that in a year when the projection was £7 million; when an institution was at last about to do a job for Ireland that was unparalleled we had the position whereby, first, the Minister for Finance instructed them to do the same as in the previous year, plus £1 million or a figure of £5.7 million, and having done that, we find that the amount allowed to the Agricultural Credit Company in 1966-67 is £3.6 million or a reduction of £2 million.</P>
    <P>Let us accept that the corridors of Leinster House for the past month know that the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and the Minister for Finance were hopping mad at each other.  Let it be to the credit of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries that he was hopping mad but devil the much he succeeded in doing about it in what is always an anti-agricultural Fianna Fáil Government.  It is quite easy to realise that the people who work in the hat shop in Grafton Street or make castings in a steel foundry or those who go down the quays to work in Gouldings and all industrial workers depend for their livelihood and for a continuance of the Friday pay packet on the expansion of agriculture.  In this industry the capital sum invested was given some years ago by Deputy Dillon as <Col N="1565" /> £1,000 million, which figure, I may say, he now agrees is quite out of date and far too small.  This is the industry that has been denuded of one source of capital, the one thing that could have seen that two blades of grass, in the words of the late Paddy Hogan, would grow where one grew before, that would mean money for Ireland and a future for the country and it has been completely lost by this Government who, let us hope, just do not understand. Any other thought would be too horrible to contemplate.</P>
    <P>What does this threat of an autumn Budget mean?  As far as I can see it means that industrial workers and those who are organised can be told: &ldquo;Get into your rabbit-holes and say nothing and, unless you do that, we will have an autumn Budget.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>You can use a mallet to kill a fly. You can have a pyrrhic victory, and that is what will happen in regard to putting this economy right.  The Government are doing a blood-letting operation on a patient, one-half of whom&mdash;if you could divide the patient in two&mdash;requires blood-letting and the other half requires a massive transfusion.  The Government are doing this in the knowledge that if it does not work and if we do not all behave ourselves, and if the great whip the ringmasters are now cracking does not bring results, we shall have an autumn Budget.  The thought is quite ridiculous; I cannot understand it.</P>
    <P>I have instanced the fact that the increase in industrial employment in a state which is only in its infancy, and in which we have this glorious work force that I regard as the best in Europe, has been halted.  Let us face the fact that in our encouragement of industry we have had some notable failures.  On the Board of An Foras Tionscal, and among the officers of the Industrial Development Authority, we have excellent groups of men.  I know most of them and they were appointed by the Government, and I want to say from this side of the House that I can think of no better men to select.  But in the particular industrial enterprises where politicians, in the shape of Government Ministers, <Col N="1566" /> have intruded themselves, they have been spectacular failures.  We on this side of the House have come to the conclusion that a serious reappraisal of the situation in relation to grants for industry must be undertaken, and this must take the form of an arrangement whereby the property in respect of which a grant is given will, by some means or other, remain in the hands of the Government.  I have deliberately refrained from using names of industries in my questions here over the past six or seven weeks, where I thought that public mention of a name would have any effect on their future progress, so that nothing can be said about the Opposition as far as affecting individual industries is concerned.</P>
    <P>I want to charge the Government that in respect of most of these operations, it is notable that where those involved have been seen with Cabinet ministers, have been associating with Cabinet ministers, and are well-known friends of the Government, they have been failures to the extent of some £1,319,000.  One company was granted £113,000 and no information was given to us in relation to any form of Government loan.  To one industry, in which it is well known the members associated with the Government, there was a grant of £120,000 and there is no information in relation to that. There was an industry which received a grant of £120,000 and a further injection of a loan of £96,000, and again there was a well-known association there.</P>
    <P>One wonders at the propriety of this matter.  One wonders what pressures were brought to bear on Government Boards, on the Board of An Foras Tionscal, or on the Industrial Development Authority, in regard to these failures.  I know that it is fair comment for the Minister for Agriculture to say across the floor of this House to me, as he has done: &ldquo;You are doing them nothing but harm by doing this&rdquo;.  I have not used their names, except in one case, and that is public knowledge, but let us realise that this is the Parliament, that these matters will have to be examined, and that the expenditure of £3 million properly applied <Col N="1567" /> would certainly have made up the difference of 8,000 jobs that should have been there if we were to provide the same labour force in 1965 as we had in 1964.  I blame the Government and nobody else because theirs was the decision and theirs was the mistake.</P>
    <P>May I say again that I find myself amused and bemused by this suggestion that there should be restraint by everybody?  The Prices Stabilisation Order of the Minister for Industry and Commerce has failed lamentably.  It is impossible to control prices generally. This has been proved in every country in Europe.  It is possible in wartime when you have rationing and fixed sources of supply, to do this, but when you have a change in quality, when you have a change in the size of the container, when you have several different brands of one particular commodity, the thing becomes so completely impossible that it would require a Department as big as the Department of Supplies, which we used have at Ballsbridge, to carry out an inquiry and examination into prices.  Prices have gone up since the Prices Stabilisation Order was introduced.  Everybody knows that; it is common knowledge. They will continue to go up, and there is nothing you can do about it, and costs will go up.  If that is to be the way, then surely the trade unions, the employers who have to pay higher wages, and everybody else, are entitled in their own private capacity to see to it that their ship does not founder on the rocks.</P>
    <P>I find this three per cent suggestion one of the most ridiculous things ever sought to be put across.  It savours of Kathleen Mavourneen and Wrap the Green Flag Round Me, Boys, but that line of thought is as dead as a dead duck.  Let us consider how some increases in the Budget will affect costs. Let us consider the position in relation to the PAYE taxpayer.  Trade unions are going to seek to recoup the losses he will experience.  I will say nothing more about that because I have already spoken about it.  Take the question of diesel oil.  As a kind of sop to Cerberus we have the exception <Col N="1568" /> in the case of buses.  Let us consider that our heavy lorries of today carry far more goods around the country than any other mode of conveyance. They are carrying more than goes by rail.  Every diesel lorry, whether owned by CIE or privatelyowned, will pay the extra tax on diesel oil and that is going to make a very serious difference to costs.</P>
    <P>Take the cost of sending goods to the west of Ireland.  Take the cost of sending heavy materials such as animal feeds, or material such as fertilisers for the fields, which the Minister for Agriculture should be looking after.  These costs are going to be charged in.  Let us face it, nobody bears these costs in industry.  You charge them up.  That is the way it goes.  Life is like that.  The Minister is an accountant and I am a businessman, and we know that, and the trade unions know it, too.  It is quite simple: you just cannot bear these things any more.  In respect of diesel oil, we are going to bear a very heavy impost.  In respect of petrol, there are commercial travellers' cars which at present are doing an annual mileage of 30,000 or 40,000.  I know one traveller who is doing 40,000 miles a year</P>
    <P>If there is to be an increase of 4d a gallon on petrol, do you think that that is not going to be charged in?  Of course it is.  That is all going to increase the cost.  Let us take the unfair and despicable action in relation to the road tax.  Let us take the view that the man who had the money and taxed his car for 12 months from January is not going to pay any increase this year.  The Minister for Agriculture need not direct his beady eye at me.</P>

      <P>When he comes to re-tax.  I made it quite clear that I <Col N="1569" /> was referring to the gentleman who had the money and paid his cheque across the counter in the first days of January.  He will be free from this tax until 31st December and he is largely the man who is doing the big mileage, who has his car for business purposes.  Surely if you do 30,000 miles in a year, you expect that you are going to make some money in doing it?  That is your job and you will not be long travelling around if you do not.  Think of the unfortunate worker who lives some distance from his employment. I am going to give an example which will bring it home to us and make us realise just how badly off he is.</P>
      <P>Four miles down the road from me, there are 700 or 800 people employed in the GEC factory in Dunleer.  The managing director of that factory told me that the girls employed there might travel from five miles around, perhaps going with a brother in a car, but the boys would travel ten or 20 miles, maybe four of them in an old van. That van or car is used for that purpose only.  I estimate that van will travel 5,000 or 6,000 miles a year, but there will be no PAYE relief in respect of the expenses involved.  Those boys are going to have to pay a 25 per cent increase in tax.  This is a far greater impost than the import on a company car in the same car park which does 30,000 or 40,000 miles a year.  Why was this tax not apportioned in a different way?  Would it not have been fairer to put another ½d. on petrol all around so that the man doing 30,000 miles a year would not be treated on the same basis as the industrial worker?  They have to be at work on time.  They lose a quarter of a day's pay if they are ten minutes late.</P>

That is why they are there today.  It is no thanks to the present Government. The Parliamentary Secretary should know where he is sticking his oar before he does so.  There were just as many of them there in 1957, may be more.  I do not want to follow up this scheme.  It would be unhappy for the Government to follow up a situation in which a company received £300,000 in grants to set up another new factory 11 miles away and six months later the factory was closed.  The Government had failed to put in the codicil we say should have been put in to see to it that the factory would remain the property of the Government and would be re-opened again.</P>

His Parliamentary Secretary who is, I believe, in charge of that section of the Department, is also present.  In talking about the Budget, the old line was not to talk about anything less than £2 million or £3 million, or you would get no notice.  But here we have the opposite procedure.  The Minister for Finance devoted almost two pages of his Budget speech to the small western farms and at the end he proceeded to give them one-tenth of a penny on cigarettes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we leave the West go, whether we like it or not, the East will largely become a suburb of London and <Col N="1572" /> Liverpool.  The unfortunate fellow going down the road with a donkey and two creels gathering turf to keep himself warm, will remember, when sucking the butt he can ill afford, that he got one-tenth of a penny on cigarettes. The pair of you should resign. You are the most hopeless lot ever perpetrated on an agricultural people. Eight or nine years ago the Minister started off knowing nothing about agriculture.  Most of his knowledge since has been gained from falling into ditches out with the Wards.  I know nothing about the man behind him, except that, like the Minister, he is a decent fellow.  But as far as grasping opportunities is concerned, and making real progress for the unfortunate people of the West&mdash;and the opportunity is there if it could only be grasped&mdash;the best they could do in the Budget was to give them one-tenth of a penny on cigarettes.</P>
    <P>Let us pass now to the Taoiseach and his conversion to a prices and incomes policy.  It is not, however, the prices and incomes policy of Fine Gael.  We would never dream of putting our names to what the Taoiseach is suggesting at present.  But certainly in regard to the concept of a prices and incomes policy, we again have government from Opposition, which the Minister for Agriculture assured me some time ago he likes.  We have converted the Taoiseach to the idea that a proper prices and incomes policy, with guideposts for the future and fair play for the industrial and agricultural worker, will obviate the difficulty in which we now find ourselves, where the unfortunate people are trying to get back what the Government have taken from them, and the Government say: &ldquo;You should not do it and we shall give you another Budget if you do.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>During the general election campaign, after which the present Government were elected to office, almost sneering references were made by the Taoiseach to the suggestion of a prices and incomes policy.  He said then it was ridiculous.  He was not very long in office until he realised this was something worthwhile.  However, by then the damage was done.  Real employment in this country depends <Col N="1573" /> on private enterprise.  Surely our present state now tells us you cannot create money by employing people through Government sources, that you cannot intrude into the private sector. The Government are limited in the amount of money they can get; they had to go to Germany and pay a colossal sum of interest, 7 per cent, and pay a further sum of 2½ per cent on the entire loan.  During the last year, the Government and the local authorities took 99.1 per cent of the new money coming forward in the banking system of this country.  Let us take that to be 100 per cent and forget about the .9 per cent.  The position is that the only new overdrafts that could be given to an industrialist here to employ people at a profit&mdash;and that is the only way they can be employed &mdash;was the money that was taken back in reductions in overdrafts from others who could ill afford it.</P>
    <P>What is the projection for 1966/67? The projection is that where they took £31,500,000 last year, they are playing safe and taking £28,500,000 in the coming year.  They took £20 million from the funds of the Central Bank. I want to tell the Minister for Finance and the Government that for the first time the principal factor in that £20 million is not included in this Budget and to say that the Central Bank funds, which are the reserves of this country, were raided to the extent of £20 million would be a valid charge. Such was the extremity of a profligate Government that they had to do this. Next year we do not know what new funds will be coming from the banking system, but we know what the Government will take if they can get it.</P>
    <P>One of the ways in which the propagation of industries and of employment can be assisted is by leaving funds available for the private sector. They do not borrow this money to go to America on their holidays, because it would not be very long before the bank manager would tell them to come home.  The private sector can employ more people and create permanent employment.  This profligate Government, by their ridiculous approach to the economy, have created a situation whereby they must <Col N="1574" /> again raid the banking circles of this country, the money coming forward, to the extent of only £3 million less than they took last year.</P>
    <P>We are told by the Minister for Finance on page 37 of the circulated version of his speech that there must be restriction of credit.  If there had been a selection of credit by the Government in the years past and if they had conferred with the banking system and saw to it that credit was applied in the right place, there would be no need for restriction of credit today; the small western farms would not be neglected, and the Agricultural Credit Corporation would not be left with £2 million less than they had last year.  There would have been a hope for a forward movement and for forward thinking, bringing some hope of more employment to our people in the years to come.</P>
    <P>In page 39 the Minister says in an apologia that all the giving had been done already and there was nothing more left to give.  If Fianna Fáil are prepared to prostitute themselves at the time of a by-election or at the time of a general election, if they are prepared to put power and office before everything else, then there comes the day when at the conclusion of his Budget speech, the Minister for Finance must say: &ldquo;I have nothing to give because it has been given already.&rdquo; The unfortunate fact about this is that decisions taken at these times and in these circumstances are almost always the wrong decisions, and we say to this profligate Government that the sooner they resign the sooner will come the day when the people of Ireland will get the opportunity of putting them out of office. They were put out in 1952 and in 1947.  This time in the Budget they have spread the jam on the bread more evenly and it will be three or four months before the people of Ireland realise that, even though there is not 6d on the glass of whiskey and 4d on the bottle of stout, their pockets are so much lighter.  When they realise these things, they will surely put Fianna Fáil out of office and my advice to the Government is: Go.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and to rebut many of the unrealistic arguments he put forward.  However, if this debate is to be of value and is to have some focus, it would be better that we should, as individual contributors, confine ourselves to particular aspects of the Budget and of the economy.  I intend, therefore, to speak about the Votes for which I am responsible, but I would not like the House to take it that because I do not specifically rebut the many nonsensical charges which my good friend, Deputy Donegan, has made, I am therefore acquiescing in them.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Higgins said here last night, and Deputy Cosgrave repeated it this morning, that there is nothing in this Budget for agriculture.  That is just nonsense.  The Vote for Agriculture for the coming year is £35,309,000 &mdash;the largest ever.  We are providing in this Budget over the whole range of agricultural services, aids and incentives the full amount which will be required to maintain them at the highest possible level of activity attainable during the coming year.  Under every heading that matters in the Vote for Agriculture and Fisheries, more money is being provided than was voted in the current year to meet the increased demands that we anticipate will be made on these services next year.  Price support alone in the coming year will require £15 million and that is £3.3 million more than was voted in the current year.  Every aid to production and every incentive to increased efficiency will be expanded during the coming year and considerably increased amounts of money will be made available to meet and finance this expansion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is more for farm buildings, for <Col N="1576" /> land reclamation, for research and education, for surveys and inquiries, for lime and fertilisers, for breeding programmes, and for all the other services which are administered by my Department and which contribute to increased productivity and greater efficiency in agriculture.  There is a greater amount provided under every single one of these heads for the coming year than was ever provided before.  The votes for which I am responsible illustrate quite clearly, I think, the Government's decision, despite the particularly difficult budgetary situation in which we find ourselves this year, that money for productive purposes will be fully and adequately provided where necessary.</P>
    <P>As the Minister for Finance indicated in his speech, the Government would have liked this year to take additional positive measures directly to increase farmers' incomes but we were prevented from doing so by the serious Budget deficit which we had to meet. We did not, however, simply wish to leave matters at that and we examined the whole position in detail to see if, within the narrow limits of the budgetary situation with which we were faced, we could do anything to help the farmer to get a better return.  We looked as sympathetically as possible at a number of suggestions and proposals which were put forward by the National Farmers' Association and, as a result, we have decided on a number of steps which we feel can be taken now, all of which will contribute to the objective of improving agricultural output and income.</P>
    <P>As many Deputies know, we have for some time now in my Department been making a very special study of the problems of the small western farm. As a first step, I established in the Department some time ago a special Small Farms Division.  I also set up a consultative council for western agriculture to advise on the various, difficult and complicated aspects of this problem.  I appointed a high-ranking officer of my Department to a post of Western Regional Officer with special responsibility for the agricultural problems of the west.  In each of the pilot areas in the 12 western counties and in Glencolumbkille practical solutions to <Col N="1577" /> small farm problems are being tested out at grassroots level.  We have now decided that the next step in this process, the result of all these investigations, will almost certainly be the initiation of a variety of special schemes to help the small western farmer overcome his production and other problems. Accordingly we have decided to provide in this Budget, despite the difficult financial circumstances obtaining, a token sum of £100,000 which will be available to launch whatever new special schemes may be decided upon.</P>
    <P>As Deputies know, we secured in the Free Trade Area Agreement with Britain an extension of the British guarantee payment system to 25,000 tons of our beef and 5,500 tons of our lamb in any year.  In order to provide the firmest possible base for this very important industry of ours, the dead meat trade, and to enable our farmers to plan their fattening programmes with the maximum possible amount of certainty, we have decided that all exports of beef and lamb to Great Britain, even quantities in excess of those for which the British payments will be received, will be supported to the same extent.</P>
    <P>I was pressed very strongly this year by the ICMSA and the NFA to do something about milk.  I would very much like indeed to have been able to accede to these requests, particularly in regard to quality milk.  Unfortunately, however, as the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach have explained, it just has not been possible to do anything.  The trouble is, of course, that to do anything at all for milk is very, very costly indeed.  To give an extra penny a gallon, for instance, this year would cost somewhere in the region of £2 million and, even as matters stand, with no increase at all, milk will cost the Exchequer over £12½ million this year.  Because of the fundamental importance of the milk industry to the whole livestock trade, and indeed to the whole economy, that burden of £12½ million is one which we must unhesitatingly accept, but let us all admit realistically that it is a very intimidating figure with which to have to grapple in the context of any Budget and particularly <Col N="1578" /> in the context of this year's Budget. It is idle to suggest that this is some sort of an irrelevancy which does not really benefit the dairy farmer.  In fact it is a corner stone of the whole industry at this time and, without it, the whole industry would collapse in chaos.</P>
    <P>I should point out that an increase in the price of milk is only one of the ways in which the dairy farmer can increase his income.  Better milk yields, better prices for calves, the control of mastitis and contagious abortion and other diseases can all make a very significant contribution and we will spare no effort to achieve such progress as we can in all these directions during the coming year.  I have already pointed out that, if we can get rid of mastitis alone, for instance&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have already pointed out that, if we get rid of mastitis alone, that would bring in an extra £6 million or an extra £7 million to the dairy farmers whereas an increase of one penny a gallon on milk would only bring in about £2 million.</P>
      <P>It is also abundantly clear that, if the creamery industry can be reorganised in a sensible and rational way, this very reorganisation itself can in time provide positive financial benefits and higher returns to the creamery milk supplier.  It may emerge in certain areas that, in order to enable a satisfactory reorganisation to be effectively implemented, some financial assistance from the State may be required and the Government have decided, in principle, that such assistance will be made available, if necessary, in certain areas, provided it is in the context of an overall national plan which is fully approved by me as Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since 1960 new farm buildings and improvements to existing farm buildings have enjoyed remission of rates for a period of 20 years.  The Government <Col N="1579" /> have decided that all such buildings will in future be completely and permanently exempted from rating. We hope this concession will help to stimulate the provision of adequate and efficient modern farm buildings because, in many cases, this is probably the greatest single thing we can do to improve productive efficiency on the farm.</P>
    <P>Sheep and pigs are important lines of production in most areas of the country and we are looking to them especially to procure the build-up we need in western farming.  We have decided to give some additional assistance to the small farmer who is anxious either to go into pigs or expand his existing operation by increasing the grants available for farrowing, rearing and fattening houses.  For farmers whose holdings do not exceed 50 acres or who have a poor law valuation of £25 or less, the rate of grant will be increased by a half, that is, from 4/- to 6/- per square foot.  The new rates will apply to the first 500 square feet of covered farrowing and rearing accommodation and the first 500 square feet of fattening accommodation, provided that farrowing and rearing accommodation is already adequate.</P>
    <P>To help get rid of the last vestiges of sheep scab special grants to meet the cost of sheep dipping and handling facilities were introduced a few years ago. To help get the scheme off the ground the grants were fixed at one-half the cost for the first few years and were due to be reduced to a level more usual for this type of grant, that is, one-third in July of this year.  It has been argued that for one reason or another the scheme has not really got under way and that extra time should be given. We have, therefore, agreed to maintain the 50 per cent grant rate for another two years.</P>
    <P>As the Minister for Finance announced in his speech, the tax on co-operative societies' tractors will be reduced to £2 10s. which is the rate applicable to farmers' tractors.  This concession has been sought by the NFA during the recent Annual Review discussion and I am very glad that it can now be agreed to.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1580" /> We are providing more money this year also for both the sea and inland fishing industries.  In particular the grant-in-aid to An Bord Iascaigh Mhara is being increased by over £150,000, from £290,000 to £441,500. The fact that the total provision for the fishing industry is increased may not be readily apparent to Deputies, because in 1965-66 for technical reasons, it was necessary to include a provision regarding the writing off of old advances from the Central Fund.</P>
    <P>The Government regard the Annual Review with the NFA as important and useful and indeed necessary.  It provides an excellent opportunity for me and my advisers to discuss the whole position and prospects of agriculture, including income aspects, in a constructive and co-operative way.  It is of particular value in bringing to the Government's attention the problems that farmers regard as of special concern at any given moment.  I am always anxious also to meet and talk to the other farming organisations and discuss problems and prospects with them.  In an industry which is so complex and subject to such change as agriculture, a continuing dialogue of as comprehensive a nature as possible is essential.</P>
    <P>The Government accept the view of the NIEC that decisions about the current level of support for agricultural incomes should be taken at the same time as&mdash;and be recognised as an integral part of&mdash;decisions concerning non-agricultural money incomes.  It is the Government's policy to take whatever measures are practicable to narrow the gap between farmers' incomes and other incomes.  Present indications are that this year there should be a rise of some £5½ million in toal family farm income, with a maintenance of the relative position of farmers in the economy&mdash;and possibly some slight improvement&mdash;provided, of course, that our agricultural projections, as agreed with the NFA, are not upset by such unpredictable factors as weather and price movements, and above all that there is no immoderate increase in earnings in other sectors. This is essential for the avoidance of a new disparity between farmers' and other incomes.  Without it farmers <Col N="1581" /> would have grounds for complaint and if their income position should deteriorate during the year the Government will review the situation in the light of the circumstances prevailing.</P>
    <P>I believe that the general outlook for our agriculture is good.  There are record numbers of cows, other cattle and sheep, and when it is remembered that the products of our livestock industry account for the bulk of our agricultural output, I can claim to have solid evidence for this belief.  As regards tillage, it is too early to say yet what the trend will be this year, especially as tillage operations were delayed because of the exceptionally wet February, but the increase of 10/-a barrel for wheat will I hope provide a very direct incentive to farmers to grow more wheat this year and help to arrest the worrying decline in the tillage acreage in recent years.</P>
    <P>The Free Trade Area Agreement with the British which comes into operation on 1st July will open a new chapter for our agriculture.  Instead of the uncertainties and anxieties of the past in regard to our principal export market, we are now entering an era in which we will have assured conditions of access to that market, together with participation in the British deficiency payments scheme for carcase beef and lamb, as well as for store cattle, store sheep and store lambs. Our biggest single export item is store cattle and as I was not satisfied that this important and complex trade had been sufficiently studied and reviewed for the purpose of further development, I am arranging to set up a very competent study team to examine all aspects of it.  Our dairying industry also can now plan its production with confidence as it knows that the basic quota for butter will be nearly double what it was previously and that we will also have satisfactory access arrangements for other milk products.</P>
    <P>Our horticultural industry which is gradually building up a sizeable export trade is for the first time assured of full and continuing access to the British market.  The same is true of the fishing industry.  Our future agricultural, horticultural and fishery export development can, therefore, proceed <Col N="1582" /> on the assured basis provided by the Free Trade Area Agreement.  It would be difficult to exaggerate the importance of this fact.  Our country is more dependent on agricultural exports than practically any other and our agricultural development would be held up unless we had these assured exports outlets for our products.</P>
    <P>When I say that agriculture is our greatest industry, I mean not only that it is physically our greatest industry but that those engaged in it are among our best and most progressive workers, who have made a greater advance in productivity per head in the past ten years than any other sector of the community.</P>
    <P>During the coming year every effort will have to be made to increase output and income.  This budget is making available the finance necessary for the operation of a variety of schemes directed to this purpose and covering every aspect of farming.  It is my wish that these will be fully availed of by progressive farmers all over the country to increase production, as this is the best and surest way of improving their income and standard of living.</P>
    <P>From my point of view, this is a good Budget: it gives me in both the spheres of agriculture and fisheries, the financial resources I need to implement the various schemes I have on hands.  We would have liked also to have been able to give some immediate and direct increases in farm prices but that was not possible and, within that qualification, this is an excellent Budget.  I have no doubt that it will commend itself to the people and, in particular, to the farmers of this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>In referring to this Budget, I should like to say that, far from being a good Budget&mdash;we know of course it is not a popular Budget&mdash; it is the product of an unimaginative man who has not seen fit to look into this matter more closely or to have, perhaps, a reappraisal of the methods of collecting tax.  He has sought to confine himself to the same sources of revenue once more this year.  We find that, although it was thought we had reached the limit a year or two ago, <Col N="1583" /> he is now trying to persuade us that these sources can be used once more for taxation purposes.</P>
      <P>I take objection to one thing, that is, that the Minister came into this House with these new methods of raising taxes and did not study this problem.  Indeed, it would seem he was all at sea yesterday.  He could not answer questions and looked to his left and right for advice.  It is not good enough for a Minister for Finance to come in here and ask this House to vote on these Financial Resolutions, realising that the taxes which would be announced in the press, would, in fact, go into operation almost immediately. Misinterpretation was, of course, obvious and the public would suffer. Indeed I think the Minister had every right to study this problem a little more before he came into this House to disclose the new taxes.  He should have had a more detailed knowledge of the subject in order that he could give us a proper explanation of the taxes.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt whatsoever that these taxes will increase the cost of living and if we take into account the fact that salesmen&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, the new taxes are certainly not by any means imaginative.  They represent just further increases on the same sources as before, and no effort has been made by the Government to seek alternative sources for taxation purposes.</P>
      <P>The increase of 4d per gallon on petrol will have its effect in increasing the cost of living and, for those whose livelihood is made in travelling&mdash;salesmen, commercial travellers&mdash;this will represent an increase of 10/- per week, if we include the 25 per cent increase in the motor tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year the Minister said our balance of payments problems would be very much improved this year; this he said ten months ago in his speech on the Budget.  No doubt he was advised by the OECD statement <Col N="1584" /> on our balance of payments problem. The OECD said at that time:</P>
    <P>There is a limit beyond which it would be unwise to allow the current deficit to rise if only because it would increase the degree to which the economy was bound to change in external conditions.  The Second Programme envisages a deficit of £12 million to £16 million by 1970.  This would imply a rather sharp contraction of the deficit.  It would appear reasonable, over the next few years, to aim at a reduction from the present level.</P>
    <P>We know that the level in 1965 was bad, and this year it is considerably worse.  We find that the Government did not seem to be aware of the economic situation, or became aware of it a little too late and then employed panic measures to try to correct the adverse economic situation.</P>
    <P>Certainly last year was a bad year for this country, although we might be inclined to compare it with a year that is not to be taken as a standard, 1964.  The NIEC Report on the economic situation states that it would not be advisable to compare 1965 with 1964 because 1964 was an abnormal year in which our economic progress was beyond normal.  While we had a drop in employment in the agricultural sector of 14,000 people we have only had an increase of 1,700 in the industrial sector, and that means that our unemployment has been very high in the last year.</P>
    <P>We will have to make up our minds either to scrap the Second Programme or to revise it considerably.  The OECD Report, which has just come to hand, advises that we revise it, although I am advised that we should not pay very much credence to this Report as the information in it is supplied by the Government.  It has been suggested that the Second Programme should be revised as there is no prospect of attaining the targets set out in it.  How we will find employment for 15,000 people per annum in the next five years in this country is beyond comprehension when we have had such an increase in unemployment in the past year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1585" /> We talk about our plans under the Free Trade Agreement.  We concluded the Free Trade Agreement without making any provision for the unemployment and redundancy that will arise under it, and the White Paper on that Agreement was as vague and nebulous as many of the other papers issued by the Government.  We cannot hope to increase employment in this country unless we adopt a more vigorous approach to the situation and Government policy at present does not give us an opportunity to do this.</P>
    <P>We had frequent discussions about the wasteful expenditure on industries which were not successful and about which adequate information was not given to this House.  We have the case in which over £½ million was invested in the GEC factory in Dundalk.  If we have many failures like this there will be a loss of confidence in our industrial development.  This situation calls for a more cautious approach to the problem of investing in industries which are of no benefit to this country. Looking at a list of these industries quite recently, I was surprised to see that some of them were obviously foreign to our way of life and that they would be in no position to create supplementary and ancillary industries. There is no proper effort made to establish industries suitable for this country.  We cannot create a demand for plastic balls in this country.  I know of an industry established here for this purpose and I doubt if any effort was made to investigate the possibilities for it.  No business has been done in that industry, there is no production and they are living on the grant received from the Government. I am prepared to give details of this if necessary.</P>
    <P>This shows an unimaginative approach by the Government to the whole problem.  There is no purpose in Financing industries such as this.  Little wonder we have failed when money has been thrown into such undertakings.</P>
    <P>Last year the Government denied that there was a credit squeeze.  They denied that money was not available and only under pressure did they admit that the situation was bad.</P>
