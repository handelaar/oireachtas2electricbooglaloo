      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Appendix 5 of Part II of the Second Programme for Economic Expansion sets out in some detail the approach used in assessing the longer-term prospects for the economy.  In the preparation of short-term forecasts all the main statistical indicators, such as those of national income, external trade and payments, industrial and agricultural output, employment, prices, retail sales and banking transactions are utilised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the former Taoiseach recently indicated that the validity of these so-called projections was, to say the least, questionable, would the Taoiseach not consider that some more reliable method should be found to determine the trends referred to in this question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <P>Bord Fáilte published in 1964 a guide entitled &ldquo;The National Monuments of Ireland&rdquo;, the text of which was prepared by the Commissioners of Public Works, listing and describing all the monuments then under the care of the Commissioners.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>No; it would take an enormous volume to list all the monuments. There are about 50,000 more sites in the country that could be, at a stretch, described as monuments.  A volume of that nature would be far too big.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>A seasonal recovery in cattle prices normally commences in the last few weeks of the calendar year and carries on into the late spring.  I think it is reasonable to expect that the usual seasonal recovery in prices will take place in the coming months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>On what basis does the Minister assume that cattle prices will increase for the small farmer?  At the present time, the small farmer cannot sell his cattle.  The prices are worse than they were even during the Economic War.  They have fallen a further £5 per head since the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries told the farmers, one month ago, to keep their cattle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows quite well what I said and what I <Col N="1859" /> meant by what I said.  His assertions about a fall in prices and the Economic War do not make sense and there is no point in his talking in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that small farmers who got £40 for one and a half year old cattle last year are being bid £12 and £15 for the same type of cattle in the south of Ireland at present, with the result that the small farmer will be annihilated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. T. O'Donnell Mr. T. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries whether he is satisfied with the result of the quality milk bonus scheme; if <Col N="1860" /> he will give details of the quantity of milk which passed the test and the numbers of suppliers who have qualified for payment of bonus in 1966; and if he will give the percentage in both categories.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes; the returns so far available show that during the 12 months ended 31st October, 1966, the quantity of milk which qualified for the special allowance under the creamery milk quality grading scheme was 196 million gallons or 48.6 per cent of the total milk tested in that period. The number of suppliers who qualified varied from month to month but the average was 34,800 or 36.2 per cent of those participating.</P>
      <P>I regard these results as encouraging. I will not of course be fully satisfied until all of the milk supplied to creameries under the scheme reaches premium grade.  The special allowance is due to be increased from the present penny per gallon to two pence per gallon on 1st April next and this should provide a further incentive to every supplier to ensure that his milk qualifies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The current publicity campaign by the National Dairy Publicity Council which began in April, 1966, is aimed principally at encouraging increased domestic consumption of cheese but is also directed towards increasing consumption of liquid milk, cream and butter.  Particulars in respect of the consumption of these products in 1966 will not be available for some time but the information at present available regarding cheese indicates that home consumption, which increased significantly in 1965, will show a still greater increase in 1966.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The discharge of wastes and other pollutants into rivers generally is subject to a number of statutory provisions, the principal of which are the Rivers Pollution Prevention Acts, the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Acts, the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, and the Fisheries Acts.  Responsibility for the enforcement of these provisions rests mainly with sanitary authorities, planning authorities and boards of fishery conservators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When polluting effluents are observed, fishery conservators inform those responsible of their obligation to prevent deleterious matter from being discharged into fish-bearing rivers and follow up where necessary with legal action.  Also, my Department advises on plans for treatment and disposal of effluents when these are submitted to ensure that the proposted <Col N="1862" /> standard of effluent is not deleterious to fisheries.</P>

      <P>The question of the number of jurors to be summoned for a particular sittings of the Circuit Court falls to be determined under the present law by the appropriate Sheriff or Sheriffs and I have no function in the matter. The law requires that the number so determined shall be reasonably sufficient, having regard to all probable contingencies, for the trial of all issues which will require to be tried with a jury at the sittings.</P>

Moreover, the law requires that the full panel of jurors be summoned to attend on the first day of the sittings.</P>

It is for private industry to take advantage of these facilities and the Deputy may rest assured that any sound proposals for the establishment of industries in the area will be afforded all the assistance within my power.</P>
      <P>I am aware of one proposal for the establishment of a new industry in Limerick city.  The Deputy will be aware of publicity relating to this proposal. I am not in a position at this stage to make any further statement.</P>
      <P>I have already announced that I am arranging an experimental programme in certain areas for the encouragement of small industries.  Limerick is one of the areas I have selected.</P>

      <P>The total provision in the seven Votes for which I am responsible, is £33,778,250.  This represents an increase of £3,080,190 in the provision for the previous financial year.  Under Vote 8 (Public Works and Buildings) £2,300,000 is being provided for the building of new schools and the enlargement and improvement of existing schools.  The extent of the extra money we are now spending on education can be gauged from the fact that in 1957-58 the total expenditure was less than £16,000,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall now give the House some <Col N="1873" /> facts and figures relating to the various Votes.</P>
    <P Just="Center">OFFICE OF THE MINISTER FOR EDUCATION.</P>
    <P>This Vote comprises (a) the administration costs of the Department, and (b) the provision for the services which formerly appeared in what was a separate Science and Art Vote.  At £1,274,220 this year's Estimate shows an increase of £141,720 in the amount for last year.</P>
    <P>The following items account for the main portion of that increase:</P>
    <P>(1)  Provision for the additional staff which the extension of educational services, particularly the setting up of a special Development Branch, necessitated.</P>
    <P>(2)  Provision for salary increases and for the normal incremental progression.</P>
    <P>(3)  University Scholarships.  The further operation of the Scholarships Act, 1961, will entail an additional expenditure of £26,000 by the Department this year.</P>
    <P Just="Center">PRIMARY EDUCATION.</P>
    <P>The net amount under this Vote is £18,854,600, which is £1,483,200 in excess of the amount for 1965/66. The major portion of that excess is to meet the additional provision for salaries and emoluments of teachers.</P>
    <P>In the school year which ended 30th June, 1965, there were 14,469 teachers employed in national schools as compared with 14,297 for the same date in 1964.  The number of pupils on rolls on 30th June, 1965, was 506,552, an increase of 4,351 in the number for the same date in 1964.</P>
    <P>Once again substantial progress was made last year in the replacement of unsuitable national schools and in the reconstruction and improvement of exisiting schools.  In fact 1965-66 was a record year for national school building: 130 new schools were built and major schemes of improvement or extension were carried out in the case of 121 schools.  In all, 23,940 pupil places were provided.  This is <Col N="1874" /> over 60 per cent greater than the average for the previous decade.</P>
    <P>Members of the House will recollect that in each of the past seven years the teacher/pupil ratio has been improved. A further improvement has been made this year.  The figure of enrolment required for a third assistant&mdash;four teachers in all&mdash;has been reduced from 140 to 130 and reductions have been continued up to and including the sixth assistant.</P>
    <P>Two other developments this year which merit special mention are the steps taken to train untrained teachers and the revisions made in the conditions governing the competition for entry to the training colleges.  In 1958 we ceased, as a matter of firm policy, to recruit untrained teachers.  In that respect we then were and probably still are unique in Western Europe. There remained, however, in the service a number of untrained teachers who previous to that time had been granted permanent recognition as junior assistant mistresses or untrained assistants.  Arrangements were put into effect this year whereby such untrained teachers who are under 56 years of age will by a series of summer courses and set studies during each year be enabled to reach the status of trained teacher.  Such courses were held at two centres last July.</P>
    <P>A committee consisting of representatives of the teachers, training colleges and my Department was appointed to examine the conditions governing the competition for entry to the training colleges, the curriculum for the training courses and the final examination.  The committee made a number of recommendations in regard to the entrance competition, the majority of which have been accepted and will be in operation for the 1967 competition. Among the recommendations accepted was that singing should not be essential for men candidates and that needlework should not be essential for girls.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECONDARY EDUCATION.</P>
    <P>The net total amount provided for secondary education is £6,654,100. This is an increase of roughly <Col N="1875" /> £800,000 on the amount provided last year in the original and supplementary estimates.  The principal headings under which the increase occurs are grants to schools, teachers' salaries, scholarships for post-primary education and building grants to secondary schools and comprehensive schools.</P>
    <P>When introducing last year's Estimate for this Vote, my predecessor said that within a few years the number of pupils on the rolls of secondary schools would have reached 100,000. This position was in fact almost reached in the 1965-66 school year with its enrolment of close on 99,000 students, an increase of 5,500 over the previous year.  There is every indication that this growth rate will continue, so that the task of providing the increased accommodation and facilities necessary to cater for these numbers over the next few years will be considerable.</P>
    <P>To help to meet this demand for places, the building grant scheme for secondary schools is being fully availed of by secondary school authorities.  To date 149 applications have been received under the scheme.  These involve total building costs of approximately £13,500,000.  The majority of these applications relate to replacements of or extensions to existing buildings, but in all cases a greatly increased number of pupil places is being provided.  The trend is generally, therefore, towards very much larger school units.  The provision for such grants this year is £140,000, which was arrived at on the basis of the State contribution towards the initial repayments on loans obtained by school managers in respect of 29 building projects, the total capital cost of which was estimated to be approximately £4,000,000.  I might point out here that the grants under this scheme take the form of an annual 60 per cent contribution towards the total repayments, capital and interest, arising from loans obtained by secondary school authorities to meet their building costs.</P>
    <P>Of equal importance to providing school places is the need to have a sufficiency of qualified teaching personnel. We are fortunate here that there <Col N="1876" /> has been a very considerable growth in the numbers entering secondary teaching. In 1965-66 the number of newly registered teachers was 416 as compared with 152 15 years previously, 1950-51.  In the same period the number of registered secondary teachers in receipt of salary has increased from 2,219 to 4,253.  In 1965-66, in addition, 370 teachers were paid the special supplementary allowance for probationer teachers.</P>
    <P>The provision for refresher and training courses for teachers was extended still further this year: in all, five refresher courses&mdash;one each in Irish, classics, history, geography and domestic science&mdash;and 43 in-service courses were held.  The in-service courses consisted of 24 courses in mathematics, 11 courses in science, three courses in Irish, two courses in French, and one course each in civics, which included sociology, physical education and music.  Some of these courses were organised directly by the Department while others were organised by teacher associations or University Colleges in co-operation with and financed by the Department.  I might mention in relation to the courses in Irish that this is only a commencement and will be followed next year by a wider series of courses linked with the introduction into post-primary schools as from September, 1967 of graded courses in Irish designed to improve oral proficiency in the language.  These graded courses will go hand-in-hand with the introduction of an oral test in Irish as part of a revised syllabus in Irish for intermediate certificate pupils.</P>
    <P>Much of the need for these training and refresher courses arises out of the complete revision which has just taken place of the syllabuses in all subjects of the intermediate certificate course. From this point of view the past year has been one of outstanding progress in which both secondary and vocational school associations have wholeheartedly collaborated with the Department in framing new syllabuses more in keeping with the times.  For this and for their co-operation generally, I wish to express my gratitude.  As a result of <Col N="1877" /> the united efforts of all concerned, we have already issued the new intermediate certificate syllabuses and these have been in operation in the schools since September last.  I have under review at the moment the whole question of the structure of the leaving certificate courses and examination and of the syllabuses that would be required. I hope to get these matters moving during the current school year.</P>
    <P Just="Center">VOCATIONAL EDUCATION.</P>
    <P>The net sum being sought for the vocational education service is £3,523,960.  This is an increase of £45,460.</P>
    <P>In view of certain statements which have been made in recent months suggesting that reductions have been effected in the financial resources of vocational education committees, I think the House should be informed of the factual position in this matter. The total amount actually expended by all 38 committees on non-capital account in the financial year 1965-66 was £4,716,307.  The total amount approved for expenditure in 1966-67 is £5,012,065 representing an increase of almost £300,000 on the previous year's expenditure.  The total income of the committees for 1966-67 is estimated at £5,132,186.</P>
    <P>Such has been the pace of the development of vocational education in recent years that it has become necessary to introduce special State grants over and above those which are related to the contributions made to committees by their rating authorities. These special grants have acquired the name of &ldquo;solvency grants&rdquo; and the amount provided for them in relation to the 1965-66 financial schemes was £891,000.  The amount provided for 1966-67 after examination of the financial schemes for that year submitted by the committees in November, 1965, was £946,000.</P>
    <P>The vocational education service continues to provide a wide variety of courses ranging from day continuation work at the immediate post-primary level to evening classes for adults and to the training of technicians <Col N="1878" /> and technologists for industry. Last September, however, saw the commencement of a new era in the opening up of access to the Intermediate Certificate course to pupils in vocational schools.  This has created new problems for committees, chief executive officers and teachers and has made the present session a more than usually difficult one for all concerned. I am glad to be able to inform the House, however, that the initial period of adaptation is being successfully coped with and that I am hopeful that with co-operation and goodwill the full benefit of the new courses will soon be extended to all the pupils in vocational schools.</P>
    <P>Another feature of this year's Estimate for vocational education to which I should like to refer is the increased provision for teacher-training courses conducted by the Department. Existing courses have been extended in scope and new courses have been introduced, with the result that the number of vocational teachers in training under the Department in the present session is 50 per cent greater than the number in training in 1964-65.</P>
    <P>The total number of permanent whole-time teachers already employed by vocational education committees according to their financial schemes of November, 1965, was 2,350 and the number of additional appointments authorised in sanctioning those schemes was 150.</P>
    <P>With regard to the method of appointment of vocational teachers, I indicated last July that it was my intention to have the present system replaced by an arrangement under which these teachers would be selected for appointment by an independent body set up for that purpose.</P>
    <P>A further development in technical education which has already been announced is the provision of regional technical colleges.  I mention it now specially because of the steps which I have taken recently in order to hasten the erection of these colleges.  In September last I set up an <i>ad hoc</i> steering committee drawn from industry and management to prepare an <Col N="1879" /> educational brief for these colleges. Side by side with that I have appointed a consortium of architects, engineers and quantity surveyors to supervise the erection of the colleges.  With the advances which have already been made I am hopeful that the building stage should be reached by the spring of 1968, and that the colleges will be open before the end of 1969.</P>
    <P Just="Center">REFORMATORY AND INDUSTRIAL SCHOOLS.</P>
    <P>The amount sought under this Vote for the financial year 1966-67 is £262,500&mdash;a decrease of £23,050 on that for the year 1965-66.  This decrease is due to the decline in the numbers of children detained in the schools.  At the end of 1965 there were 100 boys and 20 girls in the three reformatories as compared with 116 boys and 25 girls at the end of 1964. In the 42 industrial schools the numbers were 1,256 boys and 1,266 girls at the end of 1965 as compared with 1,388 boys and 1,444 girls at the end of 1964.</P>
    <P Just="Center">UNIVERSITIES AND COLLEGES AND DUBLIN INSTITUTE FOR ADVANCED STUDIES.</P>
    <P>The provision under this Vote at £3,182,800 shows a net increase of £293,500 on the amount for 1965-66. This is due to:</P>
    <P>(a)  an increase of £449,890 in the annual grant for general purposes in the case of the three Colleges of the National University, Trinity College and the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies;</P>
    <P>(b)  an increase of £28,000 in the grant for the Dublin Dental Hospital;</P>
    <P>(c)  a net decrease of £184,390 in the grants towards additional accommodation and equipment.  These grants are as follows for the current financial year: University College, Dublin, £187,990; University College, Cork, £246,000; University College, Galway, £56,620; Trinity College, £311,000.</P>
    <P>The net decrease is due in the main to the fact that the £187,990 to University College, Dublin, is a residual payment as against the £590,000 due <Col N="1880" /> to the College last year in relation to the cost of its new science block.</P>
    <P>The increases in the grant for general purposes relate to increases in salaries for the staffs of the colleges, staff expansion and the greater numbers receiving university education.</P>
    <P>The number of university students in whole-time attendance at the colleges increased from some 10,500 in 1959-60 to over 14,000 in 1965-66. This presents a serious problem of accommodation.  The steps which I am taking and will take in the matter will, I am satisfied, meet the needs of these ever-increasing numbers of students.</P>
    <P Just="Center">NATIONAL GALLERY.</P>
    <P>Provision is made in this Vote for £26,070, an increase of £660 on last year's figure.  While on this subject I should like to commend highly the very successful efforts of the Gallery authorities in recent times to bring the public to a better acquaintance with the national treasures which are in their keeping.</P>
    <P Just="Center">GENERAL.</P>
    <P>My policy in regard to post-primary education in general has as its objective the providing of comprehensive facilities in as many centres as is reasonably practicable so that as far as possible our children will have a genuine option in the matter of choosing the type of education which best suits their aptitudes and talents.  Comprehensive facilities can be provided in two ways, by the establishment of comprehensive schools and by the dovetailing of the activities of the secondary and vocational school systems, including the effect of a common intermediate examination. The number of comprehensive schools will not be large, but while they will be few in number, they will act as a signpost for the two existing systems and point the way to what can be provided by a full measure of co-operation between these systems.</P>
    <P>With this in view, my predecessor in January last sent a circular letter to the authorities of all the secondary and vocational schools in the country outlining his policy and asking for their <Col N="1881" /> co-operation in breaking down the barriers which have hitherto existed between the secondary and vocational school systems.  The response to this letter has been very heartening and has shown the great fund of good will which exists for anything which is designed to improve the educational opportunities available to our children. With regard to the comprehensive schools, three of these have been opened in Carraroe, Cootehill and Shannon.  Plans for a fourth comprehensive school in Glenties are being finalised and I hope that work on its construction will be commenced by the spring of next year.</P>
    <P>My Department is at present completing a survey of post-primary educational facilities in the country with a view to assessing the requirements of each area in catering for the raising of the school leaving age and the giving of post-primary education to all. Already the results of these surveys have been issued to the appropriate authorities of Counties Carlow, Donegal, Kilkenny, Laois, Waterford and Wexford, and meetings have been arranged to discuss how best the requirements of each county may be met.</P>
    <P>The year that has passed witnessed a memorable event in the publication of the first results of the language research undertaken in An Teanglann at Gormanston by the Franciscan Fathers and by my Department.  Under the title of &ldquo;Buntús Gaeilge&rdquo;, we have in one book the basic material to enable us to make a major breakthrough in the teaching of Irish through the framing of scientifically based courses which will be taught by scientific methods.  Last year trial courses were followed in 12 national schools with most satisfactory results.  This year further courses are being tried out in 200 national schools.  All the reports we are receiving are, to say the least, most encouraging.  Side by side with this, three committees, comprising representatives of the teaching profession and of the Department's inspectorate, are working out graded courses for primary and post-primary schools which it is hoped to have in general operation in September of next year. <Col N="1882" /> Arrangements have been made with Radio Telefís Éireann to have a course suitable for adults broadcast on radio and television commencing in the autumn of 1967.  The work on the preparation of a booklet which will accompany this course is well advanced.  It is hardly necessary for me to stress that in the preparation of all these courses the emphasis will be on the spoken tongue.</P>
    <P>There may be some people who may ask why are we going to all this trouble about the framing of courses in Irish. To my mind, the answer is the simple one which was given on another occasion recently, that is, the Irish language is the most Irish thing we have got.  I would go a little further and say it is also the oldest part of our national heritage.  That the national aim in relation to the restoration of Irish is sound is surely borne out by the fact that no country ever voluntarily agreed to the abandonment of its national language. We owe it, therefore, to our children to teach them Irish and to use the best possible methods of so doing.</P>
    <P>Let it not be thought, however, that our efforts in relation to language teaching have been devoted entirely to Irish.  This is very far from being the case.  Several hundreds of our teachers of French, for example, have attended special courses in Gormanston dealing with the most modern methods of language teaching including the use of audio-visual aids with which the Department is assisting by special grants to equip the schools. The result of the efforts made may be seen in the fact that the number of secondary school pupils taking French has increased from 37,041 in 1960-61 to 60,956 in 1965-66.</P>
    <P>Let me add that the position in relation to language teaching has not been achieved at the expense of science subjects.  In fact the number of students studying science in secondary schools has risen from 41,643 in 1960-61 to 64,943 in 1965-66.</P>
    <P Just="Center">PROVISION OF FREE POST-PRIMARY EDUCATION.</P>
    <P>I have given the House the facts and figures together with some general <Col N="1883" /> comments in regard to the Votes for which I have responsibility.  It remains for me, now, to fulfil the promise I made by giving details of my plans for the provision of free education at post-primary level and for assistance at university level for students who have the ability to profit from higher education but who, because their parents are unable to meet the attendant costs are denied the opportunity for higher education.</P>
    <P>I would remind the House of the Government's decision to raise the school-leaving age to 15 by 1970 and of my own policy, and that of my predecessors in office, Deputy Dr. Hillery and Deputy Colley, to provide within that compulsory attendance period, a post-primary course covering three years.  If attendance at school is to be compulsory up to 15 and if the three-year period from 12 to 15 is to be spent in a post-primary school, then in keeping with the practice in all other countries free post-primary education must be available up to intermediate certificate level.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, because of the importance of providing better-educated young people for our developing economy and with a view to utilising fully our human resources, it is essential that students be encouraged to stay at school beyond the compulsory age.  The drop-out of pupils during the intermediate period is considerable. The Report on Investment in Education shows that in 1963 approximately 11,000 pupils left full-time education before reaching junior certificate level; 4,000 of these left secondary schools before completing the intermediate certificate course and 7,000 left vocational schools without doing the group certificate.  This is the very time that training for craftsmen, technicians and the like begins&mdash;the area in which our national needs are the greatest.</P>
    <P>The Report on Investment in Education and the considerable public discussion to which the Report has given rise, have high-lighted the extent to which ability to pay has governed the rates of participation in post-primary <Col N="1884" /> education.  Commenting on this, the Report states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>6.92 These tables (6.27-6.29) and the accompanying diagrams show a very marked association between social groups and participation in full-time education.  In particular they show a marked contrast between Groups B (Professional, Senior Employees, etc.) and C (Clerks, etc.) on the one hand and Groups D, E, F, (Skilled, Semi-skilled and Unskilled Workers, etc.) on the other, a contrast which becomes the more marked the higher the age group and the higher the level.  If the same circumstances were to prevail in future it would mean that today's children of those latter social groups would have a relatively small chance of being in full-time education in ten years' time.</P>
    <P>The National Industrial Economic Council's comments on the Report draws attention to the difficulties created for our economic system through the lack of adequate numbers of people having, as a basic requirement, education up to intermediate certificate level.  The Council's comments include the following:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The comparison of the potential demand for those with the different qualifications with the potential supply (see Table 8.4. page 201) suggested that there would be a cumulative surplus of about, 70,000 for those possessing no post-primary qualification and a cumulative deficit of a similar order for those with intermediate (or equivalent) certificate. The growing shortage of technicians is particularly disquieting because of the critical importance of this category of worker for economic expansion ... the broad picture as seen by the team is likely to remain; namely too many workers lacking the appropriate skills and too few with a higher educational qualification.</P>
    <P>On top of that, there is a growing awareness among the public generally of the handicaps arising in later life from the lack of an adequate education. There is accordingly widespread and growing pressure for post-primary <Col N="1885" /> educational facilities to be brought within the reach of all.</P>
    <P Just="Center">PART A&mdash;POST-PRIMARY EDUCATION.</P>
    <P>These then are the considerations that moved me to seek Government sanction to make available beginning in September, 1967, the opportunity for free post-primary education up to the end of the leaving certificate course.  In this regard the Government decided that it would be highly undesirable to introduce &ldquo;free&rdquo; post-primary education at any level on the basis of a means test and felt that such a procedure should be avoided.  The scheme which I now put before the House proposes a supplemental State grant to schools in certain fee ranges on the condition that they will discontinue charging school fees, that is, that they will offer free education to all pupils.  I expect that the majority of day schools will opt to take this scheme.</P>
    <P>I propose that the supplemental grant be the equivalent of the fees charged to the pupils at present subject to a minimum of £15 and a maximum of £25.  The minimum is proposed for two reasons: first, to ensure that reasonably adequate facilities are provided and, second, to avoid the accusation that schools which have held their fees at a very low level are being penalised.  In regard to the maximum of £25 it is my hope that this sum would make the scheme acceptable to all schools charging £30 or less at present, as there would be a guaranteed payment of £25 per pupil whereas at present in most schools the total fees actually collected fall short of those charged.  On this basis, about 75 per cent of day pupils in secondary schools, 61,500 pupils, would have free education available to them.  The remaining 25 per cent of day pupils attend schools charging day fees in excess of £30 per annum and will be free to continue attending these schools if their parents want them to do so and are prepared to pay the school fees.</P>
    <P>The schools charging fees in excess of £30 would continue to receive the <Col N="1886" /> capitation grants, science and other special grants payable by the Department and would continue also to have the incremental salaries of their teachers paid by the Department.  I might stress that all secondary schools whether they would come within my scheme or not would continue to enjoy the same degree of autonomy as they do at present.</P>
    <P>The existing fees in the comprehensive schools are £6 per annum and these will be abolished.  The existing fees in the vocational schools and secondary tops attached to national schools are very low and it is considered that an additional grant of £4 per pupil would be sufficient to enable these schools to abolish fees altogether.</P>
    <P>There are a number of pupils whose places of residence are so remote as to put them outside the range of a transport service.  Because of the amount of time involved in travelling I feel that the effective radial limit of a school transport service should not exceed 15 miles.  Such pupils would, accordingly, be precluded from post-primary education unless they attended boarding schools.  I propose, therefore, to give their cases special consideration.</P>
    <P>There are furthermore a number of other pupils who attend boarding schools because the vocation they have set before themselves makes their attendance at such schools necessary. I have in mind in that regard especially the Diocesan Colleges.  I propose also to give special consideration to this other group of pupils.</P>
    <P>The Protestant community could possibly benefit to the same extent as the Catholic community under the proposed scheme.  While 75 per cent of Catholic pupils in secondary schools would benefit under the scheme only 7½ per cent of Protestant pupils would do so.  The reasons are as follows: (a) the cost of education in Protestant schools is higher because of the nature of the organisation which must obtain in the case of these schools; (b) because of the dearth of suitable day schools, a very high proportion of Protestant pupils&mdash;two out of every five&mdash;can only receive post-primary <Col N="1887" /> education by attending boarding schools.</P>
    <P>The Protestant schools are, therefore, a special problem and, I feel, require special assistance.  It could be argued that they would be discriminated against because the nature of their problem would put them virtually outside the scope of the scheme for free education.  The transport scheme for Protestant pupils attending national schools already recognises the unfavourable position of these children <i>vis-à-vis</i> Catholic children in respect of accessibility of suitable national schools.  The principle, therefore, of special treatment for Protestants to meet their special difficulties has already been recognised by my Department.</P>
    <P>I found it necessary, accordingly, to devise a scheme of assistance for Protestant children receiving post-primary education so as to provide equity of treatment with Catholic children.  My proposal is to give the supplemental grant of £25 per pupil to approximately 75 per cent of Protestant day pupils, that is, the same overall ratio as for Catholics. The amount of the fee which they are obliged to charge impelled me to offer the maximum assistance per pupil of £25.  Obviously, it is not possible to operate a scheme on the school basis, as is proposed for Catholic pupils, and I am entirely opposed to my setting up a means test for Protestant pupils only.  As an alternative, I propose to channel the grant through a central representative agency, as I do in the case of the transport scheme, and let that authority distribute the money to the individual schools on the basis of the needs of the pupils. It is understood that the Protestant school authorities would be prepared to operate such an arrangement. Protestant day pupils total 3,600 in all, and to provide a grant of £25 for about 75 per cent of that number would cost approximately £70,000.</P>
    <P>These then are my proposals in relation to the provision of free tuition in the post-primary schools.  The cost of these proposals in a full year would be approximately £1,630,000.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1888" /> Under our present system of post-primary education the obstacles in the way of the student from the lower income family may be set down as follows: the inability of his parents to pay the school fees demanded; their inability to meet the cost of school books and requisites; the need for an additional breadwinner in the family; the absence of motivation from the family environment; and the cost of transport in rural areas.</P>
    <P>This nation is dependent largely on our human resources and our economic and social well-being demands that we exploit to the full the abilities and aptitudes of our people.  It is essential, therefore, that all pupils be encouraged to achieve an educational proficiency in accord with their varying abilities and talents.  In particular, pupils who could profit from a course leading to the leaving certificate should not be baulked of it because of inability to meet the necessary costs.  But it is not sufficient for pupils from the lower income groups that free tuition be available to them: the other difficulties in their way must be removed or alleviated as far as possible.</P>
    <P>For such pupils, then, the State must offer more than free tuition.  Financial assistance towards the purchase of books and other accessories must be provided for them.  Already they will be lacking in reading opportunity and this initial disadvantage will be aggravated by their inability to purchase the text books they need.</P>
    <P>The price of school books has increased considerably over the years and now represents a sizable sum, particularly in the case of a family with two or more children attending post-primary schools.  On entering a post-primary school, books, excluding copy books, will cost about £10.  While these books will bring a pupil to the end of the intermediate certificate course, he must provide copy books each year at a cost of about £1 a year. On entering the leaving certificate course, books, excluding copy books, will cost about £12.  Any plan for free post-primary education must, I feel, provide for the supply of free books <Col N="1889" /> and accessories to those who need them.</P>
    <P>Having stated the case for assistance in this regard it is necessary to consider how best, from an administrative point of view, a scheme of assistance may be implemented.  My approach to this problem is, if possible, to avoid setting up a means test scheme, and to find the most flexible administrative procedure.</P>
    <P>In my view, the best approach to the problem and the one most socially acceptable would be to operate the free book scheme through the headmaster of the school.  This approach would have the advantage of being easy and economical to administer.  In the aggregate, free books would not be supplied to more than 25 per cent of eligible pupils&mdash;eligible pupils being defined as those attending schools providing free tuition.  The headmaster would know the pupils most in need of assistance and he would supply the books to these pupils and be reimbursed by the Department.  Copy books to a maximum value of £1 per year would be allowed in each year of the course. Each school would be allocated a quota or a percentage of the total enrolment depending on the area in which the school is situated and, to some extent, on the fee charged in the previous year.</P>
    <P>For example, secondary schools catering to a large degree for lower income group families in urban and rural areas and vocational schools would be given a higher than average percentage.  It may be assumed that about 25 per cent of the entrants to post-primary schools would normally be eligible and this overall percentage would be regarded as a constant factor. The grant in respect of each individual pupil will vary in accord with the course followed by him but on average it might be reckoned at £8 for the first year of the intermediate certificate course and £4 for each of the two subsequent years; at £10 for the first year of the leaving certificate and £5 for the following year.  The cost in the first <Col N="1890" /> financial year, 1967-68 is estimated at about £100,000.</P>
    <P>In the lower income group there will also be a number of pupils whose particular family circumstances will be such that even with the provision of free tuition and free books the keeping of them at school will still be a hardship on their parents.  When my scheme is in operation and I have had an opportunity to assess the extent of this problem, I shall have to see what special provision for such cases should be made.</P>
    <P>I fully realise that provision for education does not stop at leaving certificate level and that any plan for equality of opportunity in education cannot ignore education at university level.  In the proposals I have outlined already I have not made academic achievement a condition of assistance because my goal is to encourage all pupils to continue in post-primary education for as long as they can get value from it, in courses&mdash;academic, technical, commercial or apprentice&mdash; suited to their inclinations and aptitudes. Assistance at university level is however a different matter altogether. Here, I am satisfied that a high standard of educational attainment must be a prerequisite for assistance.</P>
    <P>When I came to considering details of a scheme of assistance at this level, I found myself in the difficulty that we have a Commission on Higher Education examining all aspects of higher education.  I felt that it would not be appropriate for me to work out a detailed scheme without awaiting the report of that Commission and studying whatever proposals in that regard they may decide to make.  My present information is that the Commission hope to report in February.  I propose, therefore, to wait until then before finalising my detailed scheme.  In the meantime I will have whatever consultations may be necessary with the university authorities.</P>
    <P>As the proposals contained in my scheme for post-primary will obviate the necessity for post-primary scholarships, I intend that schemes for the award of such scholarships be discontinued and that the moneys provided for them be devoted to other educational <Col N="1891" /> purposes.  Accordingly scholarship examinations will not be held after 1967.  Existing holders of scholarships in September, 1967, will continue to hold them until the end of the normal period of tenure.</P>
    <P Just="Center">TRANSPORT.</P>
    <P>In the light of the Government decision to raise the school-leaving age to 15 by 1970 and the policy of providing up to three years post-primary education for all children, it will be absolutely essential to provide a State-supported transport system to post-primary schools.  Full-scale attendance at post-primary schools could not be achieved in many areas without such a service because of the heavy burden which would fall on parents in respect of transport costs.  Moreover, the rationalisation of post-primary educational facilities requires that we insist on reasonably sized units.  But it will not be possible to adhere to the present policy of refusal to sanction smaller schools, which could not provide an adequate curriculum and would be uneconomic in terms of buildings, equipment and teachers, unless transport is provided to the larger centres.</P>
    <P>State assistance towards transport costs will have to be provided in respect of pupils attending both types of post-primary school.  Primary, vocational and secondary pupils often travel in the same bus.  No new principle would be involved in State subsidisation of school transport as, in addition to the travel scholarships awarded by vocational education committees, the Department of Education already subsidises transport schemes in respect of national schools, special schools, and the new comprehensive schools, while Roinn na Gaeltachta subsidises school transport services in Gaeltacht areas.</P>
    <P>One of the main findings of the Investment in Education Report was the great inequality based on social group and geographical location in the participation of children in post-primary education at all levels.  I have already quoted the reference in the Report to inequality in participation due to social group.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1892" /> With regard to the effect of geographical location, the Report includes statistics for the year 1962-63 which show the distribution of national school pupils (aged 11) by distance of the national school to the nearest post-primary school.  They show that almost a quarter, that is, about 10,000 pupils, were more than five miles from the nearest post-primary school and about 4.5 per cent, or 2,000 pupils, were more than ten miles from the nearest post-primary school.  These are the distances of the national schools, of course, and not the distances of the pupils' homes.  The finding, however, is still valid.</P>
    <P>In reference to this, the NIEC, in their comments on the Report, said: &ldquo;If we are to move towards the ideal of equal educational opportunity for all, the causes of the present inequalities must as far as possible be removed&rdquo;.  The underlying factor behind the proposal to establish a State-supported transport scheme is to remove inequalities based on geographical location.  Progress with a view to widening the participation rate will not be achieved without a nationwide scheme.</P>
    <P>A situation is now developing in which immediate action is required. There is first of all the position in regard to existing transport schemes run by local school authorities or local parents' associations.  I should like at this juncture to pay the highest possible tribute to these public spirited citizens who have already organised transport schemes to post-primary schools and have with tremendous effort on their part raised funds towards financing them.  It is being found increasingly difficult to maintain such schemes in operation in the face of rising costs and I am under severe pressure to come to their assistance financially.</P>
    <P>In addition, the surveys of post-primary educational facilities to which I referred earlier highlight the need for the concentration of schools so that better facilities and greater opportunity may be available to all pupils.  Proposals to this end inevitably raise questions in regard to transport and it will not be possible to get agreement <Col N="1893" /> on these proposals unless financial assistance towards the cost of transport is forthcoming.  The transport problem is particularly acute in the counties designated as small farm areas, because of the nature of the terrain, the low level of incomes generally and the number of widely scattered small schools in these areas.  The density of population is lowest in these areas, and the only economic way of providing post-primary facilities in them is by means of transport.</P>
    <P>Having reviewed the whole position, I have come to the conclusion that the only effective way of providing transport to post-primary schools so as to ensure equality of educational opportunity for all children is for the Government to defray the full cost without any means test of transport for pupils living more than three miles from a post-primary school.  It is very difficult at this stage to give a precise estimate of the cost involved but it is anticipated that for 1967-68 it would be about £300,000.  When the scheme is fully operational in all areas of the country, the annual cost will probably reach £1,000,000.  It is my intention that the scheme will come into operation as from 1st April, 1967.</P>
    <P>In relation to this figure of cost it must be borne in mind that in the long term substantial savings will accrue in respect of buildings, teachers and school equipment.  The erection of a substantial number of new schools will be avoided; existing teaching staffs can be utilised to greater advantage; costly school equipment will be used economically.  This policy is in line with that suggested by Investment in Education and is supported by the NIEC comments on that report.  It is a policy that is right on educational and on economic grounds.</P>
    <P>In the costings of my scheme which I have given I have confined myself to items of direct cost.  There will of course be additional charges by way of increased accommodation and equipment and increased numbers of teachers.  I prefer to treat these as normal growth items within the context of a national commitment to education. It would be highly unrealistic to <Col N="1894" /> suggest that my proposals can be implemented other than by concrete arrangements for raising the money to meet them.</P>
    <P>Every worthwhile development in the social and economic advancement of any nation calls for some sacrifice on the part of those best able to bear it &mdash;that is what we will be asking our people to accept in the implementation of these proposals.</P>
    <P>In relation to my proposal, it must be borne in mind also that as Minister for Education and acting as a member of a responsible Government, I cannot place any Utopian scheme before the House.  It is very easy to promise the sun, moon and stars when there is little prospect of your being called upon to implement such promises. When in September last I announced that I would introduce a scheme of free education the members of the principal Opposition Party told all and sundry that I was making a promise that would never be fulfilled.  They asked where was the money going to come from.  Suddenly it dawned on them that here was something that was going to be implemented and implemented in a responsible way. They then rushed out their policy for education and the scene changed over night.  The country which was bankrupt in their eyes a few weeks ago is now so opulent that the buoyancy in revenue can be expected to be such as to pay for an education plan running into many millions without any resort to additional taxation.</P>
    <P>I ask this House to endorse the proposals I have put before them and to say who is acting responsibly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to engage in the perennial fraudulent practice of introducing my speech on the Estimate through the medium of our national language.  The Minister has devoted the shortest proportion in Irish on record, ten and a half lines. He read eight and a quarter, leaving the second last sentence out&mdash;why, I <Col N="1895" /> do not know.  What is remarkable about this document is what it does not contain and more remarkable still is the fact that obviously three full pages have in what must be recent times been pulled from what was obviously the original and the numbering of the pages from there on is different.</P>
      <P>It is interesting to note, too, that the small typing, the last paragraph of the Minister's speech, the Minister's final but unusually restrained outburst at the Opposition, was a last minute effort.  We hope, and let this be said once and for all, that the Minister will not alone be able to implement, if he is still there, the scheme he has proposed, but that it will be fully implemented by next September, as he has promised, so that he can be spared the embarrassment of having to resign. I notice the Taoiseach when asked about this in recent weeks said this was a remark made in the heat of the moment and that one could not reasonably be held accountable for remarks made at such moments so that he is let out already by his Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>There are certain aspects of the speech on the Estimate which relate entirely to financial matters.  This is not a policy on education.  This is a policy in relation to certain fees, certain maintenance and to transport.  It is spattered with pious hopes about availability but there is nothing to indicate to the House or to the country that during all those times the Minister was refusing to answer questions in relation to education, there was going on a mighty examination, a most exhaustive survey, of the things which require to be examined and require to be surveyed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You do not alter education or you do not improve education in bits and pieces, as this document would tend to suggest.  The Minister raised his voice occasionally during the reading of this document to indicate either the existence of a threat or a promise in that particular spot, but nowhere in the course of this whole document is there a single reference to the fundamentals of education or what education is.  Nowhere have we got a guideline as to <Col N="1896" /> what the aims are in the Department for primary education, for secondary education, for vocational education, or indeed as to what university education should be.  This is the Minister, who when he gets a public opportunity, taunts people about not having a policy, thereby suggesting he has one or will have one.</P>
    <P>This is not a policy and can never be construed as such.  This is a makeshift document rushed over the weekend in order to combat the publication of the Fine Gael policy a few days ago. It is suggested by the Minister that the Fine Gael policy was begotten in a rush.  I want to say here and now that the study of the policy and the proposals contained therein, which we have published in the course of the past few days, are the result of long and arduous study by people experienced in all fields of education and in related activities, by people who gave of their time, unsparingly and freely, without cost.  We have produced a document which deals with aims, which deals with the manner in which we can carry out those aims.</P>
    <P>The people must, I venture to say at this stage, recognise where the true interest lies in the case of a Party who, without the slightest amount of State aid, and with recourse only to their own funds and to people who offered to befriend them and to befriend, through them, the country and the schoolgoing people of this country produced a policy of magnitude and detail. That is the composition which we produced over the past few days.  Here we have the Department of Education, with all their officials, with all their money, with all the buoyancy and so on who can only produce a document with ten and a half lines in Irish and about 29 pages in English dealing with certain unrelated facts and figures.  Let nobody be under any illusion that this is a policy.</P>
    <P>Wherever we went for the past few days after the publication of our policy, we were all told: &ldquo;Wait until the Education Estimate comes in and Deputy O'Malley, the Minister for Education, will have such a programme, will be able to outline the aims of education, the policies in respect of the <Col N="1897" /> various branches of education, that he will wipe all of this off the pages of the newspapers, and the people will realise that he is the real Messianic force of our time in relation to preaching the gospel of free education and all other things connected with it.&rdquo;  What will they think now when here today is presented, in relation to education, by the Minister who says he is a Minister of a responsible Government, the dampest squib which has ever been presented in this House?  What are the people going to think?  Will they not describe this Minister, who showed a bravery on the 10th of September at 7.30 p.m. in the Royal Marine Hotel, Dún Laoghaire, that is not matched in this document on 30th November, less than two months later, in the words of Disraeli in <i>Menjnoun</i> as a &ldquo;figure flitting across the stage, as a transient and embarrassed phantom&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>Let us examine this document.  I do not propose to go through all the points in it but the Minister does use the words &ldquo;university scholarship&rdquo; on page 2.  According to the Minister, the word &ldquo;scholarship&rdquo; has become a dirty word in recent times.  That is true, of course.  He said later on that scholarships would be abolished but I do not think he should go that far.  There must always be a certain incentive for the truly academic in that respect.  The word &ldquo;scholarship&rdquo; must be retained particularly in relation to research, in relation to post-graduate work, going abroad to different universities in Europe, America or anywhere else. It must be retained and let nobody try, particularly a Minister for Education, to cast aspersions on the connotations of that word.  One would think that it was a dirty word associated in some way with a progress that was not clean and a research that was not honest.  Let us not try to kill the essentials in getting rid of some unpleasant detail.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to untrained teachers and the fact that no untrained teachers had been recruited since 1958. That is true.  However, I should not like to think that any implication against any untrained teachers, particularly those who are still in service and who have given most magnificent <Col N="1898" /> service, particularly those in isolated areas who produced extremely good pupils and taught them well would go out from this House.  We are approaching an age in which training and longer training courses will be necessary.  A view which I have held for a very long time, and which I expressed as far back as 1955 when I made my maiden speech on education in this House, in relation to the training of teachers is that there should be a very careful selection, and the selection should be made at a time when not alone the selection body has material from which to select but the selected have reached an age where clearly they are capable of making up their own minds about what they want, and particularly in relation to the fact that they feel that they have a vocation, because teaching demands a vocation more than any other profession.  These untrained teachers who have stood us in good stead down the years have had that vocation.  They may not have had the training and the highly finished off courses but they had the vocation necessary to carry out the particular job in the particular area in which they were situated and were called upon to teach.</P>
    <P>I sympathise with the view now being adopted in regard to the rules covering singing and needlework being made less rigid for candidates entering the training colleges.  I still think that singing should be there as a subject which one could take advantage of, if one were a singer.  There are people who are singers and others who are not and will never be.  I do not know so much about the abandoning of needlework for women because after all they are the needleworkers at all phases of their lives.  I am not so certain that a girl should go through her training as a teacher without at least being able to instruct children in the very meagre, elemental things necessary in the average household, or at least being able to give such additional help as might be needed to supplement what the girl child already learns in her home.</P>
    <P>On page 7 of the Minister's speech, he refers to the introduction into post-primary schools as from September, 1967 of graded courses in Irish designed <Col N="1899" /> to improve oral proficiency in the language.  He goes on to say:</P>
    <P>These graded courses will go hand-in-hand with the introduction of an oral test in Irish as part of a revised syllabus in Irish for intermediate certificate pupils.</P>
    <P>However, he has not told us anything about the structure of the courses, or how this will fit into the whole structure, although at the bottom of the page he says:</P>
    <P>I have under review at the moment the whole question of the structure of the leaving certificate courses and examination and of the syllabuses that would be required.  I hope to get these matters moving during the current school year.</P>
    <P>I would have thought that a Minister who was boasting a few weeks ago of having a policy and taunting others with not having one, would not at this stage of the academic year be merely surveying or examining or hoping to have something done by the end of the year.  These words &ldquo;survey&rdquo; and &ldquo;examination&rdquo; are words frequently used in the course of this speech.  On page 13, in the general section, the word &ldquo;survey&rdquo; is used and again on page 14, we have it in the references to the comprehensive schools and to the Department's inspectorate where the Minister says &ldquo;which it is hoped to have in general operation in September of next year&rdquo;.  There is the pious aspiration again: &ldquo;it is hoped&rdquo;.  Surely with the expert knowledge available to him in his Department, he should not, at the end of November, be hoping about what is going to happen next September.  We are in the&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is a good bit.  I hope the Minister is not now going to break forth from the chains that were binding him while he was reading this and become the charming extrovert he usually is, so charming as to be dangerous.  I welcome the provision of school books but once the Minister has gone any distance in this regard, he should go the whole way.  I would deplore the spectacle of a headmaster in any school giving out school books to some pupils in the presence of others.  It would be a very bad thing. This is a matter at which he should look again.  It is not a field of national activity where costs, particularly small costs, should operate to affect any kind of division like that, although in other proposals the Minister is creating that trouble.</P>
      <P>I also welcome the special consideration given to the Protestant community in relation to their schools, their transport and their difficulties as a minority. That is something with which I, personally, have a special sympathy having taught in at least two of these schools in my time.  I must say that everything was done in them at all times to maintain a high standard of education and a breadth of education. As is not commonly supposed by our brethren, the national spirit operates in them just as strongly as&mdash;in fact in some cases more strongly&mdash;in some of our own schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note that the Minister says that the <Col N="1901" /> number of comprehensive schools will not be large.  Is this a climb-down from the original expression that there would be pilot institutions in various places?  If it is a climb-down or if it represents a re-assessment of the situation, perhaps the Minister will tell us why that is so and why he has said the number of comprehensive schools will not be large.</P>
    <P>He has told us that the Department is completing a survey of post-primary education needs.  This is not yet completed and yet we have a scheme and we have costings on page 22 of his report.  I do not know if there is anything in this but I want to be quite fair to the Minister and give him an opportunity of explaining it in his reply.  Is there any difference between what he said originally in regard to free post-primary education and what he now says about opportunity for free post-primary education?  There may well be no difference but once phrases are changed, something always becomes suspect, and if there is one thing I do not want to happen either in regard to the Fine Gael policy or the Fianna Fáil lack of policy in respect of education, it is that there should be any element of cynicism getting into the minds of our people regarding these proposals. Perhaps the Minister is doing his best even in producing nothing; perhaps this is the position in which he finds himself in spite of all the help he has available.</P>
    <P>On page 19 of his report where the Minister deals with increased capitation fees to schools that go over a certain fee per head per year, he is dividing our educational system into a two-class basis and that is not good.</P>

      <P>But the Minister is doing it in his scheme.  He is dividing the educational system into two parts on a class basis.  That is the meaning of what is on page 19.  The Fine Gael scheme, on the other hand, which was announced a few days ago, encourages the schools to come in and provide a minimum of one-third free places for children whose parents cannot now afford to send them to these schools. The Fianna Fáil policy introduces a <Col N="1902" /> class division in that respect.  I hope that Deputy Mrs. Desmond will speak later on this matter for the Labour Party.  I think the Labour Party have erred a little in that direction also but perhaps the Deputy will be able to deal with that and satisfy us that this is not so.  Our overall effort in this regard is one aimed at democratising these schools.</P>
      <P>There is also discrimination by the Minister in favour of the high-fee schools as he offers them more than the low-fee schools.  That is not equitable and is something he should look at again.  He does not say anything about local maintenance grants. We have proposed them, as he will find if he has read our policy, at levels up to £100 for parents in the social welfare category.  He talks of book allowances of £10 to £12 but I have dealt with that and pointed out what I consider the undesirable feature of it.  By not having local maintenance grants, I think he will probably go a long way towards defeating this scheme because the non-adoption of maintenance grants will prevent real equality of opportunity.  In so far as this is touched on in <i>Investment in Education</i> at page 398, the <i>Investment in Education</i> recommendation is rejected by the Minister.</P>
      <P>On page 26 of his report, he tells us he has no provision for universities because he is awaiting the Commission's report.  It is six years since the Commission was appointed.  I know that to await the report of a Commission is always a good excuse for delay, but there is no need to wait for the report of the Commission to decide what to do as regards opening up the universities to all who can benefit.  We have made our suggestion in this matter.  We have come out boldly in relation to the number of places in Dublin University taken up each year by foreigners which could well be occupied by Irish students.  We spoke of the ecclesiastical difficulties in the way and we hope that once goodwill is sought in that regard, it will be forthcoming from the particular ecclesiastical authority concerned.  We are sure it will.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Speaking at Dún Laoghaire last <Col N="1903" /> September, the Minister said a lot about universities and what he was going to do about them.  I want to get this quotation, particularly the bit about our old university.  The Minister has had the distinction, should I say, of going to the same university as I did in Galway.  It was on page 7 of the Minister's speech last September:</P>
    <P>I have decided, however, the problem of overcrowding must be tackled at once, and shall, therefore, very shortly give the green light to Dublin and Cork for the building plans which they have put before me.</P>
    <P>Then in the last sentence:</P>
    <P>I am also giving consideration to the difficulties of University College, Galway.</P>
    <P>Upon my word, he gave them consideration. It is dealt with on page 11 of the Minister's speech.  University College, Dublin gets £187,990; University College, Cork gets £246,000, Trinity College, Dublin gets £311,000; and University College, Galway, to whose difficulties he was adverting last September, gets £56,620.</P>

      <P>On page 29 the Minister refers to transport without a means test.  That is a better proposal than the one we have except, of course, there may be a question as to whether it is free transport.  It says &ldquo;State supported&rdquo;. Whatever that means I do not know.  The Minister, of course, will tell us in his reply.  However, I am prepared to concede, on the face of it, that this transport proposal is a better one than that contained in our programme of a few days ago.</P>
      <P>As I was saying earlier on, I have been dealing with the matters generally that struck me in the course of reading the speech itself but what I want to know is where is the Fianna Fáil Government policy on education, as promised?  Ours has been published.  I hope the Minister will tell us where the Fianna Fáil policy is.  I also want to know from him what are the Fianna Fáil policies, first of all, on the reorganisation of the Department of Education.  If he does not propose reorganisation, does it mean he is satisfied with it?  I want to say we are not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reference to curricula and examinations, our proposal is that these be taken out of politics altogether through this education committee which is mentioned in the course of our policy document.  In that way we would hope to take it away from politics and from the administrative side of the Department, giving it to a committee of experts on the outside who would have terms of reference.  They would report publicly to the Minister on these <Col N="1905" /> matters and the Minister, if he thought it in the national interest to accept them, would do so, but if he thought it was not in the national interest, he would say in public why he was rejecting them.</P>
    <P>Has the Fianna Fáil policy, if they have such a policy at all, any educational planning link with NIEC?  Not even in this document is it clear that it has.</P>
    <P>At the present time the aim of our primary education system is to provide a minimum.  I think anybody who knows anything about any aspect of education will agree that a minimum should not be the aim, that the aim should be maximal with the facilities with which people can work.  We want the aims of primary education stated. We have stated them and we want the Minister to state now what he thinks they are.  We want the reform of the primary curriculum.  We want to widen it and to give our children an education comparable with that of children in other countries.  It is quite clear from our document that we want less time for core subjects, that is, Irish, English and arithmetic, thereby allowing more of the school time to be devoted to subjects that will improve the child and be good for him or her at a later time. At the present time 85 to 90 per cent of the teaching time in any day in a primary school is taken up with Irish, English and arithmetic, only ten per cent with history, geography, algebra, geometry, singing, needlework, any of these things one cares to mention.  What can be done in ten per cent of the time of the school week in regard to these subjects?  In our view, it is not long enough.  For that reason, we propose to cut down the time for core subjects to one hour per day, thus leaving much longer time for the others.</P>
    <P>We propose acceleration of the school building programme.  There is no change in the present inadequate rate of building primary schools.  We have proposed in our document a 25 per cent acceleration.  There is a scheme for secondary school building which, to say the least of it, is fraudulent.  If you want to get an extra classroom and there is anything like an oratory or a <Col N="1906" /> dormitory, you will not get it.  This kind of thing, particularly in relation to boarding schools, is ridiculous in the extreme.</P>
    <P>What has the Minister got to say&mdash;he did not say anything in his speech&mdash; about the problem of the slow-learning child?  This is nothing new.  We have been talking about it down through the years.  In a speech I made in 1955, I referred to the problem of the slow-learning child, the child who was slow for a time or slow all the time, but one who would nevertheless benefit if properly taught and who cannot be taught in a class with children of average intelligence because that kind of child invariably finds himself in the back desk.  Through no fault of their own, these children do not make the progress they should make if they were properly handled.  What provision is being made to get trained teachers in primary schools for these children?  It must be conceded straight away that that will not be easy in rural areas where the densities of population are not that high, but it should be possible in the larger centres of population to make proper educational facilities available to these children and have specially trained teachers for them.</P>
    <P>We have also advocated parents' committees in primary schools, and also an improvement in the cleaning and maintenance of these schools.  Has the Minister any policy on these matters?  He does not say so today. Perhaps he will say so in his reply.  Has he any policy on the bringing of non-aided schools into the system, to get control of them and provide aid for the employment of trained teachers? In that respect I would say that, in an otherwise very good welcome given to our policy by a spokesman of the INTO, he said he thought this attempt to bring in the non-aided private schools was an unhealthy sign because the standard in them was low.  We recognise that the standard may well be lower in some of them than in the average run of national schools, but what we want is to encourage these non-aided, small private schools to come in and take over the status of national schools by the employment of qualified teachers <Col N="1907" /> and by the teaching of all of the required subjects in our primary school curriculum.  I want to assure the INTO that they have misunderstood us in that regard.  It was not a question of giving aid to people who were doing less than they were.  It was a question of giving aid to people if they came up to the standard of the average primary school and employed teachers to do so.</P>
    <P>We have advocated an improvement in education for apprentices.  Have Fianna Fáil any policy for that?  We have proposed the introduction of Irish technician certificates.  Have Fianna Fáil any policy in that regard?  We have proposed the elimination of Irish as an essential qualification in the leaving certificate and matriculation and require teaching through the language of the home, unless parents agree to the contrary.  In this respect our policy with regard to the leaving certificate is that if a boy or girl gets the required number of subjects, five, it does not matter what they are, it would be our intention to give them the leaving certificate in those subjects. It would be a matter afterwards for those who seek their employment as to whether they will want them if they have certain subjects or do not want them if they have not got others.</P>
    <P>In our language policy, which has been issued separately, we would have the teaching of Irish right through the secondary school.  That would be necessary for the purpose of people entering the Civil Service, training as teachers or for many other purposes indeed.  But, at the same time to anyone who wanted to develop any other subject and selected any other five subjects, which did not include Irish or even English, we would give them the leaving certificate, provided they were satisfied that was the kind of thing they wanted to do.  We will never have the teaching of any subject through any language not the language of the home, thereby placing an extraordinary burden, one almost incapable of being borne, on parents at home trying to assist their children. That, I think, is logical and can be seen straight away.</P>
    <P>I would like to know what policy <Col N="1908" /> the Government have on this.  I know the Minister said a few words at the end about the Irish language being our language.  Of course, it is our language. These are beautiful statements; but I notice the Minister did not repeat a statement, with which I fully agree, which he made in a speech at Dún Laoghaire.  In that statement he said that the Irish language&mdash;but I had better get this right because I want to get it on the record.  In page 8 of the Minister's speech at Dún Laoghaire to the National Union of Journalists in paragraph 2, he said:</P>
    <P>The language is not the property of any group or organisation.  It belongs to us all equally.  This week we celebrate the 750th anniversary of Ballintubber Abbey, the Abbey that refused to die.  There is an analogy here for those who wish to ponder on it.</P>
    <P>That is not so important.  That was one of the purple patches introduced by the Minister.  But he goes on to say in the next paragraph:</P>
    <P>If we in this generation allow the language to become a political plaything or to become the preserve of any organisation or group, no matter how well intentioned, then we might as well be honest with ourselves and throw the language on the scrapheap.</P>
    <P>I want to put it to the Minister now that at every available opportunity the Fianna Fáil Party seek to take the language unto their bosom and claim it specifically as their own.  What one says at a meeting in Dún Laoghaire is quite different from what one says in this House.  I would have far more admiration for the Minister if he had repeated that statement here in the House as well as making it in Dún Laoghaire.</P>
    <P>Is there any provision in the Fianna Fáil policy, if such exists, for university research such as is contained in our policy?  We have not heard from the Minister.  We hope we will.  What is the Government's policy on the training of teachers?  We have suggested the university link.  So have the Labour Party in their election manifesto, but they have not gone as far <Col N="1909" /> as we have.  They have gone to the point that they should attend lectures, but it is not suggested that they get degrees.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>In our policy we propose that the primary teachers' period of training be increased and that they learn the mechanics of the job. Teachers in the training college would have a link with the university where they would proceed to take their degrees.  We have also proposed one salary structure for primary, secondary and vocational teachers, all of them with university degrees.  We propose to pay secondary teachers their increments immediately they start in their first year.  They will not have to wait for this two-year period, always a period of great difficulty and almost starvation for some people in the past.</P>
      <P>What is the Government's policy on the question of recognising the service of teachers abroad?  I know they have gone the distance in accepting the service of those in the missionary areas in emerging Africa, parts of the East and South America.  They have also accepted service in Northern Ireland, but the bulk of our graduates are in Great Britain.  What is the objection to giving them recognition if they have the qualifications in the subjects which they seek to teach and for which there is a vacancy for them?  Mr. Cathcart, Headmaster of Sandford Park School, mentioned this yesterday, as reported in today's papers, and dealt with it very clearly.  He points out the academic and broadly cultural educational experience gained by these people while abroad.  It is a speech which I would commend to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister told us he said last July he would change the method of appointment of teachers to vocational schools and take it out of the hands of the committees.  I do not know where he said it or when he said it, <Col N="1910" /> but I shall take his word for it, though I must point out that it is in our programme.</P>
    <P>What is the programme of this Government on the training and retraining of teachers?  Have they any programme for the improvement of promotional opportunities for primary and secondary teachers?  Have they any programme or intention of including teachers in the policy-making group?</P>
    <P>Over 20 issues are mentioned in our programme, issues that are occupying the attention of educationists and experts in education all over this country and about which we have speeches from day to day.  There are 20 real live issues to which the Minister has not made the slightest reference.  I invite him to refer to all of these matters when he comes to reply.  Tell us what the Government policy is.  Tell us where we can find it.  Tell us if it is published or even if it is in a leaflet securely tucked away in some file in some departmental room.</P>
    <P>These financial provisions which the Minister has announced here today are inspired by <i>Investment In Education</i>, this sizable booklet.  There does not appear to be any original thinking done in the Department or even by the Minister or at Government level but even where this <i>Investment In Education</i> report has been drawn upon, it has been twisted so as to introduce a new class division in our education to which I referred earlier on.</P>
    <P>Once we proceed to draw upon <i>Investment In Education</i> as a source of inspiration of policy, we should not miss, as I think the Minister is missing, the opportunity to have our schools, particularly the high-fee schools, more democratic or fully democratic, with, of course, their co-operation&mdash;a co-operation which I understand is readily forthcoming.</P>
    <P>At the same time as trying to draw upon <i>Investment In Education</i> as a source for inspiration of a speech of this limited kind, its recommendation of local maintenance grants for post-primary education and the provision of these grants is, in our view, vital <Col N="1911" /> to the success of any efforts to introduce equality of opportunity.  It would appear to me, having listened to the Minister and having regard to what we expected today, that the Government had no idea at all on a whole range of educational problems which I have mentioned.  The Government cannot know very much except what the Minister tells them in this regard as various Ministers have their own difficult problems.</P>
    <P>The Government, through the Minister, are in the hands of the administrative civil servant who, as an administrative agent, must be regarded as extremely good and extremely sound but cannot be regarded by himself as the policy maker.  He has not got the expertise and, in very many cases, he has not time to get the knowledge or to do the research necessary for the formulation of policy of the magnitude necessary with regard to the education of our children. As long as the administrative side is left in control of education in this country, we shall always have this predicament.</P>
    <P>May I say, having listened to the Minister and, again having regard to what we were promised, a full range of policy, that this Government have been shown up, really shown up, this week as absolutely bankrupt of ideas on education and its primary aims and the necessity for the examination of these aims, the necessity for full research into every aspect of our education, primary, vocational, secondary and university?</P>
    <P>There were some problems that might give rise to trouble in areas of sensitivity.  We faced them in our policy document.  I want the Minister to face up to them now because, there, it is not by piecemeal either in transport or in the payment of fees or in matters of that kind that we shall achieve the aims necessary for a proper education of our children.  I do not think anybody can deny that our effort in putting forth this policy was an effort resulting from long and intense study with magnificent help given by interested people free of charge and in their spare time.  To them we are deeply grateful. <Col N="1912" /> We hope that the country will benefit by their work as well, realising at all times that the state of a country and the future of a country depend, in the last analysis, upon the education of our children.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>This being the first Estimate which the present Minister has introduced since he took over responsibility for the Department of Education, I should like to begin by wishing him success in the Department as it follows that his success will result in better conditions for the children of the nation.  Next, I wish to pay tribute to the group connected with the report <i>Investment in Education</i>.  I think that for their two years of hard work they must now feel very much rewarded. Since their report was issued, an awareness of the deficiencies in the educational system, factual proof of the deficiencies in the educational system, has been general and widespread.  An anxiety is now felt among all political Parties to bring about an end to the defects and injustices that have existed in our system down through the years.</P>
      <P>All Parties, and possibly all people throughout the country, are conscious that, for economic and social reasons, the type of educational system we have had here for the past 40 years cannot continue and this, <i>in toto</i>&mdash; with the exception of the Labour Party, I might add at this stage, who were always conscious of these matters&mdash;is due to the evidence placed before the people by this team engaged in the publication of the document <i>Investment in Education</i>.  We are all conscious, now that the facts are before us, that, by 1970, we shall have 70,000 posts in this country for which people with the necessary educational requirements will not be available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are all conscious, as the Labour Party always have been, that education for the lower income groups in our society is appallingly low.  We are also aware that children of the higher income groups participate in post-primary education four to five times more than children of the semi-skilled and social welfare classes.  We are aware, too, that as the education <Col N="1913" /> system progresses, when we come to higher education discrimination is even greater still, and at this stage we find that participation is 68 times greater among children of the higher-salaried groups than among the lower income groups.</P>
    <P>We are all well aware of these matters, and the social conscience has been drawn to the need for definite control and definite planning in our future educational system.  There seems to be agreement that planning is necessary, not alone in education but in every sphere of activity.  The Labour Party advocate planning.  This was not popular a number of years ago and certain accusations were levelled against the Labour Party in that regard in this House.  It is agreed now that in education planning must be an essential if we are to expand and utilise our physical and human resources and if we are to get some idea of what our future needs will be.</P>
    <P>It has also been agreed that integration should take place in our educational system, and planning is necessary if integration is to take place.  There has been agreement, certainly between the Fine Gael Party and Labour, that there should be more participation between educationists and public interests generally on planning and advisory committees.  The Labour Party have since their foundation, always been cerned with the social and economic deficiencies in our educational system and for a long number of years we have been advocating the need for planning, integration, co-ordination and improved facilities in education for the lower income groups.</P>
    <P>The Minister's proposals are good and are welcome to a point.  They are proposals which I feel are necessary at this stage.  They are matters for which we must not wait much longer and we shall have a lot to say about them. There are a few points with which we do not agree and there are questions to be asked.</P>
    <P>I should like to start at the first level of education, that is, at the primary level.  The Minister has no new proposals for primary education in his <Col N="1914" /> document.  When we speak of primary education, our main concern is with the form and condition of the structures in which education is provided. All over the country, particularly in rural areas, there are schools which are positive hazards to children's health. There are schools without flush toilets and many of them have not running water.  When you speak about these things, the Minister, in particular, is inclined to say that he agrees that this problem exists, but he also seems to think that amalgamation of small schools will overcome it in the future. Amalgamation will take time.  It is a welcome process and while the preparation of all the relevant factors that have to be taken into account before amalgamation takes place will take time, these small rural schools must wait in their present structural condition.  That is No. 1 on my list.</P>
    <P>Last year when speaking on this Estimate I mentioned that in 1944 there were 2,500 unfit national schools in this country.  Twenty-one years later, in 1965, there were 2,150.  That is very poor progress over the years.  The Minister has given an account of the progress made this year but a lot more needs to be done.  This, in my opinion, is a priority, in view of the fact that the conditions in which children have to spend so many hours a day are a positive health hazard.</P>
    <P>We have spoken before about the necessity for revision in the number of classes in national schools.  The OECD survey team estimate in their report that in 1971 we will still have 33 per cent of our children in schools with 40 pupils in each class.  It is impossible for any teacher to cope with such a class and teach them and at the same time deal with those who may not be as quick on the uptake as others.  Classes of 38, which are recommended, are still too large to enable the teacher to give the individual attention needed by the children.  Teachers in our national schools are teaching in appalling conditions.</P>
    <P>We have a total lack of audio and visual aids and these are very important in 1966 when school life has to <Col N="1915" /> compete with all the other exciting and interesting things outside today.  In an INTO document a number of years ago, it was stated that the teachers were fighting a 20th century battle with the weapons of Benburb.</P>
    <P>Schools must be made attractive if children are to benefit from the education provided.  The primary school curriculum has come in for much criticism down the years and generally it is argued that the curriculum is too narrow and that various other subjects should be added.  Fifty years ago in this country, some kind of science subject was taught in all schools, and science is not taught to any extent in our national schools today.  In a representative survey, it is estimated that only 40 per cent of our national schools teach rural science and only 40 per cent have domestic science on the curriculum. Agricultural science is vital if we are to compete in conditions of free trade and rural science should be taught to our children from an early age.</P>
    <P>Physical culture is, to my mind, vital at national and higher levels.  It is very  in urban areas where the children's facilities for exercising themselves are restricted.  But, in all areas, physical culture is something which should be developed.  It develops human beings physically and encourages the team spirit and, in general, it fits children for competition in life.  We assume perhaps that the question of physical science should be pursued at post-graduate level.  The basis should be the national school level.  I think this would be a very good thing.</P>
    <P>When speaking of the curriculum, complaints have always been levelled at the system which has allowed so much time to be devoted to the Irish language in our national schools.  I agree.  I think that possibly it might not be necessary, with improved methods, to devote so much time to the Irish language.  If we are to introduce additional subjects, we must make time for them or else extend our school week in terms of hours.  The Minister has <Col N="1916" /> told us of a new scientific method being introduced into all schools which he hopes will be very successful.  Rather than a scientific method, I should like to refer to what I think would be a natural method of teaching Irish.  A child comes to school at four years of age.  Every Deputy will agree that that child, under the method of teaching Irish we had in the past, had a better command of the English language at four years of age than he had of Irish at 14 years of age.  There is something wrong with a system that allows this to happen.  The purpose for which we must teach Irish, I feel, is to ensure that it is used in after school life as a means of communication and for practical purposes, not that the child should regard it as another subject.</P>
    <P>The child comes to school at four years of age.  He has a fairly good working knowledge of English.  How has he acquired that working knowledge of English?  It is not by being taught.  No mother sits down with a child for a portion of every day and repeats such phrases as &ldquo;I close the door; I closed the door; I will close the door; I would close the door&rdquo;.  If that sort of thing went on, children would be afraid to talk at all.  They do talk for practical purposes.  A child, first of all, listens to English being spoken before he can talk it and he uses sentences as his vocabulary increases, and as the need for an increased vocabulary arises and as his own knowledge of the language naturally improves.  He goes to school at four years old. Naturally he has developed, if he is from an English-speaking home, a working knowledge of English.  Therefore, he proceeds now with no great effort to read and to write the English language.  But the child from an English-speaking home comes to school at four without one word of Irish.  I do not think it is fair, and I think it hampered and held Irish back for years that the child should be asked to speak it, to read it and to write it, all overnight. That builds up an antagonism and makes it difficult for children.  The parents realise the difficulty for the children and a general antagonism has been built up.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1917" /> The natural method could be used in school.  Children could be taught to read sentences but always with a purpose. The use of Irish could be increased gradually as vocabulary and ability to understand the language increased.  In, perhaps, three or four years&mdash;I am not an expert and do not know exactly how long it would take &mdash;the child would readily understand and would readily speak Irish and would use it for practical purposes. Very shortly in those conditions I feel Irish would be used by children at school as a medium through which they told their stories to the teacher.  Children love to tell their stories to the teacher.  They associate that with pleasure and with the more enjoyable phases of their school life.  If Irish could be used in this, the happier part of school life, the chatting, the talking, the stories, I believe it would result in a love of the language.</P>
    <P>I firmly believe that once a child is able to speak and understand Irish, reading and writing would come easily in later years and only a fraction of the time being devoted to it at present would need to be devoted to it to develop proficiency.  At the moment they never seem to come to grips with it.  There are exceptions, of course.  A number of children do very well.  Very often the attitude of parents might result in this, but I think a greater love of the language could be inculcated into children and their parents if the emphasis were on speaking the language only in the first years of a child's life.</P>
    <P>With regard to the primary certificate, I notice that the Fine Gael Party feel that the primary certificate should be removed and replaced by a system of school records kept by teachers.  We in the Labour Party are also doubtful about the usefulness of the primary certificate as it is at present.  Very often there is poor supervision and anyway it has been proved that 11,000 children leave school each year without achieving that standard.  We believe, though, that perhaps school records alone, with no external test, might not be enough. We are all familiar with the situation in rural areas.  Parents and teachers <Col N="1918" /> know each other intimately and I feel that the teachers themselves would not like to have the records of a child's achievement which they have kept as the only criterion for the advancement of that child to a post-primary school. Perhaps they could be combined with an outside educational test, properly conducted and carried out, in order to ascertain the direction of the ability of a child at the age when he is moving on to post-primary schools.</P>
    <P>I promised not to talk about the Minister's document until I had completed the other things I wanted to say but I am disappointed to find no reference in it to career guidance.  I believe career guidance is of vital importance.  In view of the fact that comprehensive schools are few, and, according to the Minister, will remain few, most children will have to make a choice at the age when they leave the primary school as to what type of education they will follow in the future.  We in the Labour Party feel the emphasis should be on direction. In the past, parents who wanted to do their best for their children and who could afford it tended to equate doing their best for their children with sending them to secondary schools.  This, I hope and I believe, is not happening to such an extent now that we have an enhanced status for vocational schools.  They are no longer looked on as places where one whiles away six months or a year until a job turns up, now that the common intermediate certificate has been introduced and vocational schools are avenues to university and colleges of technology.</P>
    <P>I still feel that children need guidance as to the type of education on which they will embark.  Vocational education is for the activists in our society, the practical people who learn best, do best and make most progress by actually doing things.  Those people are just as important and as talented as their more literary brothers and sisters.  I think that parents should be guided as to where they should send their children when they leave primary school, as to where their interests would best be served, as to what form of education would, in the first instance, make their children happier <Col N="1919" /> and, in the second instance, result in their getting suitable jobs.  The latter is what the parents want for their children.</P>
    <P>It has been generally agreed that career guidance is necessary at post-primary level.  The NIEC Report has stressed that such guidance is very necessary even for those already in the labour force.  Indeed, all sections are agreed that career guidance is necessary and I believe such guidance should be extended to cover all schools. It is essential that it should be extended to children leaving the primary schools. Such guidance, coupled with the records made by the teachers, plus some sort of external test or examination, would be of tremendous value to parents in helping them to decide what to do for their children.  We are all agreed the parents should have the final word.  The choice should be theirs, but they should have advice.  They are entitled to that.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party have always pressed for the setting up of parent-manager-teacher associations.  Where these associations exist&mdash;it is only to a limited degree&mdash;they have done very good work in improving conditions in the schools and being constructively helpful.  A great number of organisations and associations spring up in time of crisis.  A healthier situation would be to have the organisations or associations established in peace time; if that were done, they would all the more readily rise to the occasion when crisis occurs.  Parents can do a great deal in pressing for improvements and it is they who would really know what the need might be for transport.  By and large, they can be very helpful if organised in an advisory capacity with the manager and teachers.</P>
    <P>The need for greater participation in post-primary education is recognised by everybody.  The startling comment is made by the NIEC in its Report on investment in education: &ldquo;If education greater in extent and more suitable in content had been offered two or three decades ago the problem of adapting to freer trade would now be very much <Col N="1920" /> easier.&rdquo;  That is from the economic point of view.  From the social point of view there has been a lack of facilities for education for far too long and, in our opinion, the present situation can no longer be tolerated.  We are glad, very glad, the Minister has decided to do something about it.</P>
    <P>There can be no doubt that financial considerations in the main prevent a great number of children from participating in education beyond 14, 15 and 16 years of age, or at whatever age it is they drop out of the post-primary system.  The number who drop out is very alarming: 4,000 in the secondary system drop out before reaching the intermediate certificate and 7,000 out of a total of 16,000 or 17,000 drop out of the vocational schools before reaching the group certificate. That gives cause for alarm. There are other influences at work, but the main considerations are financial and economic.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated in his opening statement: &ldquo;I propose that the supplementary grant be the equivalent of the fees charged to the pupils at present subject to a minimum of £15 and a maximum of £25&rdquo; as from the 1st September, 1967.  We welcome that, but we do not welcome it unreservedly.  I doubt that a figure of £25 is realistic. From my own personal experience of schools which are by no means socially exclusive, I know that the fees are far in excess of £25.  I sincerely hope this suggestion of the Minister will not result in some of these schools, which provide an excellent education, opting out of the Minister's scheme, since the grant would not go anywhere near meeting the cost of the education they are providing.  The Minister has endeavoured to avoid a means test and on that I congratulate him.  That is Labour Party policy.  I hope other Ministers of State will follow his example at the earliest possible moment. The ideal is the avoidance of a means test.  There are areas in which a means test cannot be avoided, but, where at all possible, such a test should be avoided.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lindsay, speaking on behalf <Col N="1921" /> of Fine Gael, said that this proposal would, in fact, create a social barrier between schools and his solution was that the higher fee school could opt into the scheme by making one-third of the places available to children of less well-off parents.  I do not think that is the solution; I do not think it is a realistic approach because I know that the fee element is only half the cost. Even if the doors of the more socially exclusive schools were opened to all children, the parents still could not meet the high cost of uniforms and of the extra curricular activities which take place, activities which are very desirable indeed.  I doubt if there are many in the lower income group who could avail of these schools, even if the doors were opened to them.</P>
    <P>There are faults in all systems.  So far as it is possible, it is very desirable to avoid a means test and social seclusion. Even if State aid were withdrawn altogether from schools which would not open their doors at all, even if that were done, we would still have a system of education at post-primary level which would of necessity result in some sort of social difference between the various schools.</P>
    <P>The Minister states that education will be available to all.  I am concerned that the Minister has not yet completed his survey of the educational facilities available in the different counties.  As far as I remember, the survey has been completed in only six counties.  There is, therefore, a large element of hope in all this.  The Minister hopes the schools will co-operate; he hopes the facilities will be there.  That is something I doubt very much.  Facilities are not there in the urban areas at the moment with regard to vocational education.  With regard to vocational education, or educational facilities generally they cannot even cope with those who already seek admission to their schools.  Therefore, I would say, all in all, there is a great element of hope about all this and all the details have not been worked out, as the Minister states has been done.</P>
    <P>The Minister talks about school books and transport.  Transport is very important in rural Ireland, where such <Col N="1922" /> a large proportion of our children live such a long distance from the schools. The Minister states, on page 28 of his speech, that almost a quarter, about 10,000 pupils, were more than five miles from the nearest post-primary school and about 4.5 per cent or 2,000 pupils were more than ten miles from the nearest post-primary school; and he proposes to make transport available free.  We congratulate him on that. He proposes to defray the full cost of transport to post-primary schools.</P>
    <P>There are a few questions I should like to ask the Minister in regard to this point.  No. 1, who will organise this transport?  I take it the Department will organise it.  It has been organised very successfully by parents in a few areas, and I can visualise the Minister's system for post-primary school transport operating very well in those areas where the transport is already organised.  But I hope, and wonder, if transport on a nationwide system will be organised by next September; if the needs of the areas will be investigated; if the facilities for education in the areas will have been investigated in time to operate what the Minister tells us will operate&mdash;a free transport system&mdash; next September.</P>
    <P>I can visualise the plight of a child living in a rural area, we will say, four miles from the source of post-primary education.  He qualifies for free transport but the nearest school to him has no vacancy for him.  I hope that, in operating free transport, the Minister really means that transport will be freely available to all children, that where no vacancy occurs for a child or where he has chosen one type of education rather than another, which involves a longer distance, the transport costs will be borne also in those cases.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to speak briefly, too, about the position that obtains in industrial schools.  Here again we have another section of our community&mdash;those boys and girls who are committed to industrial <Col N="1923" /> schools.  Those people who prepared <i>Investment in Education</i> did a tremendous service when they brought to our notice that 11 per cent only of the girls and 4½ per cent of the boys were in receipt of post-primary education of any kind in these industrial schools.  A tremendous drive must be made to ensure that better chances are given to those unfortunate boys and girls who are committed to industrial schools.</P>
    <P>To go back to the Minister's proposals, at the bottom of page 22 of his speech, the Minister refers to special assistance for children of parents in lower income groups.  He said:</P>
    <P>Under our present system of post-primary education, the obstacles in the way of the student from the lower income family may be set down as follows:</P>
    <P>(a)  the inability of his parents to pay the school fees demanded;</P>
    <P>The Minister has, up to a point, catered for this.  He continues:</P>
    <P>(b)  their inability to meet the cost of school books and requisites;</P>
    <P>He has also, up to a point, catered for this but he continues:</P>
    <P>(c)  the need for an additional breadwinner in the family;</P>
    <P>the Minister has stopped short, and here the Labour Party are most disappointed. We are conscious that this is a tremendous social need; the fact that so many families cannot afford&mdash; regardless of the provision of fees, transport costs and the cost of books &mdash;to forgo the wages which their children would bring in and, instead of letting them go on for further education, encourage them to obtain employment.</P>
    <P>At the bottom of page 25 of the Minister's speech, he states:</P>
    <P>In the lower income group there will also be a number of pupils whose particular family circumstances will be such that even with the provision of free tuition and free books the keeping of them at school will still be a hardship on their parents.</P>
    <P>&mdash;agreed.  But he continues:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1924" /> When my scheme is in operation and I have had an opportunity to assess the extent of this problem, I shall have to see what special provision for such cases should be made.</P>
    <P>Surely the Minister must agree here &mdash;as I think he does agree&mdash;that special provision for these cases should be made and there is no need to await the operation of the scheme to realise that there are people in the community, that there are children of widows whose children's allowances are withdrawn when the child reaches the age of 16, that there are children whose fathers are unemployed, or ill, or have very low wages&mdash;in the £8 and £9 wage bracket&mdash;who cannot afford to forgo the income which their family bring in and, therefore, cannot afford to leave them at school beyond the age of 14.  They have, quite possibly, other children growing up and the cost of maintaining these children increases each year.  As they grow and reach their teens, the financial burden becomes greater and it is quite reasonable to understand that there are people whose circumstances must be well known to the Minister and to everybody: those who will not be able to avail of any free scheme made available unless maintenance grants are also added.</P>
    <P>I am very sorry that the Minister who has done so much&mdash;and he has done a lot; he has abolished fees; he has catered for books, for transport, if this can be operated satisfactorily&mdash; has stopped short at these, the most needy sections of the community.  I would ask him, between now and next September, to take another look at this section, at this proposal to wait until the scheme is in operation to see what special provision can be made for such cases.  Special provisions are necessary and necessary now for these cases.  This is underlying Labour Party policy on post-primary education&mdash;this point about maintenance grants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann is of opinion that the Electricity Supply Board should not increase its charges to domestic consumers by seven per cent in view of the undue hardship which this price increase would create together with the inflationary situation which such an increase would initiate; and also considers that the ESB special charges should be abolished.</P>
      <P>It is terribly important when considering this motion to bear in mind what actually brought this about.  We are submitting through this motion that the seven per cent increase now in operation, and which was advocated by the Minister for Transport and Power on behalf of the ESB, should not be instituted because it will undoubtedly create undue hardship for domestic consumers.  One has only to think for a moment to realise who are the people who will suffer most by this imposition: domestic consumers undoubtedly to a great extent, and people who are commonly described as members of the workingclasses; old age pensioners, unemployed people or people who are working for small wages.  These are the people who, in the main, will be hit by this increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is rather significant that the Minister saw fit to do this, despite existing legislation.  The Minister who is responsible for this action has a penchant for talking down to the workingclass people.  Very often he appears in the public press telling the workers how to behave, and telling them what to do.  We find this Minister talking about an ordered way of going about things, and reasonable behaviour, and we find the self-same Minister flouting the existing Prices Act.  I submit that if the Minister sees fit on numerous occasions to talk to the workingclass people <Col N="1926" /> about the manner in which they should behave and set about negotiating increases to meet their commitments, the same Minister should be conscious of existing legislation.</P>
    <P>In this connection the Minister has seen fit to disregard completely the Prices Act.  It is pertinent to ask the Minister why.  Why did he not give notice of intention to the Department of Industry and Commerce so that they could consider an application for an increase?  That is the general idea.  That is what private employers are required to do.  Surely that is something which a State-sponsored concern must do in order to set a good example?  That did not happen in this instance, and no real explanation has been given.  When one takes into consideration the attitude repeatedly adopted by this Minister, one would imagine that he is not <i>au fait</i> with what is going on, and that he is undoubtedly in the clouds.</P>
    <P>It is a fact that the recent increase of £1 which was given to workingclass people did not represent seven per cent in a great many cases.  It is also a fact that this increase in ESB charges is coming into operation at a time of the year when it will hit the domestic consumers more than ever. I am not terribly concerned about the effect of this seven per cent increase on manufacturers and people who run industries.  If there is anyone who can afford to bear this increase of seven per cent, it is undoubtedly the people who have, and not the people who have not.  We all know, and commonsense tells us, that this is the time of the year when domestic consumers use more electricity.  Manufacturers need not use more electricity at this time. As a matter of fact, it has happened repeatedly that there has been stalling in the matter of supplying heating, and what have you, in factories, from electric power during the winter period.  This could happen in regard to the seven per cent increase.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Transport and Power has repeatedly talked about how matters affecting labour relations should be dealt with outside his Department.  I suggest that this imposition of a seven per cent increase will <Col N="1927" /> undoubtedly create hardship.  Not only that, but it is also an inflationary action.  Commonsense tells us that in our whole scheme of things the working man who is a member of a trade union is obliged to conform with certain procedures in order to obtain an increase in his wage packet.  It is a well-known fact that long drawn out discussions have taken place to bring about increases&mdash;even in the case of the £1 increase.  Arguments have to be made, cases have to be substantiated, in order to extract an increase from the employers for the working class.  In this case the Minister has jumped the gun.  He has decided to have this increase implemented without having recourse to the Department of Industry and Commerce, without having to make his case, and without having to justify why there should be an increase.</P>
    <P>I submit that if we are to have this dream order about which this Minister pontificates very often, the obvious thing for him to do is to set a good example.  In this connection that was not done, and the situation we now find is that the Department of Industry and Commerce have been charged with the responsibility of looking into the matter and of making decisions in connection with it.  We have been told that if it transpires the increase is not justifiable it will be taken off.  However, nothing has been said about retrospective relief for people who have been paying the increase.  It does not require great exercise of the imagination to realise that that type of action creates a situation in which the applicant, who will be either the Minister or the ESB, will be making a request from some other Department in the hope that a favourable decision will be given for the confirmation of this seven per cent increase.  That is an absolute disgrace.  It is a clear indication of irresponsibility and is not in accord with what was said about maintaining order in negotiations.</P>
    <P>Why has this been done?  The only reason for it is to get increased revenue and to disregard the requirements of <Col N="1928" /> the public.  I see little point in introducing legislation in the House if any Department can come along and disregard the provisions of the legislation. Above all, we should expect a Minister to take every precaution by way of procedure when application is made for increased charges.  Workers are very often told to work harder, to increase productivity, to be careful about their demands for higher wages.  Surely it is reasonable and fair that the ESB would be required to be careful, to behave in a more orderly fashion and not to take lightning action of this kind which, from the opposite point of view, is equivalent to a lightning strike.  This is a blow being struck against the consumer, a blow being struck by the Minister for Transport and Power who had many opportunities to do this in another way.  Clearly the Minister is far removed from what is happening: he simply takes these things as they come along without giving any serious thought to the repercussions on the public.</P>
    <P>Is it to be taken for granted that working class people, who will be most affected by this increase, will sit idly by and say: &ldquo;We will not look for any further increases in our wage packets&rdquo;?  That is asking too much of the working class people.  I shall take the situation in Dublin.  The last £1 a week increase did not compensate workers for future price increases.  It did not even compensate them for previous increases but the £1 a week settlement could have been regarded as a serious attempt on the part of organised workers to face up to the economic situation.  What happened? Out of the £1 a week those workers who are corporation tenants are required to pay one-sixth in increased rents.  In addition, the same set of people, and the tenant purchasers, will all be required to pay this seven per cent increase in their electricity bills.</P>
    <P>I have repeatedly asked the Minister to be a little more mindful of the effects of ESB charges on our less fortunate people.  Repeatedly we on these benches have urged the Minister to do something about meter rents, particularly <Col N="1929" /> in respect of old people.  Up to the present nothing has been done and the old age pensioners are being required to pay the seven per cent increase in their ESB bills.  It may be said they do not use very much electricity.  It must be said also that the only way they can save is to put out their lights and those who use electric fires to provide simple comfort will have to give up their use.</P>
    <P>This is a very bad situation, the worst feature about it being that old age pensioners, unemployed people, organised and unorganised workers, have absolutely no say in the matter of this seven per cent increase.  Foolishly enough, we thought when the prices legislation was being put through the House a couple of years ago by the same Government that we were putting teeth into the measure when we requested the Minister to take steps to ensure that notice of intention to increase prices and charges would be given by those responsible.  It was never in our minds at that time that there would be exemptions and that this would apply to a State-sponsored concern above all others.  With the Minister's approval, the ESB would destroy that arrangement.</P>
    <P>We have also suggested in the motion that the special service charges should be abolished.  After consultation in the Labour Party and the trade union movement throughout the 26 Counties, we have ascertained that very often it is the poor people who are required to pay these special charges. Asking these people to pay £1 as a special charge is like asking others to pay thousands of pounds.  They have not got it.  This is an imposition the Minister is allowing the ESB to enforce on the community.  It is an imposition which, in particular, affects the poorer sections of the community very seriously.</P>
    <P>At the same time, it must be said that we all take pride in the fact that we have the ESB and that there will be more and more utilisation of electric power throughout the country&mdash;that it will be brought into more and more homes.  However, while the type of <Col N="1930" /> practice illustrated by the special service charges is allowed to continue, we know the type of homes power will be brought to.  We know such services must be paid for but we suggest that the manner in which the special charge is imposed is not the way to pay for rural electrification.  In the first place, it means the ESB obviously will not get enough consumers.  The way to do it is to subsidise the service.  I know it is being done but the subsidy should be increased.  If, however, there is to be a greater contribution from consumers of electricity we should remember that industrialists get huge grants from the State and they should be the people to make the sacrifice.</P>
    <P>We are satisfied that the system employed by the ESB to finance rural electrification is a crazy way of doing business.  We who have had the opportunity of being fairly close to the operation of the ESB realise well what brought this system about.  There is an absence of thought, an absence of liaison between the ESB and their staff, between the ESB and the Minister and between the Minister and the staff employed by the ESB.  We know full well that this particular motion will, of necessity, be opposed by the Minister and his colleagues.  We put down this motion, not to gain any political capital, but to make it clear and distinct that it is extremely unfair.  The manner in which the increase was brought about is absolutely wrong and it gives the lie to all the contentions which are made by particular Ministers, and in particular this Minister, of going in an ordered way about negotiations.</P>
    <P>This is the sort of thing that sparks off a wrong action.  I hold this is an unofficial action equivalent to an unofficial strike, a strike at the consumers. The Minister should reflect on it and be man enough to admit that this general decision of his, without giving serious consideration to the facts, will be changed.  Let us hope that between this and the time when the Department of Industry and Commerce make up their minds about the application of the ESB, that the seven per cent which they have put on at the moment will <Col N="1931" /> be taken off and we will be told they have changed their minds.</P>
    <P>We are quite satisfied that the only way in which this matter can be put right is to take off the seven per cent and then make the application for an increase but let whoever makes the application for the increase make his case clearly and distinctly, prove the case to the Department of Industry and Commerce just the same as the ESB workers have got to prove their case. Other workers have got to prove their case as well.  The ESB workers had to go through many tedious operations to prove their case.  Surely the people who have control and power over those workers should in turn make their case and justify why such an increase is necessary.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I want to say&mdash;I know I am repeating myself but I cannot over-emphasise this&mdash;this act must have a tremendous effect on people throughout the country.  The fact is that the Minister who now and then takes it upon himself to tell workingclass people what they should do is the first one to jump the gun and not do what he should, conform with a regulation which is in existence.</P>

      <P>I have no doubt that when the ESB come before the tribunal in relation to this increase of seven per cent, they will be able, in the absence of firm contrary proposals, to prove their case.  They will have figures to support it, based on certain costings over certain periods.  I often think, in the matter of costings of this kind based on a certain period, the mistake is initially made in having the period under contemplation too short.  In other words, too much is attempted in too short a time and we are judging those few people over a narrow range of years.  Too much is asked for something which others will enjoy afterwards virtually free of charge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I sympathise very much with the view expressed by Deputy Mullen about the Minister's action <i>vis-à-vis</i> the <Col N="1932" /> Prices Act.  I fail to see why the Electricity Supply Board, with all the research resources available to them, with all their staff, with all their accountants and everybody associated with costing and all the other people associated with a body of that kind, could not be ready to go with their application to a tribunal straight away. Neither do I see, on the other hand, why the Department of Industry and Commerce, geared as it is, or should be geared&mdash;I am sure it is&mdash;to have such a tribunal set up forthwith, could not have the tribunal available and the ESB put their case before it.  It is a bad precedent for a Minister, in view of the legislation which is before him, to give permission to any board, body, group, firm or individual to increase a price prior to the hearing envisaged by legislation to establish the need for such an increase.</P>
    <P>That is all I want to say on that aspect of this motion.  There is much merit in the argument put forward that others have to make their case and here we have this anomaly which amounts in my view to a very bad and very dangerous precedent of saying: &ldquo;We will give you a decree first and we will hear the evidence afterwards&rdquo;. That is what it amounts to.  &ldquo;Then later on, when we have heard the evidence, we will see if the decree should be reduced or wiped out altogether.&rdquo; It is contrary to all recognised procedure by people who act in accordance with rules and regulations.</P>
    <P>Many things have been said about the special service charge and much more, I suppose, will be said in this House and outside it in relation to it.  I agree with Deputy Mullen that the special service charge falls most heavily on the people least able to bear it.  That is particularly true of rural Ireland.  I speak of the west of Ireland and indeed in very recent times I can speak of a certain part of the south of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Last evening, while speaking on the Estimate for the Gaeltacht, I recommended to the Department of the Gaeltacht that they should take up <Col N="1933" /> this question of the special service charge in Gaeltacht areas with the ESB.  Here we have a situation in which our people might almost be described, certainly in the Dingle Peninsula, as &ldquo;muintear an chladaigh&rdquo;.  Our people have survived in those areas for centuries.  They have been living on the produce reaped from the sea, the mountainside or the rivers.  They have been living in difficult and very often dangerous conditions all that time. Then our State was established and we set up various industries.  We harnessed our rivers for the purpose of generating electricity.  Who gets this service? In most cases people who have always lived within easy reach of every amenity.</P>
    <P>I know it can be argued that it costs a lot of money to erect a large number of poles over long distances, but the Minister for Transport and Power, in another capacity, does not lack experience in relation to erecting a large number of poles over long distances to provide telephones for people, without a special service charge.  When a humble citizen on the mountainside beside the coast is involved who wants to have the ESB installation, what do we find?  First of all he has to pay a capital sum and after that a special service charge is added to the two-part tariff in addition to what he has to pay for the electricity he uses.  I do not think that is very edifying, although edifying is hardly the right word to use in regard to people who are looking for something.</P>
    <P>However, I was appalled last week when I went into a certain part of the Dingle Peninsula, in the heart of the Gaeltacht, and visited a house in which Irish is spoken by the children and by the adults.  No word of English is spoken there.  I was appalled when in this very modern, well-kept, clean house I saw a man get down the old lamp.  I asked him &ldquo;Why are you using the lamp?  Did you not get in the ESB current?&rdquo; He replied: &ldquo;No, I could not because the charge is prohibitive.&rdquo; He told me what it was and it certainly was prohibitive.  Here is a home in which the children are getting the £10 deontas for speaking Irish. <Col N="1934" /> Due, of course, to the vigilance and care of the parents, they are speaking it.  These are people who did not close their door, leave the country, or go to Dublin or elsewhere, but stayed on the hillside and made their little contribution to the nation's economy, but for so doing they cannot avail themselves, by reason of their limited resources, of the one great amenity that the nation can provide.</P>
    <P>The ESB are short-sighted in this respect and the Minister is short-sighted in not altering his policy in that regard and having talks with the ESB about it.  There must be some way, in relation to costings, of being able to get the money without hurting anybody too much, and getting rid of the special service charge.  I forget what it would cost to abolish the charge but I think it is somewhere in the region of £250,000 or £300,000.  It used be anyway, in replies regularly given to the House.  I also noticed in a reply given to me recently that the ESB spent something like £150,000 in one year on advertising, yet they have a virtual monopoly.  I suppose they have a host of sales managers, advertising managers and the devil knows what. Some of this money could be saved and diverted towards rural electrification to reduce or abolish the special service charge.  This is spoiling the ship for a ha'porth of tar.  It is time we got rid of this complex which not only operates in the ESB but also in other aspects of our life.  On the basis that the ESB were allowed to increase their charges by seven per cent before they went to a hearing, and secondly on the grounds that this special service charge should be abolished and this amenity provided for the people who richly deserve it, I fully support this motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>We in the Labour Party feel that this seven per cent increase in ESB charges cannot be justified by the Minister who is responsible for the operations of the Board. The burden of paying this seven per cent will fall most heavily on the shoulders of those who can least afford it.  We find it difficult to understand the thinking of Fianna Fáil when we <Col N="1935" /> look back over the last few weeks after the election of the Taoiseach.  In one of the few statements he made the Taoiseach again lectured the workers and said that they could not seek any improvement in their standard of living at this time, by way of seeking increased wages or better conditions, without doing considerable harm to the economy! On the other hand, we have a Minister practically inciting workers to make demands in order to try to retain&mdash;not to advance but to retain&mdash; their standard of living and try to keep abreast of such additional calls on their meagre purses as this seven per cent.</P>
      <P>It is the more difficult to understand when we find that this seven per cent increase is imposed at a time when the ESB are in a position to give the Government a loan in excess of £2 million.  When one considers all these facts, one can only come to the conclusion that this is another form of taxation on the people who can least afford it.  After the unprecedented muddle and financial difficulties caused by the Government's policy, and after their frantic search for money and finding that it was not as readily available as they had hoped on any of the normal markets in New York, Geneva or London, they came along and arranged with the ESB to avail of a surplus in excess of £2 million.  One wonders was it part of the deal that: &ldquo;If we can use your £2 million, you can increase your charges by seven per cent and this silly little routine through which private individuals and concerns have to go in regard to price control will be overlooked in your case.  We get the £2 million; you get your seven per cent increase,&rdquo; and the ordinary workingclass people can once again pay the piper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister and the Government wanted to be honest, they would have introduced a third Budget this year in order to meet the many commitments for which they found it necessary to borrow the £2 million from the ESB. We do not feel that there is any justification for imposing this increase just to make it handier for the Government to borrow money from this source which is to be spent, not on doing anything <Col N="1936" /> constructive for the people but in trying to pay off some of the debts and undo the mistakes they have been responsible for.  It is not only a question of the direct seven per cent being imposed on the people.  If we are to believe the Taoiseach and if he wants the ordinary working people to take him seriously, when he was lecturing those with less than £1,200 per year who secured an increase of £1 in the last wage increase, as to the dire effects that paltry sum would have on the economy as a whole, I wonder why he did not open his mouth when the ESB imposed the seven per cent.  Surely if an increase for workers will upset the balance of payments and make us less competitive in the export market, this seven per cent will have the same effect. Undoubtedly this seven per cent will add to the cost of producing anything we produce and export.  Is it, again, the Fianna Fáil policy that if something must be paid back there is only one section of the community to go to and that is the section that can least afford to pay?</P>
    <P>After the ESB had been able to lend the Government over £2 million, letters were sent out to people who had applied to have electricity installed in their homes and the content of some of these letters was disclosed in the House by my colleague, Deputy Dunne.  It was revealed that an ordinary workman who sought to have electricity installed was asked for no less than £150 before the ESB would install the supply.  This letter came from a State-sponsored company that had a surplus of over £2 million to lend to the Government.  In the year 1966 we had a man who wanted to have this great boon to mankind, this marvellous new discovery so far as the Minister is concerned, installed in his house and he is asked to put down £150 on a flimsy, vague statement that it might be returnable when the financial situation improved.</P>
    <P>So much was said during recent weeks by Labour Party members in the Dáil that we believe the practice has now been dropped by the ESB. We also believe that there is as little justification for the seven per cent increase which will impose tremendous <Col N="1937" /> hardship on some people such as those trying to survive on old age pensions, on widows' or blind pensions.  To these people seven per cent on the ESB bill can mean the difference between having light and having no light, having some warmth or having none.  I do not think an appeal of that nature would be very effective to a Minister who, only three or four weeks ago, opposed another motion in respect of free transportation for people in the same category.</P>
    <P>We in the Labour Party intend by every means at our disposal to oppose this increase of seven per cent in ESB charges.</P>

      <P>Do not take me as being critical of a man who goes to Paris and takes in a night club because it is, perhaps, a natural thing to do. I learn with astonishment that he is not here.  What is he doing in France? Is he taking example from an older colleague to whose activities I referred at some length recently?  Is he, in fact, offering advice to <i>le grand Charles?</i> We go about the world offering advice. That seems to be our destiny or fate under this Government and we are more concerned with that than with matters more immediate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For instance, Deputy Lindsay spoke about the Dingle Peninsula and the fact that the ESB service there is so dear as to be beyond the financial capacity of a small farmer in the area. I was in the district of Cloghran six miles from O'Connell Street, last Saturday <Col N="1938" /> in a house tenanted by Mr. McLoughlin, just on the fringe of the airport.  He was using an oil lamp.  We do not have to go to these hitherto unexplored districts such as the Dingle Peninsula or Waterford to find examples of the neglect of the ESB and of their imposition upon the people in increasing their charges by seven per cent.</P>
    <P>I believe this is now an established fact: the increase has been enforced, but there is a group set up to investigate it.  Imagine investigating after the act has been done to see whether or not it was justifiable.  To me this kind of approach represents the confused thinking that has been so typical of the Minister to whom I am referring.</P>
    <P>Let me add that when I say the areas of South Kerry and Waterford have been hitherto unexplored, I am speaking purely in the political adventurist sense.  I have no doubt that the Party cartographers will have every highway and byway, boreen, laneway, field, haggard, hillside and mountainside trodden flat before next Wednesday, and anybody who is in need of ESB service will be put under the impression that it is just around the corner in the skilled fashion in which these people operate.  They have the knack of promising, while at the same time not promising at all.  It was bequeathed to them by those who went before them in this House, gentlemen who were pastmasters at this skill of appearing to say something which, in fact, they were not saying at all.</P>
    <P>This motion of ours is a very important one and I am disturbed to see how few sit in the Government benches to take an interest in the welfare of the consumers of ESB current throughout the country.  I note that the Parliamentary Secretary who has just arrived is scanning the Order Paper to see just what we are talking about.  It is about the seven per cent increase which has been imposed upon the people by the ESB with the consent of the Minister for Transport and Power without responsibility, to which may now be added Posts and Telegraphs.</P>
    <P>It is to be assumed that this Administration, whose forebears boasted <Col N="1939" /> about their upholding of the great principle of collective Cabinet responsibility do, in fact, share culpability&mdash; for that is what it is&mdash;for this increase with the Minister for Transport and Power and the ESB.  This is no mere administrative detail to be brushed aside by the Government or the Minister who is now in France, no doubt advising de Gaulle on something or other.  This represents a real increase in the cost of living of the ordinary people.</P>
    <P>This makes us think of the vainglorious projections, which was the name given to the wild guesses of those responsible for that two-and-sixpenny dreadful known as the Second Programme for Economic Expansion, these guesses as to the gross national product and other matters of that genre.  It will be recalled that it was said then by the economists, who apparently govern our lives and our future, that any wage increase in excess of three per cent would bring about disaster and ruin for the nation. There was no suggestion on the part of the Government that this very substantial increase of seven per cent imposed upon the ESB current consumers would adversely affect our national condition at all, but it does, and in a very definite and dangerous way.</P>
    <P>Increased costs of any kind which bring about an increase in the cost of living for the ordinary worker inevitably provoke demands for wage increases because the worker has no way of keeping the sheriff's hands off his goods other than moving, through his trade union, for wage increases.  We are all familiar with the economic fact that if there is too much money chasing too few goods&mdash;to use an economic cliché&mdash;there is inflation, and this can be catastrophic for the country as a whole.  We, therefore, say that the action of the ESB in increasing their costs and in increasing their charges unnecessarily was an act calculated to cause inflation and to make life harder for working people and the people who live on small farms throughout the country who have to <Col N="1940" /> avail of rural electrification, and goodness knows life has been hard enough for them.</P>
    <P>I referred to the situation in Cloghran, County Dublin.  Is it not incredible that the ESB which, it has been remarked, has an absolute monopoly in the provision of electrical power and light is unable, apparently, to provide light or power for this cottage which is situate six miles from the centre of Dublin, and that we have at this time, after 40 years of the ESB's existence such an example of people having to travel into Swords and carry home paraffin oil in order to use an oil lamp for lighting?  In this case the ESB has not given any real reason why power will not be supplied here.  It has been a case of simple and utter neglect.  These are the people who come along with all the effrontery in the world and, without as much as &ldquo;by your leave&rdquo; of this nation, increase their charges to domestic consumers.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance is here and I should be glad if he would clarify one point.  We have had over the last several weeks questions on the Order Paper directed to the Minister for Transport and Power without responsibility, who is now in France, in which we asked what is the meaning of the ESB's replying to applicants for power or current, as they have done in hundreds of cases, to the effect that current would be supplied on one condition only, that the applicant would put up the capital contribution; in other words, that they would lend to the ESB for an unspecified period the money to pay for the labour, the poles, the cable and all the equipment necessary to make a connection in such cases.  What was the sense or the meaning in that?  Has this ridiculous proposition been in fact withdrawn?  I understand that, after much effort on my part and on the part of many other Deputies to prevail upon the Minister for Transport and Power without responsibility, in fact this policy of the ESB has now been cancelled and that they are prepared at present to make such installations without asking the applicants to provide <Col N="1941" /> the capital contribution.  How utterly out of touch the ESB showed themselves to make such a suggestion at all.</P>
    <P>I know of one instance concerning a small farmer in Rush which I mentioned before.  I am sure the Minister for Finance, the former Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, will agree with me that the best farmers in Ireland come from there.  This small farmer in Rush was asked to lend almost £300 to the ESB to enable them to instal current for use in his glass-houses. This man is a primary producer who should be helped.  He is the type of man who is made the subject of many adulatory speeches in this House.  No doubt this type of man will be lauded to the skies within the coming few days until he will be submerged in a final crescendo of praise and adulation by Wednesday next.  Such a man was asked to put up almost £300 in order to get current from the ESB.  Of course, the idea was ridiculous.  If the ESB could not get money from the banks, how could the ordinary citizen get it? There was also another case in Baldonnel to which I referred previously, where a similar proposition was put up to a citizen.  Those are only two out of many such instances, which I am sure Deputies know of in their own constituencies.</P>
    <P>Has this policy definitely been reversed?  I would like an assurance from the Minister for Finance on that point, if he is intervening, as I hope he will, in this debate.  It will be too bad if somebody from the Government Benches does not say something. It will not look too good in the news-sheets in the next day or two if some contribution is not made from the Government Benches.  At least before Sunday, I hope somebody will say something and that it will not meet with the silence apparent up to now.</P>
    <P>Electricity as a commodity, if it can be so described, is one of the essentials of living today.  The average housewife is anxious to be as good as her neighbour and, if for no other reason, she is anxious to have all the labour-saving appliances on the market.  She is entitled to such facilities in the age in which we live, but <Col N="1942" /> increases in the charges of the ESB are making it impossible for people to avail of these facilities as they should or, even where such facilities are installed, they make it more difficult for people to continue to meet the charges.  Is it not an odd thing that this monopoly, which is an absolute one, cannot provide a service comparable in costs with that provided by the Dublin gas company?  Is it not odd to think that you can run a household more cheaply on gas&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The fact remains that, according to Deputy Dunne, private enterprise can give better service than a nationalised industry&mdash;and this, in spite of the constant protestations by the Party that all means of production should be vested in the State.  It is, of course, an illusion, and it is time the Labour party faced up to it, that the nationalisation of an industry, in itself, makes for efficiency.  This is not inevitable. At the same time, I have every respect for the service which the ESB have given in the past, are giving at the moment and propose to give in the future.</P>

      <P>Before reporting progress, I was commenting on what I thought was the one big omission in the scheme outlined by the Minister, namely, the fact that his proposals do not cater at all for the neediest sections of our community.  It has been a feature of State grants and State aid all through the years that, at the bottom of the income scale, there have always been people and families who, because of lack of financial means, cannot avail of such aids and grants as are offered. It is a pity that this should also apply <Col N="1952" /> in the field of education and that education should still be denied to the needier sections of our community and the greatest of all inequalities, inequality of opportunity, should still persist so far as these people are concerned. The Minister readily admits that this injustice exists and I appeal to him now to cater for our most needy brethren in what is an otherwise reasonably good scheme.</P>
      <P>The Minister proposes to provide free post-primary education for all but the fact is he will not be making post-primary education freely available to all, and that is very desirable at the present time.  The ideal would be, of course, that no family would be forced to take advantage of this State aid by way of maintenance grants.  Family incomes should be of a sufficiently high level to enable people to avail of education but the cold hard fact is that the position outlined by the Minister will not be the position as from 1st September, 1967, and that is one big defect in the Minister's scheme, one defect I hope he will see his way to rectifying before next September.</P>
      <P>The Minister announced today that books will be provided free to those who need them and he estimated that 25 per cent of the pupils will need free books.  The cost of providing free books for 25 per cent of the children is estimated at £100,000.  From that it is easy to calculate that the total cost of providing free books for all would be £400,000 and, for the sake of £300,000, I do not think it is worth introducing this means test in this particular instance.  Because of our limited resources, there are cases in which there must be a means test, but I do not think such a test is called for where school books are concerned.  For the sake of £300,000, I do not think it is worth introducing a means test and, if it is introduced, it will impose a certain amount of hardship on children in the same school, three-quarters of whom will pay for the books and one-quarter of whom will have the books doled out to them by the headmaster, or whoever is in charge, who will, in fact, decide whether or not they are needy.  That is something best avoided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1953" /> The main weakness in the scheme outlined by the Minister is the fact that he does not yet know what schools will opt for the scheme and what schools will not.  He told us he estimates the general run of schools will accept the scheme and make post-primary education available without fees.  But he has no proof of this and, having announced the scheme, the onus is on him to prove that it will, in fact, work.  Has he consulted the schools? Perhaps he has.  He has not told us that he has consulted them.  I should like him to tell us if he has consulted the schools and if he is satisfied that the number of schools he estimates will opt for the scheme will, in fact, do so.</P>
    <P>He referred in his speech to the desirability of providing comprehensive facilities in as many centres as possible and he told us that his predecessor circularised vocational and secondary schools and the response was very good.  I should like more detailed information with regard to the response the Minister got from post-primary schools generally, both secondary and vocational, because, as far as I am aware, there is a good deal of confusion with regard to the common utilisation of facilities between vocational schools, largely financed from public funds, and private schools, as to who would pay the cost of various items, who should be the ultimate authority, and so on.  Many questions have been raised.  Perhaps the Minister would tell us if these have been satisfactorily resolved. I hope they have.</P>
    <P>We have talked about the desirability of avoiding and eliminating the compartmentalisation that has existed between the various divisions in our educational system.  We have talked, too, about the desirability of utilising our teaching force, primary, secondary and vocational, to the fullest extent and to facilitate free transfer between the various levels and types of education. It is very desirable to utilise our teaching force to the full.  Therefore I would appeal, along with those who have already appealed &mdash; Deputy Lindsay today and others in the past when the opportunity presented itself &mdash;to the Minister to remove the impediments which exist to teachers transferring easily, in the first instance, <Col N="1954" /> from other countries to this country&mdash; in the case of those wishing to return home to engage in the teaching service here&mdash;and, in the second instance, to transferring between various departments in our own country.  We have a tremendous shortage&mdash;this has been acknowledged&mdash;of, principally, science and mathematics teachers.  I am quite sure there are a number of teachers, with qualifications for teaching these subjects, teaching outside this country today.  We should make it very easy for these people to return to their own country and give service to their own children, without lack of increment.</P>
    <P>National teachers, holding a Higher Diploma in Education may wish to transfer to either secondary or vocational schools.  I think they should be facilitated in doing so, if they feel their particular calling is in that line.  At present, they are not so facilitated.  A national teacher who wishes to take up secondary teaching has to forego income; a national teacher wishing to take up vocational teaching has, though he has already been trained, to undergo another training and a further test.  If such impediments could be removed, or at least some recompense made to teachers&mdash;if they must undergo these courses before transfer&mdash;this should be done.</P>
    <P>Everything possible should be done to facilitate them in easy transfer from one form of teaching to the other and so ensure there will be no scarcity of teachers in any sphere.  In the vocational sphere, there is a shortage, and we know that CEOs have put forward, for their inability to expand the force, the reason that the teachers cannot be got.  We should facilitate in every way those who want to transfer to vocational teaching.</P>
    <P>There is, of course, the whole question of adult education, and the Minister has not referred to that at all today.  We know, and the NIEC report again tells us, that, in spite of any improvements there might be in education from now on, it will take, possibly, 13 years before the full benefits of that improved system is felt in our labour force.  The average age in the labour force they gave us, at that <Col N="1955" /> time, was 42 years.  These are the people who were the products of the educational system provided 30 years ago.  Therefore, if we are to increase our competitiveness with other countries, if we are to prepare ourselves for free trade, it will not be enough&mdash;now that we are 30 years too late&mdash;to concentrate alone on our school children. We must concentrate on adult education and on the whole question of retraining. Here again, career guidance is very vital, to ensure that the adult who felt he might become redundant in his post in the near future, or who felt he might wish to avail of better opportunities now than he was enabled to do so during his school years, would have, first of all, guidance and, in the second instance, the facilities for so doing.  This is economically sound and is also social justice.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would say to the Minister that while there are faults and omissions in the system, all in all, it is a very positive step in the right direction. We wish him every luck and we hope that his highest hopes for his scheme will be realised in September, 1967.</P>

      <P>As one who, with the Minister for Education, had the distinction of attending the same university college as Deputy Lindsay, I do not intend to leave this debate to the more successful students! I feel tonight this is certainly a matter upon which the Minister is to be congratulated&mdash;this first definite breakthrough in the question of free post-primary education for everybody in this State.  He has been criticised because the details have not been fully worked out, but, to my mind, that is not a wise criticism, nor do I think it is a criticism any Minister should have to answer coming in here on a question such as this.  Had he waited until all the details were worked out, we would be waiting a further 30, 40 or, perhaps, 50 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In an urgent matter like this, you have to create a situation where demand is established.  By announcing this policy and providing the educational facilities next September, the <Col N="1956" /> demand is thereby created for teachers, for schools and transport, and those people who may have an economic or an academic interest in these problems to get down to it and see that they are provided.  In other words, teachers will realise that it is worth their while qualifying as teachers and staying in this country.  Those interested will build the schools; those who are interested in transport will provide the transport; and I feel this approach to it is as correct as any other.</P>
    <P>Those years were exciting, important and stimulating years in the history of the Department of Education. Last year we were dealing with the question of the reorganisation of the personnel of the national schools, so that the Department could make better use of the teachers available to it; so that the pupil ratio would be improved and the facilities in the schools would be much more acceptable to the pupils.  In certain areas, this meant the closing down of one- and two-teacher schools. This was not very acceptable to the few in some particular areas, but, as time went on, it became more acceptable and there are still, no doubt, some pockets of resentment throughout the country.  Judging by the amount of talk about the problem this year, it does not seem to be a big problem now, and I would urge the Minister and his Department to continue dealing with the problem in the considerate, understanding and diplomatic way they have dealt with it in the past.  I feel that, after another year or two, this will be a policy accepted without any resistance whatsoever by anybody throughout the State.</P>
    <P>This year, the centre of controversy is the question of the Irish language. It has been brought into the open very much by the announcement by the Fine Gael Party of some change in their policy and also by an organisation outside the House.  It is such now that I feel there must be very few people in the country who have not at least made up their minds as to which side they belong.  However, in the House itself, it is true to say that all Parties still accept that the policy for <Col N="1957" /> this State must be the Irish language. Fianna Fáil and the Labour Party have not changed anything on it; the Fine Gael people have changed somewhat, but they maintain that the Irish language should still be available to the Irish people.  There is but one fear I have in this change, which is, that the people in Fine Gael, who have brought about this change&mdash;if at any time in the future the Fine Gael Party were successful&mdash;would go a step or two further and have the Irish language ruled out as a compulsory subject within the national schools.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">

    <Speaker pid="HughGibbons" hpid="Dr. Gibbons Dr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Those people are advocating that this matter should be referred to the people in a referendum.  To date, I do not think that was necessary.  At all elections all Parties have placed their policy on Irish before the people and the people accepted it without question.  Perhaps in the next general election it may be different but that is the position to date.</P>
      <P>On the question of the referendum itself, the people must be careful as to what subject is placed before them in a referendum.  For example, I do not think anyone would seriously propose putting the question of income tax before the people and having them decide whether they would pay income tax.  The most important question of all for any nation, and particularly a democratic nation, is the question of war and so far as I am aware, that has never been decided by referendum. There should be no need to remind the House that on the most important referendum, the most historic referendum decided on, the result was not just that the people voted for Barrabas.  So I feel that a question such as this could never be decided by putting it to a referendum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It behoves people of my age, people who started in the national school immediately after the Treaty and continued in the national school through the 20s, were fortunate enough to go to a secondary school in the 30s and later to the university, to have some definite views on the question of the Irish language and the policy that was pursued.  The object of the State was <Col N="1958" /> to make Irish the spoken language in this country but when the State got down to doing the job, they lost sight of that object and sought to create a literary language, with perfection in reading and writing, and in that way they forgot about the speaking of the language.</P>
    <P>That is the big mistake that was made.  The standard sought on the written side was too high at that time and those of us who were requested to speak it were expected to speak it with the accuracy in grammar, correctness in pronunciation and facility of expression which our age-group could not equal.  More often than not, we found ourselves making mistakes. Occasionally we were punished for them and gradually we lost interest in the language.  I feel it would be more in the interest of the language to get away from that altogether.  That is the situation as it presented itself when I was being educated and I think that was the greatest error made.</P>
    <P>It is a bit tragic that even following all the discussions on this subject over the past 12 months, three or four teachers told me in the past couple of weeks that when an inspector goes to a national school, he still emphasises and concentrates on grammar in the second and third classes.</P>
    <P>In a situation such as this no one should criticise without offering a remedy.  The remedy I have to offer is that which was put before the House by Deputy Mrs. Desmond: the question of the use of the language.  When a child goes to school, all the informal instructions should be given in the Irish language and children should be encouraged to speak it during the play hours and in the playyard.  I would go so far as to say that when an inspector visits a school to decide on the standard of Irish reached by the children, his decision should be made on the amount of Irish he heard in the playyard rather than on the amount in the class.  Until we reach that day, I think we will be gradually sliding downhill.</P>
    <P>There are a few other remarks I must make on this subject.  As the father of a family of children who have gone through national school and are <Col N="1959" /> now in secondary school, I must make these further points.  There should be no homework in the Irish language whatsoever up to the age of about 11 years.  I do not agree with the teaching of other subjects to children of that age through the medium of Irish.  I do not think any child in a primary or secondary school should be punished for not knowing his Irish lessons, apart from the punishment which the child receives from the fact that he or she failed an examination.</P>
    <P>I may be asked why I do not agree with the teaching of other subjects through Irish.  My reason is this.  It may be educationally correct to do so but it is psychologically wrong.  I have experience going from one place to another&mdash;it is my duty to go into people's houses&mdash;and I have seen ambitious parents with books in their hands trying to teach their children geography or history through the medium of Irish and they are not in a position to do this.</P>

      <P>When that parent begins to express his opinion of the Irish language because of the difficulty created in the family, the child cannot approach the language with goodwill. It is vitally important that we have the goodwill of the parents towards the Irish language, that they should feel that the language is necessary and would like their children to learn it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same applies to homework in Irish.  If the parents cannot understand Irish, they feel they cannot help the children and that they are wasting their time.  The same situation is being created.  The parent is driven in exasperation to express illwill towards the language.  Children should not be punished physically for not knowing the language in the primary or secondary school.  If they fail their <Col N="1960" /> examinations, they have been punished enough.</P>
    <P>I mentioned that homework should not be done until the age of 11 years. I think I heard the Minister express the view that homework should start at ten years.  I am in favour of 11 years because I am aware that in Britain it is intended to start teaching French next year or the year after to all children of 11 years and two years later, it is intended to start teaching them Spanish and they must have some good reason for picking 11 years of age.  I might also mention that the people in Britain must be convinced that their children can learn more than one language.</P>
    <P>When the child goes to secondary school, the same thing should obtain. The emphasis should be on the oral aspect of Irish.  It should be taught freely, again without any punishment until the children reach the intermediate certificate.  Here I am strongly of the opinion that a change must be made.  I think we should have no compulsory Irish examination as we know it in the leaving certificate.  We should raise the standard in the intermediate examination to one halfway between honours and pass and provide that a pupil must pass that examination.</P>
    <P>We have been told that our system of education is to be geared in such a manner that when a child reaches the intermediate stage, he or she will have to decide where he or she is going from there.  That seems to be the idea of comprehensive education.  We have been told that at that stage the child may move to the comprehensive school or the vocational school or to the other schools.  If we follow this pattern, most children will have to decide on their careers at that stage.  At that stage, the child, having decided what his vocation is, the subjects which he is to be taught must be directed to that child's vocation and the other subjects not necessary for it, cut out. This will probably be a two-year course as at present.  During that course, if the unfortunate child fails Irish at the intermediate stage he should have an opportunity of doing <Col N="1961" /> the examination in each of the two years which would give him two or three opportunities.</P>
    <P>I would go further and insist that while the children are studying for their vocation they should be given the opportunity also of studying Irish to prepare themselves to carry out their vocations through the medium of that language&mdash;in other words, that the doctor would be able to pass an examination in the phrases, the words and all those other matters referring to medicine, oral and written; that the same would apply to the lawyer and to the other professions.  I do not suggest that the standard should be as high as for the person who had decided to take Irish as an academic subject.</P>
    <P>This would have a few virtues.  It would mean that leaving certificate Irish as such would not be compulsory. It would mean also that when a person went to take up an appointment in his profession and went for a Local Appointments Commission examination he would have no grievance if he had been fool enough to neglect his Irish in the meantime.  It would also get rid of the idea in people's minds the whole time that people learn Irish to get jobs.  It would remove that forever.</P>
    <P>Some of the objections raised to the Irish language interest me.  First of all, it is alleged it is not practicable.  One wonders what is practical in education. Deputy Lindsay is not now in the House.  I understood he took his degree in the classics but the number of people who say classics is not a practical subject is immense.  I do not think it can be said that Deputy Lindsay would undertake anything that would not be practical.  When I look back on all the time I spent studying and learning Shakespeare I wonder how much of it was ill-used.  Many times I thought that one could be a very good lawyer without having to decide whether Shylock had been mistreated by the laws of Venice, or a good Christian without having read all about the Forest of Arden.  I do not think that a psychiatrist, before he becomes such, would find it necessary to decide on the mental stability of Hamlet or that <Col N="1962" /> any politician in this House who becomes head of his Party found it necessary to study Macbeth and Julius Caesar&mdash;not in my Party, anyway.</P>

      <P>My experience in the university as far as Irish is concerned was that one of our greatest obligations was to attend cómhrá classes.  We had to attend 30 in the year, presided over by a senior student and there was a man there&mdash;I suppose he is dead now&mdash; whom we knew as Pádraic the Seanachaí.  He was only known to a few of the students because he played cards in the students' club.  In any event, we were expected to have 30 attendances in the year and if one had not one was not permitted to sit at one's examination.  It was alleged that if one did one's duty property at the céilí one did not have to be present for all the cómhrá gatherings.  The Minister happened to be a student in Galway in my time and I am sure such subterfuges were not known to him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the way I have seen Irish during the years.  In the school to which I went we were required to have a very high standard of written Irish but we left the school without being able to speak it very proficiently.  I am dealing with it at length because I fear that unless we get down to the question of speaking Irish at school level, we cannot revive the language as a spoken language.  The Minister referred to <i>Buntús Gaeilge</i>.  I do not know anything about the book. I have not seen it.  However, I fear we may forget the things which incidentally Deputy Mrs. Desmond mentioned and on which my views coincide.  When children come in at this level in the national school they will not be very pleased with <i>Buntús Gaeilge</i>.  Until such time as the goodwill of parents and teachers is brought to bear on children at this time we shall have a very difficult problem before us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People expressing views such as I have done must ask themselves from time to time what virtue they see in the revival of Irish as a spoken language. At times it is very difficult, when faced with some of the economic arguments.  However, one thing that has struck me down the years is that the British Government spent about 100 years in seeking to take the religion from the Irish people and they failed.  They gave us the Emancipation Act in 1829 and about three years afterwards they introduced a system of education here, one of the avowed purposes of which was to take the language from us.  In 1846 or 1848 or thereabouts the same English Government, drawing up an Act of Parliament dealing with the appointment of <Col N="1964" /> inspectors in coalmines in England and Wales, wrote into the Act that in any place in Wales an applicant with a knowledge of Welsh would get first preference.  That Government tried to kill the language in Ireland while they tried to do it good in Wales.  I have posed this question to many people but have never had a satisfactory reply and my conclusion is that the British Government were convinced that our religion and our language and those of all the nations around them, at that time meant something.  The Welsh and the Scots had lost their religion.  We had not, and I feel, therefore, that the British Government then attacked the next most important thing, the language. I feel when we have lost it, we will have lost something more by it.</P>
    <P>Regarding the question of compulsory Irish, the word &ldquo;compulsory&rdquo; is a word I do not accept at all.  You may use the word &ldquo;essential&rdquo;.  I feel anybody who uses the word &ldquo;compulsory&rdquo; in reference to Irish must never have been at school.  When I was in school, I considered every subject as more or less compulsory.  My family are no different from any other family in Ireland.  Most children find any subject they have to learn compulsory.  In other words, they have got to be made to learn.</P>
    <P>Another aspect I should mention is this question of having to pass Irish in the leaving certificate examination. When you come to think of that, there are other situations in life where people find themselves with particular barriers such as this.  What about a young fellow who is refused admission into the Gardaí because he is a quarter of an inch short in measure?  That is a bigger barrier than the fellow who fails Irish in his leaving certificate.  The person who fails Irish in the leaving certificate may with extra study pass it later but the person who fails to get into the Garda because he is too short can do nothing about it.  The same may be said about a man who applies for a job and is rejected because he is a day too old or a day too young. He has no control over that.  Those are things which are never adverted to at all.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1965" /> Another thing we are told is that there are people who cannot learn Irish.  I believe there are some people who cannot learn languages but I do not think we have ever heard of a man from the Gaeltacht who was unable to learn English when he came to Dublin or went to England.</P>

      <P>Another argument put forward which I find most nauseating is that people find Irish is no good at all in England.  I think it was Brendán Ó hEithir, writing in one of the daily papers some months ago who gave the answer to anybody who advances that argument.  Regarding the question of free education, I am very pleased that the Minister has laid such emphasis on transport.  This is the vital thing in the matter of free education in rural areas. The transport must be adequate.  It must run smoothly and the children must not be too long on the road.  I can see difficulties in some areas but I feel we must get over them.  The only thing I am sorry about is that this does <Col N="1966" /> not come into force until 1st April.  If it could have started this winter in some of the areas, particularly in the areas I know of, where children have to go nine and ten miles to school, it would have been a great advantage.  They are carried all right but they are out the whole day.</P>
      <P>Another thing mentioned by Deputy Mrs. Desmond is this question of career guidance.  I understand the Department are publishing some booklet on this subject.  I wonder how soon it will be available?  I was presented with a case during the summer where a student who had not sufficient guidance and who had his mind set on a particular career when he left the secondary school found he had not the necessary subjects for this purpose.  I do not know what the Department have in mind in publishing such a document but they should, as the Minister has done, instead of waiting for the details, put out something which would be of use to students and work on the details later.  In other words, they could put out some typed documents so that children would have an idea of what subjects to study if they wish to follow a particular profession and they would not be completely frustrated when the year is over.</P>
      <P>Regarding universities, I often wonder what will happen when we are all educated?  Will we be satisfied then?  Who are going to be the hewers of wood and the drawers of water? This problem does not arise immediately but when it does arise it will loom large.  Recently my notice was drawn to the fact that in Britain at the moment the universities are moving on to the question of demanding three years as the period between the intermediate and Leaving certificate examinations.  We have two years at the moment.  We have extended it to a third year but I think that is voluntary. It seems the British universities are demanding this three-year course before entering a university.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure the Department have a way out of this.  I should like to know if they have any fixed views on it. No doubt this is one way in which <Col N="1967" /> the universities can seek to keep down their numbers.  If there is anything happening about this we should be told about it.  In Britain at the moment they say they must provide opportunities for abilities.  They mean by that that instead of having a one-tier university you must have a three-tier university.  In other words, the brilliant fellow going into the university must not be held back by the less brilliant fellow.  I should like to know if there is anything being done here along this line.  If that is happening it will be the very opposite to what we are pressing here in this House, which is equal opportunity for everybody.  No doubt if this happens across the water we will have to think about it here.</P>
    <P>When we are speaking of universities, we always think about building new ones.  We are aware that there is one place looking for a university.  They have been agitating for this for some time.  In addition to that, I am certain we must have more university education. I feel that a natural site for a university is the Sligo area.  I am not foolish enough to advocate that it should be in my own constituency but in all seriousness we should have one in that area.  Northern Ireland have located their university at Coleraine. Derry agitated for that university.  I feel that Sligo is an area which should have a university.  It might not have the facilities for medicine but it should be able to cater for every other faculty. It does not need any natural resources round there to establish it.  It would bring induced employment with it for which there is great need.  I hope, when the Department are thinking of the location of future universities, they will keep that area in mind.  Even if we have a university in Limerick it will not cater for our needs, particularly if the universities are to become more scientific and technological.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, one of the most important points we have to make on education in the future is that now that we propose to give every child free education our civics course, with its many aspects, should be planned in <Col N="1968" /> such a way and in such a manner that it should be impressed on those pupils, when they get their qualifications, be it at home or abroad, that they have a duty to allow their country to avail of their talents.  People ask why, having got their qualifications in Britain or America, there is any obligation on them to return home but having got their primary and secondary education free here, they are under such an obligation. This is one thing that should be insisted upon from the beginning.  It ought to be pointed out to those people that they should return.  I do not know what percentage returns at present but in the medical field it is small enough. We should place this problem before them at the start and point out to them that they are needed here to provide the necessary expansion in industry and commerce and to educate the generation coming after them.  If we do not do that we will start one of the greatest brain drains that this country will have ever witnessed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>There can be no doubt anywhere in the country now about the importance to the future of our country of our educational policy and the facilities and services we provide. More and more in recent years people have come to accept the fact that a small country such as ours, if it is to survive in the world which surrounds it, must provide a level of education for its citizens at least as high, if not higher, than other countries. That is accepted and it has almost become a cliché but few people have realised up to this&mdash;they are beginning to realise it now&mdash;that the work to be done here is very much more arduous and very much more difficult than in other countries because so much leeway requires to be made up.  That we and our young children have to bear the burden of a low standard of education, is chiefly the fault of the Government Party. They have been in office on and off almost since 1932 and they have done nothing about education.  They have allowed the years to slip by with the annual debate on the Estimate which we are now discussing being a series <Col N="1969" /> of slogans and clichés about the importance of principles which they rarely understood and all the time our young people were emigrating to accept mental employment in other lands because their educational standard was not such as to qualify them for anything else.  It is against that background that this year we on these benches are going to make the Minister for Education, and any successor he will have, because I have no doubt he will have one, sit up and take notice.</P>

      <P>I would earnestly urge the Minister not to draw my fire on him because I want to retain some decorum in this debate.  I was saying that I proposed to demonstrate <Col N="1970" /> the very flimsy proposals which are paraded as a policy by the Minister for Education in the Fianna Fáil administration in 1966.

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>As I was saying, the Minister when he became Minister for Education, made a speech <Col N="1971" /> last September.  I do not wish to speculate as to why the Minister made that speech or made it to the audience to whom he made it.  I suppose that in a Minister's life, journalists are very important.  The Minister announced in his speech, which appeared from its text to be rather hastily got together, that he was about to provide the people with a new scheme which he referred to as &ldquo;my scheme&rdquo;, the scheme which was to provide post-primary education for the children of this country and everything was going to be so wonderful that we waited with bated breath for the details.</P>
      <P>I have sympathy with the Minister. It must have been a very shattering experience for him to read&mdash;I shall not say yesterday morning, because perhaps the Minister may have been fortunate enough to get it in advance&mdash; the Fine Gael document and to learn that this Party in Opposition, without the assistance of a Civil Service, was able to complete a comprehensive study and survey of the country's educational requirements and, not only that, but to put forward complete and comprehensive proposals related to every facet of education.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall deal with that later.  The important thing is that this debate takes place with no Deputy in blinkers.  It takes place against a background of a Fine Gael programme fully worked out, ranging over every facet of Irish education, and accomplished by a Party who have not available the services and assistance available to the Minister or to the Government. Perhaps it was because of that that a hasty postscript was typed in, as appears quite clearly from the text, to the last paragraph of the Minister's Estimate speech.  On page 30 of that speech, I read these hastily added words:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to my proposal it must be borne in mind also that as Minister for Education and acting as a member of a responsible Government, I cannot place any Utopian <Col N="1972" /> scheme before the House.  It is very easy&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>says this hastily added postscript&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>to promise the sun, moon and stars when there is little prospect of your being called upon to implement such promises.</P>
    <P>The Minister goes on to refer to our proposals as fitting the strictures in his postscript, promising the sun, the moon and the stars.  I accept as from an expert in that matter, these words of his.  The Minister certainly knows what it is to promise the sun, moon and stars, but I do not accept from him as one qualified to judge any stricture or any suggestion that the proposals made by my Party are Utopian or impossible to accomplish. They represent the result of a voluntary study carried out by many people in the country over the past 12 or 18 months, people who gave their time and experience and their knowledge freely, without any payment, and without any desire to have their contribution acknowledged but who gave it because they wanted to see some new thinking on education, some formulation of a comprehensive plan and some move forward in this field that for so long had become the graveyard of broken promises.</P>
    <P>The Minister says these proposals are Utopian.  He is entitled to his view, but there is a large number of people in the country who believe that what we propose can be accomplished and who are waiting for the day when in fact that can be done.  In any event, whether our proposals are capable of fulfilment or not, that is a matter about which we can exchange views here, but what I am concerned about is whether there is any alternative proposal by the Minister or by the Government to our educational policy.  May I remind the Minister that just two weeks ago at the annual Ard-Fheis of his Party the Minister was so bold, so intemperate, as to say that in the coming two by-elections, two Parties were entering the field without an educational policy.</P>

      <P>That is very fine, but what we need now in relation to the present time, the leeway that must be made up, the challenge that faces the country and the urgency to provide proper standards for our young children, is complete new thinking on education.  The present need will not be satisfied by a papering-over of the cracks.  It will not be satisfied or met by stop-gap measures to deal with this problem or that problem.  We need an entirely new look on the direction of education here, on the kind of thing we are trying to provide for our children and on the general standard of education.</P>
      <P>The Minister has very carefully avoided all these problems.  He thinks that when people hunger for something, you throw them a crust and they will be satisfied.  He thinks he is going to make a name for himself and his Party by providing now a limited scheme to give free post-primary education to certain sections of our people. That just will not do.  I do not believe that in what he proposes here he is making any serious effort to face up to what is required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to know when the Minister replies, the answers to certain questions. <Col N="1974" /> Does the Minister think the Department should be re-organised? Is he satisfied with the present structure of his Department, with the role it is playing in this field?  An answer to that question, if the Minister thinks about it, might lead to new thinking on what, in fact, is the proper direction education should take in this country. Does the Minister think, as we think, that the curriculum in our schools, the standards in our examinations, should be decided by those equipped and experienced in education, not by politicians?  Can the Minister indicate his views on that?  Why should we suffer in this country having what is to be taught in our schools and what our children are to be examined in decided by civil servants, decided by politicians?</P>

      <P>It is interesting to see the Minister has come out very definitely on that.  What about teachers and teacher training?  Can the Minister indicate to Dáil Éireann what are his proposals and the proposals of his Government to provide for our young children in the years ahead the <Col N="1976" /> necessary teachers and the necessary training for teachers?  Again, I might suggest to the Minister that if he reads the Fine Gael document&mdash;he probably knows it better than I do now&mdash;he will find concrete proposals in that regard.  Can he indicate whether these proposals commend themselves to him?  If they do not, what alternative proposals has he in mind?  In regard to vocational teachers, is the Minister satisfied with the present system of appointing vocational teachers?</P>

      <P>May I come to some other things?  Those are the easy things I have been dealing with. They will get a bit more difficult now. The Minister made a speech last September when he promised that some day, some time when his Estimate would come along, he would tell the whole story, and so today in his speech he said:</P>
      <P>It remains for me, now, to fulfil the promise I made by giving details of my plans for the provision of free education at post-primary level&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>The Minister nods in entire approval of what he said today, and so do I. He goes on to say:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1977" />&mdash;&mdash;and for assistance at university level for students who have the ability to profit....</P>
    <P>The ensuing parts of the Minister's speech refer to the provision of free education at post-primary level.  The Minister probably exhausted himself then, because when he came to the second part of his commitment, the promise which he made last September, which he said he was fulfilling today, when he came to the university, here is what he had to say:</P>
    <P>Assistance at university level is, however, a different matter altogether. I felt that it would not be appropriate for me to work out a detailed scheme.</P>
    <P>Then we have the University Commission, and once more we wait and see.</P>

      <P>Does it not seem incongruous that in ten pages of a speech here today, having promised that he would give details of his scheme for university assistance at page 16, ten pages later Deputies were told: &ldquo;Well, I am not going to do it&rdquo;?  So we have the Minister for Education, having trumpeted so much about his great new scheme, having promised so much to so many people, letting us find out now that this is a scheme merely to provide grants to certain secondary schools. But the real problem, the great problem of university education for the boys and girls who left school this year and who will leave school next year, is deferred.  What is the problem about it?

      <P>On what the Minister promises, we are going to have a new thing now in Ireland, something we never had before.  I charge the Minister that under the scheme he now proposes we are going to have class distinction introduced in secondary education.  The Minister and I were educated at the same college.

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>In paragraph 104 of the Fine Gael document, this point is made and a certain danger is referred to.  I mean this very seriously The point is made as follows:</P>
      <P>Nevertheless in view of the fact that the fees&mdash;</P>
      <P>&mdash;that is post-primary fees&mdash;have some disincentive effect, and that in any event with education up to 15 becoming compulsory, post-primary as well as primary education to that age must be free, Fine Gael proposes as one step towards securing greater participation in post-primary education, to institute a scheme under which almost all secondary schools will be enabled without financial loss to offer free education, in most cases to all the children in the school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This decision carries with it a danger, however, that must at all costs be avoided&mdash;and an opportunity that must be grasped.  The danger is that such a scheme could convert our educational system overnight <Col N="1981" /> into one divided on a class basis, between free schools and fee-paying schools; the opportunity is an opportunity to mitigate the existing less obtrusive class division within the school system.</P>
    <P>In the Fine Gael proposals, that danger was recognised and that problem pinpointed. The subsequent paragraphs of the document indicate the manner in which we propose to provide free secondary education so that a class division will not exist and that such as has existed up to this would be obviated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of the Minister's proposal is to create the very danger we had indicated might arise.  The Minister proposes here to provide grants up to £25 and stop there.  The effect of that will be the creation of a class bias in our secondary schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest to the Minister that, if he thinks about it, examines it and consults his advisers, he will find that is so.  I am satisfied it was not intended, but this again is an example on the Minister's part and on the Government's part of a hastily-contrived scheme, a proposal that the Minister had to make on this debate and which he did without much thought and much consideration.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to prevent other Deputies speaking, but I think I am entitled to say that Fine Gael stand now as the only political Party who have devoted effort, time and energy over a considerable space of time in working out the details and the costing of a comprehensive plan in education. While this work was going on, we had to meet criticisms of one kind or another but criticism did not divert the intention of our study groups from completing the mission they set out to achieve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We believe in a just society; that, <Col N="1982" /> to us, is not merely a phrase.  A just society must be a society that provides in education, in health, in housing and in all the other spheres of national activity a fair and equal opportunity for our citizens.  Education has always been a difficult problem in this country.  The difficulties are there. They cannot be wished away.  Part of them represents a heritage from the past but, despite the difficulties, we in Fine Gael were determined to have a complete survey of what is required to be done in education here.  I suggest earnestly to the Minister and to the Government that they should not parade the proposals we are discussing here, which were put forward by the Minister, as a policy.  It is not a policy. It in no way meets the requirements of our people now or in the future.  We have to have a complete examination of many other matters before there is a semblance of a comprehensive policy in operation.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the Minister's views about university education may be.  I suppose we shall get the second instalment of the Minister's plan for education on the Estimate next year and that we shall be told next year the way in which he will assist the new university students for 1968 or 1969.  In the Minister's speech there is an exclusive reference to secondary education in the limited way I have indicated. Does the Minister not think that a new look might be given to what is going on at the moment in our primary schools?  What is the aim of primary education in Ireland in 1966?  Is it merely to teach our children about the Firbolgs, the Tuatha de Danann, and so on, or will we make some effort to teach our children in primary schools today that they are growing up and will take their part as citizens of Europe?  Will we ensure that they will not be isolated in ideas, views and notions that ill-equip them for the life they will have to lead?</P>
    <P>What is to be the aim of primary education?  We suggest in our document what the aim of primary education should be.  Can the Minister indicate to us what he thinks it should be? I could list some 30 or 40 questions which I think the Minister has left <Col N="1983" /> unanswered.  All I want to indicate is that we are still looking for an educational policy from the Fianna Fáil Minister for Education.  All the big problems have been avoided.  All the thorny questions have been left unanswered. Perhaps, indeed, when the Minister replies, he will tell us something about his policy on the Irish language.  Whatever the inaction of the Minister for Education may be, there is at least now, so far as the people outside who will elect the next Government are concerned, evidence that at least one political Party has the courage to say what it stands for, has the ability and efficiency to do its work, to complete its thinking and to produce a balanced and comprehensive plan.</P>

      <P>I want to place on record the fact that the first Party in these modern times to put on record in book form their policy on education was the Labour Party and it was entitled &ldquo;Challenge and Change in Education&rdquo;.  The Minister was good enough to refer to it during the television programme interview a few weeks ago.  Unfortunately, he had not a copy; he had only a copy of, I think, the Racing Calendar that night.  He had not our booklet but Deputy Mrs. Desmond, who represented the Labour Party there, did have it.  She also had it here tonight and I think she made <Col N="1984" /> very good use of her time in speaking in the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Mrs. Desmond is our speaker on education and, therefore, she was putting across the Labour Party policy.  I propose to add a little to what she said and to give some personal views of my own. To start with, I should like to say that, while we heard the Minister for Education make his promise and while we read here with interest what he says he proposes to do, there are, in my opinion, too many gaps in the details for anybody to say: &ldquo;This is a policy&rdquo;.  They are policy headings, if you like, but there are a good many gaps.  I welcome a number of them, particularly, as Deputy Mrs. Desmond said, they are matters which we have been trying to get the Government to adopt for a number of years.  Some of them, I admit, are quite new and quite good ideas.</P>
      <P>While the Minister says he proposes to start one phase of this actually in April, 1967, I am aware of the fact that the Minister and his predecessor were asked to do certain things which they thought they could do but apparently they had not the backing of the Government.  These things were not done.  I propose to go into detail and perhaps the Minister will hold his horses for a few moments while I give him the details.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the previous Minister for Education.  Deputy Colley, was in that hot seat, I went with a deputation of parents to interview him about a school which is in a bad condition on the Meath-Westmeath border.  I was accompanied by other public representatives and one of the local clergy. The Minister pointed out to the deputation that, in fact, it was proposed to build a large-sized two-roomed school in a neighbouring area and he felt this would fill the bill.  It was pointed out that the local people did not agree and that, in any case, this did not solve the problem because even if the bigger school were built in a short time, there still was the problem that while it was being built, <Col N="1985" /> the children would continue to have to go into an insanitary, old building which could not be called comfortable in the middle of summer.  In fact, water flowed in one door and out the other. It was impossible to go into the school in wet weather, and one of the children had to take his boots off and carry a younger child across the road.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley said he was aware of this and that he had a solution. There was a site for a bigger centre and he had a prefabricated school and within a few weeks the matter would be solved.  He said, rightly so, that it was only a prefabricated school but that until money was available and plans made, it would solve the problem. That was six months ago and that prefabricated school has never been put up.  Since then, the children have been carrying the little ones, and the rats are coming out from under the floor. That goes on all over this country.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Party attempted last year to get out of this problem by saying they proposed to do away with the one- and two-teacher schools and build bigger and better schools in other areas to which children could be taken by transport.  Mini-buses would be provided, if necessary, and this would solve the problem.  I accused the Government before, and I repeat tonight, that they deliberately set out to put up a smokescreen for the purpose of stalling in a period in which they were financially embarrassed.  The school has not been replaced but in some other cases much more had been promised to the local manager.  Sites had been bought in many cases, including the site about which I have spoken.</P>
    <P>What in effect the Government were saying was: &ldquo;We are changing now; we will build a better type of school and we will supply extra teachers; we will supply transport to take the children to school.&rdquo;  They did not say when they were going to do it.  The Government did this deliberately, knowing there was a shortage of money, and that this was the way they could stall, as stall they did.  We get the result&mdash; hundreds of old, derelict schools into which people would not put their farm <Col N="1986" /> animals.  This is where the children, mainly of the workingclasses, are spending their first years of education &mdash;in buildings which are filthy, unsightly inside and outside, with broken windows and broken doors, and in some cases a bad roof.</P>
    <P>We are told that the Minister for Education has a new scheme for education. I do not think that is fair because the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach, now in the front bench, must be as well aware of these schools in his constituency as everybody else.</P>

      <P>I do not want to be accused of being vexatious or to be thrown out of the House as my colleague was today.  Those schools are in existence in every constituency and I do not mind what excuse is given for conditions over the past ten, 15 or 20 years.  The fact is that they are still in existence and those suitable for replacement within the past 12 months have not been replaced because of a trick played by the Government, with one exception which Deputy Calleary succeeded in getting done, in conjunction with Deputy Lindsay.  Those two argued over a school that should not be closed and one or the other got his way.  I understand a new two-teacher school has been built there but that is the only one that has been built over the past 12 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite obvious that the Government are doing this for the purpose <Col N="1987" /> of saving money.  When Deputy Colley was Minister for Education I am sure he would have carried out very useful changes if he had been allowed to do so.  I have a personal regard for Deputy Colley.  He was not allowed, because over the past 12 months the schools were not built.  People were told: &ldquo;They are on the planning board; bigger schools are being built.&rdquo; God knows how long they will be at the planning stage before they are built.</P>
    <P>The Minister's new programme for free education for all from secondary level up makes one wonder what is to happen with regard to primary education. I believe primary education is one place where this Government have fallen down badly.  There was a school in Knockcommon in County Meath and it was considered by everybody as being in a shocking condition.  It was agreed that it should be replaced and all arrangements were made, including the purchase of a site.  The Minister told me two years ago that it would be built last August.  Subsequently he could not recollect that.  The children were to be taken to Donore.  The children in that area were near enough to Drogheda to go to school there.  The children from Knockcommon came from a radius of two to three miles, and to go to school in Donore, they would have to come two or three miles from Knockcommon and go two or three miles to Donore.  It was not feasible. The old school has not been closed, and when it is closed, the children will be scattered around to other parishes.  Perhaps that is the way to deal with these things; I do not know. I do know that the old school could have been replaced by a new one and that is what should have been done.</P>
    <P>We hear also of the necessity to have new houses and the Department of Local Government are insisting, and rightly so, that there should be modern conveniences, that water and sewerage should certainly be laid on.  There are schools where there are no sanitary conveniences of any kind except an old dry closet which is cleaned out maybe once a year or even longer periods. <Col N="1988" /> Even some of the relatively new schools, built within the past ten or 15 years, have nothing but a dry closet. Along the main road outside the village of Julianstown in County Meath one such school exists, and the Parliamentary Secretary need not shake his head.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCarty" hpid="Mr. Carty Mr. Carty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carty</NameTxt>
      <P>There were three schools built in the parish in which I taught in the past 12 years and all of them have modern sanitary conveniences. They will not allow schools to go up without them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am merely giving facts as I see them for myself.</P>
      <P>Reference was made by the Minister to the effect that recent statements about vocational education were incorrect. He could have been referring to a statement made by me when talking to him personally and also when he received a deputation in his office.  He said I would have to retract a statement that money in certain areas for vocational education was severely slashed this year and pointed out that there was substantial money provided for and given to vocational education. I want to state here, and I ask the Minister to deny it, that grants to Meath Vocational Education Committee were cut £7,000 in the spring of 1966 and were further cut by £3,000 in August, 1966, making a total of £10,000.  I want to ask him if he is aware that, as a result of those cuts, temporary teachers employed by the committee had to be dismissed and permanent teachers, including those employed in the school of furniture in Navan&mdash;experts in their job, employed in a school which, I think, cost £48,000 to build a couple of years ago &mdash;had to be taken out to teach in old halls and old schools, part-time classes at night in order to make up their hours of work to keep them in employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1989" /> While all this is going on, the Minister for Education is going around the country talking about free education for everybody and there is lán a' mhála of money for anybody who wants education. Let us be practical about it. If those things can happen within 30 or 40 miles of Dublin, surely it is ridiculous for any Minister to talk about all the money that is available for education with no cut-back.  If extra money has been given as set out in the Minister's statement, then it must have been given to some privileged group because it was not given in County Meath.  The Minister and his officials can check on what I am saying here and it is the third time I have said it in this House. It is a scandalous waste of public money that a school should have been built and that after a short time the arrangements for the group release of students to be trained in that school had to be cancelled because there was no money to keep it going.  Why all this hypocrisy about free education when this sort of thing is allowed?</P>
    <P>The Minister has referred to the comprehensive schools.  I should like to mention something that happened quite recently.  There is a comprehensive school in Cootehill in County Cavan and a number of children who were not close enough to attend any of the existing vocational schools, children from the Kingscourt area, travelled by car which their parents paid for to where they could catch a bus nine miles from Cootehill for the purpose of attending the school.  The parents were prepared to pay for the car hire and bus fare.  They were refused admission to the comprehensive school.  I took the matter up with the Minister because I thought some headmaster down there was making a fool of himself or trying to make fools of decent people.  I got a reply to the effect that this school did not cater for the children from that area and it was proposed some time in the not too far distant future to build a school which would accommodate them, around Kingscourt or Nobber or some such place.  Again, this is an example of statements being made about the availability of education for those who want it and proof that it is not available <Col N="1990" /> to even those who are prepared to pay for it.  It is no good blowing about the four comprehensive schools that have been built and what they are doing.  I think that should cease until the Minister is in a position to say that, in fact, they are catering for those who want to attend these schools.</P>
    <P>The teaching of the Irish language has been mentioned and the experiment carried out in Gormanston which I know was a great success. Deputy Mrs. Desmond made the most useful suggestion I have heard for some time when she said that if we want to teach children in the infant classes the Irish language, since they have not got it in the home, the way to teach them is by using ordinary phrases and expressions which have some sense and not simply using phrases like: &ldquo;This is a door, that is not a door, shut this door, open this door.&rdquo;  This sort of thing is all cod. They are not taught the English language that way in their homes.  From their earliest years, they learn to speak English because their parents speak it in the normal way and they get a grasp of the language.  The accent apparently in the teaching of Irish is on learning set phrases and grammar when what is needed is to learn to speak the language, to use phrases which are useful.  I remember some years ago the <i>Irish Press</i> I think carried a phrase a day &mdash; ordinary phrases in Irish and in English, with their pronunciation.  They were very useful and I know people who picked up a number of very useful phrases by this means.</P>
    <P>If we go to the Gaeltacht&mdash;and this is something the Parliamentary Secretary knows a lot more about than I do&mdash;we find quite a number of people, fluent Irish speakers, who cannot read or would not know what it was if it were written down for them, but who can speak it fluently because they heard it spoken from their earliest years.  Surely the object should be to learn to speak Irish?  I am one of those who believe we should by right attempt to retain the Irish language.  I think we have gone too far with this question of having, instead of a love of the language, youngsters leaving <Col N="1991" /> school anxious to learn Irish, not because of the fact that they want to use it because it is their native language, but because they want to go for some job which they will not get unless they have a knowledge of Irish.  That is doing more to kill the language than anything else.  There is certainly no love for the language and in many cases other subjects are being taught to children through the medium of Irish which they do not understand and which makes it doubly hard.</P>
    <P>In addition, there is the question of the number who have failed the leaving certificate because of the Irish language. We are told the number is relatively small.  I should like to know the number of children who failed in other subjects because of the time and concentration they had to give to learning Irish.  I am sure that is something in which the Parliamentary Secretary, who is himself a teacher, would be very interested.</P>

      <P>According to the Minister, the Government have taken a decision to raise the school leaving age to 15 years by 1970.  Now, we all knew about that, of course, because the statement was made before the Minister introduced his Estimate.  The Minister explained that the three years, 12 to 15, would have to be free because children would still be in the primary school category.  We all agree with that.  Are any preparations being made to cater for the extra children when that year is added?  Remembering the number who now leave school at 14 years of age it is obvious there will be quite a substantial number who will require this extra education and we have neither the schools nor the <Col N="1993" /> teachers to cater for them.  That is something on which I challenge contradiction. This is late 1966.  With the progress we are making, it would not appear as if we will be able to cater for them in 1970 and the Minister would want to wake up to that fact very quickly.</P>
      <P>The proposal is to give them free education through aid.  This is an effort to try to meet the situation, but I do not think it is a good enough effort. I agree with Deputy T.F. O'Higgins that the Minister will immediately set up two classes of schools so soon as he brings into operation a system whereby everybody is free up to a certain rate&mdash;£15 to £25&mdash;and others are not.  Snob schools will raise the fees to over £30 and the snob parents will continue to send their children to these schools.</P>

      <P>Deputy MacEntee said the Government bought one for the Second Programme and the Government did not do so well with it.  The fact is the headmaster could not possibly decide who is entitled to free books and who is not.  This is a stupid system.  It will be resented, and rightly resented, by headmasters if they are put in that unfortunate position.  I do not think they will accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One other point about secondary schools is, of course, the question of boarders.  There is a very vague reference here to people over 15 miles from a school.  Therefore, the Minister will have to devise a scheme to deal with that.  This is supposed to be the Government scheme on post-primary education; this is, not what is in the Minister's head, or what he will be able to devise in a couple of months' time. God knows, it has been hatched long enough; it should be out of incubation by now and this is only one of a number of instances where the Minister is deliberately vague on this problem.  He says that people going for a technical profession may be required to go to a certain school, or they may be living 15 miles away.  Supposing they are not; the Minister says he is wiping <Col N="1996" /> out all scholarships with effect from a certain date.  My local authority run what I consider to be a ridiculously small number of local authority scholarships every year.  The yield is something round 60 secondary scholarships, divided between day schools and boarding schools and they have the option to go to boarding school, if they so wish.  I have my own views on this, and I am with the Minister on it because the parents of some of those children when they go to a boarding school get £90.  Ninety pounds, of course, does not represent what the parents have to pay but those who go to a day school get about £50.  The Minister now proposes to pay a sum of not more than £25.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether this thing has been gone into as carefully as the Minister suggests but it would appear to me that there is a lot of woolly thinking about it, particularly in view of the fact that for those who do go to a school&mdash;and Deputy Mrs. Desmond referred to this particularly&mdash;the amount of the fee and price of books is often only a relatively small portion of the cost.  The Parliamentary Secretary, I am quite sure, is aware of the fact that when some of these children go to a school&mdash;I saw some of them myself who availed of a scholarship to go to a school&mdash;and when they were making the final arrangements, they found that sports gear worth £20 was listed, uniform worth a further £10 was listed and certain other items amounting to £6 were listed, and the parents were not able to meet the cost.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, day school. Does the Parliamentary Secretary suggest that these people will be any better off if, instead of getting the £50 which they would get now, a limited number will in future get £25?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCarty" hpid="Mr. Carty Mr. Carty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carty</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>We had in my local authority this year, 363 children who entered for secondary school scholarships.  We gave 59 scholarships, <Col N="1997" /> so there were slightly over 304 children who got no scholarship.  The Minister has given figures for what this will cost. I want to point out that this means there will be, this year, 304 more children looking for these scholarships, or this free education, and I am all with the Minister if he is in a position to provide that education.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCarty" hpid="Mr. Carty Mr. Carty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carty</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is hoping the Minister will not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>As a matter of fact, I am not; I am hoping it will not be like so many of the other promises which this promising young man made.  I am hoping it will not just be another case of making a statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCarty" hpid="Mr. Carty Mr. Carty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carty</NameTxt>
      <P>Why not give it a trial?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid it will be like all the other promises he made which just did not come off; they got no trial and the Minister was not there to see that they got a trial.  He has put the bones of something down on paper here and I should like to hear a lot more about it before we would be prepared to agree that it is what he claims it is&mdash;the full programme of Fianna Fáil for free education.</P>
      <P>In his speech the Minister said:</P>
      <P>The existing fees in the vocational schools and secondary tops attached to national schools are very low and it is considered that an additional grant of £4 per pupil would be sufficient to enable these schools to abolish fees altogether.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Maybe I am not reading it correctly, but does the Minister mean by that that if the fee is, say, £2 or £3 the Department would be prepared to pay an extra £4, making that £6 or £7, as the case may be, or does he feel that £4 would represent the whole lot, would cover it as it stands at the present time?  It is not very clear and I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary <Col N="1998" /> is wondering, just as I am, what is meant by that.  He would have told me otherwise.</P>
    <P>The special cases of boarding schools are referred to and I would be very interested to see how far the Minister can go with that.  The Minister mentions also assistance to Protestant pupils.  The minority in this country should get a fair deal; they have always got it and I see that the Minister will continue that policy.</P>
    <P>Then we come to the question of those pupils who live far away from school and, therefore, must be provided with transport.  There is a distance of four miles laid down.  The children will be collected if they are more than four miles or five from the school.  I wonder if the Minister considers that this is the correct way to deal with that because, by laying down a mileage like this, he is saying that children&mdash;perhaps of reasonably well-to-do parents&mdash;who live, say, five miles from a school will be collected and, on a wet morning or a bad winter morning, children who live just inside that limit, of very poor parents &mdash;according to the Minister's regulation&mdash;will be required to walk to school.  If the Minister is making an arrangement to take children to school, then that arrangement should cover everybody.</P>
    <P>Recently I went with a deputation to the Minister about school transport in my area.  We were looking for assistance for a transport system which had been set up by a local parents' committee; we had a number of parents, public representatives from the county and the parish priest.  The arrangement was that a local bus was collecting the children and taking them in to school.  The parents were paying a flat rate per head for these children. Some of them were going to primary, some to secondary and others to vocational schools.  We realised that it would not be easy for the Minister to make an arrangement for this area and leave out other areas.  We understood, as the regulations stood, it applied only to primary school children. The Minister was not as puzzled about it as we were and he felt sure <Col N="1999" /> that that week he would be able to make a grant available which would solve everybody's problems.  He explained how he would do it and, during the discussion, he said to me: &ldquo;When this comes off, you will have to retract certain things you said about me&rdquo;.  I replied: &ldquo;When this comes off, I will be glad to retract them&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I have not had to retract them, because it did not come off; we thought this transport could not be provided although the Minister was quite certain that it could.  After several weeks I asked him what had happened and I got a nice polite reply saying that it was the question of school transport for the whole country which was being considered.  Had we been told that when we interviewed the Minister, we would at least have known where we stood, but this false promise meant that these parents went to the expense of keeping the bus running for very much longer than they could afford, with a heavy overdraft in a bank raised for the purpose of trying to keep the children going and, eventually when the Minister's reply came along, the whole thing had to be dropped.</P>
    <P>In view of that, can anybody blame me if I take with a grain of salt some of the things the Minister has promised here?  Does it not appear that this is another airy-fairy promise that he is going to do good, that he is on the side of the do-gooders, that all we have to do is wait and everything will be all right?  I should like to see something more concrete than what the Minister has in the White Paper before I would say that he is prepared, with the backing of the Government, to do the things which he sets out in the White Paper.</P>
    <P>The Minister made another comment which Deputy Mrs. Desmond picked him up on, under the heading of &ldquo;Special assistance for children of parents in lower income groups&rdquo;.  He said:</P>
    <P>Under our present system of post-primary education the obstacles in the way of the student from the <Col N="2000" /> lower income family may be set down as follows: (a) the inability of his parents to pay the school fees demanded; (b) their inability to meet the cost of school books and requisites; (c) the need for an additional breadwinner in the family; (d) the absence of motivation from the family environment; and (e) the cost of transport in rural areas.</P>
    <P>Now, according to the Minister he is making money available and inability to pay will not matter.  He is doing something about school books.  In regard to the additional breadwinner, he is devising a scheme.  Once again, when it comes to a question of doing something definite, of making a break with the existing regulations, where the Minister is required to make a definite statement, he simply puts it on one side and says he is devising a scheme. I do not think that it is good enough. A big problem in many workingclass families, and particularly where there is a big family, is the fact that of pure economic necessity, as soon as the eldest child reaches 14 years of age a job must be found for him if a job can be found.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCarty" hpid="Mr. Carty Mr. Carty">

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCarty" hpid="Mr. Carty Mr. Carty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carty</NameTxt>
      <P>I made a point which the Deputy did not take me up on, and he took me up on a point which I did not make.  I am saying that if a parent sends his eldest child to school, he is making a great sacrifice to educate him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought I was in possession.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to elaborate on that point tomorrow in his own time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCarty" hpid="Mr. Carty Mr. Carty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carty</NameTxt>
      <P>I will.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I will listen carefully to him.  Let me make my points in my own time.  I do not believe it is sufficient simply to say that some scheme is being devised to deal with the point about the need for an additional breadwinner in the family.  I see far too much of this.  I see far too many people whose children would do very well if they were given an opportunity but their parents cannot send them to school because they need the extra few shillings those children can earn.  There is no use in trying to pass this over by saying: &ldquo;Look, these people are making sacrifices&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCarty" hpid="Mr. Carty Mr. Carty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carty</NameTxt>
      <P>So they are.  The Deputy is putting words in my mouth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should have stated definitely: &ldquo;This is what I propose to do.&rdquo;  In regard to the absence of motivation from the family environment, I do not know what the Minister proposes to do.  We know there are many families where children are not encouraged to continue their education once they have reached the primary school leaving age.  We also know that some of those children would be brilliant if they got an opportunity. Whether there is to be some kind of campaign to encourage parents to send their children to school, or some way of trying to force parents to allow their children to remain at school after the age of 15 years if they show signs of having additional ability, I do not know.  A recognition that this is one of the barriers is not sufficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I dealt with the question of transport in the rural areas.  I am not at all satisfied that this question will be dealt with in the way in which I should like to see it dealt with.  I am quite sure the next thing we will be told is that some arrangement will be made with CIE.  CIE made a very poor attempt to provide transport for schoolgoing children.  I told the Minister about the so-called school bus which leaves Navan town in the evenings. Recently there were 167 people, including six or seven adults&mdash;the remainder were children on the way home from school&mdash;on a 44-seater bus.  It is quite common in our towns to find children coming in to <Col N="2002" /> school on a bus at 8.30 or 9 o'clock in the mornings, and hanging around the streets&mdash;or worse still attempting to thumb a lift home&mdash;until 7 o'clock or 8 o'clock on a winter's night.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is preparing to have free education and free transport for schoolgoing children, and I want to point out to him what the present system is.  If he is going to make an arrangement with CIE to supplement the existing service, that will not be good enough.  We are sick and tired of the present situation. People complain to us about the present system and ask us to have something done about it.  We can do nothing about it, but we hope the Minister can and will.  On one occasion I asked CIE to go from one road to another to pick up school children. Their answer was that they could not do that because there were already enough children on the first road and there would be too many children on the bus if they went to the other road. Therefore, those children had to cycle ten miles to school because CIE could not see their way to providing a bigger bus, or two buses where necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole question of transport is one which will have to be dealt with by the Minister in a better way than it is being dealt with at the present.  I do not know whether he has estimated the cost or what is likely to happen in the case of children who will have to travel to school.  I do not know whether he will review the existing system.  His predecessor decided not to build any more small schools, but to build bigger ones, and children will have to travel from one end of the parish to another to attend school.  I know that the present arrangements are chaotic.  I am not blaming the Minister for this, and possibly not even his predecessor, because it takes <Col N="2003" /> years to build these things up, and takes longer to break them down.  The Minister should have the fullest information about all these things before he makes a statement such as the statement he made in this White Paper.</P>
    <P>I should be interested to know what the Minister proposes to do in regard to university scholarships.  At present the system is based on the amount of money made available for secondary scholarships.  If secondary scholarships no longer exist, will a new basis be established?  Will there be free university <Col N="2004" /> education for those who seek it, and if there is, will there be some type of test which will guarantee that they will be accepted in the university, or will we have a situation such as exists at present where there is not sufficient accommodation in the universities? Will the test be so stiff as to keep out those who would like to have a university education?</P>
    <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>
