      <P>Ireland in company with several other member states of the Council of Europe has not so far signed <Col N="2" /> either the European Agreement on Regulations governing the movement of persons between Member States of the Council of Europe or the European Agreement on the Abolition of Visas for Refugees.</P>
      <P>As far as the Convention on Establishment is concerned, the question is under active consideration and it is hoped to reach a decision at an early date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs whether it is proposed that Ireland will ratify the Council of Europe Conventions on (1) disabled appliances and (2) exchange of blood reagents.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Consideration of this country's signature of the Council of Europe Agreement on the issue to Military and Civilian War-Disabled of an International Book of Vouchers for <Col N="3" /> the repair of Prosthetic and Orthopaedic Appliances is at an advanced stage and it is hoped that a decision will be reached at an early date.</P>
      <P>The question of this country's ratification of the European Agreement on the exchanges of blood-grouping reagents is also under active consideration and a decision will be made as soon as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs why Ireland has not ratified the Council of Europe Conventions on (1) extradition, (2) legal assistance and (3) commercial arbitration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not possible for Ireland to ratify the Convention on Extradition until domestic legislation was brought into line with its provisions. This was done by the passing of the Extradition Act, 1965.  The question of signature and ratification of the Convention has since been under consideration and a decision will not be long delayed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of ratifying the Council of Europe Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters has been under consideration for some time and it seems likely that legislation will first be required to enable the Government to carry out its provisions.  It is felt that, in the preparation of such legislation, account should be taken not only of the matters dealt with in the Convention but also the whole field of mutual assistance in proceedings <Col N="4" /> whether criminal or civil.  This will, of course, take some time and I am not in a position to say when the Government will be able to ratify the Convention.</P>
    <P>The European Convention providing a Uniform Law on Arbitration was opened for signature at Strasbourg less than a month ago.  It has been signed on behalf of one country only and has not yet been ratified by any.  It is hoped that this Convention will be signed on behalf of Ireland in the near future.  However, before it can be ratified it will be necessary to have legislation passed and, therefore, I am not in a position to indicate when ratification will take place.</P>

      <P>As the answer to the first part of the question consists of a long list of States, I propose, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to have it included in the Official Report.</P>
      <P>The answer to the second part of the question is that in considering recognition of States the Government act in accordance with the generally recognised principles of international law and having regard to the circumstances in each case.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposed extensions to Dublin Port involving a total estimated expenditure of £2½ million will be selfsupporting and financed by the Port and Docks Board from their own resources without any assistance from <Col N="8" /> the State.  The extensions are intended to meet the requirements of new and expanding trade as envisaged in the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i>.  I am satisfied that the Dublin Port and Docks Board have had regard to the criteria set out in the Second Economic Programme in drawing up their proposals.</P>

Secondly, does paragraph 47 of chapter 9 not say that extensions should not be undertaken merely by way of providing general facilities in the hope of attracting new and unspecified business?

      <P>It is anticipated that the port requirements of Dublin, on the basis of growing trade, will include the proposed extensions and improvements. The cost of the scheme is not £4 million.  The cost of the scheme for the coming year will be some £650,000; next year, it will be £650,000 also &mdash; all of which is being met from the finances of the Dublin Port and Docks Board.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 12, 13, 14 and 15 together.  The B &amp; I Board notified me beforehand of their intention to increase freight rates and of their reasons for doing so.</P>
      <P>The company's losses for 1965 are estimated at £51,000 and are due principally to increased labour costs, mainly for sea-going personnel and for dockers in Britain, and to reduced receipts for cattle exports in 1965.  I am satisfied that the increases in rates are fully justified by commercial considerations and I have, therefore, reaffirmed to the board my original directive that they should conduct the affairs of the company on strictly commercial lines.  Deputies will remember that the agreement of Coast Lines Ltd. to the sale of the B &amp; I was subject to the firm assurance given to them in writing on behalf of the Government that the company would be managed on strictly commercial lines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Details of the traffic carried by individual shipping companies are normally treated as confidential for commercial reasons.  This consideration does not have practical importance in present conditions in relation <Col N="10" /> to cattle exports and I can, therefore, tell the Deputy that the numbers of cattle exported by the B &amp; I in 1964 and 1965 were 210,919 and 145,042 respectively.</P>
    <P>There is no statutory authority by which direct control could be exercied over the cross-Channel freight rates charged by British Railways or other shipping companies nor would it be feasible to exercise such control on a unilateral basis.</P>
    <P>I may say that the B &amp; I Board were informed beforehand by British Railways of their intention to increase rates and decided to limit the increases they themselves had in mind to the same level and to introduce them about the same time in order to avoid confusion for shippers particularly in the case of through-rated traffic to and from internal destinations in Britain.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the necessity for stability preached by the Government for the past few months and, furthermore, to prevent increasing the cost of living and the danger of pricing ourselves out of the export market, does the Minister think it desirable to allow this to happen at the present time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole question of prices control has been made absolutely clear by the Minister for Industry and Commerce and why it has been imposed on a wide variety of commodities.  If it is absolutely proved that the company will engage in a loss, it is quite inevitable that some of these prices will rise.  A great part of the increase in these rates is due to inflation in Great Britain and to the very great increases in dock charges for which we are not responsible. When, recently, I spoke on CIE, I made it clear that, although the Government would wish to survey the operations and to exercise some control over the costs of all State companies, there was little we could do in regard to international charges imposed by State companies.  The B &amp; I have to act as a commercial company and it earns foreign-based sterling, like other companies.  Foreign goods imported here and goods now transported in <Col N="11" /> England also bear increased charges. If there are increased charges on the railways in Britain, the degree to which this imposes additional charges on our customers is limited by charges that have already taken place in Great Britain and which affect our competitors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>We may expect this year the export of the same, or a greater, number of cattle as last year. That would mean that the company would carry perhaps an additional 60,000 or 70,000 cattle within the next six or eight months.  Would that not affect the losses?  Furthermore, if this continues, we shall surely be consumed by the flames of inflation which the Minister speaks so much about at times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>It is anticipated that there will be an increase in cattle exports which I hope will favourably affect the position of the company.  The B &amp; I needs to earn a very considerable surplus in order to be a fully commercial organisation.  The Deputy need not have any fear in his mind that there will be an excess or surplus in the current year.</P>

      <P>As regards the second part of the question, the net amounts received from the issue of these bonds is used in full by the corporation to finance loans to agriculture.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that the closing of the Public Office of the Valuation Office each day from 12.30 p.m. to 2 p.m., like the closing of business and other premises for the lunch-break, may cause some inconvenience, though no complaint has heretofore been received in regard to the Valuation Office.  The lunch-time closing period was deliberately introduced because the limited service given to callers during those hours did not justify the staff time involved.  I do not consider that any modification of existing arrangements is warranted.</P>

    <P>NOTES:</P>
    <P>1.  The Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1927, became law on 20th May, 1927.  It is not possible to give the actual number of licences in force on that date.  The number of licences issued during the year ended 31st March, 1927, is the best available indication as to the number in force at the passing of the Act.</P>
    <P>2.  Particulars of the number of licences in force on the 1st January, 1966, would be misleading as in an appreciable number of cases the process of annual renewal would not have been completed by that date.  Accordingly, figures in respect of licences issued in the year ended 31st March, 1965, have been given.</P>
    <P>3.  Separate figures are not available in respect of all premises described as hotels which are licensed for the sale of Intoxicating Liquor.  However, there were 482 hotel premises licensed on the 1st January, 1966, for which the licences were granted under the provisions of the Licensing (Ireland) Act, 1902.  No corresponding figure for the year 1927 is available.</P>
    <P>4.  The expression &ldquo;sweets&rdquo; means any liquor which is made from fruit and sugar, or from fruit or sugar mixed with any other material, and which has undergone a process of fermentation in the manufacture thereof, e.g. home-made wines.</P>

      <P>I am informed by Dublin Corporation that under an Agreement made in 1936 with the Pembroke Estate the corporation are responsible for the maintenance of the sea wall adjoining Sandymount Strand, and that they hold a licence in perpetuity to use a strip of foreshore alongside the wall for the purpose of maintenance and repair of the wall.</P>

    <P>As regards the causeway from Strand Road to the Roadstone site, <Col N="23" /> I have been informed by Dublin Corporation that no details of this causeway were included in the plans lodged with them in connection with the application by Roadstone Ltd. for an outline planning permission for the construction of the concrete mixing plant or in the detailed plans later lodged with the firm's application for approval in respect of the plant.  Permission for the construction of this causeway was not given by me.</P>
    <P>The corporation's decision to grant approval for the detailed plans of the plant was made on 10th of this month. It was decided to grant approval subject to conditions requiring the removal of the entire plant prior to 1st January, 1971, and that direct access from Beach Road be closed off prior to the same date.

Certain matters arising from the Authority's proposals are being examined by my Department.</P>
      <P>The reduction in the number of pharmacists will be more than offset by the additional time which the new appointees will devote to the work.

      <P>The School Attendance Act, 1926 places an obligation on the parents of all children between the ages of six and 14 years to cause their children to attend a national or other suitable school unless there is a reasonable excuse for not so doing.

      <P>The recent decision of the Senate of the University in regard to changes in its matriculation requirements as announced publicly and as conveyed to my Department was as follows:</P>
      <P>(1) In 1967 for purposes of obtaining matriculation on the results of the Leaving Certificate examination, a candidate must, in addition to complying with other conditions, have obtained honours at that examination in at least one subject of the matriculation programme.  As from 1968, honours in at least two such subjects will be required.  (2) As from 1967 inclusive a combination of Leaving Certificate and Matriculation passes will not be accepted for matriculation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I will go along with the amendment on this.  As the section <Col N="75" /> stood, it was defective because if a dog, for example, were on the property of another owner, then the regulations could not apply to it.  It could apply only if it were on the public road.  The trouble arises in respect of a dog worrying sheep, not on a public road, but on somebody else's land.  I agree to that extent that the amendment is an improvement but I do not think that when being amended, it should have been amended to prescribe and regulate the wearing of collars by dogs while on the property of their owners and cut out the reference to a public place.  It is ridiculous to provide in a statute that the Minister can make an order that a dog in the front garden of a house in Anglesea Road must have a collar. That is bringing this Bill into disrepute.</P>
      <P>I will go all the way with the Minister in providing that the statute will have the power that I think the Parliamentary Secretary wants it to have. I do not think he wants to provide that a collie which is handling sheep on the owner's land must have a collar. I do not think he intends to do that but the Bill permits that.  That is not what it should be doing.  It should be providing that if a dog goes off his owner's land to a public place or on to somebody else's land, then it must have a collar.  I think that is what the Parliamentary Secretary intends.  If he can give an assurance that it will be dealt with in that way, administratively, then I will be quite happy.</P>

    <P>It was stated in the Seanad that the wearing of a collar may adversely affect certain dogs, in relation to its appearance.  It was also pointed out that there are types of dogs on which the keeping of a collar would be impossible. They have a type of thick neck, off which the collar could be removed over, maybe, a smaller head. It was decided to accept an amendment covering the inscribing or the placing of the name on a harness by way of an alternative to the collar.

      <P>Can the Minister tell me whether there is any provision in the Bill or the regulations permitting, at the option of the owner, some type of tattoo name in the ear, because I can visualise some difficulties.  Take, for example, a pack of hounds: if you let them out with collars on, some of them would get caught in a fence.  If you take a water shooting dog, it is really dangerous to put such a dog into a river with a collar because it is quite on the cards that if there is a bit of an old tree or something in the water, the dog will get a prong of the branch of the tree between his neck and the collar and will drown.  There are certain circumstances in which it is dangerous to let a dog out with a collar from the point of view of the user of the dog.  I should like to know how that is dealt with.  In those cases I think it could be met very easily by the name being tattooed on the ear, at the option of the owner.</P>

I think it necessary to make this clear because, since the debates in the Seanad, it has been brought to my attention that there is some confusion as to which is which, and whether one is identical with the other.  Both here and in the Seanad, I was asked whether it would be possible to indicate the number of these coins being ordered.  I understand now that I am free to give this information to the Dáil.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Dr. Hillery)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>The existing law relating to patents for inventions is contained in the Industrial and Commercial Property (Protection) Act, 1927, which will be replaced by the Patents Act, 1964, when that Act comes into force.</P>
      <P>Section 55 (1) of the 1927 Act precludes protection of chemical products or substances intended for food and medicine, except when those products or substances are produced by the processes described in the complete specification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, section 55 (1)  contains a proviso that in an action for infringement any substance of the same chemical composition as that to which the patent concerned in the action relates shall, in the absence of proof to the contrary, be deemed to have been produced by the patented process. Accordingly, where the patentee can show that the alleged infringer's substance is of the same chemical composition as the substance to which his patent relates the onus rests on the alleged infringer to prove that his substance <Col N="80" /> was produced by a process other than that claimed in the complete specification of the patent.</P>
    <P>The 1964 Act will improve the position of inventors of chemical products or substances intended for food or medicine by extending the protection to the product or substance.  Further, by means of a transitional provision an application relating to a chemical invention which is not accepted before the commencement of the Act will proceed under the more liberal provisions of the new Act.</P>
    <P>The new Act does not, however, provide for the continuation in force of the proviso to section 55 (1) of the 1927 Act which puts the onus of proof on the alleged infringer of the patent.  This means that in an action for infringement of the patent granted under the 1927 Acts, the burden of proof as to the process by which a substance is manufactured may rest on the patentee.  The manufacturing interests concerned claim this would present an almost impossible task because of the inherent difficulty of proving what is done within an alleged infringer's factory.</P>
    <P>The Pharmaceutical and Allied Industries Adaptation Association has expressed apprehension because of the repeal of the proviso to section 55 (1) of the 1927 Act.  There were no representations on the matter when the Patents Bill, 1963, came before the Oireachtas and there is no record of the proviso ever having been invoked since the 1927 Act was enacted, because of the difficulty of proving what is done within the alleged infringer's factory&mdash;the process used to produce the substance.  The Association, however, regard the proviso as having a deterrent value, and fear that if it is not retained in the 1964 legislation in respect of the existing patents the protection afforded will be seriously diminished and their prospects of expansion adversely affected.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the industry has cause to be apprehensive about the position&mdash;and that the amendment of the Act aimed at continuing the presumptives clause in force should be made.  I recommend the principle of the Bill for the approval of the Dáil.</P>

      <P>We do not oppose the Bill.  The reasons given by the Minister for bringing it here are fair and acceptable.  If there are fears on the part of patentees, then it is wise those fears should be allayed and that we should revert to the provisions of the 1964 Act.  There is one point I should like to emphasise.  This is a change and it should be remembered that most patents are sought here by people from abroad.  Of necessity, that is true today because each product we use is one which is in use not in one other country but in perhaps ten others. In the case of food products, patents are required and patentees will find that the requirements are the same abroad.  This means that an intervening period is required during which the Association of Registered Patent Agents can notify their clients abroad, if this should become necessary.  That is really the only point I wish to make on the Bill.  It is an ordinary machinery measure asked for by a section of trade and it is proper it should be given.</P>

I naturally know more about my own constituency than any other part of the country, although I am aware of the fact that houses are not being built anywhere, or, if they are, they are long overdue because these schemes come to fruition only after many months of delay.</P>
      <P>Last week I questioned the Minister in regard to the French's Field scheme in Gorey.  It is about five or six years since this scheme was first brought in by the local authority.  To my knowledge, no houses have been built in Gorey since 1952.  I should know because I live adjacent to the town.  About four or five years ago, two salaried people in Gorey came to me and told me they were living in lodgings but had been endeavouring to get a house.  They felt they could not go on much longer unless I could give them some guarantee that a house would be built.  I then became actively concerned with this scheme.  That was about four years ago.  It is about three years since the two salaried people emigrated because their wives objected to living in rooms or in socalled flats in which no modern facilities whatever were available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="83" /> I have questioned the Minister on the subject of the French's Field houses about four or five times in the Dáil.  This scheme was sent to the Minister long ago.  About 18 months ago I was told by the officials in the Department&mdash;who nowadays are not able to tell one anything without consultation with the Minister because of the unhappy state of the country's finances&mdash;that they are under consideration on some small technical point, that the matter could be rapidly cleared and that in the meantime there was no reason why they should not issue a tender.  I returned to the local authority and told them that.  The local authority issued a tender last August. It went up to the Minister's Department and there has been no reply yet in relation to it as to whether anything should be amended or whether anything was not in order.  The reply simply is that the matter is being considered. The large group of civil servants in the Minister's Department always worked well to get these schemes through, did their best to hurry up schemes and were always at the disposal of Deputies when they went in to question any delay or anything like that.  But nobody in the Department can give me any indication as to what the delay is in this case. Naturally, I do not want to embarrass them.  They are employed directly by the Minister, who is in control of the Department.</P>
    <P>The fact remains that this matter is in the Minister's office and no answer has been given on it.  I asked the Minister on three occasions if sanction would be given.  It is the same with schemes all over the country.  They are sent up to the Department and stay there.  No reason whatever is given. Any Deputy who goes to his local authority&mdash;I am not a member of my local authority but I go there&mdash;and asks them what the delay is, is told the documents are in the Department and no sanction has been received.  Of course, the standard reply of the Minister is that the matter is under consideration. If one asks politely what the cause is, if there is any technical hitch, there is really no answer at all.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="84" /> The Minister refers to delays, to his predecessor and suggests that housing is a matter that requires consideration. But there is no definite reply as to the cause of the delay, when everybody in the country knows this Government has not a penny to spend on anything.  If the Minister were to say to a Deputy concerned about a housing scheme that there was no money, he would not be disclosing any State secrets because everybody knows they have no money. At least if the Minister said that straight out, that this Government are broke and have to wait until the Budget&mdash;which they are bringing in two months in advance to try to collect a few pounds to meet their commitments&mdash;or until the Germans &ldquo;cough up&rdquo; the £7 million they are borrowing from them, and therefore, could not build any houses, one would know exactly where one stood.</P>
    <P>The Minister must know that there are people in the towns of Gorey, Enniscorthy, New Ross and Wexford who are waiting for his sanction to have a house.  There are people with families of two or three children living in discomfort in lodgings waiting for some sort of light from the Minister as to whether these schemes will be implemented or not.  There is no answer.  It would be much fairer for the Minister to tell the Deputies concerned: &ldquo;We are broke.  As a result of our policies in the country, the money has not gone as far as we anticipated, but we hope to start at some distant or near date.&rdquo;  Let us hope it will be a near date&mdash;maybe after 9th March, when the new Budget comes.</P>
    <P>It is in the national interest that the Minister should give some indication as to what future policy is. Building has come to a standstill everywhere.  Every scheme is being held up.  The Government are probably the biggest employers of labour at present.  The skilled hands are emigrating. When this money does become effective&mdash;if it ever does, if it is not already spent, if it is not a question of new money coming in just to balance the books and that we do not go bankrupt altogether&mdash;we would be <Col N="85" /> very glad to hear it from the Minister.</P>
    <P>I said before the Minister came in that he was becoming adept at dodging the issue with regard to the Parliamentary questions in relation to housing. I admit that from his point of view he is placed in a very unpleasant position.  He is the Minister responsible for the conduct of housing policy. It is crystal-clear to everybody, even to some of my Fianna Fáil colleagues, that you cannot conduct a housing policy unless you have some money with which to conduct it.  The next time I put down a question&mdash;as I very soon intend to do and the same goes for some of my colleagues&mdash;asking that these houses will be built, it will be only fair if the Minister, in his reply, will give some indication of the position. We know it to be disastrous but I think it is necessary that this Dáil and, through this Dáil, the nation should be taken into the confidence of the Minister as far as housing goes and that we should know the position that will obtain in the future.</P>
    <P>Housing is a personal matter.  It is not a question of scoring a political point.  It is a question of trying to provide what it is the duty of the State to provide under modern conditions, that is, housing for people who are not able to afford to build houses for themselves or who are not able to afford to buy houses.</P>
    <P>There is another situation in regard to housing, too.  On two occasions recently, cases of labourers' cottages have gone up for sanction to the Department of Local Government.  I understand the position to be that when they are building such cottages there is a loan concerned with them which is sought by the local authority but they must have the sanction of and a guarantee from the Minister for Local Government.  Of course, that is not forthcoming, either.  There may be some difficulties involved in the Minister for Local Government giving a guarantee to anybody because, in order to do so, one must be fully solvent oneself.  It does not seem to me that there is any degree of solvency whatsoever in relation to the finances of the Department of Local Government <Col N="86" /> so it is probably for that reason that all buildings of labourers' cottages is held up, too.</P>
    <P>That brings me again to the point I mentioned&mdash;the question of emigration. If money is available to build a cottage, if it is sanctioned ultimately and finally by the devious routes through which it has to go, the position then very often obtains that there is nobody left to build it.  If there is no local employment in the building trade, due to the terrific credit restrictions that obtain in the country at the moment, no building can be done and the people concerned with building emigrate.  Therefore, we are rearing our youth and our skilled people to let them go over to deal with the difficult building situation in which other countries find themselves.</P>
    <P>Every country in the free world at the moment is trying to build as much as possible, and there are extensive building demands together with demands for a better standard of living, higher wages and so on.  A great number of our people have gone to Britain and are likely to stay there.  When they go there, skilled workers that they are, they can get a roof over their heads, which is something they cannot get here and that helps to keep them there.</P>
    <P>Therefore, if the Minister gets the money on March 9th next, if it is not entirely absorbed in paying the debts of this Government and if there is any balance over and the Minister wishes to augment a building scheme to make up for the defects of the past, he will probably find himself without any personnel to do the building.  I do not suppose that in the history of this State there has ever been such a backlog of building as there is at present.  It is quite obvious that legislation in itself is insufficient to enable local authorities to build houses or to meet their requirements if new factories are being set up in, say, a rural area.  Practically the first question any industrialist will ask any Deputy who may be concerned with trying to bring a factory to his constituency is whether housing accommodation is available locally. We have had legislation here whereby it is possible for local authorities to <Col N="87" /> make houses available under special conditions.  I understand that special money is available to augment such building in the event of a factory coming to an area.  However, what is the use of legislation when there is no money to implement it?</P>
    <P>The whole story of housing here is that there is no money with which to build houses.  If labourers are waiting for cottages, ordinary workers are waiting for building schemes to be implemented.  Civil servants are subject to a good deal of criticism in a democratic State&mdash;they always are subject to criticism&mdash;and are being blamed for delays which are of direct political origin: there is no other reason for the delays but the political conditions that prevail in this country at the moment.</P>
    <P>I can see no hope or future for housing here unless the Government will create a situation of financial stability whereby houses can be built. I wish very particularly to refer to the terms of the pending loan or loans that the Government are making as far as the matter concerns housing.  The House will appreciate that most of the housing in this country is done by virtue of loan.  Therefore, the rate of interest is entirely in relation to the rate of repayment of loan that the occupier of the house has got to pay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I have been told.  I am trying to draw a parallel in relation to dear money. If money is borrowed from people at <Col N="88" /> a high rate of interest and is re-lent to local authorities for the purpose of house building, the housing charges will be dearer than heretofore.  The repayments will be higher.  In fact, the whole housing situation will become uneconomic because of dear money. The Minister is not responsible for that matter but he should take the point into consideration that, if he implements housing schemes at a very much later date than was originally intended, they will now cost a great deal more money than they would have cost, due to increased wages, increased charges, increases in the price for the land, increased money due for the servicing of such loan.</P>
      <P>It stands to reason that if a Government borrow money at 7 per cent and the local authority want that money for housing they must pay a certain percentage more than that to service the loan and cover the loan charges. Therefore, not only have this Government not built houses as a result of their policy but, when they build them, they will be dearer houses with bigger repayments than heretofore&mdash;that is, if they ever do build the houses.  That is the unhappy and unsatisfactory record of this Government and of this Dáil which is only a year in existence and that is what the country has to look forward to as far as housing policy is concerned.  The Minister should go to his colleague, the Minister for Finance, to get more money to subsidise these houses so that they may be available at a more economic rent.  If you start to peddle with money, you have to protect the weaker sections of the community. I want to know from the Minister if it is his intention to protect the public generally against high loan charges.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem of housing is now so great that it is not possible for the Minister for Local Government adequately to cope with the serious situation that faces the people in regard to it.  The only way the problem can properly be dealt with is by including a Minister for Housing in the Cabinet, a Minister whose sole concern it will be to see to it that effective steps are taken to ensure that, <Col N="89" /> instead of sliding back, as we are at present, we will overcome this very serious problem very rapidly.</P>
      <P>We know that in Dublin alone there are approximately 10,000 families on the waiting list for housing.  The situation at present is that the corporation are trying to deal with families of eight persons living in one room.  The pendulum is swinging back and forth. Some four or five weeks ago the corporation were, in fact, housing families of five persons living in one room.  The elected representatives on the corporation have been informed early this week that the situation now is that the corporation are trying to deal with families of eight persons living in one room. This is nearly three years after the very serious situation in Dublin was highlighted by the collapse of houses in Fenian Street with consequent unfortunate loss of life.  I speak with particular reference to Dublin but it is well known and generally accepted that the situation outside Dublin is no better.</P>
      <P>We have a Minister for Local Government who, apart from the very serious and complicated business of providing houses, is responsible for many other activities.  He is responsible for roads, sewerage, planning and has all sorts of commitments.  We feel that the housing situation which affects the lives of so many of our people justifies the appointment of a Minister whose sole function would be to see that the people were properly housed.</P>
      <P>One of the greatest difficulties that local authorities and private builders face with regard to the provision of houses is the speculation in land that is allowed to continue.  Land on the perimeter of Dublin that was bought ten to 15 years ago for a few thousand pounds can now command fantastic prices because there are people who are willing to take advantage of the need of the community in general and the Minister, who is well aware of the situation, does absolutely nothing about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been no effective action even suggested by the Minister for Local Government or any of his colleagues to deal with one of the basic problems facing a large number <Col N="90" /> of people who are trying to provide their own homes.  In order to be even in the running for a house built by a private contractor it is necessary to have an initial deposit of £500 to £600.  This deposit is demanded from people who are starting out in life and who anticipate that they will be rearing families within a few years. Apart from finding the deposit of £500 to £600, they have to furnish at least to some extent the new homes that they have acquired at tremendous personal sacrifice.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that the Minister would examine the situation in relation to the very large deposits that are demanded and see if some financial assistance could be afforded to persons who are endeavouring to buy their own homes, ensuring, at the same time, that the builder cannot increase the price by the extent of the Minister's financial assistance.</P>
    <P>It has been stated here repeatedly that this is not the best time to ask any Minister to spend money because the facts are that the Minister has not got it but it should be borne in mind that we cannot go on like this indefinitely and that money must be available at some time.  When money is available, this would be one very serious aspect of the housing problem that the Minister could possibly consider.</P>
    <P>I asked the Minister today by way of Parliamentary Question as to the reason for the delay in the production of houses being built through the National Building Agency for Dublin Corporation.  I have a very definite personal interest in the scheme in Ballymun.  As a member of Dublin Corporation, I attended all the discussions and conferences that took place between the Minister and that authority.  Quite frankly, at the time, I agreed with the Minister that the only possible way to overcome the very serious problem existing in Dublin was by some departure from traditional building and I supported, against very heavy opposition from many sections, the plan in relation to Ballymun but I did so on the assurance that was given by the Minister, the guarantee that was given by the Minister, that these houses <Col N="91" /> would be available to the corporation for letting not later than July, 1965. That is seven months ago.  So far the corporation have not had any houses from the Minister or from the National Building Agency.  I do not think it is enough for the Minister to come into the House and say this is entirely due to weather conditions.  The weather is no worse in Ballymun than in any other building site in this city.  There have been continuous completions of houses by other contractors.  These houses have been made available to the corporation for letting but not one house or flat has emerged as yet from the Ballymun scheme.  The Minister, I think, owes the people of this city a far more satisfactory explanation in relation to this than he gave today in reply to a Parliamentary question.</P>
    <P>It is necessary in this context to refer to the restriction moneywise on credit for housing, both private and municipal. We know that many local authorities find themselves unable to plan and unable to proceed with houses, houses vitally needed by those people normally catered for, and the Minister and his Department have been anything but helpful in this respect.  The situation with regard to housing is far too serious for any Party to play politics with it.  If the Minister finds there is no money available, he should clearly say so to the local authorities and to the people who are dependent on supplementary grants, loans from local authorities, etc.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister is aware that people qualified for loans and grants have committed themselves financially in many ways in anticipation of the local authority and the Minister living up to the implied promise that, provided they had the qualifications, they would automatically get loans or grants.  Not too long since many of these people found themselves well fitted and with all the qualifications but with no certainty that they would get a loan or grant since the corporation did not know whether they would have the money. That situation arose because the Minister chose to play party politics and would not state definitely what the <Col N="92" /> situation was from the point of view of the availability of money for SDA houses.  It is only right, and people are entitled to expect, that a situation which can affect them to a very large degree should be clearly stated.  I would ask the Minister now, if that situation still exists, or if it arises again at any time in the future, at least to inform the people and the local authorities in a forthright manner as to what exactly the situation is.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of which I am sure the Minister is aware from the point of view of a slowing down in building.  If there is a slowing down, we will undoubtedly lose a great many people in the building trade.  Building operatives are not the most fortunate in the country.  They are affected by many things: by weather, by wet time, by seasonal fluctuations.  If they become unemployed, and cannot find employment here, they have no alternative other than to go and find employment elsewhere.  We know from past experience that if they are forced to take the boat, they will find there is continuity of employment elsewhere and a certain amount of security for themselves and their families.  They are not likely to be induced back to this country.  If we allow a slowing down in building, we will face a very serious situation from the point of view of the availability of skilled craftsmen when we again arrive at the position in which money is available to go on building.  I do not want to detain the House but I suggest the problem is one of such magnitude it clearly indicates the necessity for a Minister for Housing to deal solely with housing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cluskey's statement that there has been a continuous completion of housing schemes since last July is correct.  That applies not only in Dublin but all over the country.  Side by side with that, even if there is a credit squeeze, there has been no great slowing up in private house building.  Over the past three years we had a situation in which the housing drive was such that work was held up owing to sufficient labour not being available.  Our main difficulty in <Col N="93" /> Donegal was in getting contractors to tender for schemes we had advertised. Even though there is this credit squeeze, the slowing down in house building is not as great as one would expect.  That is especially true of the private sector in which it is difficult even at the present time to get a full complement of skilled labour for some of the work that has to be done.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether Deputy Esmonde's views represent Fine Gael policy but I think his speech will do a good deal of damage.  His speech, containing such expressions as &ldquo;not a penny to spend on anything; building has come to a standstill&rdquo; can only do harm.  These statements are not correct and Deputy Esmonde should know that.  He admits he is not a member of a local authority but, nevertheless, he should be properly informed.</P>
      <P>There is no delay in Donegal as far as private building is concerned in the payment of departmental grants and very little in the payment of supplementary grants.  I hope the statements made by Deputy Esmonde are not made on behalf of the Fine Gael Party.  They could be very damaging to the economy.  We know money is scarce but the Minister is to be congratulated on making the best possible use of the moneys available to him and ensuring that proper use is made of them and that those concerned are getting the best value for them.  I hope that will continue.  As a member of a local authority, I find that the money is being spread evenly over a period&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point is that planning is not being held up.  The councils are being told to continue with planning and the purchase of sites.  This is something which caused a great deal of harm in 1956-57, when a complete stop in planning took place with the result that it took some time after the credit <Col N="94" /> squeeze was over to get the machinery moving again.  Despite this credit squeeze, the Minister is to be congratulated on keeping an even balance in the output of housing and also keeping in mind the needs of the future and planning for that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatHogan" hpid="Mr. P. Hogan (South Tipperary) Mr. P. Hogan (South Tipperary)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>South Tipperary</i>): If the Minister is to be congratulated on anything, it is on his technical ability to dodge Parliamentary questions. Over the past few months, I have, under pressure from my own local authority and from individuals, put down Parliamentary question after Parliamentary question, No. 1, to try to get some information as to what is likely to happen as regards sanctioning of various projects and various loans and, No. 2, in the hope of prodding the Minister into taking some action in the matter.  In this matter let me say at once that one cannot blame an individual Minister specifically.  He is merely a member of a Government. The blame lies fairly and squarely on the members of the Cabinet in their capacity as a Government.  On 25th January last, I put down a question to the Minister:</P>
      <P>... if he will now sanction the loan of £116,000 to Carrick-on-Suir Urban Council, Co. Tipperary, for the erection of 52 houses at St. John's Road, Carrick-on-Suir, for which application was made on 24th August 1965 and the tender for which has been accepted and approved by him, as the contractor is anxious and willing to commence the work and in view of the hardship and additional cost involved in further delay.</P>
      <P>This request was made to me by the Carrick-on-Suir Urban Council.  The Minister's reply was:</P>
      <P>I am not yet in a position to say when this loan will be sanctioned but I hope that it will be possible to give a decision in the near future.</P>
      <P>On the 14th December last I put down another question to the Minister:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>... when the remaining £60,000 of the £120,000 loan for the building of rural cottages by Tipperary South Riding County Council, which was <Col N="95" /> applied for on 15th June, 1965 will be sanctioned; and if he is aware that building at the rate of one house per year in some recent years has now made the local authority housing position rather serious.</P>
    <P>The Minister's reply was as follows:</P>
    <P>The loan of £60,000 already sanctioned is, I understand, sufficient to meet immediate requirements in respect of approved works.  Tender proposals in respect of twelve additional cottages are under examination in my Department.  I am not in a position to say when an additional amount of loan is likely to be sanctioned.</P>
    <P>Building has not been at the low rate mentioned by the Deputy since 1959.  The average number of cottages completed each year by the council in the five years ended on 31st March last was 24.  So far this year, they have completed 22 and have work in progress on 41 cottages.</P>
    <P>The years I mentioned in which only one cottage was built by South Tipperary County Council were the years 1959 and 1960.  In both of those years, in a fairly wealthy county where there are nearly 4,000 cottages, one was built in 1959 and one in 1960.  Again, on the same date I asked the Minister another question:</P>
    <P>... if he will state in respect of the £11,200 loan for which Clonmel Corporation is awaiting sanction (a) when the application for sanction was made and (b) the nature and extent of the projects envisaged.</P>
    <P>The Minister's reply was:</P>
    <P>(a) Application for sanction was made on 3rd November, 1965; (b) the loan is for the provision of water and sewerage extensions to housing schemes at Gortmalogue and Jackson's Cross.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether or not that loan has even been sanctioned.  Again, dealing with individual cases, I put down a question to the Minister on the 4th November, last:</P>
    <P>.... why clearance has not been given to Tipperary (South Riding) <Col N="96" /> County Council regarding 20 compulsory purchase orders, as the final date for objection to such orders appears to have expired since 22nd September, 1965 and most of those concerned are in urgent need of rehousing.</P>
    <P>The Minister's reply reads:</P>
    <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to the Tipperary South Riding Compulsory Purchase (Labourers Acts) No. 3 Order, 1965, under which the county council propose to acquire 13 plots for the erection of a total of 20 cottages.  The latest date for the making of objections to this order was 28th September, 1965.</P>
    <P>As an objection to the order has been received as respects one plot, it is necessary to hold a public local inquiry into this objection.  The inquiry will be held on 7th December, 1965.</P>
    <P>The order, in so far as the other 12 sites are concerned, is under consideration and a decision in the matter will be conveyed to the council as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>On the 27th October last I put down a question to the Minister:</P>
    <P>.... whether loan permission has been granted to any other local authority since the date it was refused to Cashel Local Authority.</P>
    <P>The Minister's reply reads:</P>
    <P>The Deputy's suggestion that a loan has been refused to Cashel Urban District Council is incorrect. The remainder of the question does not, therefore, arise.</P>
    <P>The fact of the matter is that for years we have been attempting to build a few houses in Cashel.  Having got everything ready and the contractor having been appointed, we now find that the loan is being held up by the Minister.  We are told repeatedly in this House that this is standard practice; local bodies have been told they must not proceed until sanction for the loan has been given.  We know also that this regulation is now being enforced all over the country.</P>
    <P>On 17th November last I asked the <Col N="97" /> Minister when the loan for £22,800 would be made available to Cashel Urban Council.  The Minister's reply was: &ldquo;...I am not in a position to say at this stage when the loan is likely to be approved.&rdquo;  A series of other questions dealing with loans in general, and particularly with our local water supply, all received the same type of reply: the Minister was not in a position to state when the loan would be made available.  At no stage has there been a positive answer stating: &ldquo;We have not the money and, therefore, we cannot give it to you.&rdquo;  The loan has always been rejected on one pretext or another.  As other Deputies said, it would be far more honest if the Government said: &ldquo;The money is not there.  Do not torment us with these questions.  When we have the money we shall give it to you.&rdquo;  On one pretext or another these schemes have been held up by the Minister for Local Government in an effort to stop building being carried out because they have no money at present.</P>
    <P>I have here an OECD Observer Report for November, 1965, which gives some tables which compare our position with that of other countries. On page 26 there is a list of housing units completed per thousand of the population and I find that our position is the lowest in Europe with the exception of Turkey.  Austria has a figure of 5.9; Belgium, 6; Canada, 7.8; Denmark, 8.2; France, 7.6; Germany, 10.7; Greece, 7; Iceland, 7; Italy, 8.8; Netherlands, 8.4; Norway, 7.4; Portugal, 4.7; Spain, 8.2; Sweden, 11.4; Switzerland, 9.7; United Kingdom, 7.2; Ireland, 3.2 and Turkey 2.  As we know, half the Turks are nomads and live in tents.  Our position is not one with which we can be particularly pleased.</P>
    <P>We have in Clonmel 91 condemned houses occupied.  That was the last figure given me by the Minister in answer to a Parliamentary question. We have an accepted figure of 181 in the case of the county council as in need of housing.  This accepted figure is based on the most rigid type of survey bearing no relationship to the type of assessment which we are now envisaging under the Housing Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="98" /> One's position had to be really desperate regarding housing in my constitutency before one was put on the list for rehousing.  There was certainly no generosity in interpreting housing requirements there nor probably anywhere else.  I believe the figure of housing needs is far in excess of the 181 mentioned for South Tipperary; we could pick up that number in a couple of our smaller towns.  Without going into statistics anybody who drives around the country and goes through our villages and compares them with what he has seen in villages elsewhere must appreciate that we have many substandard houses and that it will take many years to bring our housing up to a decent level.</P>
    <P>I deprecate the Government policy which deliberately set out to cut down on housing after the last election.  I realise the difficulty housing presents in connection with the balance of payments; I realise that the large amount of housebuilding that took place under the last Inter-Party Government may have helped to put them into economic difficulties and I also realise that the Government have panicked away from any danger of repeating that experience. Yet they have succeeded in getting into financial difficulties otherwise.</P>
    <P>One speaker mentioned the question of increased cost of building sites. That has been adverted to several times in the House and it is probably not peculiar to this country.  It is mentioned in reference to the position in Germany in the OECD Report on page 29.  I quote:</P>
    <P Just="Center">TOPICAL PROBLEMS:</P>
    <P Just="Center">PRICES OF CONSTRUCTION LAND.</P>
    <P>Land prices go up as a result of the disproportion between the supply of construction land, which only slowly becomes available, and the more rapidly increasing demand. In countries where private ownership, including private land property, is guaranteed by the Constitution, problems of land procurement will never be solved completely.</P>
    <P>All efforts made to suspend the principles of free development of <Col N="99" /> land prices have failed.  The price stop, valid in Germany since 1936 was circumvented in many ways.  In passing the Federal Construction Law in 1960, the lesson was drawn from this situation and the price stop annulled.  Since then the development of land prices clearly reflects the shortage.  It is the development of construction land prices on the outskirts of particularly attractive cities that proves the necessity of a balanced deployment of the population.  A planning law was passed this year after negotiations with the Länder and the communal organisations.</P>
    <P>This is the position in a highly organised and pretty well socialised country like the Federal Republic of Germany. It is clearly set out that they have tremendous difficulties in trying to control speculation in land for houses. It is all the more imperative that we here should take immediate steps to try to circumvent and control, in so far as it is controllable, excessive speculation in house-building sites.  It may indeed be that because of the small size of our population such speculation may be more controllable than in a complex society such as exists in the Federal Republic of Germany.  Nonetheless, the problem is a difficult one and I would particularly draw the Minister's attention to it.  I think he is pretty well acquainted with it already because apparently this problem has presented itself in every other country.</P>
    <P>Time and again in this House we have blamed the Minister for his failure to build houses and time again he has blamed the local councillors and when he gets tired of that, he blames the county managers.  Of course, the truth is that neither the county councillors nor the managers are to blame and the Minister is not specifically to blame.  The blame rests upon the Government as a body and upon Government policy which five or six years ago deliberately set out to cut down on the building of houses.  The notion was that it was not productive expenditure. After all, if you regard the human being as nothing more than a production <Col N="100" /> unit, then the man who is not properly housed and lives in a hovel can do as good a day's work as the man who is properly housed.  That was the hard economic policy pursued by the Government up to the present and we now find ourselves with a backlog of houses to be built.  What was a deliberate policy under the previous Government has now, because of the financial stringency, become an obligatory policy under the present Government. To a great extent we have squandered our resources and one may ask how has this position come about?</P>
    <P>A big factor, I believe, was the shameless method by which the Government squandered our resources in order to buy back the popularity which they lost when the turnover tax was introduced.  In 1964, we spent on wages and salaries £62 millions more than we spent on wages and salaries in 1963, and in 1965, we spent £87 millions on wages and salaries more than in 1963.  We did that because there was a by-election in 1964 and a general election in 1965.  That is the bill which we are now paying, in effect. The Government are great dispensers but in effect the recipients are no better off personally because the purchasing power of their money has gone down and the community is no better off because many of the improved social services which we hoped we might have been able to secure are not now available and housing happens to be one of them.  However, Fianna Fáil are in power and apparently that is all that matters.</P>

      <P>It is said that it is an ill wind that does not blow somebody good and I do not know whether the Fine Gael Party will succeed in getting out of this motion what they would like to get.  In the motion they deplore the decline in the number of houses built in recent years.  We had Deputy Hogan telling us that having won the second last general election, the Government immediately decided to cut down on their capital programme as it related to houses.  The Deputy did not go to the trouble of <Col N="101" /> finding out what the activities in relation to house building were over the past four or five years that have elapsed since the election in 1961. While the Fine Gael motion deals with the recent house building programme, they have made it a point to go back to the period from 1957 up to and including 1964.  Let us start from the year 1961 and see what has been the approach of the Government in relation to house building and what has been achieved as a result of their efforts.</P>
      <P>In 1961-62, there were 5,780 houses built and in every year since there has been a substantial increase in the number of houses built.  In 1962-63, there were 7,020 houses built; in 1963-64, there were 7,580; and in 1964-65, there were 9,430.  In the present financial year, it has been estimated that we will build 11,000 houses.  That in itself indicates that the purpose of the motion tabled by the Fine Gael Party was to gain some political support by making propaganda.  In this year we hope to build 11,000 houses and spend something over £20 million, a record figure.  Nevertheless we agree that the number of proposals and schemes before the Department are, for the first time, far in excess of the money available for this purpose.  It will be some information to people who try to suggest that the Government have no money that next year the house-building programme will benefit to the tune of an extra £1 million more than we spent in the present financial year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One is surprised at the attitude of the Labour Party to a motion such as this because it must be admitted that they are keener men on their job and they must know that housing activities in the past three or four years have increased, that the output of houses has been increased, and that therefore, there is no substance in the charge made by the Fine Gael Party that there has been a decline in the number of houses being provided through State aid.  Deputy Hogan informed us that he was requested by the local authority to table questions in order to try to get some information <Col N="102" /> regarding schemes as they affect his constituency.  I was a member of a local authority for a long time and I was a member in the dark old days when money was not available.  I never was requested by the local authority to raise a question in the Dáil and I doubt very much if the South Tipperary County Council asked Deputy Hogan to do so.  However, he was quite entitled to do it if he wanted to and if he wanted to let the people know how active he is in the Dáil.  We know the purpose that such questions serve.  As I said, he is quite entitled to raise the matter and more luck to him, but he should not do it on the pretext that he is doing it at the request of the South Tipperary County Council.</P>

      <P>Deputy Donegan set the ball rolling on behalf of the Fine Gael Party.  He had quite a lot of things to say in relation to the Housing Bill generally but he had a good word or two to say about the Minister.  He had something to say in relation to the activities of the NBA, the National Building Agency.  He made the point that the National Building Agency are now engaged in the provision of houses for industrialists, or, at least, for the executives of industries throughout the country.  It was a pity, he said, that the same could not be said for the ordinary man on the floor.  I am glad to inform Deputy Donegan and the House that in my own county, at any rate, the NBA have been very active in the past 12 or 18 months.  They have not alone provided houses for the executives and managers of a factory, but have also provided some 30-odd houses for what is called the ordinary man on the floor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same thing has happened in other parts of the country, such as Nenagh and one or two other areas in the country, so the NBA are extending their activities to cater for the small man who, if you like, is in a position to finance his own housing.  Deputy Donegan may not be aware of this.  I just thought I would mention it because it is something <Col N="103" /> I am very pleased about.  I am very pleased with their activities in my own county.  I have visited some of the sites in other parts of the country as well.</P>
    <P>Deputy Donegan had a general complaint to make about the non-payment of grants in relation to new houses and reconstruction.  The general impression he created was that all this was due to the fact that the Government had no money.  I would not be the one to deny that there may, in some cases, be a delay in the payment of housing grants but you will find, if you request the Deputy to give you details of a case which he has in mind, that when that case is investigated, there is some very legitimate reason for the delay.</P>
    <P>I will give an instance of what has happened in my own county in the past month or so.  A man carried out a reconstruction job on his house.  His wife and his aunt lived in the house and it was never known that the house was without some member of the family being present.  Unfortunately on the day the inspector called, all three were away burying a relative.  The inspector returned the file to the Department and said there was no person present.  Anything like that can cause a delay of three, four, or possibly five weeks.  Those are legitimate delays which take place in relation to the payment of housing grants.</P>
    <P>There were also other cases of an inspector calling and finding that the work was not completed.  He is compelled to go back a second time to find out if the work has been completed. Otherwise the job would not be half-completed. An applicant would always be anxious to get the grant, whether the job was completed or not.  There is an obligation on the inspector to see that this work is carried out as nearly as possible to his satisfaction and it may mean one, two or three visits before he is satisfied that the work has been carried out to his satisfaction and therefore, he could recommend the payment of the grant.</P>
    <P>There is no foundation whatever, as far as I am concerned, for the charge being made that grants are held up <Col N="104" /> because of lack of money.  We all know that if some individual is under pressure for money, and there is a delay of one week, two or three weeks, he will go to his local councillor to have the matter looked into.  Many come to me during the weekend, and also during the week, not alone from my own county but from the adjoining counties. Most TDs come to me from time to time but you will find that the housing grants that are paid after representations have been made by public representatives are a very small percentage of the total number of grants paid out in the year.  Most of the grants are paid after the inspector has sanctioned the work without any TD or councillor knowing a halfpennyworth about them. That is a good job.  It is only where we have some legitimate holdup that it comes to the notice of the local Deputy or councillor.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies raised the question of the high cost of building. The suggestion was that the colossal profits made by the builders here in Dublin and elsewhere was the reason for it.  The Minister appreciates this as much as any Member of the House.  As a matter of fact, he introduced a section on the Report Stage under which he will make more profit out of it.  It is brought to his notice, to do something about it.  It is a very difficult problem and we must all appreciate that.  It is not necessarily so that because a man is paying £3,500 for a house, he is being charged too much or that the contractor is making an excessive profit.  It is quite possible that the contractor who produces a house at £3,000 will make more profit out of it.  It is quite possible that the person purchasing it would get a much worse bargain if he had to pay a much higher price. We will have to try to consider the value the individual is getting for the money he is asked to pay and this might have to be related to the cost per foot of space provided and to the standards of workmanship in a good house.</P>
    <P>We all know that you can get a very expensive house but it might be a cheap house at the same time if the fittings and workmanship are such that they could easily justify the amount of <Col N="105" /> money charged to the individual. However, I want to say this in relation to housing costs, and I think it applies to the local authorities as much as it does to the people who are housed in SDA houses: instead of coming in here and telling the Minister that something should be done about it, the local authorities can help out quite a lot.  Recently, I was present when the Minister met a deputation from a local authority in regard to housing proposals for which they were seeking sanction.  The Minister was not prepared to sanction the proposal because of the cost of the scheme.  Some eight or nine people arrived in the Custom House and they came there with one idea in their minds, that the reason the Minister was holding up the scheme was that he had no money.</P>

      <P>The extraordinary thing about that was that as a result of the discussion we had, they got the grant and they can go ahead with the scheme.  I am sure the Fine Gael members of the authority concerned are very disappointed that they got the green light to go ahead with their scheme.</P>

      <P>The only reason they came at all was that they thought the Minister was holding up the scheme deliberately because of lack of finance.  He indicated that the money was there and that the only thing he wanted&mdash;and they could do so by negotiation with the contractors, with their consultants and with officials of the Department&mdash;was some agreement on bringing down the price.  As a result of this conference, they achieved that and have since got the green light to go ahead with these houses.  The most disappointed people, I am sure, are the members of the Fine Gael Party.  That was the Minister's approach, and if local authority members <Col N="106" /> are prepared to co-operate with him in that, it is the only way in which we can come to grips with this question of costs.

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last day this motion was being discussed, I was speaking of the fact that a Mr. O'Higgins, the Dublin City Services Manager of CIE, appealed to the authorities to ban all private cars from the city centre and to leave the area clear for CIE buses.  I stated I thought it would be much better if the higher executives of CIE set a headline in this respect.  As we know, their higher executives are entitled to use the buses to and from their homes but they do not do that; they use CIE cars.  Anybody can observe the arrival at the various establishments of CIE of <Col N="107" /> the various district managers, area managers, freight managers and many others, with each car holding one person or, perhaps, two.  Their position of importance can be judged by the type and size of the car in which they arrive. The smaller fry of executives arrive in a ten horse-power car; the bigger fish have a 12 or 14 horse-power car and the really big shots lord it over the others in their Zodiacs <i>et cetera.</i></P>
      <P>We have been told by Mr. Frank Lemass and by the Minister for Transport and Power that CIE is broke.  This has been hotly denied by Mr. Andrews.  But, if it is broke, I think we are entitled to ask who paid for the huge fleet of staff cars which was supplied in the first week of January this year, when we talk about extravagance, waste of time, and the fact that CIE executives do not avail of the bus or train services they appeal to other people to use.  They are like the Government: they are not prepared to practice what they preach.</P>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister is it not true that a meeting of executives took place in Killarney recently which lasted for several days.  The first session was due to begin at 4 p.m. and the final session on the third day at 1 p.m. A train leaves Kingsbridge which would arrive in Killarney half an hour before the meeting.  I want to ask the Minister did the higher executives use the CIE services available? According to information I have, they did not.  They used the staff cars, with two people in some of the cars and only one in others.  I am informed that seven staff cars left Dublin alone. Goodness knows how many staff cars came from other areas.  That is a waste of public money, when there is a train going from Dublin to Killarney, especially at the present time when other people are being asked to tighten their belts and told to support CIE.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Transport and Power has stated on numerous occasions that he has no responsibility for the day-to-day working of CIE.  There is an urgent need for an inquiry into the running of CIE.  Workers who are frustrated and do not know where they stand from day to day are entitled <Col N="108" /> to know the truth, to know the facts and have all the information which could be made available to a Committee such as we have requested.  The public who are using the transport system and do not seem to be satisfied are entitled to know and they want to know.  Seán Citizen, who is paying taxes and who sees his money in many cases going down the drain, is also entitled to know.  We all know that CIE is slowly grinding to a halt due to extravagance and mismanagement. Therefore, we believe, this inquiry is necessary and should be held.  There is public disquiet throughout the country at the attitude of the Minister for Transport and Power when he is asked these questions in the Dáil on the day-to-day workings of the company.  We believe that the Deputies, who represent the people who pay the taxes and keep CIE there, are entitled to have this information made available to them.</P>
    <P>On the last day, I spoke about political patronage in CIE.  I want to add to what I said that it is a wellknown fact that throughout the length and breadth of the country, it has taken place and is even, at the moment taking place.</P>

      <P>On this 50th anniversary of 1916, when Fianna Fáil are giving so much lip service to the ideas and ideals of the men who died and to the Proclamation of the Republic, particularly the part of it which says we should cherish all our children equally, it is no use to have the Minister for Education telling us there is free education for all and making promises of pie in the sky, when the ordinary man's boy or girl, unless he or she has pull and influence with high authorities in State-sponsored bodies like CIE, cannot get one of the top positions.  It is disgraceful that on the 50th anniversary of 1916, this should be the position.  It would be a good thing if the Minister for Transport and Power could say honestly that as far as jobs in CIE are concerned, each boy and girl who has the brains and the ability will have an equal chance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="109" /> When I accused the Minister of political patronage, he denied it with a display of hurt innocence.  The Minister would not be a member of his Party if he did not subscribe to this sort of thing like the other members of his Party.  In 1958, for instance, a CIE doctor in Mullingar died.  A young married doctor had bought a practice in Mullingar and was recommended by influential people for the position. However, another influential gentleman got in touch with the Minister and was promised the job.  This leaked out in Mullingar and influential people there went to CIE and put up a strong case for the young married man.  Before they left, they were told the position would be divided, half going to the young man who had bought the practice and the other half to the doctor with whom the Minister was concerned. The people believed CIE, but in a fortnight or three weeks, like a bolt from the blue, the Minister's friend got the job and the other man was completely ignored, despite the fact that it had cost him £2,000 to buy the practice in Mullingar.  He had to uproot himself.</P>
    <P>In 1962 the position of doctor for the Garda became vacant.  When a deputation of influential people went to the Department of Justice, they were told straight to their faces that they must have been asleep, that another doctor had been put up and that the position had been promised to Mr. Childers on his behalf.</P>

      <P>An Independent Deputy was on the deputation.  The deputation went to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, Deputy Hilliard. Deputy Hilliard said he had not made any definite promise, that he would consider it and that the other doctor, not the friend of the Minister for Transport and Power, might be appointed.  I should like to reiterate that what I have been saying is true. Instead of giving lip service on this 50th anniversary of 1916, it would be much better if every Irish boy and girl <Col N="110" /> were considered on his merits for positions in State-sponsored bodies.  The position CIE is now in is due to mismanagement, due to the fact that people who knew their business were not promoted instead of political hacks.</P>

      <P>I have only limited time and I do not propose to waste it talking about all the little things referring to alleged minor defects in CIE administration because if the whole lot of them were added together, they could not affect the general position of CIE.  If I have some time left at the end, I shall deal with some of the accusations and allegations of mismanagement. Deputy Lindsay made a very quiet, constructive speech.  He suggested everybody had been over-optimistic in the past about the position of the national transport company. The former Deputy Morrissey was optimistic in 1950 and the present Taoiseach was more guarded in 1958 when he made the very definite statement, which he never withdrew, that it <Col N="111" /> was an open question whether the railways would pay.</P>
      <P>I must refer to some of the past history of CIE.  Since 1958, in the face of enormous growing competition from private transport, CIE has shown it could gain traffic.  Its road freight traffic increased by 58 per cent and despite the closure of more than 600 miles of railway line, the railway passenger mileage has gone up by two per cent and there has been an increase of five per cent in the number of road passengers carried in face of most fantastic competition.  I should like to refer to some of the matters raised by Deputy Casey who spoke in a very definite way about my job as Minister for Transport and Power in relation to CIE and to my position in relation to the advisability of having increased supervision over the affairs of CIE.</P>
      <P>He made the charge that I am against the workers of CIE.  I am not against the workers.  I want to try to preserve their jobs for them.  He made the charge that I implied the workers were incompetent.  In two recent speeches, I said the vast majority of CIE workers were loyal and did their work excellently.  All I asked was that there should be further co-operation in the matter of increasing productivity, that there should be co-operation to end restrictive practices and I praised the loyalty of the staff who had to face complete re-organisation of the company with widespread changes.  I said that a great part of that re-organisation went through without any difficulties being experienced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy suggested I had practically ordered CIE to disband the existing group union committee in respect of continued wage negotiations and general arrangements for such negotiations. I did nothing of the kind and Deputy Casey is perfectly aware that there is one union in CIE which is not recognised by Congress.  He knows perfectly well that in connection with the recent strike the unions did not stand together, having made a majority decision, and that as a result there was a prolonged strike.  I hope there will be a better top level union situation in the <Col N="112" /> future in order to improve the procedures for negotiation.  There are 33 unions within CIE, and if Deputy Casey calls me Victorian, I suggest that to have 33 unions within the one organisation is Victorian.  My own feeling about CIE trade union organisation is that I should like to see less blind following of English practice and greater attention paid to the superbly run system in the democracies of Northern Europe where wages are good, where left-wing governments are in operation and where trade union organisations for essential services are organised in a way which, from the point of view of the number of strikes taking place in public utilities, seems to be an improvement on the present system here.</P>
    <P>About £1 million has been lost to CIE since 1958, in strikes equivalent to an increase of 6.6 per cent in wages in one year.  It would be interesting to know what would have happened if that money could have been spread over, say, five years.  To illustrate again the difficulty of establishing the right kind of trade union relationship in CIE, during the bus strike, which affected busmen peculiarly, there was a decline in rail revenue of £240,000 odd and a loss in the road freight service of £79,000, occasioned by a strike that did not directly concern either group of workkers.</P>
    <P>Deputy Casey compared the position of B &amp; I and CIE.  I have already made that clear in reply to a Parliamentary question today.  I made it clear that I stated, when I made my long statement about the future of CIE, that all State companies would be under some degree of survey by the Government in relation to the prices they charge for their services or their products and in relation to their financial support by the Government.  I also said that there were companies where there were international conditions, where wages and other costs were incurred abroad, and where they were not their responsibility and where it is quite inevitable charges would have to rise when those costs went up.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="113" /> Deputy Casey seemed to imply in what he said that I caused insecurity in the minds of CIE workers by suggesting there can be no increase in charges.  I never said anything of the kind.  I published a statement saying CIE would need to increase their rates and fares by three per cent at least in order to pay for the post-ninth round of wages.  I said any increase in rates and fares would have to be extremely moderate (1) for the national good and (2) in order to avoid CIE losing traffic on a catastrophic basis.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce is trying to hold down prices. The holding down of prices depends not only on management but also on workers.  It depends on whether the workers want to have an increase in the cost of living, which will be inevitable even if distributed profits are kept at a reasonable level, or whether they wish to contain the position as far as possible.  CIE is in exactly the same position as any other company in that regard.  The National Industrial and Economic Council have already stated that, unless there is a corresponding growth of productivity, for every ten per cent increase in wages and salaries, there will be an increase in the cost of living of six per cent. Inflation can be stopped in this country only if as far as possible the very good recommendations of the NIEC, which were signed by nine trade union leaders, are observed to the utmost limit.</P>
    <P>That applies to CIE just as it applies to any other company facing a difficult position in the future, either through the levy imposed on our exports or through price controls exercised to the limit he can do it by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, or occasioned by the inevitable reductions in tariffs that are going to take place in the next five years.  I made it clear when speaking of the difficulties of CIE that it was not isolated and that many other companies were going to face the same difficulties this year, which are partly due to inflation that has arisen in this and other countries and which we should all try to avoid in future by intelligent action and by accepting economic rules which are found to be <Col N="114" /> the same in every country in the world whether the country is administered by a Labour Government, a Conservative Government or any other type of Government.</P>
    <P>The second charge Deputy Casey levelled against me was that I was Victorian in my attitude towards State companies.  I want to make the position absolutely clear.  Everything I said recently about CIE was agreed by the Government and by the Taoiseach.  The decision not to increase the subsidy, the decision to restrain any increase in rates and fares to the absolute minimum required, were decisions of the Government and the Taoiseach.  I had their full consent before I gave this very full warning to CIE, in which I clarified as far as I could the whole position.  Deputy Casey suggests I am opposed to State companies.  We bought the B and I since I became Minister.  The Shannon Free Airport Development Company is going ahead and Bord Fáilte is going ahead.  But I want to make it clear that every State company has to be treated on its own merits and that they are all in a different position.  I should make it clear that this Government did not promote State companies for a socialist reason: they inaugurated State companies to fill a social and economic need where private enterprise was lacking. In the case of a great many of the State companies, private enterprise is lacking.  There is no other Irish air company; no one else wants to produce turf on the scale of Bord na Móna. The Shannon Airport Free Airport Development Company and Bord Fáilte are in a unique position; there is no rival to the Sugar Company.</P>
    <P>But we have to examine these companies objectively.  The position of CIE is clear.  It has to fight growing competition where there is plenty of private capital available.  According to recent estimates, in 1963 over £30,000,000 was invested in one year in private transport.  That being the case and it being known that private transport is being purchased by people of very modest incomes, the social need for the subsidy to CIE is inevitably limited; and as we have not started State companies for socialist reasons, <Col N="115" /> every company has to be treated on its own basis and has to face its own economic problems.  I have made that very clear.  In fact, during the passage of the 1964 Transport Bill I outlined exactly the conditions under which CIE could survive and prosper from the passing of the Bill until 1970 when the Dáil will again have to review this national transport company because fresh legislation will be required in connection with any further subsidy. For that reason CIE has to fight for traffic growth, fight to maintain its prices, fight to secure increased traffic in the same way as any other company that faces severe competition.</P>
    <P>I see no evidence as to why the taxpayer should be burdened with an increased impost as far as CIE is concerned, which already amounts to 4/6d. subsidy for every £1 of rail revenue spent on the system.  There is no reason why CIE traffic should not grow.  There are a new group of people, who before were not accustomed to travel at all, who are now beginning to travel on the CIE road and rail services.  The rail services are comfortable and reasonably speedy.  The road freight services have succeeded in getting a great deal of package deal contracts for goods.  There is no reason why CIE should not go ahead provided, as I have said, the realities of the situation are faced.  May I repeat that these realities are exactly the same in the case of a great many private companies facing a particular situation in the coming year?</P>
    <P>There are some things that simply cannot happen in CIE.  In the European railway system as a whole, for example, there is no such thing as a 40-hour week, not even in a country with over twice the national income per head&mdash;Sweden.  It is as well to be frank about these things.  In Great Britain in 1964, the basic hours worked were 42 hours and the actual hours worked 47.8 hours weekly.  It is no good talking about a 40-hour week.  It does not mean anything in the context of reality.  A 40-hour week in CIE would result immediately in an increase of ten per cent in rates and <Col N="116" /> fares outside the three per cent inevitable anyway and outside any other increase that might be given as a result of the tenth round.  That is one of the sort of realities we have to face and it has to be faced by CIE.</P>
    <P>If you look round Europe, you will find conditions vary very widely from industry to trade, from one group to another, even in countries where the general standard of living is a great deal higher than it is here and where the income per head in these countries that have developed so rapidly is higher than it is here.  All I ask is that these kinds of realities be faced. However, I am on fairly safe ground. I do not believe anybody in the Dáil would move a resolution to increase the price of petrol by 6d to 8d per gallon to support CIE.  I do not believe anybody would move a resolution to increase the rates and fares of CIE by anything up to 20 per cent.  When I speak of realities in CIE, I speak of the realities to be faced by Deputies if they had to face obligations that would arise if CIE costs were to rise excessively?</P>
    <P>As I have said, CIE can progress if the rules laid down in the NIEC report are understood by all concerned. In this case, and in the case of the other State companies, there is no question of hidden profits or excessive profits.  State companies do not make profits.  Their accounts are published. The whole world knows their content. As the State companies belong to the people, it is perfectly easy to observe the economic conditions within those State companies.  Therefore, the NIEC recommendation is one which is very well worth studying by everybody in CIE who wishes to preserve a company which is in intensive competition with private transport.</P>
    <P>I am speaking in good company in saying these things.  Everything I have said is being repeated all over Great Britain by every Minister in the Labour Party or by Left-wing Ministers in charge of economic affairs in a number of northern European countries. I am not speaking as a conservative or as a Victorian.  I am talking the same kind of left-wing economics <Col N="117" /> as are being preached at present by Labour Ministers in half a dozen countries with the object of trying to prevent inflation of the worst possible sort.  Although I do not necessarily agree with everything Mr. George Browne says, and although he occupies a very much more important position than ever I shall, it is interesting to note, in relation to what Deputy Casey has been saying, that he has been preaching exactly the same doctrine and for exactly the same reasons.</P>
    <P>I now come to speak about the question of whether there should be this committee.  As I have said, a great deal that has been said in the course of this debate relates to little, detailed operations within CIE.  I have already indicated that if they were costed, and even if the criticisms were found to be true, they could not possibly affect the general position of CIE as a transport organisation.  The idea of the establishment of a Parliamentary committee which would investigate some of the wholly untrue charges by Deputy L'Estrange is just a waste of time which would not solve the problem at all.</P>
    <P>We have had two reports on CIE&mdash; the Beddy Commission of Inquiry into Internal Transport and the Pacemaker Report.  In these two reports there lie all the facts which point to the difficulties of CIE and to the necessity for a realistic attitude towards its operation. If a Dáil committee were appointed, panels of technicians and economists would have to be attached to it.  Deputies would find that this is far too complex a subject for an inquiry by people who, themselves, are not skilled in the highly technical business of transportation and that there is nothing new they can discover.</P>
    <P>I can assure Deputies that the main elements of information and statistics that are to be found in Pacemaker still generally hold good and are modified only by increases in costs within CIE occasioned by increases in the price of materials, increases in the price of services bought by CIE and increases in costs occasioned by increases of salaries and wages.  The Pacemaker remains the authentic document.  There <Col N="118" /> is nothing that a committee established by this House could discover that is not already to be found in Pacemaker which is in the Library of the Dáil and can be read by Deputies.</P>
    <P>If, at a future time, it is necessary to have any inquiry into CIE, I imagine that the Government will appoint a Commission if they feel that the whole of the railway requires examination.  The commission's report would be laid on the Table of the House, as were the Beddy Commission Report and the Pacemaker Report, for examination and discussion during the debate on the Estimate for the Department of Transport and Power.  That is what I have to say about this request for a committee which I think was a reasonable request but had not been fully thought out.  Everything relating to parochial interests, special interests and individual pressures brought to bear by Deputies in the running of CIE would arise.  Many of them would simply be pressures which would result in increased costs to CIE.  The whole of them, if examined and discussed in the face of the chairman and the manager, would not result in any definite conclusion as to a change in the organisation of CIE or a change in the level of subsidy or in the level of rates and fares because there would be one case for increasing services and another case for maintaining them as they are and, as I have said, it really is not a matter which is subject to discussion by a committee of the Dáil.  I am not trying to denigrate the capacity of members of the Dáil: I would apply it to myself if I ceased to be Minister and became an ordinary Deputy.  I should find it very difficult to assess the position of any State company in the way that has been suggested.  If any serious situation arises, it is far better to have an examination by competent experts.</P>

      <P>Only five minutes.  I was asked a question about the Mallow-Waterford railway.  It is the <Col N="119" /> intention of the Government to introduce a Bill enabling CIE to close this railway.  This railway is really a bus service forced to travel along railway lines.  It could be entirely replaced by substitution of the services from Waterford to Limerick junction without any loss of time so far as the rail service is concerned and it would need a substitution of five buses, seven lorries and 11 trailers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>That number of lorries and buses is not in modern parlance, a railway service at all.  I have not the time to deal with the various complaints that have been made.  It would take me too long to do so. Deputy L'Estrange's observations about changes in staff in Cork are wholly untrue.  People who, he said, were retired under the 1958 Act did not retire and there was no political influence in the appointments of the Agent and Chief Clerks whom he mentioned, nor was any enormous loss occasioned by the inefficiency of a particular clerk.  The loss to CIE, which he said amounted to many thousands of pounds, was some £500.  I could go into a great deal of detail in regard to all these matters but they do not relate to the subject in hands.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Donnell asked why I opened the new facilities at Mallow, knowing that it was likely that the Mallow-Waterford rail service would close.  Mallow is being developed because it is now a more important railhead service as a result of the complete reorganisation of the whole area. It will be even more important when the Mallow-Waterford service closes &mdash;if CIE decide to close it&mdash;because this will be an enabling provision.  It will be a centre for road traffic in the area.  Everything planned for Mallow related to the possibility that the Mallow-Waterford service would close.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell, for example, spoke about the imposition on the taxpayer of a Dublin-Killarney bus service with dearer train services.  There was no Dublin-Killarney bus service. There was a bus service to Shannon to <Col N="120" /> assist in bringing people to and from the American aircraft landing there and the same bus went on from Shannon to Killarney as part of an experimental operation to see if traffic could be secured from people arriving at Shannon Airport who wanted to go directly to Killarney.</P>
    <P>That is very typical of the kind of questions that were asked and the answers to them.  I have substantive answers to all the questions that were asked which indicate that the Deputies concerned had not fully appreciated the position.</P>
    <P>I should like to conclude by saying that there need be no feeling of insecurity on the part of people in CIE if they simply face the realities in regard to the company.  When I spoke of a major inquiry into CIE, I was speaking only of an inquiry in relation to the possibility of a major disruption of service due to a major strike and, if that took place, then we would have to look into the whole position of the company.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>No company has such a bad record in industrial relations as CIE.  Whatever the reasons are, we may guess at, but at the moment I think it is true to say that no State company in the entire country has a worse relationship between those who work in the company and the management than CIE.  It is also true to say that no State company has been more subject to examination and inquiries as to the reason for this state of affairs.  Ask any ordinary bus conductor or driver or <Col N="121" /> anybody working on the railway and you will find that his attitude to the company certainly leaves a great deal to be desired.</P>
      <P>For some reason, the management of CIE do not appear to have got the recipe for successful running of a modern transport company.  Yet no company as well as being subject to so many inquiries, has done more in the way of publicity gestures to management reorganisation.  Quite recently, the management set up area divisions of the company with sort of autonomy over their respective areas.  The complaint has been made that these divisions in the company have not left these divisional areas with any authority in meeting unions locally and have not led to any real subdivision of power.</P>
      <P>A great deal of the blame for this state of affairs must lie with the management of CIE and the responsible Minister.  It is only quite recently that the Minister set aside machinery that had been set up in, let us say, all sincerity, by either side in the company, the joint industrial council of the company, the joint machinery for negotiation between unions and the management of the company.  The Minister issued an edict.  All their decisions were to be set at nought and ignored in the interim period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that industrial relations in this country get a lot of comment today as things are, it is such a topical matter.  One thing we know about it is that one sets aside established machinery only at one's own peril.  A responsible Minister with a wave of his hand, set aside machinery that has been set up over years and that has functioned at times.  He set it aside for some economic theory of his own&mdash;because he is a Minister with many economic theories.  It would probably be more in the country's interest if he left the economic theories to the Taoiseach, who is not responsible for any Department.  If he allowed the public to use the transport and got on with the job of really improving management in CIE, the general public would be extremely grateful.  After all, <Col N="122" /> the general public suffer on their feet each time there is a breakdown in negotiations in Córas Iompair Éireann. It is certainly my experience in speaking to workers in that company that relations with management are extremely bad.  How we can cure this state of affairs I do not know.  It raises a bitter smile on all our faces when it is said that this is a company that belongs to the people.  In latter years in this Dáil we have wondered to whom this company belonged because we certainly could not raise any question which we thought we were entitled to raise about its running, and so on.</P>
    <P>The one virtue in this motion is that it at least gives Deputies a chance of looking in its totality at the working of the company at the moment.  It may be, as the Minister says, that there are some interesting volumes in our Library on the company, that the Pacemaker Report gives information on the company.  As elected representatives, it is only right that we should expect to be given the adult status of being able to look into some of the problems affecting the company at this time.  One of the most important is the bad industrial relationship with management that exists.  That would certainly need to be looked at carefully.  It would be extremely helpful that this House should examine this aspect of the question. It has nothing to do with economic theories or relating our transport difficulties to problems in European countries.  It has to do with the fact that the management of Córas Iompair Éireann, for some reason or other, do not appear to be able to communicate properly with the people who are working in their own company and they stand very seriously indicated in the record of management-labour relations in their own company over the past few years.  It would be extremely important that this House should look into this aspect because it is a problem which, if not solved at this time, will be with us in the years ahead.  CIE is the largest State industry in the country and it is extremely important that this House should attempt to grapple with this problem of industrial relations and management.</P>

      <P>This motion, put down in the name of Deputy Lindsay, asks that a Select Committee of the Dáil be set up to inquire into a number of matters in relation to CIE.  I think the Minister will agree that the nature of the discussion here, the fact that most Deputies who spoke were able to contribute from their own experience to a great extent and the type of complaints that were made do give justification for the motion, do justify the idea of having some kind of committee set up which will enable Deputies to get a full and complete picture of CIE and the workings of CIE, particularly under the heads set out in the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did not hear the whole of the Minister's speech but for the greater part of the period during which I listened to him, the Minister was making a case not against the motion but against allowing any increase in wages or any improvement by means of reduction in working hours in the conditions of service of CIE employees.  I want to make it quite clear that so far as the motion is concerned, that matter is not relevant.  I doubt if anyone will fault the Minister's reasoning in the appeal he has made when he bases it, as he did to a large extent, on the NIEC Report and recommendations.  We have already had, not one, but at least two, lengthy discussions in this House regarding the general economic situation. Most Deputies and most people are, I think, aware of the economic mess to which the country has been reduced and I do not think the Minister or any other member of the Government can criticise Deputies on these benches on the score that they failed to co-operate in the national interest, both in the discussions on the economic <Col N="124" /> situation and in urging their exhortations on the people to adopt the measures that appeared to be necessary to remedy that situation, including the recommendations in the NIEC Report. Therefore, I think to a very great extent the Minister was sidestepping the questions posed in this motion when he argued the case against CIE staff seeking increases or getting increases.</P>
    <P>What we are asking is&mdash;</P>
    <P>That a Select Committee of Dáil Éireann consisting of fifteen members of whom five shall be a quorum, be appointed, with power to send for persons, papers and records&mdash; (1)  to examine methods of recruitment to all grades of service in CIE; (2) to examine the manner in which contracts are sought and placed by the company; (3) to review its working methods and practice; (4) to examine its advertising methods; (5) to review its income and expenditure generally; and (6) to make recommendations on these matters and such other matters related to public transport services and their operation as the Committee think fit.</P>
    <P>In suggesting these headings as the terms of reference of a committee, I want to make it clear that we do not necessarily imply that there is justification for complaint against CIE under these various headings, but we feel, and I think this will be accepted by the Minister, that there is a general air of disquiet and uneasiness amongest the people by reason of the fact that year after year we have become accustomed to seeing CIE losses that have to be footed by the taxpayer.  It is true, I think, that Deputies find it very difficult, and I do not say this necessarily as a criticism of the Minister, to get detailed information with regard to any State companies because the Minister with the ultimate responsibility for them is quite entitled to adopt the attitude that the matters on which information is sought concern the day-to-day administration of these companies and he has no responsibility for them.  Because that is the position, Deputies are not able to get the kind of detailed information which would <Col N="125" /> assist them as public representatives in discharging their duties in relation to State companies generally and, in this particular instance, in relation to the transport company.  I am, I think, correct in saying it has been disclosed that something in the region of £30,000 was spent in order to convert the bus scrolls into Irish.</P>

      <P>The fact of the matter is that, when people had become quite accustomed to what the CIE symbol was, suddenly it was altered. For what reason I do not know.  Neither do I know precisely what figure was involved but, in regard to this kind of expenditure&mdash;it may be only small&mdash; Deputies are entitled to get information about it, particularly when we throw our minds back, as we are certain to do, to the fanfare of trumpets which ushered in CIE in the early days, the days in which we were told we were now going to get cheap and efficient transport, and that was the whole argument behind the establishment of CIE. I do not know that it is worthwhile at this stage quoting chapter and verse; the Minister and the Deputies sitting behind him will remember for themselves the kind of speeches that were made and that that was the justification given to the people for setting up Córas Iompair Éireann and amalgamating the transport services of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we have got to do now is to take stock of the position and see where we stand, see if anything like the cheap and efficient transport system <Col N="126" /> foreshadowed by the Government in those days has come into being.  All of us, I think, know that it has not.  We know that year after year the taxpayers are being asked to foot the bill for CIE losses and the case we make on this motion is that Deputies are entitled to satisfy themselves by means of a Select Committee of Inquiry of the kind suggested as to why that should be so.</P>
    <P>The Minister&mdash;I do not want him to think I misunderstood him as in any way attempting to denigrate other Deputies or their Parties in this matter &mdash;made the case in the very short time in which he dealt with the merits of the motion that, because there had been an inquiry before, because there was the Pacemaker Report, and so on, this was just not a matter in respect of which a committee of this sort would be able to turn up anything new.  He made the case that it was far too complex a matter for non-experts such as Deputies and that there was nothing new they could discover.</P>
    <P>The Minister is taking a great deal on himself when he makes that kind of case.  Surely it is only on the establishment of a committee of this sort, giving them the powers that we ask they should be given, giving them the authority to probe and question, to examine records, to hear witnesses, and so on, surely it is only then that it can be said whether or not anything new can be discovered, anything which might assist in solving the transport problem we have.  Certainly it must be solved.  It must be solved either by this Government or by some other Government. Deputies should be entitled to get the information and, in so far as they can, to play their part in trying to solve the problem and to satisfy the people they represent in this House.  I urge the Minister, even at this eleventh hour, to reconsider his attitude and accept the motion; it is a motion which clearly has the support of every other Party in the House.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the Government to make provision in the forthcoming Budget for a substantial increase in personal and dependents income tax allowances as they bear no relation to the purposes <Col N="129" /> for which they were originally intended.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party have always believed that there should be greater emphasis on direct taxation as against indirect taxation than there is now and than there has been in recent years.  We favour a tax on incomes, a tax on wealth, but it appears to us that income tax as designed at present falls most heavily on those who cannot well afford to bear it and that it should fall most heavily on those who can best bear it.  Under our income tax code at present, those in the lower income group pay an undue amount of tax as wage and salary earners.  Here, it should be emphasised that for such persons, those earning fixed incomes, there is no escape by way of allowances. It is true they have some allowances, apart from the personal, dependents' and children's allowances but such allowances are very limited.  It should also be emphasised that since PAYE was introduced the wage or salary-earner pays in accordance with the income tax code and regulations to the very last penny, or I should say, halfpenny.</P>
    <P>Some persons have recently pointed to the fact that workers pay income tax as an argument or demonstration of how well off they are.  A relatively small number of people paid income tax 25 or 30 years ago.  This number has risen substantially.  It is often protested that £13 a week is a pretty comfortable wage or salary.  It is a fairly average wage or salary over the whole country.  I read recently that over 100,000 in this country have less than £13 per week.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this motion is to demonstrate that the allowances provided under our income tax code are inadequate when one has regard to various factors.  I want to take first the example of a single man who has £13 per week.  As I said, there are many tens of thousands who are in receipt of that particular amount, which comes to £676 per annum.  A single man gets an earned income allowance of one quarter of that, which is £169. That, deducted from his £676, leaves £507.  He gets £234 personal allowance, <Col N="130" /> leaving him £273 on which to pay tax.  The manual worker has certain allowances and so has the clerical worker, but in my experience, the allowances for insurance, for payment of social welfare contribution and for, say, dungarees and laundering of dungarees and so on, amounts to about £20 per year.  The net point so far as he is concerned is that he has to pay £90 per year in income tax.</P>
    <P>I do not think it was ever visualised that a man with £13 per week, even a single man, would be required to pay what I regard as the exorbitant sum of £90 per year.  This is somewhat less than £2 per week.  When one has regard to that fact and to the fact that he pays social welfare contributions and weekly contributions to his trade union, one realises that his £13 per week is very much diminished indeed. The married man with £13 per week, or £676 per year, receiving the earned income allowance of £169 and the married allowance of £394, discovers that after getting an allowance of, say, £20 for various sundries, he is taxed on £93 per year.  This means that the married man with £13 per week, apart from having to pay his social welfare contributions and his contribution to his trade union, pays about 10/- or 12/- per week income tax.</P>
    <P>I do not think that is fair or reasonable and certainly it is not just.  It is one of the reasons why we say that allowances in respect of such people should be increased so that their wages or salaries will be of real benefit to them.  I think I am right in saying that there is an allowance for payments of fees for membership of chambers of commerce but there is not, or there was not in recent years, any allowance for the payment of trade union dues or contributions to a man's union.</P>
    <P>In the case of the married man with two children, it is also reasonable to say that he pays an undue proportion of tax.  With £1,000 per year, and giving him the various allowances, he pays something like 12/- per week income tax, apart again from the fact that he is not allowed his household responsibilities such as rent and rates, <Col N="131" /> electricity supply charges and all that sort of thing.  As a manual worker, he also has to pay social welfare and trade union contributions.  There is, of course, also the other indirect taxation which has been imposed on him particularly in recent years in the from of the turnover tax and as well on the usual commodities which are and have been subject to taxation for quite a long time, cigarettes, drink and different other items.  However, do not misunderstand me or any other member of the Labour Party in regard to this tax because we demonstrated our attitude to that type of tax last year. When we were satisfied that the extra moneys being raised were being devoted to worthy causes in the matter of social welfare, we supported the Government.</P>
    <P>It seems to me, therefore, when one has regard to the amount of taxation that has to be paid by those of relatively modest means, that their efforts in recent times to improve their living standards and improve their lot have been somewhat negatived by the payment of income tax, on the basis of the small allowances that now obtain. In respect of these allowances, we should accept the principle that they should be fair and above all, that they should be realistic and should be established on a far better basis, particularly for those with family responsibilities. It is true that some years ago these allowances did bear some relationship to the cost of maintenance and the cost of living, but they have not been increased side by side with the fall in the value of money, or indeed with the increase in the cost of living.</P>
    <P>The commission established some years ago to inquire into income taxation did a tremendous amount of work and produced a valuable report for the Minister and Dáil Éireann which contains recommendations which in the main have not been favourably received by the various Ministers for Finance since they were published in 1962.  There again I think the motion is certainly compatible with the recommendation on page 14 of the <Col N="132" /> Report of the Commission on Income Taxation, in paragraph 27, which is as follows:</P>
    <P>We recommend recognition of the principle that income tax should not be payable on the income needed for minimum subsistance; and that the effective exemption limits should be based on the personal allowances, including earned income allowance, without the complication of a formal exemption limit.</P>
    <P>I do not think that anybody could argue that the allowances now made in respect of income tax could be regarded as &ldquo;minimum subsistence&rdquo; even as mentioned in this recommendation, because, in my opinion, the present allowances are less than minimal. As it stands, the personal allowance for a single person is £234 per year; in 1939, if my memory serves me correctly, it was something like £120. I may not be absolutely accurate in that but certainly money has fallen at a far greater rate than this allowance has increased and the cost of living since 1939 certainly has gone up in a far bigger proportion than £120 to £234.  The allowance for a man and wife is £394 and this certainly could not be argued as being at subsistence level.</P>
    <P>There is one anomaly that must have occurred to the Minister and many other Members of the House in respect of the allowance for a single person and that for the married couple. For a single person, it is £234, and for the man and his wife, it is £394.  The actual fact here is that the Revenue Commissioners or the Government believe that £160 is sufficient on which to maintain a wife.  There is another point which again I am sure must have occurred to various Ministers for Finance and to the present Minister, that is, the comparison between the allowance to a man and wife of £394 and that, say, to two brothers living in the one house where the allowance is £468 per year, or £234 each.  The least the Minister for Finance could do as far as this allowance is concerned is to put the man and wife on a par with two single people who live <Col N="133" /> under the one roof.  After all, there is the one amount paid for rent and rates and for general household expenses. To differentiate in such a big way between the married couple and two single people&mdash;they could be two brothers or a brother and sister&mdash;is something which the House and the Minister must agree is grossly unfair.</P>
    <P>There is another excellent recommendation made by the Commission on page 16, in paragraph 36:</P>
    <P>We recommend that the personal allowance for married persons should be at least twice that for unmarried persons.</P>
    <P>This again is in accordance with the motion in our names and some effort should be made to put it into operation.</P>
    <P>On page 17, there is a recommendation in regard to a widowed person. This is in paragraph 39:</P>
    <P>We recommend that a widowed person should be entitled to the equivalent of the married allowance for the four years following that in which widowhood commences; and that after this time he or she should be entitled to the unmarried allowance only.</P>
    <P>On page 17, there are arguments in favour of this, as there are arguments, and convincing arguments, in my opinion, in regard to the other recommendations. As far as the widowed person is concerned, I believe, in accordance with this Report, that there should be far more leniency in regard to this allowance for widowed persons.</P>

Some of the deposits in the National Bank&mdash;deposits in branches in England and Wales&mdash;will no longer qualify for the exemption from tax on the first £50 of interest, if and when the amalgamation of the National Bank and the Bank of Ireland is effected.  Therefore, there will be a loss to the depositors concerned.  That is the reason for the Financial Resolution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>This is hardly the occasion to discuss this in general but I think the Minister should consider whether the change in the law has had the desired result or whether, in fact, the change which required deposits bearing interest in excess of £50 or over, was not using a sledgehammer to crack a nut and whether, in fact, it has not had an effect on the movement of capital.  This is a matter on which it is not possible to get definite figures but there is an impression that, because of that decision, a number of people who had deposits in the bank, many of them of long standing, moved these deposits because of the change effected by the 1963 Act, I think. Certainly, the general tendency of much recent legislation, of that particular requirement as well as certain requirements of the Finance Act of last year has been to militate against attracting capital to this country.  The effect in some cases was possibly to bring about a movement of capital elsewhere.  As I say, this is hardly the occasion to discuss the matter in general because it is only incidental to the Bill that the Resolution is necessary, but I would suggest to the Minister that the matter should receive serious consideration in relation to any necessary alteration in the coming Finance Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I to take <Col N="135" /> it that the introduction of the Financial Resolution means that it will be necessary to provide State funds somewhere or other to deal with this transfer which, according to what the Minister said, when introducing this Bill, is supposed to be in the best interests of the National Bank, the overseas section and the branches here?  Am I also right in assuming that the Chairman of the National Bank Mr. W. Anthony Action in his statement said there was a necessity for this provision because there was too great a call on the capital in the National Bank in Ireland&mdash;for the so-called economic expansion that is taking place at present&mdash;does that not rather suggest that the National Bank, which down through the years, well over a century, was able to supply the necessary capital, has lost a good deal of capital as a result of the misguided Finance Act passed last year?  This Finance Act caused a flight of capital from the country.  In effect, the real reason for the division of the National Bank, the UK portion to the Commercial Bank of Scotland and the Irish portion as a subsidiary of the Bank of Ireland, is that there has been a flight of capital from this country, due to the direct policy of the Government.  That, in fact, is the meaning of the Financial Resolution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Dáil Éireann are in a very embarrassing position in being asked to legislate in the present situation without the information which we ought to have.  I want to make this quite clear.  I consent to the passage of this Resolution, solely and entirely on the basis that I know the directors of the National Bank, Paddy Duggan, John Leydon, James <Col N="136" /> Davy, Anthony Quirke and E.A. Maguire.  I do not know many of the directors of the Bank of Ireland.  I do not know Mr. Carroll but I know all belonging to him.  I know Professor Meenan and so far as I know, and so far as my judgement is concerned, those men stand trustees for their respective shareholders.  My knowledge of them leads me to believe that in their capacity as trustees, they would not do anything which was not consistent with what they believed to be, after the best inquiry they could make, in the best interests of the shareholders.  I want to make it perfectly clear that is all the information I have got.</P>
      <P>Mind you, I have studied carefully the Minister's statement in respect of this Bill and I cannot get any further enlightenment from that statement either.  It is extremely odd that we should find ourselves in the position of giving approval in anticipation of a decision which the shareholders themselves have not taken.  I fully appreciate that this is an enabling Bill, a Bill to enable the Minister for Finance, by order, to make those legislative deposits in the event of the shareholders of the three participating companies approving this arrangement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We can say what we like.  The fact that we are passing this Bill appears to suggest generally that we approve the transaction.  I want to make it perfectly clear that so far as I am concerned, I know nothing whatever of the merits of this transaction.  I proceed solely and exclusively on the basis that I trust the integrity of the individual directors, to whom I have referred and, so far as I am aware, Dáil Éireann has received no information from anyone which would justify it in passing a decision on the merits of the proposals which this Bill is designed to facilitate.  I do not think that is a proper procedure.  When we come to consider it on Committee Stage, we ought to have definite regard to sections 3, 4 and 5 because I know of no precedent of legislation of that character in my experience.  I urge the Minister for Finance to give us some precedents for the procedures envisaged in those sections, some evidence that the Legislature has ever undertaken in <Col N="137" /> the past to do the things it is proposed to do in those sections.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say, in replying to Deputy Cosgrave in the first instance, that when the provision in the Finance Act of 1963 was introduced, I, like him, heard some comments from bank managers throughout the country that the obligation on banks to disclose deposits bearing £25 interest per annum and upwards would cause a flight of deposits and, therefore, of capital from the country.  Being the then Minister for Industry and Commerce and being apprehensive to some degree of that suggestion, I raised it with the Minister for Finance of the day, Dr. Ryan, and he assured me that there was little, if any, flight of capital as a result of that provision.  Nevertheless, I acknowledge that there may be something in that contention and, in the last Finance Act I raised the £25 to £50 as being the interest earned by deposits which would have to be disclosed by banks.  I have continued to make inquiries about it and I am assured that there has not, in fact, been any significant disappearance of deposits or capital reserves in this country as a result of the 1963 Finance Act, or the 1965 Finance Act.  But, of course, in the 1956 Finance Act, there was already a provision whereby deposits earning £15 interest per annum or more would have to be subject to income tax, so the 1963 provision was not entirely a new one.</P>
      <P>However, the point I want to answer specifically is that, notwithstanding my inquiries&mdash;and, I will admit, my apprehensions&mdash;at the time, I am convinced, as a result of the advice I have been given, that this has not in any significant way diminished the availability of capital in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Dillon rightly pointed out, this is an enabling Bill.  Its origin lies in the background that, by reason of the economic advance of this country, there appeared to be an interest in outside banking interests taking over existing Irish banking interests.  The Bank of Ireland, as the Deputy is aware, acquired the interests of the Hibernian Bank and the National City Bank some years ago <Col N="138" /> but there was still a continuing interest in the banking interests of this country by outside banking interests.  The Central Bank and, indeed, the Government openly expressed concern about this trend and expressed it in the positive way that it was desirable that the banking business of the country should be held, in so for as was possible, by Irish interests.  I think it was consistent with that policy that the Bank of Ireland sought to acquire the interest of the National Bank.  Deputy Dillon was, unfortunately, absent, even if he has acknowledged reading my introductory speech on the Second Reading last week, but I mentioned on that occasion that the National Bank, as far as their holdings were concerned, were properly assessed as to the current value of the buildings, the bank premises, throughout the country and as to the current value of its business generally by an independent firm of accountants whose reputation, I believe, is international.</P>
    <P>The Bank of Ireland and the National Bank of Scotland are the two other interests involved&mdash;the Bank of Ireland decided to acquire the interests of the National Bank in Ireland and the National Bank of Scotland the interests of the National Bank in England and Wales, which had an independent finance house advising it.  The question was raised why the National Bank itself did not have such independent finance house advice.  I think that question was answered in the press today by the Governor of the Bank of Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister himself said because they had four merchant bankers on their own board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows&mdash;and I am sure he does&mdash; there is a danger that smaller Irish banking interests might be absorbed by bigger interests from outside.  It was for that reason the Government welcomed and acquiesced in this arrangement whereby the Bank of Ireland would acquire the interests in Ireland of the National Bank.  Under this arrangement, the National Bank of Scotland would acquire the interests <Col N="139" /> of the National Bank in England and Wales, in so far as it has branches there.</P>
      <P>I also said last week that while the National Bank was established in the early nineteenth century&mdash;in 1835&mdash;by Daniel O'Connell, ultimately, in order to acquire clearing-house facilities in London, which were essential to the efficient and more profitable operation of the bank, the legal hub, in other words, to comply with the Companies Acts, was in London.  It is for that reason it is necessary now that we should, in our legislation, make provision for the acquisition by the Bank of Ireland here in Ireland of the interests of the National Bank, and by the National Bank of Scotland in the United Kingdom, even though we cannot make that provision in respect of the interests of the National Bank in the United Kingdom.</P>
      <P>As I said at the outset, it is an enabling provision.  It is necessary that this legislation be passed before the end of March of this year because, otherwise, the tax law in relation to these matters may have changed in Britain and, under the existing company law of Britain, it will require 75 per cent, or a majority, of the existing shareholders of the National Bank to effect this acquisition by the Bank of Ireland and the National Bank of Scotland. I mentioned last week that there was a document&mdash;I produced it to the House then but unfortunately have not got it now&mdash;indicating the value in a period of ten years of the shares of the National Bank as quoted on the Stock Exchange.  The document gave full details of the assets of both the National Bank and the Bank of Ireland.  Therefore, I feel that to the extent to which this House needs information in order to enable legislation to be passed, such information is sufficiently available to us.</P>

      <P>It has been acknowledged by Deputy Dillon that this is enabling legislation.  It is a desirable trend as far as our economy is concerned in that Irish banking interests are controlled by the banking arrangements of this country.  I hope it will become even more so.  I feel that if, having passed this legislation, the shareholders of the National Bank will agree to the transfer of their shares, or the purchase of their shares by the two companies concerned&mdash;the Bank of Ireland and the National Bank of Scotland&mdash;it will be in the best interests of the Irish economy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I to take it this Bill deals with the National Bank in its entirety?  When I say that, I emphasise that one-third of the National Bank is in the United Kingdom and two-thirds in this country.  Is this legislation concerned with the overseas branches or only with the Irish branches?  It seems to me from the shareholder's point of view&mdash;I am not a shareholder, as I indicated on the Second Stage&mdash;they are entitled to have a say in the decision as to whether the overseas part is being transferred to the Bank of Scotland, or is that a <i>fait accompli</i>, or will it take place after the directors meet in London?  If that is so, I can see nothing whatsoever in this Bill, supposed to be an eneve <Col N="141" /> abling measure, to enable the directors of the National Bank to do what they wish to do&mdash;become the National Bank of Ireland here and the National Bank of Scotland in the UK.  How can we pass legislation unless we deal with both sides?  We are the public representatives of this country whose duty it is to try to get as much information as possible here in the Irish Parliament relevant to this transaction.  I fully agree with Deputy Dillon that we have been given no information at all.  The only information I can find is in the statement of the Chairman of the National Bank which says it is no longer desirable, owing to economic circumstances, that the two banks should be amalgamated, that the National Bank should be an amalgamated entity operating two banks.  I am convinced of that from the point of view of the economic situation.  Perhaps the Minister would clarify those points.</P>

      <P>This legislation can apply only to the area of jurisdiction of this Parliament&mdash;twenty-six counties of Ireland.  It is necessary to legislate in this form because a new company is being set up, the National Bank of Ireland, within the Twenty-six Counties, to replace the National Bank as it originally was.  The legislation is necessary in order to give legal force or to enable legality to be given to the transfer of securities, overdrafts and things like that.  Otherwise, it would be necessary for the National Bank of Ireland to negotiate separate agreements with all customers who have securities lodged in the bank or who are overdrawn. As I have said, the purpose of this legislation is to give legal permission to effect these transfers.  It does not apply in any way to the operations of the National Bank in the Six Counties or the UK.</P>

There <Col N="142" /> may be a change in ownership as happens always in the buying and selling of shares.  For that reason, no legislation is necessary in the UK.  The legislation here is necessary in order to facilitate the transfer of securities and overdrafts and things like that.  Our legislation deals only with the operations of the National Bank within the Twenty-Six Counties.</P>

There is a notion that some of these shares are undervalued.  The Minister says the information in the Press today, particularly the <i>Irish Times,</i> covers that.  I have read it and all I can gather from it is that Sir Henry Benson of Cooper Brothers made these share valuations.  Apparently this <Col N="143" /> information was made available to the company of Cooper Brothers, but this is an accountancy firm not a valuation firm.  Presumably that accountancy firm merely made its valuation of the value of the shares on a valuation produced by some other valuation firm? We do not know who that valuation firm was.  The kernel of the dispute and the reason why the shareholders association was formed is that they believe the premises of the National Bank, as such, have been under-estimated. I would like the Minister to give me information as to how this valuation was arrived at, this valuation given to this firm of accountants, and who were the valuation firm.</P>

      <P>I do not know. Cooper Brothers have certified that this valuation has taken place.  They have certified also that the offer of 56/6d for a 10/- share is, to use their words, &ldquo;fair and reasonable&rdquo;.  As far as I am concerned, I have been presented with a certificate of an internationally-known firm of accountants. <Col N="144" /> I have a request from the Bank of Ireland, the integrity of whose Governor and members nobody questions. Similarly, the integrity of the directors of the National Bank here is not in question.  These people coming together say to me that legislation is necessary in order to effect this acquisition by the Bank of Ireland of the National Bank.  I say, having looked at the information they supplied me with, I agree it is in the interests of the country that I provide the enabling legislation, provided the shareholders agree.  The enabling legislation is necessary, as I said, because of an impending change in British company law and British taxation provisions before the end of March.  It is my purpose in this to ensure that, as far as I am concerned, having examined it and having regard to the knowledge made available to me, it is in the best interests of this country that this transfer be effected, if the shareholders so agree.  That is what I am doing.</P>

      <P>(<i>South Tipperary</i>): The Minister says this is enabling legislation necessary for him to introduce. Why introduce it at this stage? After all, a vote will be taken in London on, I think, Thursday.  Surely he could wait until after the shareholders' meeting and allow them to approach this matter with an open mind and say what they will do with their own property?  Why, so to speak, put the horse before the cart?  It looks to me as a layman that this enabling legislation might be meant to influence the shareholders.  We know that, if we are able to get £300 tax out of the transaction ultimately, it will be a very useful thing for us.  But, at the same time, I fail to understand why the Minister rushes the enabling legislation through the House before the people who own the property are allowed in an objective fashion to make up their minds on a commercial basis one way or the other.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems the Minister is recommending this on behalf of the Government.  The National Bank has, I think, 39 branches in all the big centres in England.  I do not know exactly how many branches they have in Ireland, but the number is in the neighbourhood of 300.  It seems to me only natural, if the Minister is supporting a Bill on behalf of the Government, that in spite of the integrity of the directors referred to and of the firm of accountants referred to, he should, in a business deal of this kind concerning literally thousands of people, come in here with the requisite information as to the valuation.  Deputy Hogan has questioned the valuation of the premises, as to whether it is sufficient or not.  We had the Second Stage of the Bill a week ago.  I think I was the only doubting Thomas then; everybody else received it with enthusiasm. There has been a certain amount of public interest aroused in the matter, particularly among shareholders.  One would have imagined the Minister would have had the information as to the valuation.  There are premises of the National Bank in College Green on which a considerable sum of money has been spent.  These premises are right in the centre of the city and must be very valuable.  The bank have numerous other premises.  They have premises in the heart of London, in Trafalgar Square.  If those premises were bought for £1 million, I imagine they would be cheap by ordinary standards of valuation today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have no information at all.  We do not know if this is an up-to-date valuation or if this is the valuation of the premises 25, or even 40 years, ago. <Col N="146" /> This House is one of the places where we can dissect such matters, because in a free Parliament, we are allowed to express our opinions.  It is up to the Minister to give us the necessary information.  If he cannot do so at this stage, I presume the Report Stage will not be taken until a later date.  There does not seem to be any great hurry about the Bill.  Perhaps the Minister would have the information later as to a breakdown of the valuation of premises at £1,800,000?  If I could buy the National Bank premises in England and Ireland for that amount, I think I would have a pretty useful profit when I came to sell them again. I would be able to keep a few of the banks out of the profit.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1, in the name of Deputy T. F. O'Higgins:</P>
      <P>In page 2, line 41, before &ldquo;and&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or any obligation entered into by the transferor in relation to a customer&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that any obligation being entered into by the transferor in relation to a customer will be adequately safeguarded.  It may be that the section as drafted covers whatever obligations the National Bank Limited, described in the section as the transferor, have undertaken and is adequate.  In order to make doubly sure, however, this amendment is being put down so as to safeguard whatever obligations the transferor may have entered into with the customers.</P>

    <P Just="Center">
      <Col N="147" /> SECTION 3.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 3 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This section, as I understand it, deals with the property of the depositors of the National Bank.  Any person who has negotiated a loan for accommodation with the National Bank, as at present constituted, may have deposited with that bank securities worth £10 or £1,000 or £100,000.  He may have deposited with them the mortgage deeds of his business establishment or of his house. The Minister will recall, in his legal experience, provisions of many such mortgages and the right, in certain circumstances, to bring in a receiver.</P>
      <P>The man who mortgages his property to his bank gives great hostages to fortune.  We propose here, by legislation, to deal with the property of people, that is, borrowers from the National Bank.  We are not the parties to this transaction at all.  It is not at all inconceivable that a borrower in this country made up his mind, for his own good reasons&mdash;whatever they were&mdash;in relation to a substantial block of securities or real estate, that he would prefer to give that charge to the board of directors of the bank in London.  Is there any precedent in the legislation of this country or is it consistent with our Constitution, without any regard at all to whether you agree, to give a charge on your property or investments to the National Bank of Ireland, which hitherto had been the National Bank Limited?  We are now, by law, vesting in a new entity, the National Bank of Ireland, a lien on your property which you never gave and which you never could have given because it did not exist when you made the arrangement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recently said to a banker in this city that of the many odd provisions of this Bill, I thought this provision the strangest of all.  He said: &ldquo;The Bill does not do that; it could not do it.&rdquo; I said: &ldquo;It does do it, as far as I understand it.&rdquo;  He replied: &ldquo;Oh no, it provides for the transfer of shares in the bank but there could not be any question <Col N="148" /> of transfer of security.  That would be a matter for the bank to re-negotiate with its new customers, inconvenient as that may be.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If I understand section 3 correctly, we are proposing to give legislative sanction to a transaction which, in my submission to the House, is unconstitutional. We have no more power to give to the National Bank of Ireland, which is not now in existence, a charge on a man's property which is at present mortgaged to the National Bank than we have power to jump over the moon. It may be that section 3 does not mean this.  If it does not, I should like to be reassured to that effect by the Minister. However, if it does mean it, I should like to hear from him how such a procedure can be justified.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>If what is proposed in the section is not carried out, would it mean that the bank would have to call in all money outstanding and to arrange for the transfer and to have the new bank reissue the loans? Is that the reason for the section, as introduced?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>That, in effect, is the position.  The section was designed to avoid the necessity for doing this.  I do not mind admitting that what has been expressed by Deputy Dillon occurred to me, namely, whether a security lodged with A could be transferred to B, without the consent of the person who lodged the security, let it be a mortgage or any other form of collateral.  This question was examined. I have been assured that, since there will not be any worsening of the rights of customers or disimprovement in the securities, there is nothing unconstitutional about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I felt it necessary to insert this section in order to avoid the necessity to do what Deputy Tully said might otherwise be necessary.  Being an enabling Bill any person who feels his security has in any way been jeopardised or minimised can change, if he so wishes. I do not think it would be fair for me to expect any person to be put to the expense of challenging the constitutionality of this section.  Having regard to <Col N="149" /> the questions I raised, to the examination made of it and the results I got of the examination, I am satisfied that nobody who has a security lodged with the National Bank will be in any worse position.  There will be no worsening whatever of his position by reason of the transfer of that security to the National Bank of Ireland.  On the contrary, as I hope, the security may well be enhanced.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am challenging the statement that the security would not in any way be jeopardised.  We are setting a precedent here.  I can understand the Minister's position in saying, in effect: &ldquo;This Bill is contingent on the decision taken by the shareholders of these banks on Thursday next and it is only in the event of their deciding, by a 75 per cent majority, to adopt this scheme that I shall make the appropriate order.  I shall adopt that procedure only on account of the pending change in the law of Great Britain which requires expedition.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>How can we interfere with the property of someone who is not a party to the proceedings at all?  That is what I am saying.  If a transaction took place which did not involve legislation of any kind, and Lloyds Bank were taken over by Barclays Bank and an indignant depositor came in and said: &ldquo;I did not choose to pledge my securities with Barclays Bank.  I pledged my securities to Lloyds Bank and now Barclays are taking it over&rdquo;, I can understand Barclays Bank saying: &ldquo;If you are not prepared to give us the charge which Lloyds hold, we must ask you to liquidate your overdraft forthwith and if you do not liquidate your overdraft forthwith, we will have to set machinery in operation to recover our debts.&rdquo;  On the other hand, I can imagine Barclays Bank saying: &ldquo;We have not the slightest desire to do that. We were most anxious to retain your custom when we bought Lloyds Bank and if you transfer your security to us, we will be most happy to give you accommodation the same as or better than Lloyds Bank gave you.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But the Legislature of Ireland is required by the circumstances to intervene <Col N="150" /> and we appear, as far as I can judge, under section 3, to deal with property of persons who are not parties to the agreement which our legislation is designed to legalise.  I have held the rigid view that in this context we could easily do it in regard to other forms, or claim the right to do it in regard to other forms.</P>
    <P>The Minister is very careful to say that every provision in this Bill which relates to the property of the National Bank or the Bank of Ireland or the new entity which is coming into existence, the National Bank of Ireland or the Scotch Bank is contingent on the shareholders agreeing to the proposals set out in the Bill before us and if they do not agree he will not agree to this legislation operating at all.  There is no such reservation regarding the securities mentioned in section 3.  That strikes me as odd.  I can assure the Minister that I discussed this recently with an eminent banker in this city and he emphatically denied the possibility that such a provision could exist in the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I have covered it adequately already in the comment I have made, that I quite realise that the customers of the National Bank who are enjoying overdrafts from the National Bank will have deposited some securities for these overdrafts. Therefore, they will have pledged to some extent the custody of these securities, whether they are mortgage deeds or other realisable assets, to the National Bank only.  In the analogy presented by Deputy Dillon, if Barclays Bank took over Lloyds, that would be a transfer of ownership, perhaps, by purchase of shares.  It would be open to Barclays Bank, having purchased Lloyds, to say to Lloyds customers: &ldquo;You can withdraw your securities from us but we would prefer you to continue&rdquo;.  I take it that the same option would apply in the case of a person who has securities lodged now for the purpose of an overdraft from the National Bank to take these securities from the <Col N="151" /> new National Bank and to pay whatever obligation he has to the original National Bank to the new National Bank of Ireland.</P>

      <P>All right.  If he is not going back to the Bar in the immediate future, I wish him luck in whatever capacity he is going back because he is going out of there.  That is clear.  But, in his pre-ministerial <Col N="152" /> capacity, he was aware that if Deputy Dillon owes the Minister for Finance money and the Minister for Finance chooses to assign to Deputy Millar up there his security, not merely will Deputy Dillon have to pay the Minister for Finance the money but he will also have to pay the cost of assigning these securities to Deputy Millar.  This is to avoid (a) stamp duty to the Revenue Commissioners and (b) solicitors' charges and it is a damn good job that both are done and I am sorry the Minister did not make that quite clear from the beginning because I am sure it is in his brief.</P>

      <P>This is designed as a short cut.  It is designed, I have no doubt, to facilitate the customers of the respective banks.  Sometimes, in a desire to provide practical accommodation of this kind, you set a precedent which in itself is undesirable or which may be unconstitutional.  I know of no legislation in this House that has operated to transfer the property of a citizen of this State to anybody other than the transferee chosen by the owner of the property.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an analogy in the case stated by Deputy Sweetman and the case I have suggested to the Minister, that if the Midland Bank, at the jurisdiction of the British Government buys Lloyds Bank, Lloyds are entitled to transfer all securities to the Midland Bank, and if the Midland Bank says to a customer of Lloyds Bank, &ldquo;If you do not want to deal with us, liquidate your overdraft and transfer your securities,&rdquo; no legislation is required.  But, we are legislating &mdash; legislating &mdash; to the effect <Col N="153" /> that on the Minister making his order, automatically these securities will vest in an entirely new body which is being called into existence by this Bill.</P>
      <P>I fully appreciate that Deputy Sweetman is a practical man but he will observe that the Minister for Finance himself had some difficulty about this and took counsel.  He assures us he is advised that this thing could properly be done.  I can assure the Minister that I was assured by an eminent banker in this city that this thing could not conceivably be done, and when I said to him, &ldquo;But it is in the Bill&rdquo;, he denied it energetically and I asked him if he had read the Bill and he said he had not.</P>

      <P>The fact remains that practical considerations of this kind are fully understandable but they do not alter the fact that we are doing something that I do not believe has been done by the Legislature here before and I doubt, practical as this procedure may be, whether it desirable to do it now.  If we want to waive the costs&mdash;stamp fees, <i>et cetera, et cetera</i>&mdash;and if this is the sole object of this section, I see no reason why we should make provision that transfers of securities for the purpose set out in this section by customers of the bank concerned should be made free of stamp duty.  If this is done, the same purpose is achieved, but I admit that the National Bank of Ireland would be put to considerable additional trouble in re-negotiating with each individual customer the agreement under which he proposes to transfer his overdraft from the National Bank.  If the National Bank wants to put this scheme through, this is not unreasonable trouble, I think, to impose upon them and I suggest to the Minister that he might reflect on this again because, if his sole object is to save the bank and the customers expense, <Col N="154" /> he should make a special provision exempting the transactions in pursuit of legislation from stamp duty if completed within six months, or whatever period he chooses to name, of the date on which he brings the legislation into effect.</P>

      <P>We have a separate section dealing with stamp duty. While I was conscious of the facility for assigning debts and securities, etc., Deputy Sweetman observed that I was immersed in the constitutionality of the argument as presented by Deputy Dillon.  I was trying to answer him on that basis, but I think Deputy Sweetman has to a considerable extent answered the points raised by Deputy Dillon and, having regard to the advice on the constitutional issues, I am satisfied that this section is constitutional and will have the effect it is proposed it should have&mdash;in other words, to transfer securities from the former National Bank to the new legal entity, the National Bank of Ireland.</P>

      <P>Could I have a little clarification?  My mind is not attuned to the law like Deputy Sweetman's, Deputy Dillon's, and the Minister's.  If I have an overdraft of £5,000 and, as against that, I lodge £6,000 in Government securities, hoping they will live up to the sum they are supposed to represent, what is the position?  According to this section it is a transfer of a contract with the National Bank to the National Bank of Ireland.  Is that what the section purports to do and is that legal?  Is the Minister absolutely satisfied that, if we give the Minister this section, we are giving him something absolutely legal?  I am afraid I do not <Col N="155" /> understand Deputy Sweetman's argument at all.  It seems to me that he was suggesting there should be a separate contract with the bank concerned and that would mean that the unfortunate person, besides having an overdraft, would have to pay stamp duty as well, and the legal fees.</P>

      <P>While the Minister is collecting that information for Deputy Sweetman, I want to put it to him that, if you chose to give a mortgage to the Board of the National Bank, heretofore a company registered in London, and you are not consulted, no preliminary demand is made upon you, has Oireachtas Éireann the power by statute&mdash;the bank may have it&mdash;to transfer that mortgage from one mortgagee to another?  I confess I have my doubts.  The bank has it, but has Oireachtas Éireann got it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

      <P>Whatever it is transferring, has this Oireachtas the power to transfer the property&mdash;that is to say, of a person who is not a party to this transaction at all &mdash; from one legal person to another legal person?  I am certainly not satisfied that he has and I remember the Minister reassuring us that he would not contemplate bringing this piece of legislation into effect at all unless and until the owners &mdash;that is the shareholders&mdash;had themselves beforehand adopted the provisions of this Bill.  Then, and only then, would he consider bringing in legislation and I find it difficult to reconcile that with being asked to adopt section 3 dealing with the property of people who have not been consulted at all.  I want to go on record as expressing the gravest concern and as saying deliberately that the procedure here envisaged is a precedent from which I most emphatically dissent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>There does appear to be in this rather intricate piece of legislation a simple solution. While there seems to be a doubt in Deputy Dillon's mind, particularly about the right of the Oireachtas to legislate for the transfer, it is fairly obvious that unless something is done to bring about this situation, the people who have borrowed money from the bank and who have lodged collateral are going to be put to tremendous trouble and expense&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>They have to pay the transfer stamp duty and unless there is some provision made the stamp duty will be pretty substantial. I believe the way which is suggested by the Bill is the easiest way.  Perhaps it is not the best way to do it legally, but if the Minister has been assured by his legal advisers that it is possible legally to do what is suggested in the section, it should be done in this way, thereby saving a lot of trouble.  I am not so much worried about the cost or the trouble to the bank but I am rather perturbed about the tremendous amount of trouble and, possibly, expense which could fall on the borrower. <Col N="158" /> Goodness knows those who have overdrafts have troubles enough on their shoulders without having extra ones piled on as a result of the failure to provide for them in this Bill.</P>

      <P>I remember, when that railway was being transferred to CIE, the passionate indignation that swept this House when the first mortgage debenture holders received, I think, only £80 for every £100 of the debenture. I remember it being argued strongly here in this House that if the debenture holders went in and took over the railway company all they would have is a burden around their necks.  However, to pay 80 per cent on a first mortgage was fantastic.  As was said at the time, it may be true to say that if the mortgagers go in and take over the railway they take over not an asset but a liability, but if you elect to buy them out you must abide by the terms of the mortgagers, that is, they are entitled to £100 of every <Col N="159" /> £100 they have invested before anybody else gets anything.  Many of us at the time took the view that it was a very dangerous precedent to establish. What I am suggesting is that the transfer here envisaged may represent a practical solution to a difficult problem, but it sets a precedent which I think is highly dangerous.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister say if there is any other way in which the transfers can take place?  If this section is not included in the Bill there must be a period when the National Bank has gone out of existence and the new organisation is just starting.  The collateral is held by the National Bank.  The money is held by the people who own the overdrafts, but the new organisation, the National Bank of Ireland, holds no collateral legally for the money which has been advanced.  Therefore, if we do not do something about this, we are legally setting up a situation where the people <Col N="161" /> who have the overdraft can say: &ldquo;We have no contract with the new organisation.&rdquo; The other organisation has gone out of existence and, therefore, they can claim back their collateral and absolute chaos would result.  Is there any way in which the contract can be drawn up, other than this way, which would guarantee a continuation of the right of the bank to hold the collateral and of the borrowers to hold the money which they have drawn? Could the Minister say is there anyway in which it can be done?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We are bringing into existence a new body called the National Bank of Ireland.  The position would be, on foot of the agreement presumably, that the National Bank which is in existence, would undertake to the National Bank of Ireland: &ldquo;We will handle no customers now and therefore we will say to everyone of our customers in Ireland: either clear up your overdraft and we will give you back your securities or notify us to transfer your account and securities lodged therein to the National Bank of Ireland.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I quite agree that would be a formidable undertaking but do not forget that when they wanted the takeover to be approved, they sent out that document with a form of acceptance to every single shareholder of the National Bank.  Presumably a similar document has gone to the governor and Company of the Bank of Ireland and presumably to every shareholder of the National Commercial Bank.  All these are parties to the transaction. Does it not seem a bit odd that Oireachtas Éireann should step into the arena without reference at all to the customers of the bank?  We are going to shift them over, assets and <Col N="162" /> liabilities, <i>nolens volens</i> to the National Bank of Ireland.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Sweetman that this facilities the procedure but there are many easy ways of doing things that, in my opinion, we have to pay too high a price for.  Many of our fundamental liberties survive by virtue of the fact that the people who try to take them away from us know that if somebody appeals to the court, the court will interpose itself between us and the Executive and forbid it.  Many people of a practical turn of mind will say that only a crank will do that but cranks have as much right to survive as anybody and, vexatious as a crank may be, the Minister should not force us into the position of jeopardising fundamental rights because what we do today to a cranky borrower of the National Bank, we may do to a trade union the following morning or to an employers' organisation the day after.</P>
    <P>Then we are reminded that when we were only dealing with the borrowers or the National Bank in section 3, we passed that without comment. I want to be recorded as commenting most adversely on this procedure and as saying that whatever problem or whatever annoyance there is it cannot be very much trouble for each of these three participating banks to circulate this document I have in my hand to every shareholder they have, and I do not think it unreasonable for us to say: &ldquo;If you want facilities from Oireachtas Éireann to complete this transaction, you will have to proceed with very strict regard for the rights of those who have no one to speak for them in Oireachtas Éireann except people who interest themselves in abstract ideas.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In the troubled world in which we live, I see too many people deprived of fundamental rights because others want to take short cuts.  I attach great importance to fundamental rights and the moment we begin to abridge them in the name of efficiency, we put our foot on a slippery slope, at the bottom of which many serious pitfalls may lie.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to <Col N="163" /> Deputy Dillon's remarks about fundamental rights being taken away and action being taken, perhaps, against a trade union, action was taken against trade unions.  As I mentioned last night, in another place, two sides of the House joined to take that action and we were the only people objecting.  Luckily for everybody concerned, it did not have to be put into operation.</P>
      <P>I am not a lawyer and therefore I may not be able to grasp the fine points of this as others here may do, but from a layman's point of view, all I am interested in is this: if, say, there is a business man who has a working overdraft of £25,000, is there not a danger that unless this section is passed, the day may come when he is told that the National Bank no longer exists and that therefore he has no right to an overdraft there, that the National Bank of Ireland have not made any overdraft arrangements with him, that the only way this thing can be cleared up is for the National Bank to recall the £25,000, liquidate the debt, as Deputy Dillon says, and have the whole matter re-negotiated on different terms?  That may result in an industry closing down and people going out of employment and other undesirable consequences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this simply means what I believe it means, that it is necessary to do it in this way for the purpose of ensuring continuity, I think we should not make such a song and dance about it.  I do not think there is any suggestion of any attempt being made by either of the banks, the one going out or the one coming in, to take advantage of the borrower.  If there were, we might all consider it in a different way.  I agree with Deputy Dillon that the bank should have been able&mdash;I am quite sure they are able &mdash;to send the necessary documents to all their shareholders to ensure that the whole matter is covered, but I understand that the Minister and the Government believe that this measure is necessary in order to ensure there will be no hitch.  If so, I am prepared <Col N="164" /> to support the section.  It has not been proved to me so far that the section is not necessary.  That is the position as I see it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The layman's approach is often much more valuable than the professional or technical approach.  Deputy Tully has put his finger on it, in that if a customer of the National Bank, having securities lodged against an overdraft facility, objects to having these securities lodged with the National Bank of Ireland when it comes into existence, he has every right to say to the National Bank of Ireland: &ldquo;Give me back my securities and here is your £25,000.&rdquo;  That in effect is what happens, if he wants to do that.  But in order to avoid the National Bank of Ireland having to carry out new negotiations in respect of the value of the securities as against the value of the accommodation that has been extended, this section will facilitate both the new bank and the customers in making this transfer possible, without the necessity of going through all these individual negotiations.  I might say that there are six banks of the National Bank in the six counties of Northern Ireland.  There is no provision being made in respect of the people who have securities lodged there in respect of which they have overdrawn accounts.  In these six banks separate agreements will have to be made. There are 130 banks in this part of the country, and but for the assistance of this legislation, there would have to be a separate and new agreement negotiated between each of the various customers and every one of these 300 branches.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As has been pointed out, I can assign a debt as much as I can assign my own property.  A debt is as much my property as the tangible asset which I hold.  The debts due to the National Bank can be assigned to the National Bank of Ireland.  There is no question of offending against the Constitution there.  If somebody feels his security is in any way prejudiced or in any way jeopardised by reason of its transfer from the National Bank to the <Col N="165" /> National Bank of Ireland, he has every right to withdraw it on payment of whatever accommodation was made available to him.  It is an enabling section to obviate the necessity of the National Bank of Ireland going through the negotiations with each customer in the 26 Counties.  I think Deputy Tully's layman approach is the proper one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a much more fundamental reason than that which the Minister has given.  The Minister's explanation may be, if you like, the layman's approach of Deputy Tully, which I do not criticise at all, but the fundamental reason for this section is quite a simple one.  Again, I am sure it is in the brief.  This does not do anything that the bank cannot do of their own accord.  The National Bank can transfer all these securities to the National Bank of Ireland without this section.  Therefore, we are not in this section giving the bank or anybody else any rights that they have not got on their own.  We are in this section avoiding certain expense that there may be on the customers and the bank.  If the Minister made his case on that basis, as is the law, and as I am sure, is in his brief, we would be on much stronger&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Section 7.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 3 relates to securities.  The Minister said that £50 million was the amount involved&mdash;sixpence per cent or £12,500.  I am not good at mathematics but I am sure that the Minister or some of his advisers have worked out what sixpence per cent on £50 million is.  The plain fact of the matter is that the Minister has not put it on record, and therefore somebody has to put it on record for him, that the National Bank have at present in law the right to transfer these securities and the debts that are due to them to the National Bank of Ireland, whether or not the customers of the National Bank wish it.  If the <Col N="166" /> National Bank were to transfer to the National Bank of Ireland the debts due to the National Bank, and the securities that are due to the National Bank, then those customers in the National Bank will have to pay (a) stamp duty and (b) the costs that are involved in that transfer.</P>
      <P>With all respect to other people, there was a great argument against section 2.  Section 2 might very well be described as being unconstitutional, but section 3 does not give anybody any rights they have not got already. I am sorry I have to make a case for the Minister which the Minister has not made, but all section 3 does is by an Act to do what the National Bank has the power to do, not at its own expense but at the expense of its customers.  Because it is going to save the customers that money and cost the Minister, if you like, £12,500, I am glad he is doing it.</P>

      <P>(<i>South Tipperary</i>): I asked the Minister a question to which I did not hear a reply.  I asked him why a new legal entity, as he calls it, is being created here and not in Great Britain.  Neither did he give me a favourable reply to my question about why legislation was being introduced beforehand.  I will ask him a third question, that is, why was a simple merger not possible, without having to come to the House at all? At present there are plenty of international mergers going on; there are insurance companies in Great Britain forming mergers with insurance companies on the Continent with a view to entering the Common Market.  The Commercial Insurance Company, which is a widely known insurance company, and which we all know about, is at the moment forming a merger, in order to form a new company, with two German insurances, one of which is in Munich.  I am sure there will be no difficulty about the transfer of assets or liabilities in respect of their customers between these companies, not to speak of shares.  I have not heard of them going to the German Government or to the House of Commons to have legislation introduced. I am still baffled as to why a simple merger was not sufficient and why legislation creating a legal entity was desirable here and apparently is not necessary in Great Britain.  From the Minister's speech, with all respect to him, and from the discussion so <Col N="168" /> far, and I have listened attentively.  I have been unable to grasp why.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This strange procedure arises here again.  A person, who is not party to this legislation at all, has placed his securities, his documents, goods and other property with the National Bank.  I do not want to embark on a long discourse on the implications of the law on bailment but the bailee of a customer's goods knows there are a number of very elaborate common law liabilities from which the bailee can discharge himself only by well recognised procedure.  As I understand section 5 of this Bill, we relieve the National Bank Limited of all liability as bailee.  I do not clearly see in the section the effect of the words &ldquo;to create the liability of a bailee&rdquo; in the National Bank of Ireland Limited for goods transferred. It may be there but it has escaped me. I would be glad to have my attention drawn to those words in this or some other section, if they are there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dillon obviously knows the implications involved in the obligations of bailment.  This section transfers those obligations from what has been described the transferor to the transferee; in other words, the new holder of the bail would have the same obligations to the bailor as the present holder has. Therefore, that secures the interests of the bailor in respect of his goods.  On the other hand, on transfer, he is entitled to withdraw his goods or his securities from bailment.  Therefore, so long as he will have them <Col N="172" /> there, the new bailee has the same obligations to him as the present one has.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I have differed from Deputy Dillon in regard to some earlier sections but so far as this section is concerned, the Minister has completely failed to make the proper case made by Deputy Dillon in relation to this section. This section, in fact, does what was suggested in an earlier section with regard to the right of private property. This section means that somebody who had some property and who entrusts it to A is no longer able to look to A to give him back his property.  He must look for a new person, B, to give him back his property.  That, to put it mildly, is a dangerous procedure. The Minister would be wiser if, in relation to this section, he met, frankly and sincerely, the difficulties in relation to the transfer of private property that we are concerned with here in this section.  There could be a very grave constitutional argument in relation to that.</P>
      <P>This could be contrary to the section of the Constitution which deals with private property.  If a customer has certain property of his in the custody of the National Bank, the effect of this section is to exonerate the National Bank from all liability in connection with that property and to say that a new entity, recently formed, is to take over that responsibility.  It is, if you like, travelling far in relation to the rights of private property so to delegate the rights of the customer.  And there has been no suggestion by the Minister, no argument advanced by the Minister, no even tentative argument put forward, as to why this is necessary for the effective arrangement of the merger, adaptation, take-over&mdash;call it what you will.  The fact, of course, is that the whole operation being carried through could be carried through without the Minister bringing in any Bill at all but it would have the effect of individual persons keeping and retaining their rights against the National Bank.  The Minister coming in here and giving <i>carte blanche</i> exemption to the National Bank against the customers in respect of that has a duty to explain why it is necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="173" /> So far as section 3 is concerned, I, for one, feel his duty is discharged when it is made clear that, by that section, he avoids the stamp duty on the transfer which would otherwise be operative and which is exempt also under section 7, but in addition, he avoids the cost of the transaction, which would be very substantial and which would otherwise be added to the customer.  But there is no advantage whatever to the customer in section 5.  Section 5 does nothing except exclude the existing National Bank from any liability.  Why should it be excluded?  We have not heard any reason given by the Minister.  If the Minister is going to exclude a person&mdash;and I use &ldquo;person&rdquo; in its legal sense of a corporate entity&mdash; from any liability, then it is up to the Minister, when he brings in a section of that type, to make a case, but he has made no case in relation to this section.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon is entirely right when he says this section is a precedent which will be used again and again for infringement of the rights of personal property.  Before it could be accepted in that way, it would be up to the Minister, or whoever has been or will be in the near future sitting in his seat, to explain clearly to the House why this is not something which will be a precedent for all time.</P>

      <P>We are arriving at the astonishing stage where a heavy silence falls in the House, and that is that. These are complex matters in which, very often, the House takes little interest but I have been long enough a member of this House to see precedents casually created because they had their origin in something which was complex and which had little popular appeal.  I think the right to private property is a very important thing, not so important to somebody maybe who has too much of it, but it can be very important indeed to somebody who has just sufficient to carry on.  It can be extremely important to organisations or bodies of people who come together for their mutual protection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I see in sections 2 and 3 the encroachment which Deputy Sweetman has made clear.  He appreciates at least more fully my problem in regard to section 5.  The Minister said, in effect: &ldquo;Well, I am giving the bailor as good a security as he had&rdquo;, but I do not think we have the right to put ourselves in the position of the bailor. It is for him to determine that.  We have no right to say quite casually: &ldquo;You chose to deposit your treasure, <Col N="175" /> whatever it is, with the National Bank. We are now releasing the National Bank from the liability it undertook to you and transferring that to the National Bank of Ireland, in as much as we believe it is just as good a security, that the transfer will be deemed to be made by virtue of an Act of Parliament passed by this House&rdquo;.  Suppose it turns out that it is not as good a security, what happens then, or what moral position are we in then?  Suppose something did miscarry and it transpired that the security was not as good&mdash;but I do not envisage such a practical possibility in this country.  Suppose it did arise, is it as serious as it is suggested, that an Act which effectively deprived someone of part of his property, passed by this Oireachtas, would stand.  Think of the confusion that would be created, were the Supreme Court to declare this Act unconstitutional.  That would be really something, as compared with the trouble and difficulties created if we did not pass sections 3 and 5.  I have the feeling that the Minister for Finance has accepted this Bill on the recommendation of the Bank of Ireland and their advisors as being a very simple way&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I can best proceed by analogy.  As far as the question of constitutionality is concerned, Deputy Sweetman raised the point of bailment in particular and suggested that what we propose to do here under that law is not constitutional.  If I, as a private individual, hold the goods of somebody else on bail for any purpose&mdash; for fees, as security for advances of money I have made&mdash;&mdash;</P>

In my place will come the National Bank of Ireland and when it comes into existence, if it comes into existence, my intention is to transfer to that new entity the goods I hold on your behalf&rdquo;.  The bailor who has made the deposit of the goods may say: &ldquo;I shall withdraw my goods.  I do not wish the National Bank of Ireland to hold them&rdquo;.  However, if the National Bank of Ireland does hold them, what we are saying is that the obligation the National Bank had in respect of these goods will be transferred to the National Bank of Ireland.  That is all we are providing for.</P>

      <P>This deals with staff of the existing National Bank.  The last paragraph of the section reads:</P>
      <P>Provided that for the purpose of ascertaining and calculating the right to pension or superannuation benefits, service or employment with the transferor shall be taken into account as if it were service or employment with the transferee but the transfer of service or employment from the transferor to the transferee shall not, of itself, give rise to any claim to pension or superannuation benefits.</P>

      <P>I should also like clarification on portion of this section. It appears as if a precedent is being set by it.  I do not know so much about what has been discussed earlier &mdash;it was difficult to follow&mdash;but it is easy to understand a situation where in State or semi-State employment it has been the practice for a number of years, on the merger of two companies, that if the person employed wishes to be transferred with full pension rights that is all right.  But if he does not wish to be transferred for one of a hundred different reasons, that may be allowed, with pension and superannuation scheme in existence. My interpretation of this section is that employment is being offered at similar status, similar pay and similar pension rights in the new concern but if staff members do not accept, they must leave the service without any compensation whatsoever. Would the Minister explain if I am interpreting the section correctly?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>No. The short answer to the Deputy is that existing rights of National Bank personnel are completely safeguarded.  If somebody wishes to leave the service of the National Bank on its going out of existence&mdash;if he does not wish to transfer to the National Bank of Ireland&mdash;he is entitled to whatever pension rights he enjoyed.  If he goes into the service of the National Bank of Ireland, he carries forward to his new service the rights he has picked up.</P>

      <P>What Deputy Esmonde fears is covered in the section.  However, I should like to get clarification on the last paragraph of the section which states:</P>
      <P>Provided that for the purpose of ascertaining and calculating the right to pension or superannuation benefits, service or employment with the transferor...</P>
      <P>That seems to me to suggest that he carries his service with him, but the section continues:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>... but the transfer of service or <Col N="179" /> employment from the transferor to the transferee shall not, of itself, give rise to any claim to pension or superannuation benefits.</P>
    <P>The Minister says this means an official cannot say: &ldquo;I am entitled to a pension from the National Bank of Ireland in which I can subsequently establish a right to a further pension or gratuity.&rdquo; That is the Minister's explanation.  One can also interpret it as stating that if a person decided he wants to terminate his employment in banking he is not entitled, on doing that, to avail of the superannuation and pension rights he had accumulated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>When I was practising law, I always thought it good to go to the <i>locus in quo</i> and look at the scene.  In the same context, I think it is a good idea to give a practical example of a man who has been 30 years in the service of the National Bank.  The National Bank goes out of existence.  He continues for a further ten years in the service of the new bank, the National Bank of Ireland. For his 30 years service he has the full value of whatever superannuation benefits he has built up, and added to that he can get his ten years' service in the National Bank of Ireland. Therefore, he has 40 years' service. If, instead of getting that 30 years plus ten continuous service, he says he now has 30 years plus ten years under this section he has also ten years in the service of the new bank and he seeks superannuation rights for the 40 years plus the superannuation rights for the new ten years he has built up, he just does not get that.  He gets one continuous period for reckoning purposes.  The purpose of these words at the end of the section is to preclude the possibility of his claiming for 40 years continuous service plus 10 years extra service.</P>

      <P>Could the Minister tell us how many employees are involved in the transfer?  I mentioned earlier that there were 300 branches in this country.  I understand I am entirely wrong in that.  I think there are about 315 or 318 branches between here and Northern Ireland.  I gather that the National Bank has more employees than any other bank in the State, with the exception of the Minister and Leinster Bank.  I do not know the number myself.  Perhaps the Minister could give us some indication as to how many there are?</P>
      <P>Since the Minister is introducing this Bill on the direction of the Bank of Ireland, could he tell us if there is any guarantee of full employment or if he has received any information as to whether there will be any reduction in personnel or not?  One of the reasons given for the merger is apparently that it will create greater efficiency. Greater efficiency often means less employment.  There is considerable apprehension among the employees of the National Bank, not so much that they will be thrown out with nothing at all but that some may be retired at the prime of life to make way for other people.  Can the Minister give the House a guarantee that the employment will continue, even though the name of the bank is changed and even though that bank is unfortunately going to be swallowed up by another bank, and so allay the anxiety of a great many personnel many of whom are married, have families and are looking to the future?</P>

I understand also that there is no question whatever about the security of employment of each of these people being in any way prejudiced. Not only that, but I am told on inquiry that inspectors went round to each branch of the National Bank and gave such an assurance to the staffs of each of the branches concerned. I understand from statements made by the Governor of the Bank of Ireland that in the new set-up they propose to have heads of branches, which will make for more efficient administration of the banks' business and more satisfaction to the public. Even with this new delegation of functions there is no question whatever of redundancy arising.  On the contrary, I believe there may be greater opportunities for promotion.</P>

If they give a guarantee of continued employment what they mean is a guarantee for those in existing employment but not a guarantee of continued jobs.

      <P>Section 7 is the section which deals with the rates of stamp duty liable under transfer of credit and debit accounts in the National Bank to the National Bank of Ireland.  But it says, at the end of that, in the explanatory memorandum: &ldquo;It is not proposed to charge duty on the transfer of these accounts.  Exemptions are not being granted in respect of the conveyances of real property&rdquo;.  To me, &ldquo;real property&rdquo; seems to mean the transfer of the bank buildings.

      <P>Deputy Sweetman suggested I should have dealt with this matter in section 3.  This is the section under which the value of the securities and the value of the deposits are not taken into account because they are not assets.  They might be capable of being put on a balance sheet, and stamp duty paid to what was put on the balance sheet, but it would be unfair to ask the people involved in the transaction to pay the stamp duty. Therefore, it was thought fair and reasonable to confine the payment of <Col N="184" /> stamp duty to the value of the real property which, as Deputy Esmonde has said, are the buildings, the actual bricks and mortar involved&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a valuation of bank premises.  The balance sheet is very careful to say so.  It says that there are bank premises and other properties, at cost, less the amounts written off.  The balance sheet makes no pretence that this is a recent or a realistic valuation of this property.  It brings to the attention of the shareholders the fact that it is not realistic and is not recent: it is less whatever sums the directors may in the meantime have written off.  That valuation of premises is neither real nor realistic. It is notorious that some of the premises have been in the bank's hands since Daniel O'Connell was wearing his hat.  We are assured that they appear in the balance sheet at what they cost less whatever sums the directors may in the meantime have written off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister will now appreciate the reason why I asked him the question and why I was so anxious to find out if, in fact, this will do what the Minister says it will do.  Could we now have some information as to whether or not a valuation will be carried out and, if it is, if there will be a realistic value and if this will considerably alter the whole situation?  It does appear that what Deputy Dillon says is correct and that what is contained in the balance sheet shows a very much lower valuation than the actual cost of the erection of the buildings, not to talk of their present-day value.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>There were two items subject to stamp duty, that is, the duty on capital increases which is apart from the buildings and the duty on the buildings themselves.  This is a matter for negotiation between the Revenue Commissioners, my Department and the people involved.  The total amount of duty payable is consistent with the amount attributable <Col N="186" /> to the value of the bank premises, having regard to a recent valuation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite recently, I asked the Minister a question.  My suggestion was that, on his raising £2¾ million, they would vest in him every premises belonging to the National Bank which he would be free to sell on the open market.  Does he seriously suggest that there would be no profit to be made on that transaction?  I am not a shareholder in the National Bank.  I do not know why I should worry so much about them, but does the Minister think that the valuation of £2,818,964 is a realistic present valuation of all the properties belonging to the National Bank?  I think it would be much better for the Minister, seeing that he is sponsoring this legislation, to meet these kinds of questions headon because these questions are being asked.  There are small shareholders in the bank.  They cannot be blamed for feeling that over and above their own directors the Minister for Finance has some responsibility to protect their interests in view of the fact that he is sponsoring this legislation.</P>
      <P>I do not believe there is anybody in Dáil Éireann who regards a figure of £2,818,964 as a realistic valuation of these properties but I should like to hear the Minister say that he does if that is his honest opinion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister hear my mind on the subject? If I understand Deputy Tully, he is asking the Minister to increase, I think astronomically, the valuation of the various branches in the country as real estate.  If that is so, and the value is increased to a very large extent, there will be very much greater stamp duty payable on it at the expense of the shareholders.  Does anybody want that?  It is the shareholders who will be paying it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely Deputy Costello does not suggest that simply because it happens to be a bank that is transferring and shareholders are involved it should be able to say that <Col N="187" /> the property is worth very much less than it is, in fact, worth?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. J.A. Costello Mr. J.A. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course I do not, but what I want to know is what we are at.  Are we increasing the value in order to make the shareholders pay more stamp duty?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Usually when property is being sold, as in this case, a realistic value of the property is set up for the purpose of stamp duty.  Is there to be an exception because a bank is involved?  Are we to say that everybody else must have a realistic valuation but that the bank must not? The 130 branches throughout the country, plus the head offices in Dublin and the property in Britain, we are told, are worth a relatively small sum and it is suggested now that we should not interfere with what they say, that we should ask the Minister for Finance to close his eyes to the fact that they are worth very much more.  If that is to be the situation, then let us do it, but let us do it with every type of property passing from one person to another and liable to stamp duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the point.  The shareholders are the owners, I presume, of the bank.  The bank is administered by the directors. The shareholders are the owners and entitled to get the full value of the bank.  You cannot have it both ways. Apparently, the value of the premises has been whittled down considerably. Therefore, the value of the shares the shareholders hold has been brought down.  I do not agree with that but there is no reason why anybody should try to create the impression here that the banks are valued at a very low price for the sole reason of trying to get increased duty paid to the State. I do not think Deputy Tully will find himself very popular with any shareholders who are considerable in number and who may vote for him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>May I try to resolve this?  The revaluation of the premises, as I said, was a very recent one and it <Col N="188" /> was done to assess the value of the property for the purpose of the transfer and the value of the property for the purposes of payment of stamp duty.  That revaluation amounts to about £3.5 million as far as the property of the National Bank in Ireland is concerned.  It is on that basis the shares were assessed.  It is on that basis the stamp duty on the property in Ireland was assessed.</P>

As far as I am concerned, I do not mind whether there are shareholders in a bank who may change their opinion of me as a result of what I am saying here tonight.  All I am saying is that if the property is undervalued, something should be done about it, or alternatively we should decide that in future when property changes hands, we should accept values 100 years old and let it apply to everybody.</P>

      <P>When the debate was adjourned, I was dealing with Deputy Cluskey's reference to Ballymun and to the failure of the consortium to hand over houses to Dublin Corporation. Deputy Cluskey did state that a number of houses, built by the traditional builders, had been handed over recently to the corporation.  In the month of January, according to my information, 64 houses were handed over&mdash;six houses in Infirmary Road and 58 houses in the Coolock-Kilmore area.  I shall leave the other points raised by the Deputy in relation to Ballymun to be dealt with by the Minister.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;there are local authorities, which are well geared and which will spend any money they are given, but there are possibly others not geared to spend the money and the last thing any of us would want is to have money lying around in a local authority because of lack of planning or lack of initiative on the part of the local authority, particularly in view of the fact that money is not as plentiful as we would like it to be.

      <P>Some local authorities are much more active than others.  We all know that.  It would be a pity if some local authority down the country got a certain amount of money and did not build houses, while, at the same time, Dublin Corporation were bursting at the seams, in dire need of money in order to keep going, and we could not give it to them.  That is an aspect we have to consider seriously because it would not be desirable to make money available to a local authority if that local <Col N="194" /> authority was unanxious to avail of it.</P>

      <P>We send up good workmen and the Deputy is only too anxious to avail of their services and intelligence.  Why should you not house them?</P>
      <P>There was some discussion, too, in the course of the debate in relation to cost.  Deputy Larkin, Deputy Tully and others referred to the increased cost of house-building.  It applies largely, I think, to SDA houses.  The Minister has introduced a section in this Bill which will empower him to deal with this, if it is brought to his notice.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaugeBrennan" hpid="Mr. P. Brennan Mr. P. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Brennan</NameTxt>

      <P>Then he will have to stay in his bad housing conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaugeBrennan" hpid="Mr. P. Brennan Mr. P. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the contractor who will be punished.  It is not just as simple as some people think.  It was generally thought up to now that one of the governing factors was the floor area, the cost per square foot.  Because a man pays £3,250 or £4,000 for a house, it does not necessarily follow that he has got a good bargain.  He may get a good house or he may get a substandard house.  Irrespective of whether the house costs £3,000 or £6,000, the Minister would be anxious <Col N="195" /> to do something about the latter.  One can get good and bad houses, good and bad bargains, in both categories.</P>
      <P>Reference was made also to the cost of local authority houses.  As I said earlier, if the members of the local authorities co-operate with the Minister in his efforts to bring down prices, something can be achieved.  I cited the case of the local authority with which the Minister had talks six weeks ago.  As a result of the conference which was arranged between the engineers of the local authority, the Department and the contractor who was getting the job, a substantial reduction in the cost was brought about without adversely affecting the houses in any way.  When that local authority first came to the Minister, they had a feeling that the scheme was being held up for lack of finance and that is not the case, although there are times when the Minister does try to have economies effected in order to get the price of the houses down to a realistic figure.  Apart altogether from the fact that we have not as much money as we would like to have, we could get more houses built if efforts were made to have them constructed at a more reasonable cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having dealt with the motion, I should like to take this opportunity of dealing with the Bill.  It is a comprehensive Bill containing some 116 sections.  There was a good deal of discussion on it and, on behalf of the Minister and myself, I should like to thank the Deputies from the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party for their co-operation and their contributions. Both Deputy Clinton and Deputy Tully spent hours here discussing each section and there is no doubt that, as a result of this, there is very little about Housing Acts or the Housing Bill these Deputies do not know.  The fact that there were only three divisions on the whole of the Committee Stage of the Bill is an indication of the way in which the Bill was originally drafted and put before the House.  The Minister was reasonable in his approach. He tried to meet the wishes of the Opposition Deputies when he was <Col N="196" /> satisfied that doing so would bring about an improvement in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The suggestion in the motion put down by the Fine Gael Party that there has been a decline in the number of houses erected in recent years cannot be substantiated.  The facts show that there has been a substantial increase in the number of houses built, particularly in the present decade.  The amount of money provided this year is over £20 million and the amount of money provided in 1960-61 was less than half.  Next year we hope to spend at least £1 million more than is spent in the present year.  Therefore, I do not know how the people in the Fine Gael Party can say there has been a decline in housebuilding operations.  We hope to erect houses on the same scale as was done during this year and to build something like 11,000 new houses which is in keeping with the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> which envisages the erection of 12,000 to 14,000 by 1970.  We can only do this if the money is available. Unfortunately we have more proposals than we have money to cover them, but what is important is that whatever schemes are approved the money will be there to pay for them.  We are making strides towards relieving the problem in relation to many thousands of our people, not alone in the city of Dublin but all over the country who are badly in need of houses.</P>
    <P>There is no real basis for the argument put forward by the Fine Gael Party and I am satisfied they were merely availing of an opportunity to try to score political points.  The amount of money we are providing this year is a record and next year we intend to provide £1 million more, which will be another record, and I feel confident we shall reach our target by 1970.  If that is achieved, the Minister will have gone a long way towards solving the housing problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. J.A. Costello Mr. J.A. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one matter arising out of a particular section in the Bill to which I wish to draw attention.  It is a matter which will seriously affect a number of my constituents in a certain part of my <Col N="197" /> constituency where my colleague, Deputy Moore, is also concerned. Under section 22 as it stands, there is, in certain circumstances, power for the Minister to give a grant for the reconstruction of houses where those houses, or parts of them, have been damaged by flooding.  Section 22 is a precise reproduction of section 4 of the Houses (Loans and Grants) Act, 1962.  That Act is proposed to be repealed by this measure.  Under section 4 of that Act, applications were made by a number of my constituents in Anglesea Road for grants to effect repairs necessary because of damage caused by the extensive flooding that occured in and around Anglesea Road as a result of the overflowing of the Dodder some time before Christmas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put down a question in this connection at the time, and the reply the Minister gave to me led me and, unfortunately, my constituents, to the belief that the Minister had power to give grants to deal with the very serious effects of the flooding involving the payment of a large amount of money by a number of these people. When somebody, on behalf of the association which has been formed as a result of the flooding, applied to the Minister for the grant, he was told the Minister had no power to give a grant.  The section undoubtedly gives <Col N="198" /> the Minister discretionary power to give grants for this purpose.  Although the answer the Minister gave suggested to me there was no question that he could exercise his discretion, the case made by the officials of the Department was that the Minister had no power.  Apparently the basis for that suggestion was that the portions of the houses that were damaged and had to be reconstructed at very serious expense were the boundary and side walls of the gardens of the houses. This had occurred in the previous flooding in other houses and perhaps in regard to some of the houses with which I am concerned now.  The Minister's officials said they could only give grants for houses.  If that is the situation&mdash;and this is being carried on in section 22 of this Bill; it is a precise copy of the other section to which I referred&mdash;I want the Minister, in order to clear up doubts, to amend that when he brings this Bill to the Seanad.  I personally think there is no doubt, but the Minister's officials say the house cannot include the boundary wall of the front or back garden.</P>

      <i>(x)</i>Assumes that a Messenger has 40 years established service which due to the relatively recent decision to make this an established grade would not have been possible by February, 1966.</P>
    <P>
      <i>(y)</i>Pensions have been calculated at 40/60ths of retiring pay rather than 40/80ths for comparison purposes.  The 80ths system applies only to female officers recruited after the passing of the Superannuation Act, 1954, and to those recruited before that date who opted for the provisions of the Act.</P>
    <P>NOTE: Pensions awarded in 1938 and 1951 have since been increased under the Pensions (Increase) Acts, 1950-64.</P>

    <P>GENERAL NOTES:&mdash;The estimate of the change in the value of money is based on the level of the Consumer Price Index at Mid-August 1938, mid-February 19 51 and mid-November 1965.  The change in the volume of Gross National Product is estimated by valuing the Gross National Product for the years 1938, 1 938, 1951 and 1965 at constant 1958 prices; the 1965 estimate is provisional.</P>
    <P>For comparison purposes, the details for Shorthand Typists (now Clerk-Typists) relate to those recruited before 1 July, 1960.</P>
    <P>In calculating salary net of tax for purposes of part <i>(c)</i> of the question, officers on the minima of scales A and B and on the maximum of scal e A have been regarded as single without dependants and officers on the maximum of scale B as married men with dependent wife and no other dependants.</P>
