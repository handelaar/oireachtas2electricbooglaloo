    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power the number of CIE retired pensioners with pensions of 30/- per week or less.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>2.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephMcLoughlin" hpid="Mr. McLaughlin Mr. McLaughlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McLaughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power if he will consider increasing the pension allowance to retired CIE employees who are now in receipt of pensions ranging from £1 to £3 and in some cases to £4 after many years' service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers) Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
      <P>The number of CIE pensioners now in receipt of CIE pensions of 30/- per week or less is 1,914.</P>
      <P>The levels of pension and contributions provided for in CIE wages grade pension schemes took into account the social welfare benefits to which members would be entitled on retirement. Thus at 70 years of age a married CIE pensioner in receipt of 30/- CIE pension has a total pension and social welfare benefit income of £6 17s 6d per week and a single pensioner has £4 10s a week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unless the existing members of the CIE wages grade pension scheme were prepared to agree to an amendment of the scheme to provide for an increase in the rates of pension payable to existing <Col N="830" /> pensioners, the full cost of any such increase would fall to be borne by CIE on an <i>ex gratia</i> basis.  The Deputies are already fully aware of the difficult financial position of the Board at the present time and of the causes of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I inquire from the Minister how he considers it fair play that practically 2,000 pensioners have less than 30s a week to live on?  How does he reconcile that with the pension and other moneys given by CIE, who are now admitted to be in poor financial circumstances, to Dr. Andrews?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to the fact that a very great improvement has been made since the Deputy's Government were in office.  In 1956, a single man was in receipt of a total old age pension of £2 4s and a married man, whose wife was not able to get an old age pension, was receiving £2 4s a week.  Allowing for the change in the value of money since that time, the increase in pension in the case of the single man is 40 per cent and 120 per cent in the case of a married man.  This can be related to the general overall increase in the incomes of the community of one-third so we are making progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister seriously say that progress has been made by CIE under Dr. Andrews when we have fewer miles of railways, fewer railway stations, canals closed down, with a closing down of lock houses and railway stations?  Surely the Minister cannot describe that as progress?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy bothered to listen to the Estimate, he would find that the number of passenger miles has increased, despite the closing of the railways, that freight haulage has gone up some 58 per cent during the period of office of Dr. Andrews, that the bus passenger service also went up and CIE have got £1 million worth of package deals. The loss, as a whole, would be between £3 million and £4 million, <Col N="831" /> compared with a current loss of £2 million a year.  I do not understand what the Deputy is referring to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Opposition continue in this vein, it will be impossible to get any competent persons whatever to take part in the life of nationalised companies.  There has been a lot of propaganda about Dr. Andrews and his salary and retirement benefit.  If the Deputy is made aware of the fact that to get a competent sales manager for a private industry with a turnover of £250,000 requires a salary of £3,000 to £4,000, then perhaps the Deputy will stop talking as he has been.  This kind of talk only brings into disrepute the appointment of any person to any State company in any capacity and well the Deputy knows it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government the steps which are taken to ensure that tar purchased for road making and maintenance is prepared entirely from crude tars produced as a by-product of the high temperature <Col N="836" /> carbonisation of coal in retorts or in coke ovens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>10.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government the annual amount of tar purchased under the joint purchasing scheme; the number, frequency and quantity of samples thereof (a) taken and (b) tested to ensure compliance with the schedule of requirements for road tar provided in BSS 76: 1943; and by whom the tests are conducted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 10 together.</P>
      <P>As stated in my reply to a related question on the 17th May, 1966, the standard of quality of road tar is ensured by the conditions of appointment of the official contractors who supply it to local authorities, by the checking of deliveries by the road engineers of these authorities, and by laboratory tests in appropriate cases.  In addition, the manufacture and production of the commodity may be inspected on my behalf should the need arise.</P>
      <P>The annual amount of tar purchased under the combined purchasing scheme is approximately 15,000 tons. Three samples in all have been taken and tested in recent years, in accordance with the statutory procedure under the combined purchasing scheme.  These tests were made by the State Laboratory and the sample proved satisfactory in each case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister send an inspector into the works where the tar is manufactured?  My information is that part of the tar is manufactured from Segas and from CWG, which is in direct conflict with the specifications laid down, and that this is producing a tar which the engineers believe is up to specification but which my information leads me to believe is not.  It is because this tar is lacking in the necessary binding properties that local authorities are having so much difficulty with tar on our roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is surely aware, the particulars of appointment for the suppliers state that the road tar shall be prepared entirely from crude <Col N="837" /> tars produced as a by-product of high-temperature carbonisation of coal in retorts or in coke ovens.  This has been the standard requirement for quite a number of years and I have no reason to believe it is not followed.  In so far as inspections are concerned, they are being carried out, but if the Deputy has any information that would warrant an immediate inspection other than the normal routine inspections, I should be glad to have a spot check carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>My information is that the manufacturers prepare almost daily sheets showing the tar manufactured and from what it is manufactured.  I respectfully ask the Minister to have these sheets inspected.  They will show that a considerable proportion of the ten per cent gas is manufactured definitely outside the specifications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister any complaints from local authorities that there has been a considerable amount of damage to roads this year which were freshly tarred because, if rain comes immediately before or after the tarring, the tar lifts and an entire day's work can be spoiled by a shower of rain?  This has been particularly so this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of it. I would not say it has not happened before this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Not on such a big scale.  Would the Minister inquire from the local authorities if it has been widespread this year?  It might prove Deputy Ryan's point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>If we could have from the Deputies what they are trying to prove, it might make my task easier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister wants proof, he can find it from engineers employed by local authorities. A considerable amount of tar put on soon after a shower&mdash;sometimes six or seven hours after or before a shower&mdash; has been lifting.  Some of it has been carried from one county to another on wheels of vehicles and perhaps some counties will have their tarring done for nothing.</P>

      <P>Representative comparable figures are not available.  I would refer the Deputy to paragraphs 118 to 126 of the Survey Team on the Bacon and Pigmeat Industry, published in 1963, about the difficulty of making reliable comparisons.

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries why onions are practically unobtainable in Ireland at the present time; how import licences are regulated; and who gets such licences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>In the interest of home onion production, import licences for onions are not normally granted each year in the period from 16th May until the home crop has been disposed of.  Licences are granted thereafter without restriction up to 16th May.</P>
      <P>Onion supplies have recently been affected because of lower than normal imports by traders in the period preceding the 16th May and by some depletion of stocks resulting from sales to Northern Ireland.  As an exceptional measure, licences have been granted this year for the importation of an additional quantity of onions, in order to maintain supplies until the home crop becomes available.  Licences for this additional quantity were given to those who imported during the unrestricted period.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries if he is aware that the Guernsey Tomato Board, knowing that they had the only supplies of British tomatoes available, decided that they would supply only two importers and send less than half the quantity required with the consequence that they were able to obtain sixpence to 1/- per pound more than in the United Kingdom markets; and what action he proposes to take in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The information available to me shows that the suggestions made in the question are unfounded.</P>
      <P>The arrangement under which the Guernsey Tomato Board sends supplies through two agents here has been in operation for many years.  I propose to review the position generally before next season.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not true to say that tomatoes were normally imported here by 22 importers&mdash;11 principal importers&mdash;and that the Minister, in fact, issued his licences on the basis that these two importers got less than half of the total licences and, if tomatoes were not normally imported by at least 11 importers, the Minister, surely, would not have issued his licences in this way; and is it not wrong that the British should be allowed to monopolise this business and impose conditions through the Agreement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is confusing the open period which exists up to 7th May, when tomatoes can be imported freely and for which all the <Col N="848" /> various people involved are issued with licences, with the period after 7th May, when no imports of tomatoes are permitted, except the 850 tons we are committed to under our Trade Agreement to allow in from the UK during what we call the closed period.  In that closed period, licences are still issued to all of the importers concerned but the Guernsey Board restricts its exports to this country to two firms.  That is not of my doing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries what progress has been made with the pilot area established a few years ago in County Donegal; and if it is a fact that lack of capital is the principal brake on the development of farms in the pilot area; and that only a small proportion of the farmers in this area are now full time engaged in farming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Pilot Area Development Programme only commenced in Donegal in February of last year and, although the programme is essentially a long-term one, the results to date have been most encouraging. Notable developments in the Donegal pilot area have been the organisation, for the first time, of creamery milk production; the completion of a successful lime and fertiliser campaign; the <Col N="850" /> organisation of joint activity in land drainage, group water schemes and co-operative transport of livestock; and the erection of new farm buildings.</P>
      <P>In Donegal, as in the West generally, one of the problems is to get credit facilities widely availed of, and indeed this, and not lack of credit facilities, is one of the major problems which the advisers in the pilot areas are having to contend with.</P>
      <P>As to the final part of the Deputy's question, since a high proportion of the farmers in the Donegal pilot area have holdings under 30 acres, it is understandable that a number of them seek to supplement their incomes from farming.</P>

      <P>As I have already conveyed to the Irish Nurses' Organisation, I have accepted the principle of a general superannuation scheme for the staffs of voluntary hospitals receiving grants out of the Hospitals Trust Fund in recoupment of revenue deficits, and also for district nurses employed by voluntary agencies.  Every effort will be made to avoid delay in the implementation of such a scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The superannuation schemes are completed.  The details must be worked out before the scheme is put into effect.  This is being done. The scheme will end the disadvantage which nurses in some voluntary hospitals suffer as compared with their counterparts in local authority hospitals with regard to provision for their retirement.  The terms of this scheme will compare favourably with the local government superannuation code relating to corresponding staffs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the Deputy's question relates to public health nurses.</P>
      <P>I have recently authorised health authorities to pay mileage rates to such nurses working in rural areas, instead of paying fixed allowances, as had previously been the practice.  I have also authorised an increase in the fixed travelling allowances of nurses in mainly urban areas, the upper limit being raised from £50 to £100 a year.</P>
      <P>In the Dublin area the health authority issues vouchers for bus tickets to the majority of its public health nurses for travelling on nursing duties.  A few nurses in Dublin have opted for fixed allowances in lieu of this arrangement. No doubt these allowances will be reviewed by the Dublin Health Authority in view of the recent increase in bus fares.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;of the shortage of dental surgeons in the public dental service, and of the disappointing results of recent competitions conducted by the Local Appointments Commissioners for the recruitment of such staff.  Since the shortage of dental surgeons in the public service is attributable, in the main, to the general shortage of qualified dentists in this country and in Britain, I am not in a position to say when an adequate number of dental surgeons will be available.</P>
      <P>The steps to be taken to overcome this difficulty are at present under active consideration in my Department as part of the White Paper proposals for improvement and development of the public dental service, and I also intend to discuss the position with representatives of the Irish Dental Association at a meeting which has been arranged to take place very shortly.</P>

      <P>Yes.  I calculate that we are short at present in Ireland 275 dentists, to have an adequate service. The emigration rate of dentists is very high.  In the period from 1953 to 1964, the average number of dental students who qualified each year was 54 and the average number of additions to the Dental Register in the same period was 27.  From these figures, it will be obvious that half of our dental graduates are emigrating.</P>

      <P>My personal opinion is that the remuneration is not adequate.  I believe they are leaving this country because it is purely a question of economics.  They are getting a great deal more elsewhere.  My difficulty, too, is that when I gave a substantial increase to the doctors recently, I was slapped by certain members on the Opposition benches.  If I try to keep the dentists at home, I shall be subject to grave criticism again.  If we want to keep our doctors and dentists in Ireland for our people, we must pay them.</P>

      <P>This recommendation was accepted by the Government in the White Paper on the Restoration of the Irish Language which was published in January, 1965.  It was implemented in August of last year when all secondary school managers were notified that in the autumn of that year and in the autumn of every year for the future the supplementary examination in Irish referred to by the Deputy would be held.</P>
      <P>I might add that there is no basis for the suggestion made in a Dublin newspaper last Sunday that a supplementary examination would be held next autumn because of protests made concerning the leaving certificate pass paper in Irish taken by candidates earlier this month.  In fact the preliminary circular in regard to that supplementary examination issued to secondary schools last month and before the leaving certificate examination began.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>This is some improvement on the existing law, but only some improvement.  I think the Minister has gone about it in the wrong way.  What it says is that, when accounts are furnished, you can get a clearance by asking for it.  Obviously, if you pinpoint it by asking specifically in one case, you are going to run into trouble because it will be presumed there is something queer in that case.  The way practitioners will deal with this therefore&mdash;and I have discussed it fairly widely with accountants in the city&mdash; is that in every single case they will send in a request under this section. Every set of accounts sent in to the inspector of taxes will be accompanied by a request under this section.  The result will be that this will be accepted as a generality and in consequence of that there will not be a spotlight on any one particular case.</P>
      <P>The Minister would be much better advised, instead of making it as here on request, to make the provision that where appropriate accounts are sent in, the rest of the section would apply and that it would be up to the Revenue, where they have passed the accounts, to requisition something additional. What I am thinking of are cases in which accounts are sent in and in pursuance of those accounts, an assessment is made for income tax.  At the time of the raising of that assessment, it means that the Revenue Commissioners are satisfied that they have all they want or they are raising a larger assessment than the accounts provide because they are not so satisfied or because they want additional information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the accounts are dealt with is <Col N="866" /> the time at which the matters referred to in section 21 of the Finance Act of 1922 should also be dealt with concurrently. The provisions of this section, by virtue of which there is to be another examination, are only going to make for more administrative work, only going to mean there will be more difficulty and differences between what I may call the professional adjusters, be they accountants, auditors or individual tax consultants of the firm on the one hand, and Revenue, on the other.  It would be far better to base this improvement&mdash;and I hand it to the Minister at once that it is an improvement&mdash;which is a limitation of the powers contained in section 21 of the 1922 Act on the assessment being raised out of ordinary accounts furnished for income tax purposes.</P>
    <P>The Minister is aware from his professional work before he became Minister, just as I am aware for the same reason, accounts are sent in, but the measure of profit shown in the accounts for the company's purpose does not always coincide with the correct measure of profit for income tax or corporation profits tax purposes.  That is inevitable because, for instance, the amount of depreciation might differ from the amount of the company's write-off.  Where the accounts go in, are examined by the inspector and in pursuance of that an assessment is raised for corporation profits tax or income tax&mdash;either an agreed assessment or the assessment goes to the Special Commissioner and is agreed at that time&mdash;when that assessment is made and is agreed, then without any request time should automatically run from that date, unless the Revenue make a move within an appropriate period after that date.  To provide that an additional request is necessary is only going to add to the administrative cost.</P>

      <P>In reply to Deputy Sweetman, it was largely to meet the case made by him last year both on Committee and Report Stages that the amendment was introduced.  The Revenue Commissioners would be quite happy to meet the situation envisaged by Deputy Sweetman if accounts were supplied under section 3 in every case.  Whether that possibly would be taking it too far from this point of view or not, I do not know.  Section 21 only applies to a limited range of cases where the number of directors&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>Before section 8, but in Part I, to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The provisions of Part VII of the Finance Act, 1965, shall not apply to an increase in value of the property in question arising before the 5th April, 1965&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I referred to this matter on the Second Stage of the Bill and I put down this amendment which, while not a very great experiment in drafting, makes it quite clear to the Minister what I mean.  One of the cases that has come to my knowledge is that of a company which was incorporated on 10th August, 1937, was registered in Ireland, managed in Ireland and controlled in Ireland.  From the date of the incorporation of the company up to the present, the policy of the company has been to build houses for the purpose of renting.  They built a great number of houses for renting up to 31st December <Col N="871" /> last year and built them on the basis that they were to be an investment from which income would be received.</P>
    <P>In consequence of other actions by other Ministers, and for reasons that were deemed necessary for the general good, in April 1941, the rents in relation to buildings of that sort were frozen.  The effect of the freezing meant there were certain increases in basic rents but, when a house became vacant, it was obviously better from an investment point of view to sell the house, and the money realised by that sale was utilised for the purpose of providing more houses.  The effect of merely changing the investment of the company from an old house to a new house did not mean, before the Finance Act of 1965, that any assessment would be made for tax purposes.</P>
    <P>In the years 1963 and 1964, the contention by the company in that respect was accepted but, following the enactment of the Finance Act, 1965, a different situation arose and, for the life of me, in relation to that, as well as in relation to individual cases to which I shall refer in a moment, I can see no justification whatever for it.  In consequence of the provisions of Part VII of the Finance Act, 1965, if the company about which I am speaking erected a house in the year 1938, and that house at that time cost £1,000 and, because of the depreciation in the value of money over the past 30 years, that house is now sold for £2,000, the effect is that the company concerned is assessed on that additional £1,000 which has arisen not by means of any capital profits in the ordinary sense but purely because successive Ministers for Finance all the way down the years since 1938 have failed to provide that the value of money shall not decrease and I fear there does not seem much prospect of any stoppage in that decrease at the present time either.  It seems to me quite outrageous to provide that a person or a company, consisting of a number of small people, as this company does, shall be assessed solely for the reason that the value of money has decreased.  I am quite prepared to accept, if the value of money <Col N="872" /> has increased since the commencement of last year, that it would be desirable &mdash;not so much desirable as in accordance with the terms of the legislation &mdash;that that increase should be taxed.</P>
    <P>Let me take another case, the case of the individual.  An individual bought a house or succeeded to a house and some land in 1910, 1920, 1930&mdash;it does not really matter when&mdash;and decides to sell that house and land.  He has done some work on the house by way of reconstruction.  It must be remembered that the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Local Government, has been endeavouring to get people to improve their houses by way of reconstruction grants.  This man does some reconstruction work and, following on that, decides to sell.  As a result of the interpretation of Part VII of the Finance Act, 1965, he comes within the ambit of that Act and, because he does, he will be assessed not on the increase in the value from the time that notice accrued to him under this Act but on the decrease in the value of money since 1930, if that was the date at which he bought or succeeded to his property, up to the present time.  I can understand neither the equity nor the morality of that.</P>
    <P>Suppose, then, a person had a house and some land worth £1,000 in 1930. He did some building and the house and land is now worth £3,500.  I think the Minister will agree that the value of £3,500 today is about the equivalent of £1,000 in 1930.  Yet, because that man has brought himself within the ambit of the Act by doing the reconstruction work, he will be assessed for income tax and surtax on that increase of £2,500.  I cannot see any justification at all for that.  I could understand the Minister saying&mdash;I might not agree with him&mdash;that he will take the value as at the date of the commencement of the 1965 Finance Act and any increase in value after that date&mdash;say, 5th April, 1965&mdash;will be brought into the general taxpayer's income.  After all, when they were introducing the capital gains tax in Britain, they did it in that way: they took the value as at the date at which they introduced the tax and taxed capital gains only after that date.  Under Part VII of the <Col N="873" /> Finance Act of 1965, however, the Minister has not merely taxed capital gains since 1965 but has also taxed in addition the decrease in the value of money going right back over the years.</P>
    <P>I accept that something had to be introduced to obviate certain avoidances on the part of those whose job it is to develop land by building but, in the efforts to ensure that these people would not escape, the Minister threw the net so wide last year that he has caught many innocent people whom neither he nor this House intended to be caught.  The only way to deal with the situation now is by a complete re-thinking of the method of assessment in relation to profits made on the development of land for building.</P>
    <P>The Minister will find that he will get all the co-operation he requires in his efforts to prevent evasion but it is quite outrageous that, in trying to prevent evasion, the innocent should be hit just as badly as the guilty.  Two categories are involved: the company building as an investment and merely exchanging one investment for another and the individual who has done reconstruction work within six years.  I admit the terminology is not very elegant but I think the Minister will agree that, coupled with what I said on Second Reading, it does make the position sufficiently clear to enable him adequately to brief himself on what I have in mind.</P>

      <P>I accept that Deputy Sweetman does not claim anything special from his drafting and, for that reason, I shall not comment adversely on it.  He realises that in the form of drafting he has employed there are certain types of cases that could get reliefs much beyond what would have been envisaged.  Take the builder who, having developed land and built a house on it in the ordinary course of his business prior to 5th April, 1965, let it appreciate over a period and sold it immediately after 5th April, 1965.  The difference in value would have been very little between 5th and 6th April and there would have been charged very little by way of tax on the profit he would have made over the period.</P>

      <P>Assuming he is a trader in this broad sense, goods, for example, that he would have taken in stock and sold after 5th April would be caught under this legislation as well.  However, I agree that Deputy Sweetman has a point and I did not claim for Part VII, when it was passed through the House, that it was going to be a perfect piece of legislation by any means.  I should like to repeat a statement which was published some time after the operation of Part VII:</P>
      <P>There have been criticisms of Part VII of the Finance Act, 1965, which is concerned with the taxation of profits from dealing in or developing land.  The previous legislation in this field, dating from 1935, had proved ineffective and had permitted large profits, which on any reasonable view should properly have been taxed as income, to escape liability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="875" /> The main defects were that, to establish liability to tax on profits from the acquisition and disposal of property, it was required to show that the person involved had acquired the property with the intention of reselling or developing it; and that the transactions of acquisition and disposal had been carried out in the course of a trade.  In practice it was found virtually impossible to controvert any statement a taxpayer made as to what his intentions in relation to a particular property were at the time he acquired it; and, even if the intention of reselling or developing was proved or admitted, the profits arising were not chargeable unless the transactions in question, having regard to the way in which they were organised, amounted to trading in the income tax sense.</P>
    <P>In justice to the general body of taxpayers the state of affairs which existed prior to 1965 could not be allowed to continue&mdash;I believe this is generally conceded; and accordingly the legislation now contained in Part VII of last year's Act was brought in to secure proper taxation of all profits from dealing in or developing land.</P>
    <P>Much play has been made with the intricacy of the drafting.  It is well recognised, however, that sections introduced to prevent avoidance of tax must almost always, from the very nature of things, be highly difficult.  The main provisions of the new legislation are necessarily drawn in very wide terms.  But they are qualified by a number of exemptions, of which some appeared in the Bill in its original form and some were inserted during its passage through the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Deputies will appreciate that, in relation to profits of this kind, the framing of legislation which is both effective and equitable is far from easy.  I would not be surprised to find that, particularly in regard to persons who cannot fairly be said to be carrying on a trade of dealing in or developing land, further exemptions <Col N="876" /> may be desirable.  On the other hand, it may well be that, in some respects, the 1965 legislation may require to be strengthened to prevent tax avoidance.</P>
    <P>It was announced some time ago that the Revenue Commissioners have set up a special branch with which professional bodies and consultants generally can raise matters arising out of the practical application of the new provisions.  In this way it is to be expected that information based on experience will be assembled over the next 12 months by reference to which decisions can be arrived at as to where, and to what extent, the legislation may have to be altered.  I would thus be in a position to introduce amendments in next year's Finance Bill, with full retrospective force if necessary.</P>
    <P>I feel that, in this complex matter, it is better to wait until the problems that may arise from the application of last year's measures can be seen in their entirety&mdash;and then to deal with them as comprehensively as possible, rather than to embark on piecemeal changes.</P>

      <P>No.  The office to which I referred was only set up at that time, and experience of the defects that may arise on Part VII has not <Col N="877" /> been sufficient to enable suitable amendments to be introduced.  However, the purpose of Deputy Sweetman's amendment is one of the things I propose to keep under review and to alter, if it appears to be necessary to alter it, in the Finance Bill next year. In reference to that, I did not get an opportunity of replying to the general debate the other evening&mdash;I could have got the opportunity today if I wanted to take it&mdash;but Deputy Sweetman referred to some statements I had made in the House about there being no complaints put to me about the operation of Part VII.  These were in reply to a Parliamentary question on the subject by Deputy Cosgrave. In further reply to a supplementary question by him, I said: &ldquo;I certainly got no representation on that specific point&rdquo;, the specific point being a case where a firm who acquired premises 80 years ago, and who have now been obliged because of development to buy new premises are being charged on the difference between the price 80 years ago and the value of the property at present.  That was the specific point to which I referred.  I did say that Deputy Sweetman had mentioned to me in the course of conversation that there was difficulty about this. He will remember the conversation at the time of the opening of the building in Ballsbridge.</P>

      <P>It is at column 544, volume 221 of 1st March, 1966.  Having repeated the statement, I hope it will get some further publicity.  I would suggest to Deputy Sweetman that, in so far as his amendment might go further than would be absolutely desirable and, on the undertaking that this is one of the matters that will come under review for amendment next year, which, as I had indicated, would have retrospective effect, perhaps the Deputy might consider not pressing his amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say two things about the amendment, as such, and about the opening part of the Minister's statement to which I was listening as carefully as I could.  But, at the same time, I appreciate what one hears about a statement does not always convey quite the same interpretation as when one looks at it in black and white.  It does seem to me, however, that the Minister's statement represents an attitude of mind which is not the appropriate attitude of mind; an attitude of mind which is, in my view, very typically &ldquo;Revenue&rdquo;.  I say that as one who yields to no man in my appreciation of the work done by Revenue in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 6 of the Finance Act, 1935, provided, as the Minister has stated, that the Revenue could not raise an assessment unless they were able to prove that a person had bought land with the intention of developing it.  I am putting the matter rather broadly in order to make it simpler, but I know what is being done by certain dishonest people.  In fact, I know to my own cost because one man wanted my connivance in it.  I refused point blank to accept a professional retainer from him and he went to another solicitor.  It remained at that; I would not do it. The regular way it was done was&mdash;Mr. A went out and bought a piece of land, which had a house and ten acres suitable for building development.  Having bought it today, he took his wife out to it tomorrow and she said: &ldquo;I would <Col N="879" /> not dream of living there under any circumstances.&rdquo;  Then he was able to go along to Revenue and say: &ldquo;I bought that for my own residence but when I took my wife out to see it, she would not live there and, therefore, I had to develop it.&rdquo;  The Revenue were bound, in consequence of the wording of the Act of 1935, to accept that untrue statement by the person concerned.</P>
    <P>With the Minister's desire to close that gap for that type of deceitful flaw he will have my wholehearted approval and the wholehearted approval of anybody in this Party.  The Minister for Finance is not allowed to see individual taxpayers' files; he will not know to whom I am referring.  The Revenue officials, whose duty it is to read the debates, will know to whom I am referring and will know that this case has arisen peculiarly often in one respect.</P>
    <P>There was another case in which a person went out and bought land.  He did it as a single transaction through a single company.  The company was liquidated and that land was then sold at an excessive price, as in the first case I mentioned, which will show there could not be any profit in the building operation and the profit was siphoned off.  That was a legitimate avoidance but an avoidance that should equally be stopped.  In so far as Part VII stopped that avoidance and stopped the first evasion&mdash; because it was evasion based on deceit&mdash;the Minister was right in stopping them but the Part went much beyond that and I think that the attitude of mind disclosed in the opening phrases of the statement the Minister has just read amounts to this: &ldquo;It does not matter whether what you were doing before was lawful or not, I am going to be sure you will be caught under Part VII of the Act of 1965.&rdquo;  If it was unlawful, of course, the individual must be caught. But if it was lawful to bring in a section of an Act and utilise that Act for the purpose of declaring, subject to taxation, something that was not previously subject to taxation, that is not merely wrong but, I think, it is probably unconstitutional.  I do not purport <Col N="880" /> to be in any way a constitutional expert but it is certainly contrary to the spirit of what is involved.</P>
    <P>There is also in this a hint running through the statement by the Minister that, so long as you ensure that nobody escapes the net, then you are doing a good job in the national interest.  One must take a much broader view than that.  One must ensure that the national interest in general is pursued and that, in the efforts and desire to provide that somebody will not escape the net, the net must not be cast in such a way that the innocent will be caught as well.  If the Minister means, by what he has just said, that the anxiety now is to examine Part VII of the 1965 Act to see whether, as the result of that Part of the Act, any innocent person is not caught by the provisions of the Act and that any innocent person who was abiding within the law is not penalised by it, then I am perfectly happy.  Equally, I take it that the Minister means that in the event of any individual&mdash;who is not engaged in this business, either directly or as a director or substantial shareholder of a company which is so engaged, or through a chain of shareholders&mdash;dealing with his property he will not be caught in this way.  The case of a man who does some trifling reconstruction work within the six years and, in consequence of that, is brought into the assessment is not one which can be defended.</P>
    <P>Part of the mistake in the drafting of the Act of last year in that respect was that we provided that it was not to cover a case under £1,500.  We provided in relation to that £1,500 that it was to be under £1,500 difference and not that it was to be worth less than £1,500.  The effect of the particular section which provided that difficulty is mainly in section 42 and particularly subsection (3) (b) (i) which says:</P>
    <P>in a case in which the building was constructed or reconstructed, the period from the time when the construction or reconstruction was completed to the time when the <Col N="881" /> interest was disposed of was not less than six years...</P>
    <P>As people read that section at present, it means that a person who adds a bathroom to his house is within the purview of section 42 and that if, in consequence, he sells after he has added that bathroom, he is caught under section 42.  That certainly was not what was intended and I do not think it was what the Minister intended last year.  The Minister might have thought that he was exempting that case by the proviso contained in section 44 but the proviso contained in section 44 of last year's Act exempted only so much of the profits.</P>
    <P>As I say, where something worth £1,000 in 1930 was now worth £3,000 solely because of the diminution in the value of money, that case would still be caught by an assessment in the sum of £500.  There would be the original £1,000; there would be the exemption under section 44 of £1,500 but it would leave the balance of £500 liable to assessment, an assessment on top of the taxpayer's income.  I must confess that the Minister puts a Deputy at a very considerable disadvantage in relation to this.  Providing a form of drafting that would catch the evasion case, that would catch the case in which the builder or developer was utilising a legal form such as I indicated to get out of the liability on his building and developing, is one that would, I think, be far beyond the drafting ability of any Deputy.</P>
    <P>What should be substituted for Part VII may provide a difficult drafting matter.  To that extent I am bound to say I must agree that the very simple method of drafting I adopted to hang the peg on would not have suited, but it did hang the argument on sufficiently well.  I shall withdraw the amendment, with the permission of the House, and say that I hope when the Minister and the people concerned in Revenue have examined this we shall not have to wait until next year for a suitable amendment.  The uncertainty and the difficulties created are such that we cannot wait another 12 months.  I had occasion recently&mdash;and one does not like to talk about one's personal experience&mdash;to <Col N="882" /> ask a taxation counsel to give an opinion in relation to section 42.  His reply was that he could not, that he was not able to say what exactly, in relation to the set of circumstances, section 42 meant.  He also added that he had discussed the position with many other counsel in the Library who advised on taxation matters and they had all told him the same thing, that it was not possible in relation to section 42 of last year's Act to provide a certainly that is necessary and desirable in taxation, and that he had reluctantly come to the conclusion that the only thing he could say in relation to section 42 was that everything was in and the taxpayers must provide accordingly, whether innocent or trying to evade or to avoid. If they are trying to evade in any way, the Minister will have the full wholehearted co-operation of the House in trying to stop the evasion, and if they have been trying to avoid, he will have power to take action legally.  If it is desirable to block the loophole, then let the loophole be blocked.  But it is not appropriate that there should be something within the law that has to be changed retrospectively.  Does the Minister think I am unfair in the case I have put on that basis?</P>

      <P>While the Deputy highlighted these cases, there were a lot of other contrivances in order to distinguish between avoidance and evasion whereby people sought to get out of their tax liability, and it was not easy to provide for all of them.  I tried in the course of the drafting of the initial Part VII and in the course of the debate on Committee and Report Stages to bring in what I thought were reasonable amendments to exclude certain transactions.  I realise that I may not have gone all the way and I realise difficulties have arisen since that ought not have arisen, in other words, <Col N="883" /> cases that we did not envisage should be caught by Part VII.  It is in recognition of that fact that the announcement to which I have referred, and which I have repeated in great detail now, has been made and that the special section has been set up.  I could not give an undertaking at this stage that I could introduce the amendments in advance of next year's Bill but if I see it is feasible to do so, I certainly would be inclined to consider it.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister consider one specific amendment which I think would have the effect of taking many individuals, and I use the word &ldquo;individuals&rdquo; rather than the legalistic word &ldquo;persons&rdquo;, from within the provisions of Part VII, that is, where an individual did reconstruction work of a value less than £1,500, the figure mentioned in section 44, and where that individual is not&mdash;either himself or his wife&mdash;a director or a shareholder in any company that builds, that is engaged in building or developing, he will not come within the provisions of Part VII?  If that were done, it would have the effect of knocking out all the innocent individuals who are covered by this section.  I do not expect the Minister to give me an answer straight away.  It would not be fair to ask him to do it.  I would, however, ask him to think about that as a simple method to remove the innocent individual between now and Report Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>Before section 8, but in Part I, to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Section 17 of the Finance Act, 1963, is hereby repealed.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think everybody will agree, including even the Minister, that the main malaise from which the country is suffering at the present time which is having and will have the effect of preventing further increases in employment and further increases in our <Col N="884" /> standard of living is the shortage of capital.  Nothing has done so much harm to the capital situation as the provisions of section 17 of the Finance Act, 1963.  This was the provision which for the first time breached the confidential relationship between a bank and a customer.  The Minister introduced that section with the laudable idea, if you like, of being able to ensure that in relation to interest on bank deposits there would not be tax evasion.  As I said on the last amendment, all of us accept that there should not be evasion but section 17 has not done that at all.  All that has happened since that section was introduced is that people who wanted to evade transferred their deposits out of the country and put them either in Northern Ireland or in Britain.</P>
    <P>There has been a variety of estimates of the amount that the country has lost as a result of this attitude in the Finance Act, 1963.  I saw one estimate by a most reputable person in the city, the head of a substantial insurance company, that it was between £70 million and £100 million.  I do not think it has meant quite as much as that, but I am absolutely certain that it has meant a great deal of money.  I am absolutely certain that we have lost since 1963 a very substantial part of the whole credit base of the country.  I am certain that we are continuing so to lose every month as a result of that section.</P>
    <P>Wherever one goes throughout the country and asks bank managers whether they lost deposits as a result of section 17 of the 1963 Finance Act, one is told at once: &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.  Some bank managers will tell one of the amounts that went out in the flight after that Act was passed.  They cannot all be wrong.  One's estimate of the amount as a result of discussions with bank managers cannot be accurate, but I have never heard any acknowledgment by the Minister of the amount that his Revenue officials have estimated as having gone or the amount that has been estimated by the Statistics Office.  However, there is no doubt whatever that it is a very substantial loss.</P>
    <P>Worse than that is the fact that the knowledge that bank deposits would <Col N="885" /> not be confidential has prevented other capital that we need very badly indeed from coming into the country.  The Swiss built up their prosperity largely on the inviolability of the confidence that exists between the customer and the banks in Switzerland.  There have been suggestions in recent times by people in industry that it would be to our national advantage to have what they call the numbered bank accounts system of the Swiss.  I do not think that matters very much.  What matters is that the relationship should be engendered in such a way that people coming in here would be entitled to feel, and think, and know, that this confidential relationship existed.</P>
    <P>As I say, this section was introduced by the Minister for the purpose, as he said, of stopping evasion of responsibility by certain taxpayers.  Everyone would be with the Minister in providing that those taxpayers must bear their proper share of tax.  Everyone would be with the Minister in providing that means should be found to ensure that they could not evade, but there is no use in finding means by which they could not evade, if finding that means damages the whole structure of our economy.  There is no doubt whatever that the structure of our economy has been damaged by the shortage of capital which has arisen in the past couple of years.</P>
    <P>Equally, I think everyone who knows anything about the commercial life of the country will accept that that shortage of capital has arisen largely because of the reputation engendered by section 17 of the Finance Act, 1963. For example, I can think of another way in which the Minister could have provided that deposits could not evade responsibility.  He could have done so by providing a penalty system.  The people concerned would know that when their evasion came to light a full and rigorous penalty would be imposed upon them.</P>
    <P>I have often asked professional people with whom I am associated what happens in relation to those who attempt to evade income tax on the type of scale this section was designed to catch.  The answer I got&mdash;and this has been my own experience&mdash;is that <Col N="886" /> they are caught sooner or later.  It is proper that they should be caught sooner or later.  When a person who had a deposit dies, it is caught in the schedule of assets, and Revenue are entitled to go back to decide the proper liability of that person.  The amount that filters away and is not caught is trifling.  The only thing the section might do in regard to a person whom the Minister desires to catch is that he might be caught a little sooner rather than later, but to catch a person sooner rather than later, it is not worth smashing the whole base of our economy.</P>
    <P>The Minister will admit that his main difficulty at the moment in the economic field flows from shortage of capital: shortage of capital in relation to base for credit, and also in relation to savings.  I want the Minister to take the positive step of being big enough to admit that the action taken by his predecessor in 1963, while correct in the narrow field of preventing evasion, was all wrong in the wider field of providing a base for our capital expansion and to repeal that provision of the 1963 Act; to enact, if he wishes&mdash; and he will get my support in this&mdash; much more stringent penalties for those who attempt to evade their due responsibilities; to provide a climate of confidence that will not merely mean that Irish capital will be kept at home but also that the foreign capital which we need so much to develop, to provide additional employment, to make our existing industries and employment more viable, will be attracted in here and not driven out.  That has been the only effect of the 1963 Act.</P>

      <P>I should like to support this amendment.  I fully agree with what Deputy Sweetman has said.  This is the type of legislation which has been responsible for driving out capital.  When I was speaking here recently I suggested that it had driven out of the country something like £100 million.  I was immediately challenged by the Minister and asked to prove it. I cannot prove it.  I can only tell the Minister what the people I have spoken to in responsible financial circles&mdash;whether officially connected <Col N="887" /> with finance or private individuals with financial commitments&mdash;are at one in the opinion that this was in their experience the most stupid piece of legislation that was ever passed in this country.  It has gained nothing.</P>
      <P>It has been challenged on several occasions in this House and there has been no attempt by successive Ministers for Finance to justify it.  I cannot see what possible benefit it is to the Revenue people or tax gatherers. Assuming that people have sums of money on deposit in the bank, I assume from the income point of view that they are taxed purely on the amount that accrues from the particular deposit.  The interest from those deposits is about as low as it could possibly be.  I think the rate of interest on a deposit account at the moment, up to £5,000, is somewhere in the neighbourhood of 1 per cent or 1½ per cent.  If it goes over that sum or over £10,000 you may get two per cent.  The assumption is that this tax was imposed for the purpose of getting at death duties, in other words, getting a bigger estate for tax returns.</P>
      <P>I do not propose to say anything at this stage on estate duty because I will have quite a lot to say on this subject later on but I should like to say this.  I have discussed the matter before the House at the moment with various people.  I have never yet met anybody who has not said that this is an absolutely asinine piece of legislation, that it has done incalculable harm to this country.  In fact, it has had the very reverse effect it was intended to have.  It seems to me that the Minister, in spite of all his financial difficulties&mdash;I believe the Government are in financial difficulties and that they are more or less living from hand to mouth&mdash;should accept this amendment, amend this legislation and enable capital to come into this country again.</P>

      <P>Perhaps, but we have freedom of thought in the Labour Party.  Personally, I consider that this piece of legislation has done a great lot of harm.  A great amount of money is being taken out of this country and deposited elsewhere.  Anybody who has a bank manager can ask him about the colossal amount of money &mdash;it may be £100 million; I do not pretend to know what it is&mdash;that has been taken out of our banks and deposited elsewhere.  Money which is kept at home is of no advantage to the banking system in this country.  There was a tendency, particularly among the farming community, to keep money at home under the bed or some such suitable place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not pretend to know where they keep it.  Whether the amount of money involved was a few hundred or a few thousand pounds, it was kept in most farm houses in the country.  This was done because of the unhappy experience of the 1930s, the credit war and the credit restrictions of the time.  It was only gradually that the younger farmers, who were taking over, resorted to using banks or gained confidence in the banking system and put money on deposit, thereby getting a small amount of interest on it.  As Deputy Esmonde said, it is the absolute minimum of interest which is collected from this money.  If it was on deposit a long while under the normal erosion of values and depreciation of money, from this point of view anybody who had money on deposit will know that it is a very bad system.  However, for various reasons, a large amount of money was on deposit in those banks. The Government did the country a tremendous amount of harm by making the banks disclose those sums for tax purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know, quite frankly, how much back income tax was collected, but certainly a great amount of damage was caused to the economy since this was introduced in the 1963 Act. Quite obviously, banks cannot lend <Col N="889" /> money that is not on deposit with them.  This is one of the factors which contributes to our present economic difficulties.  Although it was the previous Minister for Finance who was responsible for this, I am sure that the present Minister will try to protect him and will be reluctant to admit that any case that can be made for this has very little merit in it.  I am sure, even though the Minister is in the unenviable position of trying to defend somebody else's tragic mistake, that he will admit it was a mistake and that this section should be repealed and confidence restored in the banking system.  Eventually, if there has been evasion of income tax, and it has not been collected, it can be collected in death duty later on. Certainly, from a national point of view this was a very bad thing.  This is something which the Government will not be able to do twice.  Now that they have had experience of it the Minister should be courageous enough to admit that this is not a good thing and he should consider deleting this particular section of the 1963 Finance Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> Up to the passing of the Finance Act, 1963, people in the rural parts of Ireland, at any rate, had the utmost confidence in the banking system of this country.  They dealt with the banks in the belief that their dealings were confidential and secret and if they had a bit of money in the bank it was their own business and it could not be disclosed to anybody or to the State without the person's consent. Rural people, and country people as a whole, are suspicious about having their business made known to State Departments and to other people.  For example, it was sometimes very difficult to persuade people, up to the passing of this Act, that they should take their money out of the bank and put it into a national loan on the basis that they would get a better return from the national loan than they would get from the bank.  They believed that as long as they had the money in the bank it was their own business and their own secret.  They felt that if they put their money in <Col N="890" /> the national loan the Government knew about it, various Departments of State knew about it, and it was no longer a secret.  I can tell the Minister that from my professional experience.</P>
      <P>I think, therefore, that the effect of the section we are seeking to repeal has been to encourage Irish people to withdraw money from the banks and, indeed, to discourage farmers and others from putting even comparatively small sums into the banks, amounts which would not necessarily be caught by the section&mdash;I think it had to be £1,500 before it became obligatory on the bank to make a return.  The farmers of Ireland and others putting money into the banks felt that once a bank could disclose anybody's business it could disclose theirs.</P>
      <P>It was a mistake, therefore, ever to enact this section and much good can be achieved by repealing it.  It has been said here that money has been withdrawn from the banks and deposited outside the State, in Northern Ireland and Britain.  Money has been recalled to Northern Ireland and Britain and money has been exported to Northern Ireland and Britain.  This is deplorable at a time when the country is in such great need of capital and has to go abroad, to Canada and Germany, in search of modest loans. I am sure the Minister has been asked &mdash;if he has not, I should like to ask him now&mdash;how much money by way of revenue this section has brought into the Exchequer since it was enacted. I should also like to repeat Deputy Sweetman's question: how much money has disappeared out of the country, out of the banks, since this section was enacted?  Both by this method and, as Deputy Esmonde has said, by death duties, we are endeavouring to discourage people from bringing money into the country. One would think we had too much money or that we did not have a shortage of capital.  Our income tax laws and death duty laws are really doing more harm than good to the country and I suggest they should be looked at and reviewed.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the amendment.  These deposit accounts in banks brought foreign <Col N="891" /> capital in here at very low interest rates.  I think it would average about two per cent and the owners of such deposits were the only people who got away with the tax.  When Irish people put money into the banks, on death their beneficiaries were asked how it had come to be accumulated, how long it was in the bank and the interest they had received.  All this would be taken into account on their being taxed and it would also involve them in a higher bracket of death duties.  Irish people could not escape under either heading and the Irish people using such deposits were professional people who got very small profit out of it.  The pool of money so accumulated in the banks was not drawn on by business people because the Government have been drawing out of it practically 80 per cent or 90 per cent and there was very little or nothing left for business people. That has been leading to unemployment. We have had to go out of the country looking for money at between ten per cent and 12 per cent.</P>

      <P>I should like to get one thing clear.  As one who knows very little about high finance, I have been listening to this side of the House debating the section for some time.  Am I to assume that the money we have been speaking about was hot money or the money of people within the country who did not want to disclose it in order to avoid taxation?  Are we saying that we cannot survive unless people who could get money by honest means do not wish to disclose what money they have in England or elsewhere and that they might be able to come in here and hide it in Irish banks?  Is it so that since the Irish Government decided they wanted that money taxed these people have been withdrawing it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with that.  The argument is reasonably correct.  There has been the suggestion that people who make profits in one way or another and do not want to disclose these profits often put their profits into Irish banks and leave them there quietly.  I shall go back to the beginning.  I agree with Deputy Sweetman that one of our present difficulties is the shortage of credit.  There have been statements, as he mentioned, by leaders in commerce to the effect that £70 million to £100 million has left the country as a result of section 17 of the 1963 Finance Act.  I do not accept that.</P>
      <P>I have made some attempts to find out but have not been able to find out how much, if any&mdash;I am not suggesting none&mdash;of these deposits left the country.  The banks' deposits are increasing all the time and the shortage of credit is not so much attributable to a shortage of deposits as to the fact that more and more credit is being sought for a greater scope of industrial and other development and expansion programmes.  That, however, brings the debate into wide perspective. I wish to say, first of all, that the person who pays his tax honestly has nothing to fear from section 17 of the 1963 Finance Act as amended by last year's Finance Act.  The purposes of the section in the 1963 Act was not so much to gather in for tax purposes the small interest rates paid on deposit as to ensuring that disclosures of profits made in trading and in professional and other activities would be made known to the Revenue Commissioners. The Revenue Commissioners themselves did not contrive this section. The section was introduced as a result of the unanimous recommendation of the Commission on Income Taxation.</P>

Members of his Party talk about evasion or avoidance of tax by people who can afford to pay it better than ordinary workingmen who cannot escape at all or by the person who has small investments in National Loans, and others. All these people, if they are liable to tax, have to pay tax on the accretion of all their income which would include dividends on these investments. These people have no way out of it.  The person who can lodge thousands of pounds out of profits from his profession, trade or business of any description may seek to avoid income tax in that manner&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to clarify something. The Minister said he could not understand my point of view in supporting the general spread of tax.  The Minister is approaching this matter in a very naïve way.  He thinks that because this particular section of the 1963 Finance Act is in force, he is collecting money from these people.  First, I think the bulk of people concerned operate in a small way and the £50 interest allowed tax free will exclude the bulk of people operating on this. The type of person the Minister would like to catch, the man operating on a big scale, depositing thousands and thousands of pounds, is, generally speaking, a very slippy operator and will not be caught by any naïve little clauses like this.  He will simply take his money and put it elsewhere, or he may keep it at home.  If he is not going to pay tax and makes up his mind to that, this will not be a method of collecting.</P>
      <P>We are now losing both ways.  We do not collect the tax at source and the money is being lent to Britain instead of being in the economy here. If it were on deposit here with the banks and the taxpayer collected 1½ or two per cent interest, the Minister, presumably, would be borrowing it from the banks in due course and, instead of paying 7¼ per cent in Germany, would be getting it at the rate of two per cent from the banks.  The money would be in the economy here, helping the country.  Instead, we have to go abroad to borrow because we are exporting capital, partly due to this.  The other point the Minister made&mdash;it has slipped my mind&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>No.  I am making it clear that this is a personal point of <Col N="897" /> view.  I was not here in 1962 when the Party supported this section and I do not feel that I am actually bound to support that as such.  I am giving a personal point of view.  I think it was a mistake.  The Minister is approaching this in a very naïve manner.  We are not catching evaders.  If this section were repealed, it would do far more good than harm to the economy. The amount collected is very small. The Minister does not know how much but I gather it is very small. Last year, he was disdainful of the sum of £180,000 a year on a 25 per cent stamp duty on foreigners.  I doubt if this is a lot more.  He could be equally disdainful of this trivial amount.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I will take a leaf out of the Deputy's book and interrupt him in the middle of a sentence and say that the £180,000 that the Deputy has referred to as coming under the 25 per cent stamp duty on land purchased by foreigners would not arise anyway, in view of the provision in the recent Land Act which requires the sale of land to a foreigner now to get the consent of the Land Commission.</P>

      <P>The position obtaining up to then was that where the Land Commission gave their certificate the 25 per cent was not payable.  The <Col N="898" /> fact was that the Land Commission had to be consulted; if they said that they were not interested in that particular piece of land, they gave their permission and the 25 per cent would not be payable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that the amount of money on deposit had been increasing from year to year. That does not prove anything.  A lot of money may have been taken out of the country and placed on deposit elsewhere or taken off deposit in this country.  The fact that the amount on deposit here increased does not prove that a lot was not taken out.  It merely proves that the amount on deposit here would have been greater if this amount had not been taken out.  I think the Minister if he has made inquiries&mdash; and I suspect he has&mdash;will find what I found.  I have taken the trouble of consulting eight or ten bank managers in different banks as a matter of interest and every one of them said that a large amount of money had been taken out of the country and that those who had been caught would not be caught twice.  The Minister did not make the mistake but he should abolish this system and see how we get on in future.  We are collecting little or nothing by it and I am sure the Minister himself agrees with this point of view.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is being most naïve about this.  When the section was introduced, it was done on the basis that it was necessary to stop evasion.  The fact is that the last three years have proved that it has not stopped evasion.  The fraudulent person&mdash;and I am entirely at one with the Minister that the fraudulent person should be caught&mdash;puts his money on deposit not down here but in Belfast or Liverpool.  This section does not operate now, whatever <Col N="899" /> it did about bringing anything to light earlier.  It is now of no assistance in preventing evasion.</P>
      <P>I disagree, but the Minister may if he likes make the case that, when first enacted, it did assist in preventing evasion but that is not in issue now. If that were the only advantage, that advantage is spent and finished but it does not now operate to prevent evasion because the position is that people have moved their capital.  The Minister says he has got the record of it because it was in the preceding year and that is that.  Like Deputy Norton, I have made it a habit for the past couple of years to talk to bank managers about the amount of capital they think was transferred as a result of this section.  I have also discussed with bank managers the amounts they feel are still being transferred.  They do not see it directly but they can watch a trend in individual accounts and they hear of amounts that would otherwise come into the country.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture is credited with saying that we are not interested in that type of capital.  I think the Minister for Finance would not agree with him but would take the view that we were most interested in obtaining any capital that would enable us to develop our economy, provided we did not accept stolen money, if I may use that as a means of expressing it.  Every bank manager will tell the Minister that some money has gone out of his bank and out of the economy as a result of this section.  I am quite prepared to take the appropriate page of Thom's Directory and with the Minister stick six pins in it and taking the six branches that come out, I will go with the Minister to the managers of those bank branches.  I guarantee that every one of the six will tell the Minister that some money has gone.  In some cases it will be a small amount, in others, a big amount that has been transferred.  That depends on the volume of business and on the proximity of the branches concerned to the Border.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section has failed and will fail <Col N="900" /> to stop evasion.  Other methods should be adopted to stop evasion.  By the repeal of the section, we would do something to build up the credit base of the country which is needed for the protection of those now employed and towards providing for their employment in the future.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not agree even to this small extent with those who have argued the case on this side of the House&mdash;he does, of course, agree and accepts that there is a credit squeeze&mdash;that some of the credit squeeze is due to this legislation by virtue of the fact that the banks have not any money available to lend to their clients and also that the money they originally got and held on deposit was subsequently lent to clients?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>To the extent that this section has caused money to leave the banks, it must have contributed.  I do not know to what extent.  What I have said is, first, that the credit squeeze is world wide at the present and every country is experiencing it and that, as far as we are concerned, our experience is that it is due to the greater degree of economic activity &mdash;more development in agricultural and industrial spheres and, generally speaking, more people seeking credit in the past two years and to a greater extent.</P>

Does he not agree that this money will be got eventually in 99 cases out of 100 when the person dies and when tax will have to be paid <Col N="901" /> on death duties if he is liable?  Surely the money will be caught anyway?  It may not be this year or next year but the year after, and in the meantime why not maintain this confidence that exists between a bank and its clients? I should also like to ask the Minister to look at the merchant banks because it is a fact at the moment that you can invest in them and they can pay, to a deposit account probably, your dividends and you are not taxed here or there.</P>

      <P>It has been recognised for a long time that this practice existed.  This was not a brilliant idea that occurred to the Government in 1963 but it was known since the beginnings of the State.  It was deliberately ignored, if you like, <Col N="902" /> because it was recognised that the amount of interest on deposits was not very great and that inflation was eating away the capital in any event and for this purpose and in order to help the economy, it was disregarded. Suddenly, because they were hardpressed for money in 1963, the Government, who were introducing the turnover tax, were scraping the bottom of the barrel and they damaged it in the process.  I suggest they should now think about it again and find out from the banks how much money is involved and then go back to the old system.  It may allow a small number of people to escape paying taxation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>Amendment declared lost.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5 in the name of Deputy Cosgrave:</P>
      <P>Before section 8, but in Part I, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where an individual has been involved in expense in respect of illness the amount of such expense shall be deducted from or set-off against any income for the year of assessment of such person.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is drafted as a means more of extracting from the Minister some expression of view on the position that has been raised regularly here rather than as a final judgment on what should be in the Bill.  We have had discussions here on Finance Bills many times in the past to provide that the expenses of illness to a <Col N="905" /> taxpayer in excess of a certain amount should afford that taxpayer relief.  The view has already been expressed&mdash; and I think correctly&mdash;that there must be a minimum amount of expenditure below which no relief will arise because, without that, the task of administration would virtually be impossible. It is a fact with which we all agree that illness may well have calamitous effects economically in a family above the class of people covered by the Health Act and particularly in those cases where it is not possible to get cover under the Voluntary Health Insurance arrangements.</P>
    <P>The case was made in earlier years by Ministers for Finance that because of the existence of the Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme, there was no necessity for a provision such as is suggested.  The Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme does of course provide for a large number of cases, and it is important that we should do nothing that would in any way impair the efficacy of that scheme and its success.  There are, however, a substantial number of cases of people who are not entitled to have the cost of illness borne by the local authority under the Health Act and who find themselves unable to get Voluntary Health Insurance cover and yet are involved in very substantial costs of illness.  It is precisely that type of case we are anxious to cover.</P>
    <P>I can see the Minister saying that it would be wrong to alleviate in this respect only those people who have substantial tax obligations while at the same time making no provision for those who have no tax obligations.  In the ordinary course of events, that would be a true answer to the proposition we make, but when you analyse the number of people who would have severe costs in relation to illness and who are not insurable under the Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme, who are not covered by the Health Acts but who have to pay the costs themselves of that illness, you find that virtually all of them are in the taxpaying bracket.</P>
    <P>As I say, this was deliberately drawn in this loose fashion for the purpose of hanging an argument rather <Col N="906" /> than providing an absolute amendment to the Act.  One must agree that the types of cases we have in mind are cases that would have the sympathy of everybody in the House, including the Minister, and cases which the Minister can concede without making it a consequence that there would be any great indentation of the general tax law, or any loophole through which there could be evasion of any sort.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. P. Byrne Mr. P. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Sweetman said, the principle of this amendment was recommended by the Income Tax Commission in its Seventh Report and the Government's attitude to the recommendation was set out in the second White Paper on Direct Taxation. The Minister of the time appeared to hedge on the question: he stated that the recommendation would be looked into and it would be ascertained if it was administratively feasible to implement it.  As Deputy Sweetman also said, this amendment in one form of wording or another has been a hardy annual in this House for several years past.  I recall putting it down on one occasion and I recall about three or four years ago a number of Fianna Fáil backbenchers criticising the amendment for not going far enough in dealing with this calamity of illness which can financially break a family.  Since that time it is very significant that the costs of hospitalisation, and the costs of medical treatment and medicines, have jumped astronomically.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The stock reply of the Minister's predecessor to our argument, and to the arguments of his own backbenchers, was that we had sitting in this House the notorious Health Services Committee which collapsed last year and that that Committee was investigating the health services and could be expected to produce a worthwhile health scheme which would in another form cater for the contingency for which we in our amendment to the Finance Bill were trying to cater.  Everybody knows what happened to the Health Services Committee.  It collapsed completely; the efforts were fruitless and everybody knows that the implementation of a worthwhile health service, of a comprehensive <Col N="907" /> health service without a means test, is pie in the sky as far as the immediate situation is concerned. This amendment is an effort to give effect to what is more than a simple Christian proposal.  Illness can have a calamitous effect on a breadwinner.</P>
    <P>I recall that about three years ago a colleague of the Minister, the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, was standing in for the Minister on Committee Stage and he agreed that the amendment was a good one and went through the form of committing himself to it, stating that, if we reopened the debate on Report Stage, he would hope that the official draftsmen would have suceeeded in giving effect to the principle which we wished to have put into effect.  Unfortunately, that fell through.  I do not wish to make a detailed case for the amendment because that has been done many times before and it is seeking no more than simple justice.  The very fact, if nothing else, that the Income Tax Commission unanimously recommended the principle of the amendment&mdash; admittedly, in words somewhat different and a little more hedged in than Deputy Cosgrave's amendment &mdash;should be good enough for the Minister.</P>
    <P>When dealing with section 17 of the 1963 Act, the strongest argument the Minister could produce was that it was the unanimous recommendation of the Income Tax Commission.  So is this the unanimous recommendation of the Income Tax Commission.  The Commission made that recommendation in the teeth of an official submission from the Revenue Commissioners which was opposed to the principle. They were aware of all the snags and no snag can have been uncovered by the Minister which was not anticipated by the Commission.  Therefore I appeal to the Minister either to accept the amendment as drafted or to come back on Report Stage with his own draft on the lines of the wording recommended by the Income Tax Commission.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a rather pitiful state of affairs that we have one year <Col N="908" /> after another to plead this case?  We find in this House of Parliament successive Ministers for Finance indicating their sympathy with the proposal. We have on both sides of the House and in the public Press considerable support and encouragement for our attitude here on the Fine Gael Benches on this matter of asking that medical expenses be not subject to income tax.  Despite many expressions of sympathy by Ministers for Finance, there has been no concrete result.  We would hope that this year the Minister might go a little further than a mere expression of sympathy and inability to find some way of doing what is so clearly the right thing.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Sweetman and Deputy Byrne have pointed out, the principle which justifies income tax is that it is a tax applied over that portion of an income over which a person has discretion from the point of view of spending. The curing of suffering and disease is not something discretionary.  It is a most humane activity and anything we can do in our laws to ease the lot of our fellowmen who are suffering from disease should be done.  We have the rather ironic and, indeed, tragic situation here that not only are we applying income tax over that portion of a person's income over which he has no control but we are also mulcting him through the medium of turnover tax in the money he expends on medicines and drugs.  There is in fact double taxation.</P>
      <P>Diabetics are refused assistance by the health authority on the ground that they have sufficient income to pay for drugs out of their own resources.  These people may have to spend anything from £1 to £2 10s per week on drugs. Over a year that expenditure can amount to £100 and more.  In order to pay that £100 and pay for the prescribed drugs and medicines, they have to earn anything from £130 to £150 to meet income tax liability.  Thank God, there are few relatively suffering from chronic ailments, but, from that point of view alone, the Exchequer would suffer very little if we did the humane thing and granted the assistance for which Deputy Cosgrave asks in his amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="909" /> As Deputy Sweetman said, the amendment has been drafted in very general terms.  Up to now, when we tried to amend these restrictions imposed by Ministers for Finance, we simply appeared to justify inaction. We did not wish this year to provide any outlet for the Minister since we hoped then that the Minister would have to accept the amendment or else justify his attitude all along the line. There are too many who think a thing cannot be done here unless it has been done elsewhere and can be shown to have been successfully done elsewhere. That is a very inadequate approach.  It is interesting to note that what we are seeking here does apply in many countries.</P>
    <P>Income tax allowance is made in the case of medical expenditure of a certain kind up to a certain amount.  For those lovers of precedent, there is ample precedent available and the sooner we apply it to our particular circumstances the better.  From the utterances of Government spokesmen, we know that the much boasted reforms in our health services will not come about for many years.  The financial situation is such as to offer no hope of reform this year, next year, or for many years to come.  For years we were put off by the existence of a Committee which sat on a certain portion of its anatomy which was referred to here recently. That Committee was not productive of anything except acrimony.</P>

That being so, we plead with the Minister, in the name of humanity, to make this small concession. It will not cost a great deal and it would be very valuable to many <Col N="910" /> individuals and families who suffer on occasion from heavy medical expenses against which they cannot insure themselves.

      <P>There is one point I should like the Minister to consider. The Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme is available to certain sections of the community but the Minister knows that, if a person has a serious illness, there is a limit on the amount that may be subsequently claimed in a subsequent illness from the Voluntary Health Insurance Board.  That is something which should be borne in mind: the amount of coverage in subsequent illness can be inadequate.  The income tax allowances for both married and single are very small.  I think the Minister would be doing simple justice towards those who pay income tax by accepting this amendment.</P>

      <P>As some of the Deputies opposite observed, this has been a hardy annual in debates on the Finance Bill for quite some years.  I met it myself for the first time last year as I did not normally take part in debates on the Finance Bill until last year.  I expressed a certain amount of sympathy with the motives behind the amendment as drafted last year.  The wording of the amendment does not matter because, as Deputies opposite say, what is involved here is the principle.  While one might have sympathy with the principle, as I said last year, I was not fully familiar then with the administrative and other difficulties that might be involved, and I did say to the House, having turned down the amendment last year, that I would look at it more closely in the event <Col N="911" /> of a similar amendment being moved this year.</P>
      <P>I have done that, and I have examined the situation from many points of view.  First of all, we must regard income tax as something a person pays on the balance of his income after certain allowances have been given.  These allowances are given largely on the same basis to everybody, child allowance, expenses incurred in the course of one's business or profession.  I am not going to distinguish between those necessarily incurred and otherwise, but these are given as well.  Apart from these specific allowances, no allowance is made for other expenditure, for example, domestic expenditure and any other form of unavoidable personal expenditure, under which heading, I take it, medical expenses would fall. To give an allowance in respect of medical expenses would naturally open up the way for claims for allowances for expenses of a different nature, for example, educational expenses, for rates paid by a householder. The principle has been established that, once the allowances to the individual referred to at the beginning have been granted, then a person is responsible for the payment of the unavoidable expenses incurred in his living.</P>
      <P>If this amendment were to be accepted in one form or another, the first question that would arise is whether it could operate fairly.  If the State has to come to the assistance of all individuals in the matter of medical expenses, as it does to a considerable extent at the present time, then it ought to come to their assistance in an equitable way; in other words, it ought not to be more generous to some than to others.  The person who would be liable to pay a very small amount of income tax possibly would not benefit to the same extent as a person who would be in the surtax bracket.  Therefore, to that extent, the State would not come to the assistance of all its citizens equally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One might argue against that, that if a person is paying no income tax or such a small amount of income tax <Col N="912" /> as to amount to practically none, then the question of a tax allowance is not relevant, but, nevertheless, taking two people having the same income, one with a big family and not paying income tax, and one with no family who would be paying a large sum&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>You can even go above that.  People with many children would not be liable to income tax or to a very small amount of income tax by reason of the dependent child allowance.  There is the difficulty, for example, that in giving an allowance for medical expenses as a deduction for income tax, you could subsidise a person in the surtax bracket up to over 75 per cent of his medical expenses.  The difficulty arises then as to what are medical expenses.  In what way do they arise? People now undertake medical treatment for all kinds of maladies, even hypochondriacs' maladies, even things for which treatment is not necessary at all.  People go in for slimming.</P>

      <P>That is possibly an extreme example, but people take drugs and medicines not necessarily in connection with serious illness, and even if they are, one has to define what is medicine, because there are things taken for various purposes which could not properly be described as medicine.  There is also a difficulty in connection with the Voluntary Health Insurance Board fund.  Representatives of the Voluntary Health Insurance Board have stated that it would have an effect on the income to the fund, in that people, if they thought they would get an allowance in respect of income tax for medical expenses, would possibly withdraw from the fund.

      <P>When the Minister was speaking at the beginning and saying that income tax was chargeable on such a sum as remained after allowances, etc., he had read his brief very fully.  In fact from recollection, I could write that brief, because it was exactly the same brief as was given to me when I brought in in 1956 one of the best pieces of legislation ever introduced in the country, the export tax relief introduced in 1956.  The advice tendered to me then was that it would be all wrong to do it, that it would breach the whole income tax code; income tax was there for the purpose of providing that assessments would be made on profits, etc., etc.  It was exactly the same advice as was tendered to me&mdash;honest advice, but it was wrong&mdash;and which was overridden by me.  That was good legislation, as the Minister&mdash;from his experience in Industry and Commerce&mdash;will agree.  He should override the advice in the same way now on this issue, not I agree in the exact terms of this amendment but in terms of the more limited one.  With that, when he may have an opportunity of considering it on a more limited basis, may I withdraw the amendment with the permission of the House?

      <P>Control of Imports (Amendment of Quota No. 3 and Revocation of Quota No. 4) Order, 1965.</P>
      <P>I have circulated a memorandum explaining the background to this Order.</P>
      <P>The Free Trade Area Agreement with Britain provides for the removal of a number of quotas against goods of United Kingdom origin and their substitution with duties.  Some quotas will be removed immediately on the 1st July, 1966, and others will be retained for varying periods.  One of the quotas retained for two years is that on leather footwear.  This is retained to meet the wishes of the manufacturers.</P>
      <P>The quota restrictions on rubber and plastic footwear were removed with effect from the 1st January, 1966. The rubber footwear quota included slippers and the manufacturers of slippers wished to retain quota protection for a further period.  This was done by altering the scope of the leather footwear quota, which is being retained for two years, to include slippers.  Plastic footwear, which formerly was included in the leather footwear quota, was removed from it and, thus, no longer has quota protection. If there is any other information required by Deputies, I shall let them have it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Control of Imports Order is a very necessary piece of legislation as far as the footwear industry is concerned, but it is wise at this stage to examine very briefly the present situation in the footwear industry, as this quota and the remainder of them, of which this is obviously a forerunner, will affect the industry.  In my constituency about half the footwear operatives in this country live and work.  I am sorry to say at this time that a very great <Col N="916" /> number of them, mainly in the town of Dundalk and some of them also in the town of Drogheda, are on short-time; they are working three days per week.  This would be a serious situation if there was to be no change in the future as far as tariff or quota protection is concerned but, unfortunately, those of us who have studied the free trade negotiations which were carried on and the eventual agreement which emanated know that in June, 1968, all quotas on footwear must disappear.  In face of the fact &mdash;and I quote an old figure because I have not got a new one&mdash;that only approximately 24 per cent of our footwear is exported and 66 per cent is consumed at home, it is quite clear that unless we can increase our exports spectacularly before the 30th June, 1968, then our footwear operatives and the factories in which they work will be in a very serious position indeed.</P>
      <P>I am aware, from recent reports available to us, that there is an improvement in exports.  How this is possible at the present time with short-time in the footwear industry is something I find difficult to comprehend. I do not know whether or not the Minister has any information on that but, unless he has some particular information I have not got, I am sure he will find that difficult to comprehend also.  But it is true.  There must be a very definite effort to increase the exports still further.  The two items of choice and price which will come upon us on the 30th June, 1968 are items which will mean, inevitably, the loss of some of our home trade.  There might be some amongst us who would be naïve enough to suggest that we all ought to be patriotic and buy Irish but, while that might hold for some of us, for a great number of our citizens I am afraid that will not hold and they will buy on price and on choice.  In fact, it is also true to state that in many cases they will not be told by the suppliers of footwear whether or not the article offered is of Irish manufacture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, a very serious situation faces the industry because we could not hope to hold the high percentage of our total production which is home <Col N="917" /> trade in any article of wearing apparel or indeed of human consumption because choice exercises a very definite preference for one type of thing or another, or one design or another.</P>
    <P>In the case of footwear the vast number of articles which can be offered to a prospective buyer means that with the influx of British shoes here, the range will be widened to a very considerable degree.  That, of itself, would mean that less of the home trade would fall to us.  But if you add to that the fact that the price of some of the imported articles offered may be lower than the price of our home trade articles, then it seems to me our home trade is the one which will suffer.  That is not the only difficulty we have of the attack on a vast expansion in our export trade. I hope that we can do it but it seems to me that if we have increased our export trade in recent months&mdash;as we have&mdash;then we are, perhaps, in a position of having too great a production potential within the industry. I hope this is not true but if we are capable of producing more shoes than we can export and more shoes than we can use at home, then there must be very great changes or, otherwise, the 30th June, 1968, will find us in a sorry state indeed.  I do not want to be the harbinger of bad news, particularly when it would affect a very large number of people within my constituency but it would be like sticking one's head in the sand like an ostrich and not taking any account of the portents if we did not point to the fact that, before we reach this stage of the 30th June, 1968, we have short-time in the industry and that this has been occasioned while exports have been increasing.</P>
    <P>I should like to have from the Minister clarification on a point to which I think I know the answer. That is the question as to whether or not leather shoes with rubber or composition soles&mdash;I do not refer to slippers, I refer to, shall we say, walking shoes&mdash;are included in the quota section or in the duty section.  That is something which should be clarified. I think they are in the quota section for leather shoes but I would wish to see the matter clarified.  I agree with <Col N="918" /> the Minister's statement in his explanatory memorandum that &ldquo;these arrangements have been agreed with the British Authorities and are in accord with the Free Trade Area Agreement&rdquo;.  I think, at the same time, the fact that the deadline and the guillotine is 30th June, 1968, is a sobering thought.  That is something the Minister should dwell on as far as hopes for industry are concerned and perhaps he will give his hopes for the expansion of industry, or at least his hopes in defence of every job that exists therein, when he is replying to this debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is now very apparent that the boot and shoe industry, with which this measure seeks to deal, is one of the most vulnerable in respect of the inroads that can be made in any industry in the context of free trade.  That being the case, it is all the more desirable, and indeed necessary, that all possible steps be taken to safeguard the industry and the workers employed therein.</P>
      <P>This measure gives notice of the intention to abolish the quota system and to replace it with a tariff system. It refers to the various types of footwear manufactured in this country and indicates that the manufacturers of one particular type of footwear, namely, rubber or plastic footwear, have indicated a preference for the levy system in their particular category. They asked that quota restrictions on their type of products should be terminated and a duty substituted and this is now being done with effect from 1st January this year.</P>
      <P>In thinking in terms of free trade, we have striven to convey to the Minister and his predecessors the desirability of safeguarding this industry and continuing the quota protection for so long as possible in order to assist the boot and shoe manufacturers to complete the task of re-adaptation which they have embarked upon and which is not as yet completed in very many instances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our advice is to hasten very slowly in respect of the removal of this protection by way of quotas in particular because there is evidence that the <Col N="919" /> industry is not as yet ready for the excruciating experience with which it will have to contend in freer trading circumstances.  It would be all right if this industry were going to gain something by free trade with Britain or free trade with the countries of the EEC.  But he is a very foolish man indeed who does not realise that the highly efficient manufacturers of Britain and the Continent are capable of flooding our market, capable of dumping here a sufficiency of goods and commodities which would last a year out of what was for them a week's production.  If we do not slow down this process of dismantling this protection, it is evident to us that industrial graveyards will result.  Even at the present time, in the boot and shoe industry in particular, there is evidence of firms throwing in the towel even before the battle has commenced.</P>
    <P>We have the fact that within the past few weeks two very old and well-known boot and shoe establishments have closed down, one at Carlow and the other at Birr.  As one who worked in the boot and shoe industry, I realise full well what this means to the operatives in the boot factories in these two towns, Carlow and Birr. These are men and women who have given the best years of their lives to the boot and shoe industry.  They are highly skilled craftsmen and women, many of whom have reached advanced years and are very largely unsuitable for alternative employment.  Indeed, in respect of the two small towns to which I refer, there is no alternative work available for them.  To my knowledge, many of them have been forced to emigrate.  These are portents, Sir, of things to come.  An obligation devolves upon the Minister to realise the social consequences that flow from the closure of such factories.</P>
    <P>Here we have some hundreds of boot and shoe operatives thrown on the unemployment scrapheap without any alternative employment in these particular towns, and with no golden handshake either.  Indeed, the manner in which the Carlow factory in particular was closed down gives cause for <Col N="920" /> great anxiety, because the union concerned would not accept redundancy in the form laid down by management and management, which even repudiated the recognised principles of seniority of service when it comes to laying off staff, peremptorily closed down the factories and removed the machinery so as to make it impossible for successful negotiations to take place or production to continue.  This rash decision, this disregard for men and women who gave such long, loyal and devoted service&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I sincerely hope, therefore, that the Minister will give special attention to this problem and do all he can to ensure that production recommences at the Birr factory, or that he will strive to find some alternative means of employment for those unfortunate boot and shoe operatives who have lost their livelihood in Carlow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a matter of some wonder to us why we should be so anxious to rush into free trade with Britain or the Common Market because the balance of trade between ourselves and the Common Market in particular is completely adverse.  We bought some £40 million worth from the countries of the EEC in one year, and we sold to them in return only £8 million worth of goods.  In other words, for every £5 worth we bought from the countries of the EEC they bought only £1 worth from us in return.  We cannot see what <Col N="921" /> advantages are to be gained by such a movement towards freer trade.  In respect of the British economy, let me reiterate that the gigantic forces in Britain, when the barriers are lowered, are capable of wreaking disaster on our economy.</P>
    <P>If we are to commit ourselves to this exercise, the Minister should deal in his reply with the problem of dumping. This is one of the ingrained fears of industry.  Without an adequate system of protection against dumping, it is quite evident to us that the highly efficient manufacturers in Britain, with whom we are now embarking upon free trade, are quite capable of overcoming, not the quota system because it is limited to a certain number of goods, but the tariff system.  Irrespective of how high the tariffs may be fixed, these manufacturers will be quite able to overcome them, and by dumping hundreds of thousands of pairs of footwear here, they could dislocate the native industry.  It is a well-known truism that it is too late to apply antidumping regulations when dumping has, in fact, taken place.  The damage is done at that stage, and it is difficult to retrieve the industries that have fallen by the wayside.  Effective antidumping legislation is required to ensure adequate protection for the home trade.</P>
    <P>In this measure it is proposed that the quota system which the boot and shoe industry has enjoyed over a long number of years will be discontinued. Instead of having a quota system, a duty will be applied.  That duty will be 36 per cent <i>ad valorem,</i> or 6/- per pair of imported footwear.  To my mind, that is excessively low.  At present there is evidence of British manufacturers selling off dated lines of footwear at virtually give-away prices. It strikes us in the industry that 6/-duty per pair is something that they could easily get over.  Some of the more unscrupulous of them may be prepared to get over this duty, however high it is put, even at a loss, in order to get a foothold in this market of ours.</P>
    <P>This duty of 36 per cent <i>ad valorem</i>, or 6/- a pair, which is to come into operation in July, 1968, will be <Col N="922" /> reduced by 4½ per cent per annum, and by 8/- per pair of footwear between 1968 and 1975, when the duty will have disappeared altogether, and we will then have completely and utterly unfettered free trade between this country and the United Kingdom.  While I am pleased to see the quota system being continued for another two years, I am concerned about what will happen after that when the duty replaces the quota.</P>
    <P>At present the quota is very high and it makes for competitiveness amongst Irish manufacturers.  The quota for imported footwear for 1964 and 1965 was 165,000 pairs.  Now, 82,500 pairs is fixed as the quota for the half-year to June, 1966.  It would seem then that the quota for 1966 will be the same as it was for last year, and for 1964, when it stood at 165,000 pairs.  This does not take into account the very many thousands of pairs of footwear which are brought into this country by way of licence granted by the Minister to traders and wholesalers who may require particular types and standards of shoes which allegedly are not manufactured here.</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister to have regard to the increasing quantities of footwear imported by way of licence. It seems to us that many of these licences are secured on a pretence and that the footwear which many allege cannot be made here can and should be made here.  Our manufacturers are quite capable of making shoes of the standard and style required by anyone in this country.  There should be no grounds for the issue of licences of this kind at all.</P>
    <P>I have said that we are concerned about the advent of free trade for our boot and shoe industry.  The Committee on Industrial Organisation have investigated this industry, and have indicated in no uncertain terms that in the event of freer trading circumstances, and this most assuredly takes in Great Britain, no fewer than 1,000 operatives in the boot and shoe industry will lose their jobs, and, if the adaptation measures which the CIO recommended were not adopted, a further 1,000 operatives would lose their jobs.  This then comprises one-third <Col N="923" /> of the whole labour force in the boot and shoe industry.  The boot and shoe industry comprises some 6,000 persons.  It is true to say that it produces 97 per cent of the home requirements and that it distributes £3,500,000 in wages here every year.  Last year it exported 30 per cent of its products.</P>
    <P>The industry is one which has proved itself to be both competent and efficient. It is a great national industry which is surely worthy of protection and of being afforded every opportunity of equipping itself and readapting itself for the sterner competition with which it will have to contend in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>In case I might be regarded as expressing a biased viewpoint with regard to the attitude of the industry towards free trade, I would like to quote from the Report of the Footwear Adaptation Association, Third Annual Report, 1965, page 15 under the heading &ldquo;Free Trade with Britain&rdquo;.  I quote from that Report:</P>
    <P>The leather footwear industry gained nothing from the Free Trade Area Agreement with Britain; on the contrary, we stand to lose a substantial and growing share of our home market to imports over the next 10 to 15 years.</P>
    <P>This is the considered opinion of the Adaptation Council of the Boot and Shoe Industry.  I feel, lest I might be unfair to them, that I should complete the paragraph.  I quote again from this Report:</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, from the beginning of the negotiations, the Council supported, in principle, the idea of a trade agreement.  We did this on the assumption that the Irish Government would succeed in negotiating reasonable terms for the protection of the Irish footwear industry during the transition period, and that there would be adequate protection against dumping.</P>
    <P>This measure also breaks with the principle of the quota as far as the industry is concerned.  It concedes the principle of the duty and tariff system to the rubber and plastic <Col N="924" /> footwear section.  I accept the Minister's statement that it was at the request of the manufacturers of those particular types of footwear but I must advert again to a comment in this Report:</P>
    <P>In view of the increased use of plastic and other man-made materials, in footwear uppers, the Council considers that it would be more logical and more satisfactory that the footwear industry (with the exception of the sector making wellingtons and over-shoes) should be treated as a single industry for the purposes of protection.</P>
    <P>The industry desires one method of protection, if at all possible.  It states further:</P>
    <P>In the years ahead, it is probable that the footwear ranges produced by all Irish footwear factories will contain footwear of both leather and man-made materials.</P>
    <P>My wish then is to express our pleasure that the quota system will continue for another two years and the hope that the Minister is not fully committed to the abolition of the quota at the end of that period but rather that the situation will remain fluid and flexible so that we may have a closer look at the industry and satisfy ourselves that it is ready for dismantling of the quota system and its replacement by a duty.</P>
    <P>I have already expressed our ingrained fears at the abolition of the quota and the imposition of the duty because a duty is relatively easy to overcome.  It may well precipitate an avalanche of dumping here and the quick dislocation and virtual annihilation of many of our industries.  We should then have increased unemployment in the boot and shoe industry and wholesale redundancy.  There is evidence of that at present in Carlow and Birr, and this is happening in circumstances in which as yet there is no system of adequate compensation for those redundant operatives and no recognition by the employers or the State of services rendered over a life-time.</P>
    <P>It is a particularly unchristian <Col N="925" /> approach that workers should be discarded as mere items of refuse.  That is why it is so important that the much-lauded proposals in the manpower policy in respect of training, compensation and re-absorption in alternative employment, should be implemented as soon as possible.  I again appeal to the Minister to do everything in his power to resolve the sad situation of Birr while there is still hope and not to allow the highly skilled craftsmen and craftswomen of this particular town to be lost to this great industry.</P>
    <P>The Minister should find some ways and means of rehabilitating the industry, helping it on its feet, and giving it a new lease of life.  While Carlow is more difficult, in the sense that the machinery has been taken away, the Minister should do everything possible to bring to Carlow some new enterprise which will absorb the unfortunate men and women who have lost their employment through the closure of this long-established factory.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will give us his views on pending legislation involving proposals he may have for dealing with the colossal problem of dumping. I hope he will also tell us whether we are finally committed to the complete abandonment of the quota system in 1968, after which we must move on in trepidation to 1969 when duty will replace the otherwise adequate safeguard to this most important industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I share with Deputies Donegan and Treacy an anxiety that this proposal is being discussed at a time when this long-standing industry is going through a difficult time and when people in the industry are full of anxiety, stimulated not by the disappearance of two factories but by the onset of the Free Trade Area.  This measure is simply one of many similar ones which will have to come before us for consideration in the light of free trade conditions and it is unfortunate that so many people in the House are not fully informed about the direct consequences on various industries of these proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must accept in good faith what has been put to us by the Minister <Col N="926" /> because we must take it that the Minister, in turn, has been informed by the industries concerned.  It is with some interest we note that one section of the boot and shoe manufacturing industry wishes to have quotas replaced by tariffs right away while another section wishes to have quotas retained for two years.  Why there should be any difference in their desire is something which does not readily strike the uninformed and we should appreciate any assistance the Minister can give us in this respect.</P>
    <P>One of the less desirable consequences of quotas is the system which operates whereby licences are issued to a limited number of people who do not, in fact, import all the shoes they are permitted to import under the licence but rather farm out or sell portion of their quota to other people. This situation of one parasite making profit out of another parasite has caused an artificial price for many imported shoes.  This, in turn, of course, has operated to the advantage of Irish manufacturers because while the goods were supposed to be imported free of duty under licence or quota, the considerable profits made by the licence holders or by their sub-licences has meant that before shoes reach the retail shops a number of parasites have made considerable profits on the articles which, in turn, have been passed on to the consumer. With the disappearance of quotas, it would appear that privately imposed taxes will go and be substituted by the State tax and this may be preferable to the extent that if a tax is imposed by the State it may be beneficial to the public.</P>
    <P>I wish to express concern that it is becoming next to impossible to obtain leather soled shoes for children.  In the past month I have been informed that in future no leather soled shoes will be manufactured in this country for children.  I should like to hear that is not so because the medical profession are of the opinion that children can be given a more firm grip with leather soles than with shoes which have rubber or soft composition soles. If we provide our children only with composition shoes or shoes with rubber <Col N="927" /> soles, any deformity in the children's feet or legs will be simply translated into the shoes and will not be corrected by the shoes.</P>
    <P>That may well be beyond the limited scope of this Bill.  It may not be something the Minister can control by the imposition of quotas as an alternative to tariffs or <i>vice versa</i>, but it is something I should like the Minister and the contacts he has to bring before the boot and shoe industry.  I may have misunderstood Deputy Treacy but it appeared to me that he seemed to think quotas and licences are two different things.  Perhaps he is right but as I understand it quotas are the amounts allowed to be imported under licences.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>There are special licences apart from quotas.  I mentioned certain types of shoes not made here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I speak as one of the unfortunate consumers.  The shoe industry is one which has had to fight hard during the years against the unreasonable and unjustified prejudice of many people who believe the Irish article is inferior to the imported one. This still applies to several different goods manufactured here but I think it has applied with a larger degree of unreason to boots and shoes.  This has led the industry here carefully to conceal the fact that they have been made here.  Some of these shoes are exported because they are of a sufficiently high standard.  Some of the shoes bear no indication that they were made here, but rather the reverse.  They may bear the name of some English or American firm.  The manufacturers are careful to conceal the fact that they have been made in Drogheda, in Carlow or in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can only hope that the oncoming of the free trade area will encourage our people to think afresh and while they may not necessarily buy an article simply because it is Irish, that they will take a pride in Irish workmanship and not allow this stupid prejudice which has operated in the past to continue.  I have been told by some people in the retail end of the shoe <Col N="928" /> business that they have had on occassions customers coming in saying they do not buy Irish shoes.  On being offered Irish shoes they have been quite curt and rude in rejecting them and willing to take other shoes offered. Those other shoes were, in fact, made in Ireland but were of the kind which did not bear an indication that they were made in the Emerald Isle.  Those retailers told me they had no complaints coming from the people who bought the shoes which had not on them an indication that they were made in Ireland.  I suggest that this is a simple test of the quality of Irish shoes.  In the instances I have mentioned it may have been applied dishonourably but it showed that good Irish shoes can be sold despite unreasonable prejudice.</P>
    <P>The only thing which compels us to accept this measure is that apparently it is in accordance with the wishes of the people in the industry.  They have suggested that it is the best way to meet the arrival of the free trade area. We hope all goes well with them in the future because they deserve well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not a motion proposing that we should enter the Free Trade Area.  This we dealt with earlier in the year.  The motion deals with arrangements for the footwear industry arrived at after consultation with the industry in its various branches.  Doubts have been expressed about this industry.  It remains to be seen how valid the arguments are that were put up, the fears that the industry cannot survive in competition.</P>
      <P>I believe that this is one of our industries that through its whole history has developed from a very small industry in the twenties, in the beginning of this State, to one supplying the bulk of the home market last year, plus about £3 million of exports.  This is an industry that has proved in competition in the export market that it can meet the best put up by other manufacturers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the same time, all the footwear markets are going through a difficult period.  This is not to say that our manufacturers cannot compete with others.  They have successfully comreasonabl <Col N="929" /> peted in the export market.  I might add that their adaptation procedures are well advanced.  I have every confidence in their capacity to increase their market when the general picture of markets for footwear improves in Britain as well as here.</P>
    <P>The question of Carlow and Birr was raised as if competition from abroad had caused their troubles. Free trade has not arrived yet and the competition from abroad is quite limited.  It is about three per cent of the market.  It is not fair to link in these problems with the coming of free trade.  This is ordinary competition in the home market.</P>

      <P>We are exporting ten times as much as we are importing. This is a good industry that is able to compete in the export market.  It has adapted well.  After that, we have to have faith in it.  In free trade, we cannot go around telling workers that they cannot compete with workers in other countries.  Everything in this industry says that it will succeed.  At present, the industry here and in Britain is going through a difficult period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A question was raised about leather shoes with rubber soles.  Any leather in a shoe, I gather, brings it within the leather quota.  The quota, which will be retained for two years on leather footwear, will be replaced by a duty which <Col N="930" /> will be rather high&mdash;36 per cent or 6/-per pair, whichever is the higher.  This was arrived at by a close examination carried out by the Industrial Development Authority.  There was no picking of figures out of the air.  This was a thorough examination.  It was calculated that this would be a good protection and, as Deputies know, the protection will gradually be reduced.</P>
    <P>In the matter of dumping, legislation is ready.  It is being produced.  I had hoped to have it introduced in this session of the Dáil.  It will not now be introduced in this session because of consultations which have to take place.  The legislation has been prepared in consultation with a variety of interests, including the Federation of Irish Industries and has all the necessary components to make it effective and to protect our industry against dumping.</P>
    <P>Deputy Treacy said that licences for unusual types of shoes outside the quota were issued when somebody alleged that he could not get the shoes here.  These licences are issued only when cleared by the local manufacturers.</P>

      <P>That is my information. That is the rule.  I agree with Deputy Ryan about the standard of Irish shoes and that is why I am confident of their ability to compete.  I will make inquiries as to the question he raised about the availability of leather-soled shoes.</P>

The difference between the requests by the two sections of the industry&mdash;the leather footwear people asking that the quota be kept on for two years and the rubber footwear people asking to have the quota removed at once and replaced by a duty&mdash;is explained in this way.  As far as I know, the quota in the rubber range was not across the wide range of shoes available in rubber but the quota was being used to get in the better paying types so that the market for the less valuable types was left to the home manufacturer.  He is <Col N="931" /> in a better position if the quota disappears and he is dealing with a duty.</P>

      <P>He will have to compete in future.  The Deputy will see that if we have a quota which does not go across the whole range but takes the better part of the market in the value of the shoes, then he is at a disadvantage.  If he is meeting a duty across the whole range, he is confident that this is the way he can best deal with the situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Boland) Kevin Boland">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>As Deputies will have seen from the explanatory memorandum, the Bill includes the provisions necessary to implement the decision announced by the Minister for Finance in his Budget speech to increase the rates of non-contributory old age, blind and widows' pensions and the personal and adult dependant rates of unemployment assistance for persons with no means. In addition, I have found it possible to include two important changes in the Social Insurance Scheme&mdash;the modification of the contribution conditions for widows' (contributory) pension and the extension of unemployment insurance to cover women employed in private domestic service and in agriculture. There are also a number of provisions dealing with miscellaneous improvements in the social insurance and social assistance schemes.</P>
      <P>Although the Bill is not very long, the explanatory memorandum circulated with it is necessary to elucidate the effects of its provisions, which must of necessity be largely drafted by way of reference to existing legislation, a method which unfortunately can lead to a considerable amount of obscurity in the text.  I trust that Deputies will have found the memorandum useful and sufficiently informative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Budget increases are all on the <Col N="932" /> social assistance side this year and I think it only proper that, where resources for improving the social services are limited, the bulk of these resources should be devoted to the most deserving groups in the community. This is in line with the views I expressed here in July last in replying to the debate on the Second Stage of last year's Social Welfare Bill.  I intimated then that I hoped, as further moneys became available, to introduce new categories in the means scale, including one for persons with no means and apply a higher rate of pension to them. I feel sure that Deputies will agree that this is the way to get the best advantage from the amount available.</P>
    <P>For that reason, the money made available to me in the Budget this year has been devoted mainly to increasing non-contributory old age, blind and widows' pensions and unemployment assistance for persons who have no means, that is, persons whose means on investigation have already been assessed as nil.  It is estimated that some 21,000 old age or blind pensioners out of a total of over 112,000 such pensioners will benefit from the increase of 5/- in the maximum rate of pension and that some 6,500 widows out of a total of 22,000 widows will similarly benefit.</P>
    <P>The position in regard to unemployment assistance is somewhat different in that the manner of applying the means test to recipients differs from that applying in the case of pensioners and it would not have been possible to apply the Budget increases only to persons with no means without causing a number of anomalies.  For unemployment assistance purposes, the existing Acts lay down maximum rates of assistance for the various categories of person and these rates are payable where the weekly means do not exceed 2/- in the case of a person with no dependants or 5/- in the case of a person with a dependant, in other words, the first 2/- or 5/- of assessable means as appropriate are disregarded. The rates of assistance are reduced by 1/- for each further 1/- or part of 1/-of means which the person may have over and above the amount disregarded.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="933" /> The Government have agreed, therefore, to extend the Budget proposals in relation to unemployment assistance slightly, so that, in effect, every recipient will get some increase. This is being done by increasing the maximum rates of unemployment assistance, both urban and rural, for the various categories by 5/- in the case of persons with no dependants, 10/- in the case of persons with adult dependants and 8/- in the case of persons with child dependants and at the same time, withdrawing the disregard of the first 2/- or 5/- of any means. Thus, the new maximum rates will be paid to persons with no means and these rates will be reduced by 1/- for each 1/- or part of 1/- of weekly assessed means.</P>
    <P>The result will be that all recipients of unemployment assistance will receive increases ranging from 10/- in the case of a married couple with no assessable means down to 3/- in the case of a person with no dependants who has means.  The increases in rates will also have the usual effect of automatically extending the means limits for qualification for unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>The question of modifying the contribution conditions for widows' (contributory) pension is a matter I have had in mind for some time.  The present conditions are quite satisfactory in cases where the husband dies while still insurably employed, even where he may be fairly young, as the requirement of having 156 contributions paid, that is to say, the equivalent of three years paid insurance, and a yearly average of 39 contributions paid or credited over the last three or five years immediately prior to his death, are comparatively easy conditions to satisfy.  If they are satisfied&mdash;as they are in the majority of cases&mdash;the widow gets full contributory pension for life without any test of means.  However, they are not satisfactory in cases where the number of contributions during the years immediately prior to the husband's death is low, due, say, to a break in insurable employment for any reason.  Similarly, they are difficult to satisfy where a man has a regular but limited amount of insurable employment <Col N="934" /> each year, and is, say, self-employed during the remainder of the year but for one reason or another fails, or is unable to pay voluntary contributions.</P>
    <P>A number of cases have come to my notice where there had been a considerable amount of insurance over the husband's working life but not sufficient contributions in the vital three or five years before his death to qualify the widow for pension.  It could be argued that the man must have failed, for one reason or another, to exercise his right to become a voluntary contributor and thus to preserve his pension rights but to learn this after her husband's death is of little consolation to the widow, particularly where she knows that her husband had a large amount of insurance in earlier life which in the event is useless to her for pension purposes.  I propose to remedy this position in the Bill by continuing the existing requirement of 156 contributions paid but, where a widow fails to satisfy the existing average test, to provide an alternative test under which the average will be calculated over the full insurance life-time, full pension being paid if the yearly average so calculated is 48 or more and reduced pensions being paid where the average is less than 48. This will enable more widows to qualify for contributory pensions either at the full rate or at reduced rates and the extra cost will be met by an increase of 2d in the rates of employment and voluntary contributions.</P>
    <P>Some of the widows who benefit by the modification of the conditions may also be entitled to widows' (non-contributory) pension and these will not be paid where the contributory pension is better.  Regulations will, however, be made to permit widows to draw the non-contributory pension in lieu of the contributory pension if the rate of non-contributory pension for which they could qualify would be higher, the contributory pension in any such case being paid from the Social Insurance Fund into the Exchequer to offset in part the cost of the non-contributory pension.</P>
    <P>The fact that women employed in private domestic service were not <Col N="935" /> insured against unemployment has been the subject of some comment and criticism over the years.  I have not been satisfied that a good case exists for such a total exclusion or for the similar exclusion applying to women employed in agriculture.  I propose therefore in the Bill to extend the unemployment benefit scheme to include these women by increasing the rates of social insurance contribution payable in respect of them to include some element in respect of unemployment benefit and by permitting the new increased contributions to count for unemployment benefit purposes.  Additional conditions for the receipt of unemployment benefit by these women will, however, be prescribed by regulations under existing powers and will have regard to the peculiar conditions of their employment and other relevant factors.</P>
    <P>The terms of these additional conditions have yet to be settled but the general intention is to restrict entitlement to unemployment benefit to women with a good employment record over a minimum period of, probably, ten years&mdash;possibly with some scaling down of the requirements beyond that point in step with advancing age.  The restriction of entitlement to the proved domestic and agricultural worker of maturer years enables the consequential increase in contributions to be put at the low figure of 1/- a week, of which the employer will pay 7d.</P>
    <P>The proposals in relation to widows' contributory pension and unemployment benefit for female domestics and agricultural workers both involve increasing the rates of social insurance contributions while other increases in these contributions rates are proposed in the Social Welfare (Occupational Injuries) Bill at present before the Oireachtas.  It is necessary for obvious reasons that all three increases in contributions should be synchronised and accordingly the proposals for increased contributions in this Bill, together with the related provisions, will be brought into operation on a date to be appointed by order by the Minister. It will then be possible to ensure that <Col N="936" /> the increases under this Bill and the increases in connection with the occupational injuries scheme will be brought into operation on the same day.</P>
    <P>One of the miscellaneous provisions in the Bill is consequential on the increase in the maximum rate of non-contributory old age pension.  This is section 13 which provides that a person who is disqualified for receipt of non-contributory old age pension because he is benefiting under the old age contributory pensions scheme may have the option of drawing the non-contributory pension if he can qualify for it and it would be better for him than the payment to him or in respect of him under the contributory scheme.  This, of course, can only happen in the combination of circumstances of the person being eligible for the new maximum rate of non-contributory old age pension, having no means, and being entitled to a lesser payment under the old age contributory pension scheme.  Where a person opts to receive the non-contributory pension, the amount he would otherwise receive under the contributory scheme will be paid out of the Social Insurance Fund to the Exchequer to help meet the cost of the non-contributory pension.  A similar position will arise under the widow's contributory pension scheme in relation to widows aged 70 years or more when the new conditions provided in the Bill become operative. Section 13 is drafted to provide for widows in such circumstances.</P>
    <P>The remaining provisions of the Bill involve mainly the tidying up of existing provisions.  One of them will enable regulations to be made for the payment of increases of old age (contributory) pension in respect of qualified children to persons other than the pensioners where the circumstances so warrant.  This power already exists in regard to the increase of pension in respect of an adult dependant and it is used, for example, to allow payment of the adult dependant's allowance to be made directly to the wife where it is clear that the husband is neglecting her.  It is considered desirable that similar powers should exist in regard to the increases of pension payable for children.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="937" /> Another provision relating to children involves qualified children for the purposes of increases of pension under the Old Age Pensions Acts. These increases are payable at present in respect of children for whom the pensioner is receiving a children's allowance under the general children's allowances scheme and a blind mother is thus precluded from receiving an increase of her blind pension in respect of her children where her husband as head of the household is the person entitled to the children's allowances.  It is proposed to permit the blind mother in such a case to receive an increase of her pension for her children.  Steps will be taken by regulations to be made under existing powers to prevent the payment of double increases in respect of the same children to both the husband and the wife.</P>
    <P>A few cases have arisen recently where widows have lost contributory pension by reason of the default of their late husband's employers in the payment of contributions and I have been advised, in connection with the recovery of lost benefit for the widows that I could not recover more than the net amount of the benefit lost, due allowance being made for the fact that the widow had been paid non-contributory pension.  This could apply also in connection with other benefits of the social insurance scheme.  I am not happy about this position nor am I satisfied to leave the position such that the employer in such circumstances can evade his liabilities at the expense of the Exchequer.  The Bill, will, therefore, make it clear that the amount repayable by the employer in such a case is the gross amount of benefit lost and that, if assistance has been paid to the beneficiary, it will be repayable to the Exchequer either as part of the gross amount repayable by the employer or, if he has repaid the full amount of the benefit lost to the insured person or other person affected, by that person.</P>
    <P>Finally, the powers in relation to the making of Orders in connection with reciprocal agreements with other countries on social security matters are being consolidated and expanded to cover all the main social security schemes administered by my Department. <Col N="938" /> This was in part prompted by our ratification of Convention No. 118 of the International Labour Conference which made it necessary to obtain such powers in relation to children's allowances.  In addition, the recent agreement with the United Kingdom on social security matters showed the desirability of having clearly defined powers covering the widest possible range of our schemes.</P>
    <P>I hope I have been able to add sufficient to the explanatory memorandum to give Deputies a comprehensive picture of the proposals in the Bill and of their effects.  It may help Deputies if I summarise the cost of the various proposals in the Bill.  On the social assistance side, the total cost will be £694,500 of which the Budget proposals as amplified will account for £674,500.  There will, however, be savings to the Exchequer consequent on the modification of the widow's (contributory) pension scheme amounting to some £144,000 a year and this will leave the nett cost to the Exchequer of the proposals in the Bill as £550,500. The gross annual cost of the improvements on the social insurance scheme will be £310,000 in a full year of which £288,000 will be met by the increase in contributions leaving the nett cost to the Exchequer, £22,000 in a full year.</P>
    <P>The improvements in the social welfare schemes being provided in this Bill are not as substantial or extensive as those provided last year but they are worthwhile improvements within the limits of the resources available. The Bill is moreover an earnest of the Government's continued interest in developing social welfare services and a continuation of the process of effecting each year such improvements in them as are found possible.  I have pleasure therefore in recommending the Bill to Dáil Éireann.</P>

    <P>NEW SECTION.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. P. Byrne Mr. P. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="939" /> Before section 8, but in Part I, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Rule 9 of the Rules applicable to Schedule E contained in the Income Tax Act, 1918, is hereby amended by the substitution of &lsquo;reasonably to incure expenditure for the appropriate performance&rsquo; for &lsquo;to expend money wholly, exclusively and necessarily in the performance&rsquo;.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment is designed to provide a measure of relief for salary and wage earners.  Before making my case for the amendment, I want to draw the attention of the Minister and of the House to the context in which this amendment has been framed.  Wage earners and salary earners are the most important single section of the tax-paying community. Numerically, they amount to about 90 per cent of the total number of taxpayers.  Over the past several years, the total tax collected from wage and salary earners has increased very substantially indeed, particularly since the introduction of PAYE.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned here on section 1 last week, there is an old maxim of the law to the effect that equity is a stranger to income tax.  I have suggested that the Minister's predecessor was too readily prepared to live with that situation.  We have a tax code&mdash; again, as I mentioned last week&mdash; which was never designed for our circumstances and for our times, a tax code which was first introduced to this country in 1853, having originally been drafted away back in the first decade of the last century by the then British Prime Minister, Sir William Pitt.  In so far as there are anomalies, inequities and injustices in that tax code which relate to wage and salary earners, it is even more desirable in this case, in simple justice, to rectify these anomalies and inequities because of the inequitable extent to which we are leaning on wage and salary earners for direct tax revenue.</P>
    <P>This amendment appears to be somewhat technical.  It is an amendment of Rule No. 9 of the Rules applicable to wage and salary earners&mdash;<Col N="940" /> Schedule E Rules&mdash;as laid down in the British Act of 1918 which is still in force in this country.  I shall read the Rule: it is quite brief.  It is:</P>
    <P>If the holder of an office or employment of profit is necessarily obliged to incur and defray out of the emoluments thereof the expenses of travelling in the performance of the duties of the office or employment, or of keeping or maintaining a horse to enable him to perform the same, or otherwise to expend money wholly, exclusively, and necessarily in the performance of the said duties, there may be deducted from the emoluments to be assessed the expenses so necessarily incurred and defrayed.</P>
    <P>From the reference to keeping or maintaining a horse, it may be surmised that the Rule is of very long standing.  In fact, it is intact in the 1918 Act as it was in the British Act of 1853.</P>
    <P>That brings to mind a picture of the Minister coming into Dáil Éireann riding his horse or being driven by his coachman behind a pair of spanking bays.  It is as antiquated as that, as are, indeed, other Rules in the tax code.  I have said here, time without number, that such Rules are quite unsuited to these times and to our conditions.  That Rule is a very restricted rule.  It has the effect of depriving wage and salary earners of tax relief in respect of legitimate expenses incurred by them in the earning of their salaries and wages.</P>
    <P>The amendment I have drafted is as recommended by the Income Tax Commission.  This Commission reviewed the British background of this Rule and had a look at the decisions of the various Royal Commissions which considered this, amongst other matters.  The British Royal Commission of 1955 stated there can have been no part of the tax code which has been so regularly the subject of unfavourable notice as this Rule 9.  It has been variously described by learned judges as &ldquo;jealously restricted&rdquo;, &ldquo;strictly limited&rdquo; and &ldquo;a very narrow and strict Rule&rdquo;.  These are quotations from the Report of the Royal Commission, <Col N="941" /> which also give the references to the cases from which the learned judges' remarks are quoted.  In one case the provisions of the Rule are described as &ldquo;notoriously rigid, narrow and restricted in their operation&rdquo;. In the test case, Bolan v. Barlow 1949, the learned judge in Britain declared:</P>
    <P>A great number of these cases have produced in my judgment extremely hard results.</P>
    <P>It is a Rule which undoubtedly causes a considerable amount of hardship when applied to particular cases.  It is a Rule&mdash;and this is a most important point&mdash;confined to wage and salary earners.  It is not a Rule applied to business people taxed on a different part of the tax code and entitled to considerably more latitude and discretion in deciding what expenses they incur in the earning of their profits.</P>
    <P>It is not unfair or untrue to say that for all practical purposes wage earners and salary earners are not allowed any expenses as of right.  In some cases by concession they are allowed a limited sum in respect of tool money and overalls. These are the restricted examples that occur to me.  A worker cannot claim his trade union subscription as an allowable expense for tax purposes. A salary earner who is a professional person, a member of the expanding group of managerial persons, cannot even claim his subscription to his professional association.  If he does not pay it, he will be struck off his professional roll and no longer qualified to hold his job.  Let us say he is an architect in the Board of Works or a lawyer in the employment of Deputy Sweetman.</P>
    <P>I think there is an unanswerable case for this amendment.  Under the present Rule, the Revenue are forced into the anomalous position of making very unreal distinctions as between what an employee is obliged to incur in the performances of his duties and what it is desirable he should incur. There is great emphasis in this Rule on the physical performance of one's duties.  If an architect, for example, ceases to be a member of the architects' institute he will not be physically unable to prepare plans or make drawings, <Col N="942" /> but he will cease to be an architect. That is an example of the unreal distinctions made under this, not to speak of the broader range of cases involving expenditure on books for their professional learning, on tools and protective clothing and involving for certain types of salary and wage earners perhaps the provision of secretarial assistance and of a motor car.</P>
    <P>I do not want to labour the case.  As I said on a previous amendment this evening, the fact that our Income Tax Commission considered this matter at length, considered the pros and cons of the various courses of action and came up with the proposal which is involved in my amendment, in itself should be sufficient for the Minister. Bereft of technical details, the nub of my case is that wage and salary earners and individual taxpayers are a section of the community who in equity are most harshly and indeed unjustly treated by our tax code.  The implementation of this amendment would be an instalment of justice for these sorely afflicted people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that this Rule is framed in what might be described as old verbiage does not necessarily mean it is bad wording.  The reference to the horse obviously indicates that it is over a century old, but the essential words, the words Deputy Byrne seeks to amend, are expenses incurred &ldquo;wholly, exclusively and necessarily&rdquo; in the performance of his work or job.  These words are as relevant now as they were 50 or 100 years ago. I do not think time has changed the purpose of those words, nor is it necessary now to change the effect of the words.  I do not think we need bandy about the recommendations of the Commission on Income Taxation because I have been using them as they suit me and Deputy Byrne has been using them as they suit him.  Therefore, so far as the Commission are concerned, their recommendations can cut both ways.</P>

      <P>Maybe I have been guilty of that, but nevertheless the fact <Col N="943" /> is we have used the recommendations as it suited our own particular case. Of course, our Commission followed the recommendation of the Royal Commission, as Deputy Byrne said, even though that Commission's recommendation, in the form Deputy Byrne now proposes, has not been adopted in Britain.  Deputy Byrne cited a number of cases, the case of the architect employed in the Office of Public Works, or a solicitor employed by a private practitioner, but that is not the full case because in the case of the architect, if he is obliged, as a condition of employment, to continue his contribution to his professional organisation, then it would be an allowable expense, being a condition of employment. It is the same with a solicitor. The trade unionist does not necessarily have to pay his contribution to his trade union as a condition of employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not familiar with the conditions of employment there.  In any event, the words which Deputy Byrne wants to introduce instead of &ldquo;wholly, exclusively and necessarily in the performance&rdquo; would widen the whole scope of the kind of allowances a person can seek in mitigation of his obligation to pay income tax.  It would certainly create a whole volume of new case law, create much difficulty in administration and would certainly reduce the tax income from this source.  I forget if Deputy Byrne made any reference to the workman who has to have overalls cleaned and tools provided but I think he did, and I think he accepted that these are regarded as expenses necessarily incurred and therefore <Col N="944" /> qualify for an allowance.  I believe that to change the wording would certainly open up the prospects for avoidance of income tax and would have the effect of reducing the income from this source.  As the Deputy is well aware, the words &ldquo;reasonably to incur expenditure for the appropriate performance&rdquo; are so wide that it would be very difficult to establish what was not reasonable and what was the appropriate performance of one's functions.  The old definition &ldquo;wholly, exclusively and necessarily in the performance&rdquo; is a fair one and one which can be measured accurately and which gives the minimum prospects of avoidance.</P>
      <P>I know that the payment of income tax is not something that people welcome in any sense but I would not go as far as Deputy Byrne has gone, to say that it is grossly unfair as operated in this country.  On the contrary, I think our income tax code is much less onerous than that of many other countries.  I do not think it is in any way inappropriate to our circumstances.  The fact that this form was introduced by Sir William Pitt in 1853 does not necessarily mean that the form in which it has evolved as of now is necessarily inappropriate to our circumstances because for almost half that period, or perhaps less than half, we have been introducing our own Finance Acts and&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. P. Byrne Mr. P. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>As to the moulding of our own legislation, there was considerable discussion here on section 17 of the 1963 Act which, like so many other provisions brought in here in various Finance Bills, was no more than a schoolboy's cog of the British law.  Now, in the Commission's report, in paragraph 231 of Chapter 4, there are set out six examples of what the Commission considered to be fair expenditure incurred by employees and <Col N="945" /> office holders and which were held to be inadmissible.  I am not going to detain the House by reciting those clear-cut examples but rather would I ask the Minister to study them at his leisure.  It is true that the recommendation on this matter which was made by the Royal Commission in 1955 was not implemented by the British Chancellor, in its entirely at any rate, although a provision somewhat analagous to my amendment in respect of professional subscriptions was brought in in a British Act some five or six years ago.  Broadly speaking, the Minister quite rightly says that the British Chancellor did not implement his own Commission's recommendation.  That, to my mind, is no proper precedent for the Minister to quote.  The Minister has not adverted to my comments on the context in which this amendment has been framed, the great need to give an instalment of justice to wage and salary earners.  There is a dead hand of conservatism on tax reform in this country and in dealing with the Minister's predecessor, one was beating one's head against a stone wall in advocating reasonable, fair and just reforms as recommended by our own Commission.  It is most disappointing to see that the present Minister for Finance is following that particular precedent.</P>

      <P>We have been talking about old Acts and at the time these Acts were passed, most employees lived on the doorstep of their employment.  Dublin city was about one-tenth its present size. Today a great many employees&mdash;and <Col N="946" /> I am very conscious of this fact as, I am sure, is every other Deputy &mdash;have to live a very long way from their employment.  Some have to spend up to £1 a week at least on public transport.  It is said that there are administrative difficulties in the way but it would seem to me that it would not be administratively very difficult for an employee to claim the amount he spends on public transport each day going to his place of employment from his home.  I do not see why the Minister could not favourably consider granting that as an allowance.  It might go some way towards meeting the wishes of Deputy Byrne.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>Before section 8, but in Part I, to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In connection with any assessment for liability to income tax where a person proves that he has incurred expenditure by way of fees paid to an educational establishment for the instruction of his child, step child or legally adopted child there shall be deducted from the income to be assessed the expenses so incurred subject to a maximum deduction of £75 in respect of each child and provided that the child is not entitled in his own right to an income in excess of one hundred pounds per year.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a very fair and, I think reasonable amendment.  I hope the Minister <Col N="947" /> will accept it.  This country is very poor indeed from the point of view of natural resources, natural wealth, mineral wealth and inherited wealth, such as are possessed by other industrial countries.  If one looks at the matter objectively, one must come to the conclusion that our greatest source of national wealth is the brainpower and talent of our young people.  I said here last week that it was time to sit back and take a long, hard look at the principles upon which personal allowances are based for tax purposes. There is a personal allowance for a child engaged in full-time education of £120 a year; that was increased this year by £30 to £150.  Presumably it is intended to cover the upkeep and maintenance of a child at school or university. It is not nearly enough.  Ten years ago day secondary school fees were approximately £20 per year; today they are £60, £70 and £80 per year.  In UCD, when I was doing Arts and Commerce, a three-year course, the fee was £20 per year.  It is now in the region of £75, nearly a fourfold increase.  Students' digs ten years ago were 45/- to 50/-per week.  One could get really good digs at 50/- per week.  Now digs are costing £5 and £6 per week.</P>
    <P>There is very little State assistance given to education here as compared with the standards prevailing in Northern Ireland and Britain and a scale of tax allowance analogous to that applied in the North or in Britain falls far short here of equity and fairplay. In the tax code as applied to business people, very sound encouragement is given for capital investment.  If an industrialist buys a new machine, he gets in the year of purchase substantial tax relief.  That is in the national interest because it enables us to build up capital and develop our country.  If the Minister thinks that an increase of £30 this year in the allowance for school-going children and university students is either a realistic or worthwhile relief for parents providing education for their children, which is made available by the State in other countries, then he is grossly misleading himself, his Party and this House.</P>
    <P>That, briefly, is my case for this <Col N="948" /> amendment.  The allowance is grossly inadequate compared with 1939. The £ today is worth about 6/8 as compared with 1939.  Caught in the tax code today is a type of person who would not have been paying any tax on an equivalent income in real terms in pre-war days.  The Minister's predecessor made the point several times on amendments similar to this that, rather than bring in <i>ad hoc</i> reliefs, he would prefer to lower the standard rate of tax.  We know the Minister cannot lower the standard rate of tax and I would make the case that the really urgent need now is to provide relief for individuals.  Indeed a standard rate of tax substantially in excess of the present one could hardly be objected to if it were accompanied by a firm scale of personal reliefs designed to restore effectively the pre-war position and ensure that the small man, who contributes so much in the way of indirect tax and, in particular, the family man, coping with all the trials and tribulations which afflict people today who are trying to bring up children and educate them, is relieved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Much of the comment I made in dealing with the amendment about medical expenses would be relevant to this amendment as well.  The amount of subvention by way of grants and other assistance that the State has given to education over the past few years has increased more than proportionately with the increase in overall taxation.  I cannot give the Deputy the exact figures now, but I could prove that, if challenged.  While we still may not be paying as much in educational subventions as other countries are, we are increasing them relatively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our big difficulty here is that not only is our tax base not very broad but the number of taxpayers we have is not very great.  The Deputy is aware that about 30 per cent of our people are engaged in farming and, by and large, farmers are not income tax payers.  Some of them pay under Schedule B, which is a very limited sum, and some who are engaged in other activities pay on their income from those activities.  Therefore, the number of people who pay <Col N="949" /> taxes is very limited and the more reliefs we give, the more we have to burden these people with taxes, whether income or indirect taxation.</P>
    <P>Because I found it necessary to increase the standard rate this year, I thought it was desirable to give some form of relief, and the one I thought best to introduce was increasing the child allowance from £120 to £150 for children of 11 years and upwards. I did that in order to help people who were sending their children to secondary and vocational schools and to universities.  This might appear at first sight to be a modest increase in the allowance, but it costs the best part of £500,000 in a full year.  That is as far as I could go, this year at any rate; I am not suggesting that in a future year I could not bring in the specific allowance Deputy Byrne has suggested.</P>
    <P>Again, while I presume Deputy Byrne does not claim anything special for his drafting of this amendment, it would, in effect, cover a very wide range of instruction and education. The Deputy simply says: &ldquo;...where a person proves that he has incurred expenditure by way of fees paid to an educational establishment for the <Col N="950" /> instruction of his child...&rdquo;  How would one define &ldquo;an educational establishment&rdquo;?  There are many people who are getting national and secondary education practically for nothing.  I admit there are secondary school fees but they are very limited. The same applies to vocational education. Some of these people might like to send their children to a deportment class where they might get full-time instruction, and while deportment may be a worthwhile subject, the Deputy's amendment would allow relief in respect of up to £75 in fees paid for this purpose.  I know that is an extreme example, but I have gone as far as I can this year, having regard to the difficulties it would raise for the Exchequer and particularly having regard to the fact that the taxpayers as they now exist would have to bear the increased burden if we were to increase reliefs as suggested by the Deputy.</P>

    <P>Amendment declared lost.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>Before section 8, but in Part I, to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Amounts paid by individuals for transport to and from their places of employment by bus or rail shall be deductible from incomes for the purposes of tax assessment.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Deputy Byrne, in his treatment of his amendment, has very capably outlined the position of the income taxpayer generally in the community.  While the Minister claims that our income tax code will be said to be less onerous than that of other countries, the fact remains that the section of population which is required to pay income tax in this country are mainly the wage earners and salary earners and it is to the condition of the wage earner that I want to address myself in dealing with this amendment.</P>
      <P>The cost of travelling to and from employment has become a very big item in the cost of living which workers have to face in these hard times.  That is particularly true in respect of workers who live on the perimeter of this city or in Dublin county, or, indeed, of workers who live on the fringes of other cities or towns throughout the country who must travel considerable distances in many cases to their places of employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bus fares, of course, are extremely high as we know and only recently they have again been very considerably increased, again accentuating and sharpening the problem of living for the people to whom I refer.  Take the example of a man who lives on the edge of Dublin city, who is working in some industry either at the centre of the city or on the far side of the city, and it will be found that, as a general rule, his bus fare, that of a man who is usually the head of the household, is seldom less than £1 a week.  Take the part of my constituency to which I have so often referred, Ballyfermot, and look at the position of the worker living there and <Col N="953" /> not at the extreme end of it either. He will require to pay, for travel from the shopping centre in Ballyfermot to O'Connell Bridge, 1/- there and 1/-back. That is two shillings per day for that journey and he is working a five day week, so it amounts to 10/-per week.  But more often than not he has a second bus trip to make to his place of employment, possibly out to the southern or northern suburbs, if he works in an industry or factory of one kind or another.  So it is quite possible to find such men suffering an effective wage reduction of up to £1, and sometimes much more than £1 a week, within the Dublin city area by reason of the exorbitant bus fares charged to workers for the use of buses.</P>
    <P>This problem is magnified when one thinks of workers travelling to Dublin from places in the county more or less remotely situated.  There are many examples of people who travel from, say, Balbriggan to Dublin by rail or, indeed, who travel from Drogheda, County Louth, to work in Dublin and back in the evening.  Here we have instances where the cost of travel on the ordinary wage earner bears exceedingly hard.</P>
    <P>If I mention the situation in Dublin particularly it will be understood that I do so because it is long accepted by students of transport here that the bus travelling population of this city and county subsidise by their bus fares the transport system in a general way in the rural areas.  It has long been argued that transport nationally cannot be made an economic proposition and the Government have on every conceivable occasion at the instrumentality of certain very prominent public officials, who shall be for the nonce at any rate nameless, lost no opportunity of increasing the already too high level of bus fares.  It is in order to try to get some relief for such of the bus-using public as are required to pay income tax that I put down this amendment.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sir Anthony Esmonde in the course of his remarks on a previous amendment pointed to that very important fact as it affects the position of workers nowadays and distinguishes workers as a class or social group <Col N="954" /> from workers of other days inasmuch as it was true that up to more or less what can be described as recent times wage earners were to be found living very close to their place of employment, clustered as it were around factories or other centres where work was available.  The passage of time has changed that.  Housing development, such as has occurred, has been largely suburban.  Clearances of the slums have resulted in the transfer of many thousands of working class families to houses in locations four or five miles from the city centre.  This has brought about these modern conditions in which costs of travel are an integral part of the cost of living for the average worker, but there has been no recognition of this fact by the Government.</P>
    <P>I do not know if, in fact, costs of travel are ever taken into account by statisticians when computing the cost-of-living index.  I would rather doubt it. It is high time that this was taken into account.  It is merely as an initial step in that direction that we seek to have this principle embraced in this Finance Bill&mdash;the principle of making allowance by way of income tax at the beginning for workers who have to pay these high bus fares and rail fares for getting to their place of employment.</P>
    <P>In my view, the burden of income tax falls upon the working people, the wage earners particularly and the salary earners, to an extent that is unjustifiable.  As Deputy Byrne said, it is completely inequitable.  There are large sections of the population of Ireland who get away with the payment of no income tax of any kind whatsoever.  I do not think it is an exaggeration to say that in many cases their economic condition is extremely comfortable when you take it in comparison with the situation of the workers to whom I refer, and the details of whose living costs I instanced last week when we were dealing with the General Resolution which is related to this Bill.</P>
    <P>I am moving this amendment because I believe it is high time that notice was taken of the position of such people.  A beginning should be made in the direction of affording them some relief.  I do not think that the <Col N="955" /> relief suggested here is extraordinarily great, nor do I believe that if it is permitted to these workers it will seriously impair Revenue receipts.  I hope that the Minister will receive it favourably and so contribute to an easement of the struggle which these people are now having in order to live.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. P. Byrne Mr. P. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>We welcome this amendment.  We tabled one very similar to it two years ago.  Since that time the problem which it endeavours to cater for has been considerably aggravated by rising transport costs.</P>
      <P>Those of us who are involved in Dublin housing problems are only too well aware how reluctant our people are to accept Corporation housing in far outlying places such as Coolock, Ballyfermot and Finglas.  Ballyfermot is known in the vernacular as Bally-far-out. I have known of many cases where persons sorely in need of housing would put up with inadequate accommodation in the city area rather than accept housing in these outlying areas. These people have absolutely no discretion and no choice in the location of their houses.</P>
      <P>If an affluent businessman chooses to live in Greystones or Skerries the Minister and the Revenue Commissioners could very fairly ask: &ldquo;Why should we provide a tax concession for an individual who chooses to move out to live in the rarified atmosphere of an exclusive far-out suburb?&rdquo;  That argument is a good one in those circumstances, but it cannot at all be related to the city worker compelled against his own personal preference to accept housing far out from his place of work.  It is, of course, a most sacred principle of the tax rules that the expense of travelling to one's place of work by a wage earner, a salary earner or a business person, must never be allowed for income tax purposes.  That has been elevated to the position of a most sacred doctrine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Dunne said, bus fares can be a most significant item in the family budget of a worker, not only for himself in travelling to work, but for his wife in going to the shops, and for his children in going to school.  By <Col N="956" /> reason of our ill-conceived lack of planning in our housing development we have built houses in places like Ballyfermot and Coolock, and we have failed to provide them with all the peripheral amenities which are customarily provided in other countries, shopping centres, schools and churches.</P>
    <P>The bus bringing children from Ballyfermot or Finglas to the Whitefriar Street National School is still running after donkey's years since the people were sent out to that area.  While the children are granted reduced fares&mdash;I think it is still a 1d. fare&mdash;in the morning time and in the evening, that is not available to them at lunch time.  It is true to say that bus fares are a very considerable burden on the pay packet of many a Dublin worker and salary earner.</P>
    <P>The tax code makes no allowance whatever for these expenses which must be incurred before the taxpayer can have a taxable income.  To my mind, it is only a matter of simple commonsense.  We are wholly in favour of the amendment and are most happy to support it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not detain the House very long but I would like to support the amendment.  Deputy Dunne has mentioned the fact that bus fares to a worker who finds himself living in some of the suburban housing schemes is a major item of the family budget.  As a member of Dublin Corporation who is placed in the position of interviewing people regarding housing problems, I have possibly a far greater insight than others into just how big an item in the family budget bus fares are.  I have knowledge of very many families who were evicted from houses, due to their dangerous condition, and who were offered alternative accommodation, if they were fortunate enough to be in the category to whom it is offered, for whom one of the major problems was the question of bus fares, the expenditure of the husband getting to his work and home at night.  This expenditure completely debarred him from going home at lunchtime for a meal and he had the additional expenditure involved in <Col N="957" /> having a meal away from home or had to take a very meagre lunch with him to his place of employment.</P>
      <P>As was mentioned by the previous speaker, the wife finds that in some of those housing estates which we have around the perimeter, all facilities are not available.  This is particularly evident in the newer estates.  It is necessary for the wife to make frequent trips into town.  There is also the question of children who are attending schools adjacent to their former places of residence.  Those children also have to be catered for.  This situation has been very greatly aggravated by the recent happenings in Dublin with regard to housing.  We found it necessary, due to houses collapsing, to condemn hundreds upon hundreds of houses and absolutely no account could be taken of where a person would be offered alternative accommodation.  No account could be taken at all of where the man worked. Bus fares are a very large item of expenditure and we feel this amendment is very worthy of consideration. It would mean quite a substantial amount to the people in question and would mean very little to the Government by way of revenue.  The amendment should be accepted by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment refers specifically to people who travel to and from their place of employment by bus or rail.  The amendment asks that the cost of such travel should be deductible, as an allowance, for income tax purposes.  The amendment takes no account of people who travel by bicycle, by foot or by car.  Therefore, at the very outset, it raises difficulty of administration as to whether the person who travels by bicycle or the person who finds time to walk, has in fact travelled by bus for the purpose of this claim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Byrne has said it is a principle of income tax regulations that the cost of travel to and from the person's place of employment has not been allowable as a deductible allowance for income tax purposes, because the position was many years ago that a person, by and large, lived <Col N="958" /> where he liked.  If a person lived in a far off place very distant from his place of employment, it was in many cases a matter for himself.  It still is a matter for many people who are working for wages and salaries.</P>
    <P>This amendment takes no account of wage earners, as Deputy Dunne describes them, as opposed to salary earners.  The man Deputy Byrne referred to living in Greystones or any of those well-known, desirable suburban places, could still be a wage earner or a salary earner.  He could live as a matter of choice in such a place.  He would be entitled to an allowance in respect of his bus or train fare much as the Ballyfermot resident would be entitled to it, if the amendment were accepted.  It would obviously give rise to great administrative difficulties as it takes no account of other modes of travel.  It would also be a way of making false claims.  I am not inferring that people living in Ballyfermot would engage in malpractices. Incidentally, Ballyfermot has been referred to many times in this House as an example of many things but there are other places such as Spangle Hill and Mayfield in my own constituency where people have to travel long distances to work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputies serve them well and without having to raise their difficulties in the House.  Deputy Dunne referred to the family he instanced in the House last week, the person earning about £12 10s a week. The Deputy was able to produce that person's outlay as amounting to something in excess of £13 a week.  Of course, that person would not be relieved <Col N="959" /> at all by the provision the Deputy wants to bring in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not suggest he would.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>People earning more than that would not be brought in. That person with two children had roughly £12 10s a week.  In order to be caught for income tax and therefore to qualify for the relief in Deputy Dunne's amendment, such a person would have to earn much more than £12 10s a week.  A person with three children would have to earn £1,000 odd a year, over £19 a week, before paying income tax.  That person would not be entitled to claim, either, under Deputy Dunne's amendment.  That person with three children would have to calculate bus fares in his budget, assuming his children had to travel to school, assuming he had to travel to his place of work and that his wife one day a week would have to buy things in town which would not be available locally.  Therefore Deputy Dunne's amendment would create relative hardship on that person as against the man with no children on similar income who would be getting an allowance in respect of bus or rail travel on his way to and from work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not suggesting it should be widened; I am merely pointing out the shortcomings of the Deputy's amendment.  I have given a couple of examples of the difficulties. The amendment takes no account of workers travelling by bicycle or motor car.  They go to work now not only by push bicycle but by motorcycle and motor car, especially to and from building sites.  When I was Minister for Industry and Commerce, I visited a factory and the factory manager complained about lack of space for proposed expansion.  The bulk of the workers were not in that day for one reason or another.  I pointed to a huge site where one or two cars were parked and asked: &ldquo;What about that?&rdquo;  He <Col N="960" /> said: &ldquo;The workers would never let me.  That place is a car park and it is full on an ordinary working day&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of them find it cheaper to run a car than pay the greatly increased bus fares.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>This was a rural area.  People going to a factory in a rural area must find a mode of transport other than scheduled bus or rail services.  I should point out that this is an allowance that has not been given except to a limited extent in Britain in war time to workers who had something to do with the war effort.  At the end of the war it was immediately withdrawn because of difficulty of administration.  That difficulty would always arise in relation to this type of relief.  It would help people in the income tax bracket and would not give relief to people who were not but who still had to pay increased bus fares.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason I mentioned bus and train users is that these people, certainly in Dublin and I am sure in Cork and Limerick and similar areas, are paying extraordinarily high rates for travel by way of bus and rail fares&mdash;those of them who are commuting, as the Americans have it, to work.  As well as paying high bus and rail fares to semi-State bodies, they are refused an allowance for income tax purposes in respect of these fares. In my view this allowance is due to them.  One would like to have&mdash;at some future date one hopes it would be possible&mdash;an amendment of the finance legislation which will embrace the various categories mentioned by the Minister&mdash;those who use cars, mopeds or motor bicycles and who have to buy petrol at greatly increased prices as a result of the mini-Budget.  That apparently is not conceivable now.  It was in order to accept the principle in small doses, so to speak, that I put down the amendment.  I regret that the Minister has not seen fit to accept it because it would have been a step in the right direction.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 8b:</P>
      <P>Before section 11 to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;11. &mdash; (1)  (a)  Subject to the next paragraph, the duty of customs on tobacco imposed by section 20 of the Finance Act, 1932, shall, as on and from the 10th day of March, 1966, be charged, levied and paid at the several rates specified in Part I of the Third Schedule to this Act in lieu of the several rates specified in Part I of the Second Schedule to the Finance Act, 1965.</P>
      <P>(b)  The said duty shall, as on and from the 15th day of June, 1966, be charged, levied and paid at the several rates specified in Part II of the Third Schedule to this Act in lieu of the several rates specified in Part I of that Schedule.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="968" /> (2)  (a)  This subsection applies to manufactured tobacco which was manufactured in, and consigned from, the United Kingdom and was manufactured therein from materials other than materials falling within Tariff Heading number 24.02 in the Schedule to the Imposition of Duties (No. 128) (Customs Duties and Form of Customs Tariff) Order, 1962.</P>
    <P>(b)  The customs duty on tobacco mentioned in subsection (1)  of this section shall, as on and from the 1st day of July, 1966, be charged, levied and paid on manufactured tobacco to which this subsection applies at the several rates specified in Part III of the Third Schedule to this Act in lieu of the rates chargeable under subsection (1) of this section.</P>
    <P>(c)  The provisions of section 8 of the Finance Act, 1919, shall apply to the duties imposed by this subsection&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  with the substitution of &lsquo;the area of application of the Acts of the Oireachtas&rsquo; for &lsquo;Great Britain and Ireland&rsquo; and as though the expression &lsquo;manufactured tobacco&rsquo; in the first column of the Second Schedule to that Act did not include manufactured tobacco to which this subsection applies,</P>
    <P>(ii)  as though manufactured tobacco to which this subsection applies, together with the descriptions of such manufactured tobacco in Part III of the Third Schedule to this Act, were mentioned separately in the said first column and the appropriate preferential rates specified in Part III of the Third Schedule to this Act were mentioned in the second column of the said Second Schedule to the Finance Act, 1919, opposite the mention of those goods in the first column thereof, and</P>
    <P>(iii)  subject to the last paragraph (beginning with &lsquo;Goods shall not be deemed&rsquo;) of subsection (1) of the said section 8 being disregarded.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="969" /> (d)  In this subsection &ldquo;the United Kingdom' means Great Britain, Northern Ireland, the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands.</P>
    <P>(3)  (a) Subject to the next paragraph, the duty of excise on tobacco imposed by section 19 of the Finance Act, 1934, shall, as on and from the 10th day of March, 1966, be charged, levied and paid at the several rates specified in Part IV of the Third Schedule to this Act in lieu of the several rates specified in Part II of the Second Schedule to the Finance Act, 1965.</P>
    <P>(b)  The said duty shall, as on and from the 15th day of June, 1966, be charged, levied and paid at the several rates specified in Part V of the Third Schedule to this Act in lieu of the several rates specified in Part IV of that Schedule.</P>
    <P>(4)  The expression &lsquo;hard pressed tobacco&rsquo; mentioned in Part III of the Third Schedule to this Act and the next subsection of this section has the same meaning as it has in section 17 of the Finance Act, 1940.</P>
    <P>(5)  The expression &lsquo;other pipe tobacco&rsquo; mentioned in Part III of the Third Schedule to this Act means manufactured tobacco of kinds normally intended to be used in pipes, not being hard pressed tobacco.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>My remarks in relation to section 10, as amended by amendment No. 8a, are relevant to this amendment.  The increase in the tobacco tax imposed by the Budget of 9th March is added to the increase imposed by Resolution No. 3 passed last week and the increase are then combined in this amended section and acceptance of the amended section will involve the deletion of section 11.</P>

      <P>Before section 13 to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;13.&mdash;(1) Subject to the provisions of subsection (2) of this section, there shall be charged, levied and paid on all stocks of tobacco of every description which at five o'clock in the afternoon of the 14th day of June, 1966, are in the ownership or possession of a licensed manufacturer of tobacco and in any place in the State other than a bonded warehouse, a duty of excise, payable by the manufacturer, at the following rate, that is to say:</P>
      <P>(a)  so far as the stocks consist of unmanufactured tobacco, three shillings and five pence for every pound weight of the stocks, and</P>
      <P>(b)  so far as the stocks consist of tobacco (including snuff) other than unmanufactured tobacco, three shillings and five pence for every pound weight of unmanufactured tobacco from which, in the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners, the stocks were derived.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  The duty imposed by subsection (1) of this section shall not be chargeable on any manufactured tobacco (including cigarettes, cigars and snuff other than offal snuff) as to which it is shown to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners that it was at five o'clock in the <Col N="971" /> afternoon on the 14th day of June, 1966, fully prepared for sale by retail and that either&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  it was not the product of any operation carried out by any manufacturer in whose ownership or possession it was at that time; or</P>
    <P>(ii)  it was at that time held as retail stock in premises used for selling tobacco by retail; or</P>
    <P>(iii)  it was at that time in transit from seller to buyer under a contract of sale:</P>
    <P>Provided that no tobacco shall be deemed for the purposes of this subsection to have been fully prepared for sale by retail if, according to the ordinary course of business of the person in whose ownership or possession it was or to whom it was in transit, it had still to be subjected to some further process (other than packing) before being sold by him.</P>
    <P>(3)  Every licensed manufacturer of tobacco shall not later than the 21st day of June, 1966, make a return to the Revenue Commissioners in a form approved by them giving such information as they may thereby require and, in particular, showing the quantities by weight of tobacco of every description in his ownership or possession at five O'clock in the afternoon of the 14th day of June, 1966, in any place in the State other than a bonded warehouse.</P>
    <P>(4)  Every licensed manufacturer of tobacco shall&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  produce, if so required, to any officer of Customs and Excise the trade books and all accounts and documents belonging to or in the possession of such manufacturer which are necessary for verifying the return made in pursuance of subsection (3) of this section, and</P>
    <P>(b)  render all reasonable assistance to such officer in the taking of an account of the tobacco which was in the ownership or possession of such manufacturer at five o'clock in the afternoon of the 14th day of June, 1966.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="972" /> (5)  Every licensed manufacturer of tobacco shall, immediately upon making the return required by subsection (3) of this section or on the 21st day of June, 1966, whichever is the earlier, pay to the Revenue Commissioners the full amount of the duty mentioned in this section on any tobacco which was in his ownership or possession at five o'clock in the afternoon of the 14th day of June, 1966, and was chargeable with the said duty, and the Revenue Commissioners may, if they think fit, defer the payment of the duty to a date not later than the 31st day of December, 1966, upon the manufacturer giving security by bond or otherwise to their satisfaction that such duty will be paid.</P>
    <P>(6)  Every manufacturer required by subsection (3) of this section to make such return as is mentioned in that subsection who either fails to make such return or makes a return which is incomplete, false or misleading in any material respect or fails or refuses to do anything which he is required by subsection (4) of this section to do shall be guilty of an offence under the status relating to duties of excise and shall for every such offence incur an excise penalty of fifty pounds, and all tobacco in relation to which such offence was committed shall be forfeited.</P>
    <P>(7)  Where drawback is payable in respect of tobacco on which the excise duty imposed by subsection (1) of this section has been paid, such drawback shall, to the extent of the duty paid in pursuance of the said subsection (1) as determined by the Revenue Commissioners, be a drawback of excise.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>This is the section imposing the duty on Irish wine.  There is no duty at present on wine made here.  It is made from what is called imported &ldquo;must&rdquo;.  That is the raw material for this type of wine.  There is duty on imported wine even if it is imported from the United Kingdom and in order to conform to the terms of the Trade Agreement, we either have to eliminate the duty on imported wine or impose a duty on Irish wine. Rather than forgo the duty on imported wine, we propose to impose a duty on wine made here and it will be done in accordance with the Trade Agreement and as agreed by the manufacturers of wine in this country in ten equal annual instalments.  The imposition will be trifling and makes no real difference to the manufacture and sale of wine from home sources.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>Before section 17, but in Part III, to insert the following section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The various enactments relating to death duties are hereby repealed.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Death duties or estate duty as a whole are one of the things we have inherited from British legislation to which we appear to be slavishly adhering, to the detriment of our financial position. Anybody will appreciate that the present Minister for Finance finds himself in considerable difficulties in that there is a gross shortage of capital at the moment.  We are one of the few countries in the world that has surtax and estate duty tax as well, neither of which is an encouragement to capital to come into this country.</P>
      <P>It was away back at the end of the last century or at the beginning of this century&mdash;I am not sure which&mdash;that estate duty was first introduced for the purpose of getting at the big estate-owners in England who paid little or no tax.  Whoever the genius was who thought of this tax, I presume it was thought that when a person was dead, he would not be worried about what tax he had to pay.  Actually, it is the reverse in this case: it is the people who live on who have to pay the tax. It is gradually widening its net.  It is causing untold hardship to all sections of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to deal with the question of how one could offset this tax.  The amount concerned on all taxes relating to estate duty, according to figures I got in reply to a Parliamentary Question on 30th March of this year, is £4.441 million.  It is just under £4½ million.  The overall revenue of this <Col N="976" /> country is running, in the average, at £250 million a year.  In effect, my amendment suggests that the Minister forgo a sum of £4½ million.  I am not frightfully optimistic, having listened to the rejection of amendments this afternoon where the Minister was asked to forgo only a few pounds to enable people to travel free on buses to their work.  I have no doubt that the economic and financial advice the Minister gets is that it is not feasible. Unless somebody infuses a new idea on fiscal policy in this country, we are heading gradually for gross financial difficulties.  We are doing so already. We are static in our economic progress. We have been listening to descriptions of the great advance in economic progress supposed to be going on in this country over the past four or five years.  That has suddenly been halted. I do not propose to deal now with the pros and cons of our economic progress. Assuming that it was progress and that there has now been a halt, then it is halted for the want of money.  I do not think anybody can deny that.</P>
    <P>There are several economies far weaker than our own with a far smaller population and fewer resources and reserves than we have. They have had the intelligence to do away with duties such as this to enable them to get capital into their country and to keep going by the process of the inflow of capital.  I shall mention just three of them.  The Channel Islands have very little resources, really.  Malta has practically no resources whatsoever.  At one time, it was entirely dependent on the British Mediterranean Fleet which is now practically non-existent.  They had no source of revenue but they had the sense not to impose taxes such as this and they have had a steady inflow of capital to enable them to carry on comfortably.  The same applies to the Isle of Man and to Cyprus.  Cyprus is a place torn with dissension, a place in which bombs fly.  They depend for their existence on lesser taxation.</P>
    <P>Sooner or later somebody will have to take a new look at the situation in Ireland.  I know the Minister's reply will be that we cannot afford to do it. <Col N="977" /> I do not expect he will even go so far as to agree that what I am saying is a useful thing to do.  He will probably say that we have reciprocal arrangements with the United Kingdom in relation to tax and therefore it is impossible for us to do it without breaking the sweet harmony that exists at present between the British Prime Minister and the Taoiseach, which culminated in that Agreement the other day.  We are not unmindful of the fact, however, that we have been twice kicked in the face.  First, they restricted the flow of capital here, which added to our difficulties; secondly, they had no hesitation in imposing the 15 per cent.  I do not suggest we break away from sterling or do anything drastic like that; but I suggest we at least continue in our financial policy on the lines most suited to this country as a whole.  If the Minister would go so far as to say he was accepting the principle of my amendment if he could find £4½ million, we would be travelling in some direction along the road.</P>
    <P>In many countries of the world today, people are trying to avoid taxation. In fact, the world has reached such a stage that practically everybody who has an investment or real estate of any sort is trying to evade taxation as best he can by legal and other methods.  I know the Revenue Commissioners in their activity on the turnover tax are well able to look after their end of the story.  I regard estate duty as a predatory tax.  It is harmful to a community as a whole.  Take the firm with an overall paid-up capital of £50 million, of which not many exist in this country.  It is subject to death duty.  The rate on £50 million is something like 30 per cent at present.  In the event of some principal in that firm travelling the road we all must travel some time, it means 30 per cent of that capital is going to be scooped out of that firm and it leads to unemployment. If it is on a capital of £100,000, the rate is 40 per cent.  No Minister for Finance and no adviser sitting beside him can convince me that is neither injurious to the economy or conducive to unemployment.  It may even go so far as closing down factories and business <Col N="978" /> concerns.  Apart from that, the duty itself is responsible for causing untold harm and disruption even in the family life of the country.  In the past this duty covered only bigger concerns. With the rise in the value of money, it takes very little to bring people within the ambit of this duty.</P>
    <P>I want to pose the ordinary case. The case where perhaps most harm is done is among the not very wealthy middle classes.  It does not take very much these days to run an estate up to £15,000.  The Minister probably knows the value of money better than I do because he is the custodian of the national purse, the one that pinches from time to time.  Say a person dies in the prime of life, leaving a couple of children at the most expensive stage.  The deceased owned his own house.  It does not take much in that walk of life to bring the value of the house up to £8,500.  Knowing I was going to move this amendment, I made a few researches into the prices of house property.  I see some quite moderately-sized houses now completed in the suburbs of Dublin are listed at £8,850.  Say there is an insurance policy.  I think that is put into the estate.  If there is an annuity as well, that is capitalised and put into the estate.  If the breadwinner prior to his decease had been told by a doctor he may not have more than a few years to live and has made over the property within three years or outside the period of three years, he is now pared back to five years.</P>
    <P>Suppose a man has saved his money, worked hard, bought his house and provided an annuity for his widow and also an insurance policy.  What happens is this.  Trying to educate and bring up these children, if the widow is lucky enough to have an insurance policy as well as an annuity, she may just be able to cover and pay the predatory demands of the tax gatherers and keep a roof over her head and maybe retain some of her annuity to struggle to bring up her children.  I do not think that is suitable justice.  I do not think it is applicable or suitable to this country.  Sooner or later &mdash;quite obviously, successive Ministers for Finance have been thinking <Col N="979" /> on those lines only they have not courage enough to take the plunge&mdash; somebody is going to come along and say this tax must go.</P>
    <P>That brings me to what is perhaps the most important part of what I am trying to convince the House.  It is, of course, said from the Fianna Fáil benches that if you remove any taxes at all, you are doing the old age pensioner out of his due.  I am more convinced than ever, having listened to this debate and listened to the rejection of the humble pleas made by Deputy Byrne and by Deputy Dunne, that the Minister is not likely to give anything but I am going to try to convince him and the House that it would be possible to get this money.  I am convinced that if to-night the Minister accepted this, the auctioneers would be pestered with inquiries from people living in the United Kingdom, probably people of fairly advanced years, who would see an opportunity of coming and settling here and of being part and parcel of the economy.</P>
    <P>It might be argued that that would be encouraging people to buy what we do not want to sell, our land, but it would not.  The type of person who would come would be retired pensioners of whom there are thousands in the United Kingdom.  They would come here and they would want to get houses.  Possibly one of the advantages of a Fianna Fáil Government is that so many people are without a roof over their heads and the first thing these people would have to do is to build houses and it is likely that they would build.  They would probably buy plots of land in the vicinity of our big cities.  Most of the people I have in mind would be enjoying lucrative pensions and would pay income tax.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to consider all the income tax he would get.  Apart from the income tax, their coming would create a different situation from the existing situation in which there is a lack of credit, a failure to pay the heifer grants, and so on.  All of these would fade away.  When these people came in, they could not live <Col N="980" /> indefinitely in hotels.  They would have no chance of getting any houses because there are no houses here, thanks to the policy of the Fianna Fáil Government. If this were made effective, they would build houses and the building of houses would mean more tax under PAYE from those engaged in the building trade.  I may be wrong, but I think that it would not be a question of 50 or 100 people, but of thousands coming in.  After all, it is a good country to live in, despite our weather, the Government and a few other things like that.  As I say, the Minister would have the advantage of PAYE and the industrial life would benefit because the building industry is one in which we supply all the raw materials ourselves. This would be a step away from the old policy of accepting everything that is British and particularly of accepting any worn out legislation that is bad for the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>We should have a fiscal policy of our own and we should think on those lines.  I feel certain that if the Minister is prepared to take this risk, it will pay him.  At the moment we are paying out large sums of money to foreign industrialists, to attract them to come here and having spoken to foreigners&mdash;as I suppose all Deputies have, in an effort to get as many industries as possible to their own constituencies, and some of us have not been as lucky as others&mdash;I know that quite a lot of them have refrained from coming here because of the estate duty they would have to pay on the investment of their money in this country.  Literally millions of pounds have been paid out by the Industrial Credit Company.  I have not got the actual figures but I am sure that over the years we paid out more than the amount we take in in estate duty.  The removal of estate duty would be an inducement to people to come in and would result in an industrial expansion and revival.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will consider what I have said, but as I also said, I have not much hope of anything from this side of the House being accepted.  This Government have lost their nerve.  They are struggling to exist from day to day, afraid to lose a <Col N="981" /> shilling and afraid to take any risks. I suppose if you have made many mistakes in your lifetime, you become cautious as you get older.  I am not talking about the personnel who, I understand, are seething young dynamos. This Government has been a long time in power, except for short broken periods when we had inter-Party Governments, and to a large extent they have stopped thinking.</P>
    <P>It is a curious thing for a Conservative Deputy like myself to say, and I am not ashamed to admit that I am conservative, that they are thinking conservatively and they are doing and accepting nothing new.  I am sure the Minister knew that this amendment had been tabled and I am sure he has had very sound conservative advice from his advisers&mdash;&ldquo;do nothing and you will not get into danger&rdquo;.  I am asking the Minister to take this step. If he does, he may undo the great harm of the financial legislation we have had over a number of years.</P>

      <P>Deputy Esmonde has made a good case for the point of view he seeks to present but unfortunately the extent of the Utopia he thinks we are going to get is not realistic. In the first place, a person to bring in his assets so that they will be liable for death duties in Ireland, must be presumed to have transferred his domicile.  Domicile is not a thing like nationality that you can establish by a written document.  Domicile is something <Col N="982" /> that must be proved by reference to a number of factors and these factors involve literally moving one's residence and moving one's usual habitat and habits from a former place of residence to a new country of residence. Even then the country from which he moves may not accept that he has changed his domicile and may look to his assets for death duty purposes when he dies.  The stroke of a pen or the buying of a ticket on a boat or on an airline does not necessarily involve the person who has assets bringing them under one jurisdiction rather than another.  Even if it did the person Deputy Esmonde has in mind would have then to transfer all his investments from the country from which he moved into the new country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, certainly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not so easy because some of these investments might be in lucrative equities.  They might be in some type of family companies from which he might not like to withdraw his investment.  Even if he did succeed in getting his money out, he might not find sources of investment here to satisfy his requirements from the point of view of a return on his money.</P>
      <P>However, to return now to fundamentals, we have here, unlike most other countries, no capital gains tax. The only type of capital gains tax we have is that imposed on the estates of deceased persons.  Under the Constitution we are required to ensure that the ownership and control of the material resources of the community are so distributed as best to subserve the common good.  The main purpose of estate duty is to ensure against the accumulation of wealth in the hands of a few people and to ensure, so far as estate duty is concerned, that such wealth will be fairly distributed amongst the people generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another consideration then to which I should advert.  Some years ago, my predecessor, Dr. Ryan, amended estate duty legislation by limiting the amount of duty on big estates of £100,000, and over, to 40 per cent, his purpose being to test this <Col N="983" /> contention that a reduced rate of duty would attract wealth.  I do not know to what extent it has done that, but there has been no very striking evidence of any great shift of capital from other countries.</P>
    <P>Now estate duty here at 40 per cent goes right through from estates of £100,000 and over, whereas in Britain the 40 per cent increases gradually to 80 per cent.  On estates of £1 million and over, the Irish tax is 40 per cent as against 80 per cent in Britain.  That is a fairly good inducement to wealthy people but it has not apparently been successful because we have very few estates of £1 million and over, whereas it is quite commonplace in Britain for the Exchequer to extract 80 per cent from estates of that size.</P>
    <P>There is one other point.  Deputy Esmonde referred to it.  It is the question of the £4½ million.  It is not something to be treated lightly.  I am not at all satisfied that the abolition of estate duty would attract sources of revenue of that value into the country. With regard to the suggestion that by doing nothing one will not make any mistake, the first advice I got from the Taoiseach when I took up ministerial office was to do something, that, by doing something, I might make a mistake but I might do a helluva lot of good too.  I have tried to follow that advice.  I do not see a great deal of good being done by adopting Deputy Esmonde's suggestion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that there were difficulties in moving capital into this country, difficulties in transferring assets, that other countries might object to assets being transferred. Am I not right in thinking that, if a person is domiciled in a country, it is in that country he pays tax?  My argument is that these people would come and live here, transferring their assets here.  They would then be subject to the fiscal laws here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but in the early part of the Minister's reply to my argument about people coming into this, as he said, suggested Utopia, he said that, even if they did come in, he would not be able to collect taxes from them.  I maintain he would.  My argument is based on the supposition that, if we abolish estate duty, people with money will come and live here and pay taxes here and that will compensate for the loss of this £4½ million revenue.  I understand the Minister to say these could not be domiciled here without the consent of <Col N="985" /> the country they leave.  The only consent a person needs is the consent of the country into which he comes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I never used the word &ldquo;consent&rdquo;.  Domicile has to be established and the country the person left may not accept that he has, in fact, changed his domicile and might chase his assets in here for estate duty purposes.  Generally it is a row between countries in relation to liability to estate duty by people who transfer their residence and who might be presumed to have transferred their domicile. Transfer of domicile is a different matter from transfer of residence and the country from which an individual has come may claim, and establish, that he has not, in fact, transferred his domicile and claim estate duty, therefore, on his assets when he dies.</P>
      <P>There are many other considerations applying.  I have not said at all that the person who comes in here, for example, draws a pension, say from the British Government or the American Government would not be liable to income tax on that pension. If it were high enough, indeed he would.  There is no question whatever about that.  However, I was saying that I doubt if the number of people attracted by the abolition of estate duty would be sufficient to make up by way of income tax the £4½ million we would lose in revenue from estate duty and death duties.  Deputy Esmonde made another point a while ago, that the abolition of estate duty would encourage industrial development. Of course, companies, being corporations, are not liable to estate duty at all so it does not matter to a company where it has its assets from the estate duty point of view.</P>

    <P>I think that where the Minister and I are at cross-purposes is this: the Minister assumes these people are going to come over here and die at once and there is going to be a dispute over the estate duty.  My hope is that these people will come here, will have many years to live here in which they will spend their money and that the Minister will be able to get income tax from them which will represent a full replacement of what he would have got in estate duty.  Of course if they come over here and died immediately, there would be a dispute as to who should get the estate duty and it would be very hard for the Minister to prove it was his lawful right to have it.  That is not the issue between us.</P>
    <P>Where I join issue with the Minister is on the Minister's statement that no one can transfer here without the consent of the country concerned.  If the person died within a reasonable period, there might be some dispute as to who should get the estate duty, but the issue is whether or not the people coming in here with money are going to provide revenue.  I absolutely fail to see why they should not, provided enough of them come in.  Anyway, the Minister knows no more about them from that point of view than I do, because he has never tried it.  Obviously the capital development situation of the country at the moment needs a new look.  I am suggesting to the Minister that this proposal is the avenue for it.  As I said at the outset, I was not very hopeful because there is very little new in the offing lately.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
      <P>Before section 18 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Notwithstanding anything contained in any other enactment insurance policies shall not be aggregated with the rest of an estate for death duty purposes.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment provides that there shall not be the aggregation of policies provided by section 25 of the Finance Act, 1965, because, though amendment No. 10 does not mention that section, it is that section which is the operative one.  Prior to the passing of section 25 of the Act of 1965, the provision was that policies that were taken out by a man for the purpose of providing for his widow after his death were not aggregated and, in consequence, did not operate for the purpose <Col N="988" /> of increasing the estate passing on the death and, therefore, for the purpose of increasing the rate of estate duty payable.  The section concerned dealt with the aggregation of the policies in question, but the effect of the section itself is aggravated by the provisions of section 26 of the Act of last year and by the provisions of section 17 of the Act of this year.</P>
    <P>The combined effect of all these sections now is that, even though a person may have taken out a policy <i>bona fide</i> for the purpose of providing for his widow in the event of his untimely death, substantial duties will have to be paid.  It also has the most extraordinary effect that the earlier the age at which a person dies, the greater will be the duty payable.  We can all visualise the case of a person who dies in his very late 20s and has a very young family, compared with a person who dies in his late 50s, and whose family are reared and fending for themselves. In the enactment of any taxation legislation, it is quite clear that we should bend over backwards to provide that the person with the young family will come out in a better situation than the person whose family has been set up.</P>
    <P>Because of the manner in which the computation for a policy is taken and related to the number of years over which the premiums have been paid within the previous five years as against the total number of premiums payable, the younger person is hit much more seriously than the older one and is hit also because of this aggregation provision. This is a matter that was discussed fairly fully last year.  I think time has shown in the year that has gone that everything we said then was true and that the criticisms that were levelled by us at most of Part III of the Finance Act of 1965 were justifiable criticisms.  Indeed the Minister has admitted that to some extent by the provisions of section 18.</P>
