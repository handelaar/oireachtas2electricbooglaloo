      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach when it is proposed to set up a joint committee between the British and Irish Governments to supervise the operation of the limitation arrangements <Col N="1114" /> and related matters in the textile sector of the Free Trade Agreement; and what form this committee will take.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. Carty)</NameTxt>
      <P>The entry in the National Accounts in respect of stock appreciation is not an element of National Income.  Since in company accounts the annual profit is arrived at by including the change in the value of stocks and since only the value of the physical change in stocks appears in the National Accounts, an offsetting entry termed &ldquo;Adjustment for stock appreciation&rdquo; (which may be positive or negative) has to be made to arrive at the conceptually correct total.  It would not be meaningful to express the adjustment as a percentage of National Income.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance the reason why there was a fall of over twenty per cent in the last quarter of 1965 compared with the last quarter in 1964 in the amount received by way of stamp duties on land and property transactions, other than stocks and shares.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The fall to which the Deputy refers is due principally to the virtual disappearance during the last quarter of 1965 of transactions of the kind which would have attracted duty at the £25 per cent rate in the last quarter of 1964.  Moreover, acquisitions of land by non-nationals in the last quarter of 1964 reached an inordinately high level, probably because it was during that quarter that section 45 of the Land Act was introduced. The Deputy will recall that section 45, which became law on 9th March, 1965, provided that an interest in land in a rural area could not vest in a non-national without Land Commission consent.  There were no transactions entered into since that date, which would have attracted the £25 per cent rate of duty even if that duty had not been repealed by the Finance Act, 1965.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware of the special interest which the design of this automated beet harvester created amongst the manufacturers of agricultural machinery in Europe, and especially in Holland and Britain? Is it not surprising at the very least that the Irish Sugar Company took no interest and offered no encouragement, help or advice, to this man?  Is the Minister not further aware that Irish beet-growers are clamouring for such an automated harvester and have indicated and are on record as saying that it would increase their acreage out of all proportion?  Is it not surprising that we should have to wait for foreigners to point out such a native genius as we have in Mr. Heffernan?</P>

      <P>I am not competent to judge the respective merits of Mr. Heffernan's machine and the machine being operated by the Sugar Company. The question of waiting for foreigners does not arise in this case.  The Armour machine has been developed and used, and continues to be developed, by the Sugar Company for several years.  It is not a question of waiting for somebody else to come along and point out a native genius and it is not reasonable to suggest that they should abandon what they regard as a suitable machine.  The Sugar Company would not be justified in taking on another machine.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 22 and 23 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been the practice to sanction local authority loans for house purchase on the basis of the projected volume of loan allocations.  In present <Col N="1126" /> circumstances, it is not possible to continue the forward commitment of capital for unduly long periods, and the amounts of individual loan sanctions are now based on estimated payments for a reasonable period ahead.</P>
    <P>In the case of Limerick County Council, the loan of £50,000 was sanctioned on this basis.  Sanction to a further loan is now under consideration.</P>
    <P>In the case of Limerick Corporation, a loan of £50,000, out of the £200,000 applied for in September, was sanctioned last November and the balance of £150,000 was sanctioned on the 4th January last.  The further loan of £150,000 applied for on the 13th January 1966 is under consideration.</P>
    <P>I understand that, in both areas, there is a substantial undrawn balance of approved loans still available.</P>
    <P>I expect to be in a position shortly to notify housing authorities of the amounts which will be made available to them in the next financial year to meet payments on house purchase loans.  This should enable housing authorities generally to proceed with forward allocation of loans subject to payments not exceeding these amounts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Some 80 houses are at present under construction.  The handover of houses for occupation is dependent on site-organisation which, as I informed the corporation in December last, was severely set back by weather conditions.  It should be possible in the next few weeks, in consultation with the corporation, to agree a handing-over programme with the contractors.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the real reason that these have not been handed over that the Minister has refused until the Dublin Corporation fleeces the wouldbe tenants and charges them rents far in excess of those now being paid in order to pay for the scheme?  It is not the weather that is to blame.  There has been nothing unusual about the weather this year compared with other years and the Minister knows that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if a notice in a trade journal which is available to subscribers only fulfils the obligation of public notice of planning applications as required in the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised that such a notice would not be adequate to comply with the requirements of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963 (Permission) Regulations, 1964.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that such a notice has in fact been accepted for a fairly important planning proposal?  Would the Minister consider amending the Act in some way to ensure that notices cannot be put in such a way that nobody could normally be expected to notice them?  They are being put in in Irish and in one newspaper they are put in in the sports columns&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be appropriate in some cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and all sorts of means are used to evade the Act.  Would the Minister consider doing something about this because the matter has reached serious proportions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only say that the people who in the first instance, and indeed in the last instance, determine whether or not the notice which is furnished is in accordance with what is required, is the local planning authority. The regulations state:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1129" /> Prior to the submission to a planning authority of an application for a permission for development, for an approval or for a permission for retention of a structure, the applicant shall give public notice of his intention to apply for a permission or an approval, by publication in a newspaper circulating in the district in which the land or structure is situate or by the erection or by the fixing of a notice on the land or structure. </P>
    <P>&ldquo;Newspaper&rdquo;, I should add, is not defined but how these other sorts of circulations are accepted by the officers of the local planning authority is more than I can fathom because while it is not defined what &ldquo;a newspaper circulating&rdquo; is, some of the things which the Deputy mentioned are stretching the imagination as far as the regulations are concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the difficulty not lie in the definition of &ldquo;newspaper circulating in the district&rdquo;?  Could the Minister see any way of defining that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that a notice stating that a man proposes to erect a dwelling or a building in a townland is not sufficient, although it is considered sufficient at present, because that townland may consist of a square mile and people will have no idea where the building is to be erected?  Would the Minister not agree that it should be much more specific?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose in this is to try to ensure that a person or persons who might have any views for or against the proposal would by this means be put on the alert, from which point they would be expected to be sufficiently interested in the townland to find out the location.  If I could find an easier or a clearer way of bringing this notice to the public's attention, I should be glad to do so.  We did try this at the time the Bill was being prepared but we found it rather difficult and too cumbersome and objectionable even from the point of view of the applicant.  In so far as a definition of &ldquo;newspaper&rdquo; is concerned, I do not know what we can do about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people dealing with these applications <Col N="1130" /> and acting upon them as valid applications should know better than to accept some obscure publication which is circulated on the basis of a subscription list, and it is asking for too much latitude when the regulations say &ldquo;a newspaper circulating in the area&rdquo;. Certainly I do not think our people in the local authorities should accept such applications.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister examine the position which arises out of the fact that some of these trade journals are registered in the GPO as newspapers, and that may be the difficulty in which some local authorities find themselves in regard to excluding them.  If they are regarded as newspapers in one section of the State service, difficulty may arise in not so regarding them in other sections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister advert to the fact that during the passage of this legislation &ldquo;a newspaper circulating in the area&rdquo; was held to be one read in the area and that a trade journal, as such, could not be held to be a newspaper circulating in the area?  Would the Minister further say if permission got in those circumstances is now void?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a six-marker.

      <P>I am talking about a case which might have succeeded and where permission has been obtained, as it were, by subterfuge, wittingly or unwittingly.  I can see the greatest difficulty in rectifying the situation after the event.  The whole purpose of these notices is to try to prevent these things happening.  I shall see if there is anything we can circulate further to the local planning authorities in order <Col N="1131" /> to clarify the matter.  In regard to Deputy Jones's reference to the debate which took place here on this matter, his recollection is also my recollection of it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he will outline <Col N="1132" /> the procedure for an applicant seeking a tractor driver's licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the Deputy's question relates to &ldquo;tractors used in connection with agriculture&rdquo;, which are separately classified as Class B for the purpose of driver licensing. The procedure follows the same pattern as that applying to other applicants for driving licences.</P>
      <P>In order to learn to drive, an applicant for a driving licence for such tractors has to obtain a provisional licence covering vehicles of Class B from the local licensing authority, that is, the County Council or County Borough Corporation in whose area he ordinarily resides.  He then has to obtain a certificate of competency from my Department which is granted on passing the driving test in that class. When this has been granted he must apply to the local licensing authority, on the prescribed form and submit the certificate of competency.  Where he wishes his driving licence to cover vehicles of Class C or Class D in addition to Class B, he must undergo a test in Class C or Class D and this (if passed) exempts him from a test in Class B.</P>
      <P>A person who, in the past five years, has held a driving licence covering vehicles of Class B is not required to take out a provisional licence or pass the driving test; he can get a further driving licence by way of renewal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I put down this question because of an unusual case which has come to my notice of a man who will not drive anything but a tractor; he walks everywhere else.  According to the regulations when a person has his provisional licence, he is supposed to have a person who holds a licence sitting beside him.  There is a prohibition in law against having such a person sitting beside the driver of a tractor.

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Boland) Kevin Boland">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is assumed that the question relates to the new system of calculating means from land under the Unemployment Assistance Acts which has recently been brought into operation in relation to smallholders in congested areas of the West.  In fixing the geographical limits of the amended scheme&mdash;as prescribed in the Unemployment Assistance (Specified Areas) Order, 1965 (S.I. No. 236 of 1965)&mdash; the Government adopted substantially the same areas as those recognised by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for the pilot area and other similar schemes administered by that Department.  These areas represent the congested districts in the widest sense of that term.  The reason for specifying them as the areas of application of the new system of means assessment was that the small farm problem is concentrated there and that in these areas the difficulties of the small farmer are, generally speaking, more acute than elsewhere and the volume of wage-earning employment available is lowest.</P>
      <P>I should perhaps make it clear that it is still open to smallholders resident outside the specified areas to apply for unemployment assistance in accordance with the general conditions of that scheme.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare what progress, if any, has been made towards securing that persons in receipt of the British retirement pension who are resident in Ireland will receive the benefit of increases on the basic rate granted by the British Government on a scale similar to that which applies to persons resident in Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 34, 35 and 36 together. As Deputies are aware, British retirement pensions are paid to persons living in this country.  As long as such a person lives here, however, the British authorities freeze his pension at the rate payable when he left the United Kingdom or, if he lived here when awarded pension, at the rate first granted.  This British policy of freezing pensions applies to persons living in all countries outside the United Kingdom except where a reciprocal agreement specifically provides otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has been negotiating with the British Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance over the past two years for a new reciprocal agreement on various matters relating to pensions.  One of the issues in these negotiations has been the inclusion of a provision binding both sides not to freeze pensions.  I can readily agree to such a provision as Irish pensions are paid in full to persons in the United Kingdom.  My Department has been pressing for unfreezing which is, in fact, the only important issue outstanding and the decision of the <Col N="1139" /> British Ministry in the matter is still awaited.</P>
    <P>I am most anxious to have this matter settled as, indeed, it would already have been if the decision rested with me alone.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 37 and 38 together.</P>
      <P>I am not empowered to increase any of the rates of non-contributory or contributory old age pension, which cannot be altered except by amending legislation.  In any event, as the Deputies are no doubt aware, increases in pensions in common with other Social Welfare payments, and the provision of the moneys necessary to finance them, are normally matters for consideration in connection with the general Budget proposals.  Accordingly, I am not at present in a position to say what increases, if any, may be granted in the near future.</P>

      <P>This German gentleman flew over here as far as Dublin. He bought an Irish estate against the wishes of the people.  He has never seen it.  He stocked it with mountainy sheep. That was roughly two years ago.  This is my fourth time putting the same question to the same Minister and getting the same reply.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>If the owner flew from Timbuctoo, there are certain laws affecting land in this country that must be observed.  Negotiations are going on for the voluntary purchase of this estate.  These negotiations take time. There is the question of price to be considered.  If they come on a voluntary basis, it is a far easier and cheaper way of getting these lands than by compulsory acquisition.</P>

      <P>1.  The amount of grant paid is the same figure as given to the Deputy on 23rd June, 1965.  This was payable to Potez Aerospace Ltd.  The amount invested by Taiscí Stáit in Aviation Development Ltd. is now £914,900.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Seeing, as is now clear, that a very much larger sum is <Col N="1152" /> now either invested in or given by way of grant by the State to the development on the Naas Road, Potez Aerospace Limited, would the Minister not be prepared to make a more detailed statement to the House in view of the great disquiet in relation to this very large investment of Government funds for which there seems to be a very small return, or hope of return, in employment?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not accurate to say that the State investment is greater than the Potez investment.  The Potez investment is still higher than the State investment.  I am awaiting a report from the IDA when I shall be able to give a fuller picture to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say, not in a spirit of correction of the Minister, that I did not insinuate or suggest that the Potez investment was not large. I said that the total investment now by the State by way of grant or loan was very much larger than it had been seeing that the amount indicated by way of investment by Taiscí Stáit in Potez Aerospace Limited had greatly been increased.  In view of this much larger investment, would the Minister not be prepared to make a fuller statement to the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>Following negotiations between the Industrial Development Authority and E. H.

An Foras Tionscal informed Messrs. Brammer that they were prepared to make a substantial grant.  Messrs. Brammer indicated that the amount <Col N="1154" /> was acceptable to them.  The announcement of 2nd April, 1965, was then published. Subsequently Messrs. Brammer decided not to go ahead with the project. No part of the grant was paid.</P>

      <P>Apart altogether from the question of patents, which does not arise on this question, does the Minister not consider that it is a very serious indictment of his Department and agencies under his Department, the Industrial Development Authority and An Foras Tionscal, that an enterprise of this kind could be ignored and that his various agencies could be so utterly blind as not to realise the tremendous potentialities of an invention of this kind and that it should have to be pointed out to us by Dutch or British people?  Nothing whatsoever was done to assist this inventor to bring his idea to fruition.  This machine has been a reality for some years past. Will the Minister now say what he <Col N="1156" /> will do to have this machine manufactured in this country by reason of the very important employment content involved, apart altogether from its intrinsic worth from the point of view of agriculture?  What is the Minister doing to assist this man to have his machine manufactured in Ireland rather than in Holland?  Are the Dutch going to take it?</P>

      <P>Before the commencement of the discussion on the Housing Bill, may I say, Sir, that I have received from you a note to the effect that a number of amendments could not be moved?  You do recollect that during the discussion on the Committee Stage, due to an error on the part of the Acting Chairman, the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, some of the amendments down in my name and in the names of some other Deputies were not reached and the House agreed that <Col N="1158" /> they could be recommitted.  The only point in having the others listed was that they were amendments which hung together.  If one group fell, then the remainder would also fall.  I am rather surprised that these amendments have now been ruled out of order on the grounds that they were not properly before the House.  I wonder, Sir, if we could find out if that is so, in view of the fact that the House did give permission to recommit these amendments on Report Stage?</P>

I do not like anybody trying to make a fool of my Party when amendments are being discussed.  It does appear as if somebody has the idea that this was an easy way to get over it and that when the matter would come up today, the Chair would be asked to rule them out of order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised that it will be necessary to recommit certain amendments on the ground that they impose a charge on the Exchequer or on local rates, or that they involve some new matter.  I, therefore, propose, with your permission, that the following amendments be recommitted: Amendment No. 8, dealing with grants for custodial staff for elderly persons' accommodation; amendment No. 9 dealing with grants for prototype houses, 12 and 14, dealing with grants for the improvement of local authority houses, 17, 21 and 25 clarifying the power of housing authorities to pay supplementary grants by instalments, and 42&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be in the next group.  I am grouping these together for a reason which I shall give in a moment.  Amendments Nos. 17, 21 and 25 clarifying the power of housing authorities to pay supplementary grants by instalments, and 42, enabling a housing authority to make an allowance to a person displaced from his home by certain of their operations.</P>
      <P>I should say, in relation to that particular group, that these amendments could impose an extra charge on the Exchequer and on local rates.</P>
      <P>The second group then would be amendments Nos. 36, enabling the Minister to apply certain additional conditions for the payment of State grants; 59, 60 and 65, dealing with recovery by housing authorities of houses; 67, 75, 76 and 80 dealing with the making by housing authorities of bye-laws to require minor repairs to houses; 73, 77, 78, 79 and 81, dealing with unfit houses; 90 and 93, requiring the consent of the Minister to the disposal of property by a housing authority in certain circumstances; 94 and 99, dealing with labourers' cottages; 103, providing for an amendment of the Land Act, 1923; and 120, dealing with compensation for compulsory acquisition of property.</P>
      <P>These amendments in the second group involve new matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1160" /> I should tell the House that the necessity to recommit a number of these amendments arises from under-takings which I gave to Deputies during the Committee Stage debate to put down Report Stage amendments to meet points raised by them.  Other amendments are necessary to meet points raised by local authorities, Government Departments and others, since the Committee Stage of the Bill. Deputies will, I think, agree that it would be undesirable to reject the suggestion for the improvement of the Bill simply because the Committee Stage is passed.</P>

    <P>During Committee Stage, I indicated my intention of amending the section dealing with grants for accommodation for elderly persons by providing for special grants for custodial staff.  This amendment makes the necessary provisions and, under it, grants of up to £50 a room, subject to a maximum of £250 for each dwelling, will be provided for accommodation for persons providing welfare or caretaker services for elderly persons.</P>

      <P>This amendment, and the cognate amendments Nos. 21 and 25, are intended to clarify the position whereby housing authorities may pay supplementary grants by instalments where the State grant has been paid by instalments. The instalment of supplementary grant may not, of course, exceed that of the State grant.

      <P>I should like to understand the effect of this amendment more fully.  I have had a great deal of difficulty with local authorities over the years in cases where they refuse to pay their portion of a grant because the State had not paid its portion.  Is this amendment intended to rectify that position?  Does the amendment mean that the local authority does not have to wait any longer for the State to pay?  The Department has been used in the past by the local authorities as an excuse for not paying their share. Does the amendment mean that the local authorities will now have to wait until the Department pays its portion of the grant and, when the Department has done that, the local authority will only have to pay its portion to date or can the local authority pay more?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">

      <P>Not more.  The situation generally is that the local authorities rely on the operations of the Department of Local Government to certify that a certain point has been reached in the construction of a house and the evidence of that point having been reached is the payment of the first instalment of the grant by the Department. When that evidence has been given to the local authority, they can <Col N="1165" /> pay a like amount of their grant, but no more.  When the final payment has been made by the Department that is taken as evidence by the local authority that everything is up to requirement and the authority can then pay its final instalment.</P>

      <P>I think this is an excellent idea and it applies to new and reconstructed houses.  We will all welcome it and, indeed, we have been pressing for it.  However, we hope that it will not be used to slow up further the payment of grants.  Because of the fact that grants are not now coming out as fast as formerly from the Minister's Department, the local authorities are much slower in paying their grants and some people building houses find that they are tied up.</P>

    <P>In page 27, between lines 37 and <Col N="1166" /> 38, to insert the following subsection:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(2) (a)  Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1) of this section, the Minister may under this section refuse to allocate, withhold or reduce a grant in respect of any house, flat or maisonette where the amount of the consideration which is being charged for the house, flat or maisonette, whether by way of purchase money, rent or otherwise, exceeds&mdash;</P>

    <P>This amendment specifically empowers the Minister to withhold or reduce a grant, firstly, when the price of a house is above a level fixed by him by order and, secondly, when a house is not value for money, that is, when the price fixed on a house exceeds the fair value of the house.</P>

      <P>I am sure that the Minister has given a good deal of attention to this matter and that he intends the amendment as an effort to keep a rein on the cost of houses but I hate to see any additional condition brought in which must be met before grants are paid.  I am afraid this provision is something that will leave the grant position in further doubt and will make it more difficult to decide in what conditions a grant will be forthcoming. Because it may be used to have a slowing up effect on the payment of grants, I would be opposed to having it put in the Bill.  There are many other ways in which control can be kept over the cost of houses than by putting in this condition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I would agree with Deputy Clinton that this appears to be an undesirable development.  In fact, what the Minister is now saying is that if a house does not appear to him to be good value for money, he can refuse to pay the grant.  Who suffers in the event of that happening? It is the person building the house and not the contractor.  In such cases the plans for the house will already have been sanctioned and notification issued that a grant will be paid.  When the house is finished, the same plans are again inspected and the same officials will decide that the job is not desirable.  There is a grave danger that people will decide that they have not the same guarantee as they have now when they decide to build a house. Now when a person decides to build a house and the plans are approved, he knows that he will get the grant but this section proposes to remove that guarantee.</P>

      <P>There should be a fairly clear distinction in relation to the more important part of this amendment which is directed rather specifically to the speculative builder who is prepared to erect £12,000 and £15,000 <Col N="1168" /> houses.  While such houses may be good value for money, there have been cases in which they may be value of the order of only half that figure.  It is in regard to such instances that I have directed the insertion of this amendment which means, in effect, that if these people want houses at a price of from £12,000 to £15,000, then let them have them and pay for them.</P>

I would not suggest to the Minister how he could express what he has just said in the form of an amendment but the amendment he has introduced does not achieve what he has set out to do.  It may have the effect of gravely endangering some person who sets out to build a house for himself.  After his plans have been okayed and the job finished, the same Government officials as okayed the plans have the right to say that the house is not an appropriate one. The time to say that the grant will not be paid is before the house has been built.</P>

I do not take the same view in regard to this as I do in regard to exorbitant pricing resulting in exorbitant profits to a commercial concern which is selling the houses to the public.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy and House will appreciate that to try to do anything in this direction is difficult.  To try to legislate in detail for it is, from our experience, practically impossible. For those reasons, we are asking the House to support an amendment which does not attempt to spell out every last detail, because of the impossibility of doing that.  At the same time, we seek power to step in where these sorts of objectionable practices may arise again as they have in the past and to be able to say: &ldquo;If you want to build houses at exorbitant prices and get exorbitant profits, then the public and the tax-payers are not going to contribute to them&rdquo;.  This is the intention and while you may read much more into the amendment, the intention and the spirit is broadly that.  It is the method of operating these provisions rather than what is in them which is really of essence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have mentioned as one danger the possibility of using as a further excuse for delay the fact that the Minister is now investigating <Col N="1170" /> this house to see if it is not too costly and to see that the profits will not be too great. That excuse could be given for withholding the grant for a long period. The danger I see is that the person the Minister is trying to get at may not be hurt but the person who is buying the house may be hurt.  Builders and developers have ways of tying up the customer, especially if the customer is for some reason or other tied to that area.  They will tie him with the deposit or in some other way and if the grant is not given, he is the sufferer and not the man who is building this type of house.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The operation of this in the way the Deputy suggests would be really an exceptional case.  I should like to say that not all but only a few of the speculative builders would have been offenders in the past, or may be in the future.  It will be an exception rather than the general rule and we will not be investigating all grants with a time-wasting formula.  Indeed, I would anticipate that in some cases prospective purchasers would bring to my notice the exorbitant prices they have been asked for houses that allegedly were being built with the aid of State grants.  In such cases there would be the retrospective investigation of whether or not grants should be paid for that particular group of houses.  The inclusion of this section in the Bill does not mean an immediate decision to put it into operation under either of the two aspects, but that it would be advisable to have it there, lest there be a recurrence of the situation which has only recently passed in regard to exorbitant costing of houses with wither wasteful expenditure, or exorbitant profits going to certain operators.  Even if this matter were now in operation, I have no cases in mind to which I could apply it tomorrow.</P>

I remember an attempt being made to withhold grants in order to get a developer to finish his job and provide the people in a certain estate with the amenities to <Col N="1171" /> which they were entitled.  This was done and it was not 100 per cent in compliance with the law but the people who were suffering were those who wanted to get into the houses and had paid their deposits but could not get in because the grants were being with-held. That danger might arise in this case also.</P>

      <P>This amendment will give the housing authorities an easy method of recovering possession of an abandoned house which has been rented from them.  It corresponds to the powers in sections 101 and 105 to recover abandoned purchase-houses. The powers in those sections are, however, more restricted since they deal with the recovery of houses which have been sold rather than rented by the housing authority.  Under the amendment, where the rented house is vacant for a month and the rent is unpaid the housing authority may serve notice on the tenant of their intention to resume possession.  If the rent is unpaid on the expiry of the time mentioned in the notice, then the authority may resume possession without further formality. Notice will be given under section 3 of the Bill which provides for a service where addresses are unknown.  I should add that amendment No. 60 is consequential on No. 59.</P>

We are dealing with the tenant who has failed to pay the rent for a month and the house in question has subsequently been discovered to be vacant when the rent collector or agent called.

It is a constant source of annoyance to thousands of people on the waiting list who petition councillors every time they see such houses vacant, and one cannot explain to people who are in urgent need of a house, to their parents or to their family, that there are legal snags which prevent the corporation repossessing these houses.  This is an advance. Technically, as a lawyer, I resent any efforts which seem to interfere with the rights of tenants, but where there is clear evidence of realistic surrender of the house or of non-interest in the house and the rent is not paid the local authority ought to be able to get it back.</P>

      <P>The only point I want to make is in connection with the notice.  I agree section 3 does seem to cover all contingencies.  Where the house has been abandoned, amongst the modes of service which are allowed is affixing the notice either on the premises or near the premises in some conspicuous place.  However, unless I have misread section 3, it does not seem to allow for service of notice by post to the premises, if the premises do appear to be abandoned, and the Minister might consider whether or not it would be an advantage to have that power in these cases.  I know that if the notice is affixed at or near the premises as provided, evidence of so affixing the notice can be given in court and presumably would be acted upon, but as a practical means of service of the notice, that may prove to be very ineffective.  Take a time, for example, of extremely bad wet weather or something of that sort; a notice may last for only a few minutes before it is gone by reason of the weather.  I would suggest that, as an alternative, the local authority might have power simply to send an ordinary letter addressed to the tenant at the premises in cases where they do not know what his address is.</P>

If the person does not go there to collect his mail or if he has abandoned the premises, that is his own funeral.  However, I am simply raising the point to be looked at.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 65:</P>
      <P>In page 41, line 52, after &ldquo;document&rdquo; to insert the following: &ldquo;and in case there is no tenancy in the premises to which the proceedings relate by reason of the termination of a tenancy by notice to quit and the person to whom such notice was given is the person against whom the proceedings are brought, the following additional provisions shall apply:</P>
      <P> (a)  any demand or requirement contained in such notice that the person deliver up to possession of the said premises to the authority or the Agency, shall be a sufficient demand for the purposes of paragraph (b) of the said subsection (1); and</P>
      <P>(b)  any statement in the said notice of the intention of the authority or the Agency to make application under subsection (1) of this section in respect of the premises shall be sufficient notice for the purposes of subsection (2) of this section.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment will make it clear that a notice terminating tenancy may also contain a demand for possession <Col N="1177" /> for the purposes of paragraph (b) of subsection 1 of the section, and also that the notice shall be regarded as sufficient notice of the intention of the local authority to take court action if possession is not given to them.  The section deals with the recovery of possession of rented dwellings from both tenants and trespassers.  In the case of tenants a notice terminating the tenancy must be served.  This notice may contain a demand for possession of the dwelling.  If, following the service of the notice, possession is not given to the authority, they apply to the district court for the issue of a summons.  At the subsequent proceedings, the court, if satisfied that the application is duly made, must give possession but can order a stay of execution.</P>
    <P>In the case of trespassers, the housing authority must give notice under subsection (3) of the section of their intention to take court action if the trespasser does not hand up possession. Following this, they apply to the district court for a summons and proceedings may then take the same course as in the case of an ordinary tenancy.</P>

      <P>The principal object of these amendments is to restore the existing position for the making of bye-laws by housing authorities dealing with minor repairs to houses let for rent.  It had been the intention originally, as Deputies will see from the explanatory memorandum circulated with the Bill, to allow existing bye-laws to lapse and to rely instead on the repairs notice procedure for securing the execution of urgent repairs.  I have, however, recently received urgent representations from Dublin Corporation that the bye-laws should be retained, <Col N="1178" /> principally on the ground that they represent an easy and well-tried method of securing minor patching repairs to houses for which the repairs notice procedure might prove too cumbersome. On consideration, I have decided to retain the existing bye-laws.  These amendments provide accordingly. Amendment No. 76 provides for the recovery of expenses by the housing authority who do work in default of repairs by the owner.  The same method of recovery will apply as applied in respect of work done under a repairs notice.</P>

      <P>It may be only a token, but I have objected on several occasions to this type of section being put into Bills.  It is undesirable that we should weight our law in the matter of evidence in the manner being done in this amendment now as that the onus of proof, instead of being on the complainant, is by virtue of an Act of Parliament placed squarely on the shoulders of the defendant.  There may be special reasons for it in a Housing Bill of this sort, but, generally speaking, the principle being enshrined in this amendment is not a good one.  It is <Col N="1179" /> one which normally I would feel should be resisted.</P>

      <P>I wish to support Deputy O'Higgins on this.  I have had the experience&mdash;I am not sure whether he has or not&mdash;of appearing before one venerable member of the district court bench on a number of occasions pleading on behalf of defendants in proceedings where the onus of proof of innocence lay on the defendant.  The district justice in all these cases said it was not himself I should blame for the verdict but persons who, like myself, were legislators.  It is undesirable &mdash;and, I think unnecessary&mdash;to be infringing the principle upon which our law is founded, that is, that every person is innocent until proved guilty.</P>
      <P>This is the thin end of the wedge. The wedge is already there.  I know it has been inserted in the rights of the individual already.  But to give it another tap on this occasion, and on every occasion upon which the State is seeking extra power, is to do damage to the rights of the individual.  Frankly, I do not think it is necessary to have it. The Minister should tread warily.  The additional powers given in this measure to deal with the improper reoccupation of condemned property are sufficient without bringing in this unnecessary obligation on a defendant to prove his innocence.</P>

      <P>There emerges here a grave question of principle.  It is presumed a person is actually breaking the law and the responsibility rests on himself to prove he is not.  It would seem to be a very retrograde step to accept this amendment and enshrine this principle in any legislation.  It is contrary, surely, to all the accepted canons of jurisprudence.  The obligation to prove breach of the law must rest upon authority.  Here we are seeking to put the obligation to prove innocence upon the individual.  It is a serious incursion on individual rights. I would ask the Minister to reconsider it.</P>

      <P>On other occasions when this principle was enshrined <Col N="1180" /> in legislation&mdash;principally I have in mind road traffic legislation&mdash;a case was made that a certain amount of time was wasted by the State and Garda in giving technical proofs and that we were only leaving loopholes for people who should be punished to get out.  That kind of argument does not really apply here.  As I said, I appreciate there is often a certain amount of urgency in dealing with housing matters.  Very often exceptional powers may be justified.  But I do not think that is the case here.  After all, under section 68, we are providing very severe penalties for breaches.  The defendant, if he is found to be in breach of the law, may be fined as much as £50 or imprisoned for a month.  Where you have a high fine, where you have imprisonment or where you have at the option of the court a fine or imprisonment, in those circumstances it is not right that we should relieve the local authority of what up to now has been their duty to present their case and their proofs properly in court.  That does not seem to be adequate justification for a breach of the principle on this occasion.  With Deputy Dunne and Deputy Ryan, I urge the Minister to reconsider the matter.</P>

This would arise only in the case where a housing authority suspected that, after notice had been given, the house was being re-occupied or inhabited by people when it should not be inhabited. When they make that accusation, they are the strong party in this dispute. Surely the benefit of the doubt should go to the weaker party?  I think it is quite unfair and I feel that here we might have a person who would be perfectly innocent being put to the expense of going to the court and proving his innocence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we are inclined to widen this to cover lots of people who will never come under it at all. We are dealing here with the case where a house, in respect of which a repairs notice, demolition order or clearing order applies, is, in fact, occupied.  Do not forget that this occupation may be with the knowledge and consent of the landlord and to his own benefit by way of rent, and very often a very high rent.  All we are asking here is that if it is found that such a house is, in fact, occupied, the owner will be required not merely to say: &ldquo;I did not know anything about it&rdquo; but to clear himself in court of the allegation.  What we are asking is that, in court, he will not only be left to say that he did not know about these people but will be able to show that, by his securing of the door or the window of the property, it was not open to anybody to walk in &mdash;in other words, if the house was occupied, the persons had to break in&mdash;or that he will be able to show that, as soon as he was made aware that his <Col N="1182" /> property was being occupied in contravention of one or other of these orders, he made some effort to try to get these people out.  This is what we are seeking in relation to that limited class of re-occupied houses in respect of which a repairs notice, a demolition order or a clearing order has been made and which have in fact already been vacated on foot of such notice.  It is that limited category that is affected. It is not a question of bringing a person to court and saying to him: &ldquo;Stand up and defend yourself against the charges by the county council or by anybody else&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is oversimplifying it.  It is a question of principle.  Under subsection (2) of section 68 the offence, which we are laying down now will be an offence, is that of using the premises or permitting the premises to be used.  Up to now, the ordinary rule of evidence has been that if an allegation is made against a person that that particular offence is being committed&mdash;the offence either of using the premises or of permitting the premises to be used &mdash;it was necessary for the person bringing the complaint to show that the offence had been committed, to prove that the premises had been used or to prove, in the alternative, that the premises had been permitted to be used.  That was the position under the Bill as introduced by the Minister.</P>
      <P>The Minister is now saying, by means of this amendment No. 73 that if that offence is alleged&mdash;the offence of permitting the premises to be used &mdash;the court must accept it as being so, unless the defendant can show that it is not so.  In other words, the question of the local authority tendering evidence to show that the offence has been committed is completely dispensed with.  All they have to do now, if this amendment is accepted, is to make the allegation and, the allegation having been made by the local authority, the court must convict unless the defendant can come into court and establish his innocence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us see what we are doing.  We are setting up a situation where the local authority have simply to make an allegation and that allegation must <Col N="1183" /> be accepted by the court unless the defendant comes in and establishes his innocence.  The allegation, which must be accepted by the court, carries very heavy penalties: it carries a penalty of up to £50, a month in prison, or both, and that penalty can be imposed by the court, if this amendment is accepted, merely on an allegation, unproved, by the local authority.  I think that is going too far.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>This argument is on the basis of a principle in relation to which I know there are quite strong feelings which I do not share, as Deputies may remember from other occasions.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Even so.  In relation to the principle about which some Deputies feel quite strongly, I would say that they are inclined to exaggerate the actual situation we are trying to deal with here.  It is not just a question of allegation by a local authority against the owner of the house: it is a question of a factual situation that is brought before the courts.  Take, for example, a house which already has been detenanted and cleared by way of a legal instrument&mdash;one or other of these orders.  If it is a fact that this legal instrument and intention has been circumvented, this is what is brought before the courts and the owner of the house is, as a result, before the courts to show, for instance, in the case of a clearing order or demolition order, that he has, in fact, conformed to the terms of that order which obliges him to take steps to secure the house against re-occupation.  This is an imposition already on him, which clearly and in fact will have been broken.  It is that which is brought before the court and he will be brought only as a party to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am saying, further, that he is not being brought forward on a mere allegation. He is being brought forward on a factual situation which is in contravention of a legal instrument that compelled him as owner, not only to have <Col N="1184" /> the house cleared, but to take steps to see that it would not be re-occupied. What we are saying is that it will not be enough to say: &ldquo;I did not know anything about it&rdquo;.  He will be asked merely to show on the one hand that he had conformed to the order which required him to secure the place against re-occupation or, alternatively, having found that it was re-occupied, that he had taken steps to try to have it detenanted again.  This is the distinction that exists between what I am trying to get done and the principle as enunciated and argued by Deputy O'Leary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>In subsection (2) of section 68, there are really two distinct offences involved.  There is the offence of using the house and there is the offence of permitting the house to be used.  All of the Minister's arguments the last time he was on his feet seemed to me to be directed to the offence of using the house and, in that event, evidence still has to be given to the court to prove that a detenanted house has been used.  The Minister's amendment does not weaken or strengthen the position as regards the offence of using the house.  The Minister's amendment is, in fact, not relevant to that particular offence at all.  It is relevant to the offence of permitting the house to be used and the Minister has not really addressed himself to the argument made on that at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any of us can think of a situation which might arise.  Possibly it is far-fetched, but a situation might arise where the order has been fully complied with by the tenant.  He has locked up the house, secured it as best he can and another member of the family or, if you like, a stranger goes in and squats in the house and uses it. In that set of circumstances, if the Minister's amendment is accepted, the local authority will simply have to come to court and say that the house has been used and thereupon, without any evidence and, in fact, even without an allegation, the court must hold, under the Minister's amendment, that the tenant knowingly permitted it to be done and that presumption must remain unless the tenant can come in <Col N="1185" /> and establish his evidence.  It is, whether the Minister recognises it or not, a complete reversal of our standards of justice and standards of evidence in connection with matters of proof.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is going further in his amendment than he needs to go if what he seeks to do is confined to the particular cases he has in mind.  As Deputy O'Higgins points out, there are two offences described in section 68.  One is the offence of user and the other is the offence of permitting user.  The Minister, in fact, has referred to another offence, to another action or inaction which could be separately classified, that is, the failure to secure a property against re-entry.</P>
      <P>There is a very big difference in the moral turpitude involved between failing to secure property against re-entry and actually granting permission to a person to use the property.  If I can illustrate it by the reference to another type of offence, I will refer to the Road Traffic Act.  There there is a well-known offence of using a mechanically-propelled vehicle without the permission of the owner.  If the Minister's argument here is valid, it would be a valid defence for any person charged with using a mechanically-propelled vehicle without the permission of the owner to show to the court that the owner had not secured the car against re-entry and had not secured the car against being driven by another person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the line of argument the Minister is using here now.  I would be loth to see the Minister even going so far as to presume in law that a person is guilty of an offence of failing to secure a property against re-entry but if he confined it even to that it would be a reasonable compromise. But, here the presumption is that a person has deliberately, knowingly, thwarted the law, has deliberately been in contempt of an order of the court, of deliberately and knowingly giving another person permission to go into the property.  That is an entirely different thing from failing to put a lock on the door or failing to put concrete <Col N="1186" /> blocks on the window or otherwise securing the property.  The Minister is using a sledge hammer where a nut-cracker would do.</P>

The Deputy is deliberately using the arguments I have just made to suggest that a readymade defence is provided for a person who commits the offence as user, merely by following up and reversing what I have said about a person who permits the use of a house.  I did not use any argument that could be used in any such way.  I do not think the Deputy was really serious when he suggested that it was fair to draw a parallel between the person who uses a house and the person who takes away a car and makes the plea that it was not locked.</P>

      <P>The Deputy has not put it forward as anything other than that, to try to make it appear that my argument as to why the onus of proof should be put on the landlord can be reversed in the same way.  It cannot be done in the case of a car any more than in the case of a house.  The Deputy suggests that that can be done to the advantage of the person who has permitted occupation of the house, namely, the tenant, that the tenant can get away with it merely because we are asking him to carry the onus of proof.</P>

      <P>Here, a person who occupies is committing an offence.  A person who permits the occupation is committing an offence.  Each of them is committing an offence.  All I am saying is that these offences in regard to this section are in relation to the relatively small number of houses which are for the time being subject to a repairs notice, a demolition order or a clearing order and the owner surely can be expected to show in his own defence that he did not willingly permit the use of his house when it should not have been occupied.  He can quite clearly show this by indicating that he took the ordinary steps to secure the house against reoccupation, which in respect of demolition and clearing orders he was already obliged to do by this instrument of Order or legal document that would have been served on him originally and, further, that even if he fails to show he took reasonable steps to secure the house against occupation or re-entry he can show that so soon as he becomes aware of its being occupied he made some effort, went to the house and said: &ldquo;Get out.  This is my house.  It cannot be re-occupied.  It is a case of a clearance order,&rdquo; as an alternative to showing that he had properly secured it.  Either would be a good defence.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister will recall in connection with his term as Minister for Local Government when he was dealing with such matters as the Road Traffic Act it was pointed out time and time again that what the Minister says in this House or what any Deputy says in this House. does not matter as far as the court is concerned.  What matters as far as the court is concerned is what is written into legislation.  I am asking <Col N="1188" /> this now, not in a carping way, Can the Minister point to any portion of section 68 which says it is a good defence to show the man has made the effort?  I do not think there is anything there.  The Minister is completely wrong in that.  It may be what he wants but it is not what is in the Bill, and what is in the Bill when it becomes an Act is what the courts must go by.</P>
      <P>The only other point is: am I right in taking it that, if this amendment is accepted, it will cover also proceedings under subsection (3) of section 68?  I was regarding it as referring only to subsection (1) and (2) where the penalties are £50 or a month in jail.  If, in fact, it extends also to subsection (3) the position is obviously far more serious.</P>

      <P>I do not want to be offensive about how clear one must be sometimes.  I will use the Deputy's own argument to combat his second one. If we assume that what the Deputy said is so, then nothing we say here need be taken into account by the learned judges in their interpretation of the law.  If that is so, then the seriousness of the fine of £500 or the six months in jail will not be taken into account either, even where a conviction has taken place on foot of the judge's interpretation because that is merely something we write in here and it does not really matter; the judge will weigh up the evidence and apply the penalty he thinks fit to suit the crime.</P>

      <P>We cannot have it both ways.  If they ignore us in one direction, then there is no increased danger in applying this to subsection (3) of section 68.  Subsections (1) and (2) introduce fines of £5 and, if we include subsection (3), the fine will be £500.  That would be a real difficulty, were we to take it that the courts would give cognisance to this £500 merely because we have written it in here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I have not made myself clear.  The fact is we have written in £500 and six months but we have not written into the Bill that it would be a good defence if the defendant were able to say to the court that he told the fellow to get out or put on a lock and someone took it off.  We do not say <Col N="1190" /> in the section these are good defences but we do say that he can be fined up to £500 or six months in jail.  In having regard to the £500 or the six months, the court will be having regard to what is in the Bill.  That is the distinction.</P>

      <P>This is a rather naive way of expressing some of the findings. There is a word used in this particular amendment; it is the word &ldquo;permits&rdquo;. I believe&mdash;I am not as conversant with the matter as some Deputies are, perhaps, and those Deputies who frequent the courts may be able to tell us&mdash; that the word &ldquo;permits&rdquo; carries a certain interpretation in the courts. The two legal Deputies who have spoken may be able to throw some light on this; it has a bearing, I think.  The word &ldquo;permits&rdquo; has a certain connotation and interpretation in our laws at the moment.</P>

However, if it can be established that a dog which kills sheep belongs to me, then damages may be visited on my head, and rightly so.  If a breach of the law in respect of a house I own takes place, then I would expect to come under some penalty.</P>

      <P>If I am the owner, I must have responsibility.  I have been directed by order to close and secure the house against re-entry.  The local authority find the house has not only been re-entered but is occupied.  They may have good reason to believe that it is a rent proposition as far as the owner is concerned.  Surely it is reasonable to provide that that owner must go further than merely saying: &ldquo;I did not know.&rdquo;  He must show that he conformed to the closure terms that he should secure it reasonably against re-entry. Alternatively, if he can show that, or if he can say that, as soon as he knew it was re-occupied, he took certain steps to try to have it cleared <Col N="1192" /> again, he is pleading innocence.  Either of these answers to me would obviously establish clearly that he did not permit.  It is on this question of permitting that we will be standing rather than on anything else.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has, perhaps unwittingly, given his mind away.  We would all go along with him in the case of a house the user of which requires that a penalty should be imposed and that the owner, if he allows the user, should be one of the people visited with that penalty or penalties.  If the Minister had left it at that, we would all agree with him. What we are concerned about is that it is not now necessary to show that the owner had permitted the user.  The Minister has not answered the query put to him by Deputy Clinton and has not stated why it is necessary to bring in an amendment of this sort.  His parable about the dog does not appear to me to be relevant.</P>
      <P>The Minister may say that he does not wish to waste the time of the officials of local authorities in going to court and trying to prove that a person had knowingly permitted the use of a house in a particular way.  Even if he had said that it was going to become impossible to prove positively that the user had been permitted by the owner, there would be something for us to get our teeth into but all he has said is that he wants the House to accept an amendment which will make it quite unnecessary for the local authority to prove the allegation they are making. All the local authority have to do under this amendment is to make the allegation and that allegation must be accepted by the court.</P>

      <P>The whole purpose of the amendment is to ensure that houses which have been declared unfit for habitation shall not be occupied until they have been repaired, or whatever. What we are suggesting here is that the owner of the house should prove that he did not permit the use of the house. We are not making any allegations against him but we are saying that he must show that he did not permit the use of the house.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister consider the case of a person who is away from his house and, in his absence, a relative occupies the house while he is away, perhaps without his knowledge. Owing to the condition of the house, that person who is occupying it in the absence of the owner is being moved by the local authority into a new house. What is the position of the actual owner of the house if he comes back and has nowhere else to go?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>This would not arise in the case of an unoccupied house. If the house is occupied by a relative who pays no rent to the owner and the owner puts nothing into it and does not repair or do anything like that, then due to the neglect of the owner the house may so deteriorate that it must be demolished.  Arising out of that and arising from this demolition, the then occupier, not the owner, qualifies and gets a local authority house. The question put to me is what happens to the owner who may return from somewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">

      <P>He comes back to his house and finds it demolished or about to be demolished.  There is nothing he can do about it and pleading that he has nowhere else to go is not just good enough.  He had that house for long enough.  He may plead that he did not know what was going on but he was receiving no rent for the house and was putting nothing into it.  Because of this neglect of his, the house is now falling down and the law requires that it be demolished.  In that case the house is not a place that he should go into.  It is not fit for him.</P>

This person now returning from hospital has no place to go.  He is served with a demolition order and he tells the local authority that he wants an alternative house. There is no house available for him. What is he going to do?  Contravene the law by going into the house or sleep out?  There is nothing else for him to do.</P>

      <P>What Deputy Jones is saying now is quite different from what he said a moment ago.  I agreed with the Minister in his reply to the first case put up by Deputy Jones.  In the second instance, what happens if a person goes to hospital and his house is occupied by a relative and that relative is now going to be rehoused because the house is unfit? The house could not be demolished because the original owner could not be rehoused.  That would be a different case from that of a person living in another house and the person now to be rehoused is the only occupant.  In that case the Minister is right.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I suggest the possibility of a compromise on this?  I think the amendment as it stands is dangerous and the principle in it is entirely wrong.  Would it be possible to insert in the amendment some provision that if the owner had been served by the local authority with a notice calling his attention to the fact that a demolition order appeared to have been made, in proceedings taken subsequent to the service of that notice, it could be presumed that the user had been permitted. Would the Minister interpose some step which would ensure that the attention of the tenant would be directed to the fact that an order had been made and that there was unauthorised user?  I have in mind the case of a person who is absolutely innocent and had no knowledge whatever of the fact that unauthorised user had taken place.  Under the amendment as it stands, that person is presumed guilty of the allegation made by the local authority.  The Minister <Col N="1195" /> should make some provision whereby the local authority would serve a notice on the tenant calling his attention to the unauthorised user and saying that in subsequent proceedings guilty knowledge would be presumed.</P>

Obviously if he wished to do anything about it by way of trying to get them out, presuming he did not know anything about it, he could take those steps between then and the actual date on which he was to appear in court.  On the other hand, if there was to be any sort of compromise that would give me what I want and meet the objection that is being raised, we might say something to the effect that either of the two things I have mentioned could be raised as a good defence.</P>

The principal effect of the other three amendments is to give the owner on whom notice of intention to rent a house is served the right of appeal to the Circuit Court.  In amendment No. 77 we are giving the right to the local housing authority to recover the expenses of repairing a house by letting, as distinct from the present situation. The following three amendments give the owner, when he gets the notice telling him that they are going to let the house for a rent, the right to appeal to the Circuit Court, if he feels aggrieved.</P>

      <P>The principal purpose of these amendments is to insert a requirement that the consent of the Minister be obtained to a disposal of land for houses where the members of a local authority disagree with the proposed disposal terms submitted by the manager.  If the requirement to obtain consent were not included, the local authority could dispose of land or houses on any terms they wished, without control, and simply by passing a resolution.  In the ordinary case where the members agree, specific sanction of the Minister will not be required so long as the minimum terms of saver laid down are observed.  These would probably provide that the sale price would be the best, with reducations in the case of houses to correspond to the grants and subsequent compensation.</P>

      <P>The Minister is aware that in my own county we had a difference of opinion between the elected members and the manager on the terms and the Minister had subsequently to reduce the amount being sought by the manager for sites which were made available.  Is it the intention that the Minister should be bothered by all those things again? At that time the manager made the case that the Minister's officials required that the same rate be obtained for the site as had originally been paid for it.</P>

      <P>If there is anything in this that curtails the freedom to do what we have advocated, and in some cases have carried out, in the past, that is, providing these sites at a reduced figure, then I certainly would be disturbed. My information is to the contrary, that no such change is made in these amendments and that we are dealing mainly with the problem which arises where a manager and his elected council disagree with the proposal he may have put before them.  In that case the Minister's consent may then <Col N="1201" /> be sought and minimum terms might be laid down and a general indication given of what these might be.  On the other hand, specific cases, if they should arise under this, may not be dealt with necessarily in a general way.  If there was a good reason why the minimum price generally applicable in cases arising from the amended sections was right for a particular set of circumstances, obviously we would have to look into that and make a charge so as to allow the council to do what we felt was right rather than what was wrong.  As a Minister, I am not obliged to lay down a particular line of action in this regard.  All that is being done is that the Minister is given the power to consent or to withhold his consent to the disposal of land or property or houses belonging to the local authority, a dispute having arisen on the proposal between the Manager and the elected representatives.</P>

      <P>What I am concerned about is this.  Section 87 (1) says:</P>
      <P>Any land acquired for the purposes of or appropriated for the purposes of or under this Act by a housing authority may be sold, leased or exchanged subject to such conditions as the authority may consider necessary having regard to the purposes of this Act.</P>
      <P>Now the Minister proposes to insert &ldquo;with the consent of the Minister&rdquo; If a local authority decided to make available at a nominal rent or a nominal charge a site for building and the manager says: &ldquo;You cannot do that and I shall appeal to the Minister&rdquo;, the Minister then says: &ldquo;We must protect the rates; we cannot allow this to happen and the charge shall be so much.&rdquo;  That is what I am afraid of.  I was satisfied with the section as it was.  I would not like anything put there which would make it more difficult for housing authorities to improve the housing situation.</P>

If it was a question of the manager disagreeing with the elected representatives I would be glad to see some way of settling it, but if it is the other way around, that the Minister wants the right to decide, if the manager refuses to agree to what the elected representatives suggest, there is a danger of fouling the thing up.</P>

      <P>The Deputy can discount that.  The situation could well arise after any election, after all the care and nurturing that local authorities have given their property over the years, that a few people could be elected who by their influence or their weight in council could adopt a line of action to dispose of property of great value to the council, dispose of it to many people or a few people or even one person, at very poor value to the ratepayers and to the council.

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:&mdash;</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann is of opinion that the Government should facilitate the provision of Tenant Purchase Schemes for Corporation tenants in Dublin, Cork and other municipalities, by providing the same subsidy facilities as are available to rural local authorities. &mdash;(Deputy Clinton.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's intervention yesterday evening to all intents and purposes finished discussion on this motion because he said it was not acceptable to him.  The Minister would be less than just to himself in adopting that line without waiting to hear the full reply.  He described the motion as a pious incantation which could do no good.  One of the bases of the motion is the equality of all individuals before the law.  If a house purchase scheme is devised to make houses available throughout the State to local authority tenants and enable them to own their own homes&mdash;something which the Minister agrees, I think, is desirable&mdash;it can hardly be argued that different canons of justice should apply as between residents of urban and rural areas.  It is presumed that all people are equal before the law in that everybody should have the same facilities.  It is hardly fair to say at that stage that it is a question of necessity and that necessity knows no law; but that is the basis on which the Minister is arguing this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister quoted another phrase, which sounded rather trite at the time, that his function was to provide houses and not dispose of them.  The Minister is being less than fair to himself and the office he occupies in this matter. His function is to provide homes, not <Col N="1207" /> shelters.  This evening and for some time past we have been discussing housing legislation.  We should assume that the people who will occupy these houses will have a right to make homes of them.  The right of a home certainly ensures that family traditions continue.</P>
    <P>The Minister made a distinction between rural and urban areas in this matter.  He said one of the reasons why you can envisage a purchase scheme in rural areas on terms you cannot have in urban areas is that in rural areas the houses were isolated and, if vacant, would not always be readily occupied again.  That is a bit of a fallacy.  It may be all right for the purposes of argument here.  Readily, throughout the country in any local authority area any house that becomes available anywhere is eagerly sought after.  In regard to the argument of a family continuing to occupy the same home, to say you can apply this to rural areas and not to urban areas does not invalidate the argument one way or the other.  The Minister would be nearer the mark if he said it was purely a question of cost, that there would be a certain loss in regard to the short-term payment of subsidy. This is the real kernel of the situation and not the argument the Minister was trying to rely on to dispose of this motion.</P>
    <P>Surely urban houses have as much an attraction for the people who occupy them and surely their families would be anxious to remain on in them? Deputy Ryan quoted figures which showed that when a purchase scheme was applied to houses here in Dublin, out of 500 houses concerned, 300 immediately became subject to purchase. The Minister says purchase schemes are available.  We know they are, but the distinction is, so far as urban authorities are concernred, that the subsidy is not continueds once a purchase scheme is made.</P>
    <P>Local authorities are apparently becoming less and less inclined to get rid of property at present.  Perhaps the Minister is in this frame of mind, too?  They seem to think it would be much better to hold on to property rather than dispose of it.  I suppose <Col N="1208" /> in some cases there may be exceptions where the disposal of property might not be in the best public interest.  But, by and large, many houses have been purchased in rural areas.  Where the houses provided by the local authority in the first instance were not large enough to serve the needs of the families occupying them, they could not be enlarged by the local authorities themselves.  However, once a purchase scheme became applicable to them and they were vested in these people, they were able to enlarge them themselves and qualify for the grants applying to that type of enlargement so necessary for a growing family.  That is being denied to residents of urban areas at present in their being deprived of the right to a purchase scheme where the subsidy will be the same level as in rural areas.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that these houses become available at a price which nobody can pass over.  I presume that, in the ordinary way, the same canons would apply to homes in rural areas as in urban areas.  I presume that the immediate family of the occupant would have first claim upon it and that they would be no less eager to continue with that right of ownership. I cannot see why they would not want to continue to exercise the ownership which, in their time, was exercised by their parents and maybe even grandparents, rather than have the position that speculators might get possession of such houses.  I should imagine that, in all instances, the rights of the local authority are protected by reason of the fact that, for the duration of the purchase scheme, they would be the controlling interest. There has been a tendency over the years, particularly in respect of housing estates, to extend the number of years purchase in regard to these particular houses and therefore I cannot see how the interest of the local authority would in any way be interfered with.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that houses would not be available for those who need them.  That statement presumes that the houses would pass into the ownership of people who did not need them. If a person is selling a house which he <Col N="1209" /> holds within the terms of a purchase scheme, then such person may not sell it without the permission of the local authority who have an over-riding determination as to whether or not the proposed purchaser is a suitable applicant. Therefore, the Minister's argument falls in that case.</P>
    <P>The Minister speaks of the liquidation of our stock of houses.  He is making an academic argument.  Has he any figures on which to base his assumptions in this respect?  The word &ldquo;liquidation&rdquo; brings back to our mind the Second World War and the meaning of a wiping-out of a particular area.  When the Minister speaks of &ldquo;liquidation&rdquo; here, one might be inclined to think that the housing estate, as such, would vanish if a purchase scheme were applied to it, but I do not think that would happen.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that, under the new Housing Bill, when enacted, regulations will be made in regard to the future vesting of houses.  It will be subject to regulations which may be changed.  There would be power to make purchase schemes, having regard to the attractiveness of a particular scheme.  I would point out that that power has been there all the time in regard to purchase schemes.</P>
    <P>In his opening statement last night, the Minister said that purchase scheme facilities which exist at present are not being availed of.  As Deputy Ryan and Deputy M. E. Dockrell pointed out, one of the reasons why they have not been availed of is that the attractiveness of the purchase price is militated against by the fact that subsidy will not continue to be paid in regard to the scheme.  Deputy Ryan mentioned that it could vary by as much as £1 in relation to any particular dwelling. That is a factor which would or would not make a proposition attractive particularly in purchase schemes in relation to artisans' dwellings and other houses under the Housing of the Working Classes Acts where people, in the main, have large families and generally a limited income.  Such people could not afford to indulge in any cash speculation in regard to the purchase of their home.  They are confined <Col N="1210" /> to a weekly wages, which, in the main, does not vary too much.  The attractiveness of a scheme to such people would lie in the fact that it was within their financial resources to avail of it, and, in this case, non-subsidy is a factor which would not make it attractive.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that the motion is not concerned with the Housing Bill which is going through this House at present.  The general purpose of the Housing Bill is the provision of houses. Everybody's aim, in the various housing measures that have come before this House from time to time, has been the provision of houses for the people. The endeavour has been to provide homes in which units of the nation can set up families who will become attached to their homes and remain there.  Certainly, I do not think anybody had the idea that people would not be rooted to the homes in which they were born and lived and would not desire to remain in them.</P>
    <P>One of the binding forces in Irish life has been a good community spirit. People have taken a pride in ownership and in their locality.  In various commendable movements such as the Tidy Towns Competition, and so on, we have appealed to people to take a greater interest and pride in their homes and locality.  In the Town Planning Act, we had the same idea of making places attractive and keeping them attractive.  Certainly, the qualities of home ownership would be one of the dominant factors in this matter and would outweigh anything else.  In the long run, the State and the local authority will not lose anything on this.  Earlier on, they will have to find more capital to provide homes which is one of the outstanding needs of our economy at present in large centres of population.</P>
    <P>The binding argument on which this motion is based is that people ought to be equal before the law and ought to have the same facilities.  Most of the amenities available in the urban areas are now available in our rural areas &mdash;water, sanitation, lighting along the footpaths, roads, open spaces, and so on.  Therefore, no extra amenity is <Col N="1211" /> available in urban areas as against rural areas.  For that reason, I think the Minister should concede this of right.</P>
    <P>I could not follow very well the Minister's argument as to why he had prejudged the issue except in so far as I think it is mainly concerned with costs.  I do not think the Minister wants to be held to his phrase that he is the provider of houses and not the disposer of them.  In this House, we make facilities available for the provision of houses.  It should be our aim to make homes available to the people wherein they may live contented and useful lives, which their families after them will continue to maintain under the same conditions and be induced to improve them and keep them in a good state of repair and that they would always form the basis on which we might depend for a continuing population in these areas.  Ownership gives people a link with a place and a sense of responsibility.  It is for that reason that we felt the motion should be put down and hoped that it would have been accepted in that spirit by the Minister.</P>

      <P>It is very difficult to understand the attitude of Deputy Jones when he takes the Minister to task for coming in at such an early stage of the debate on this motion to indicate his attitude towards it.  It has always been the practice in relation to Private Members' motions for a Minister to intervene at a very early stage to indicate his views.  The Fine Gael Party would like to have it both ways.  Last night the Minister was forced to his feet by the lack of enthusiasm on the part of the Fine Gael Party, a number of whom were in the House at the time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems that Deputies opposite were very anxious to get him up.  The least one would expect is that the Minister would indicate his attitude to the motion. <Col N="1212" /> Deputy Tully was on the same lines last evening, even though he was not in the House at the time the Minister intervened, nor was any other member of the Labour Party present.  The Minister would have preferred to have heard a few more Fine Gael Deputies giving their arguments.  If he did not have an opportunity to do so, it was no fault of his.  The debate would have collapsed if the Minister had not offered at that time.</P>
      <P>The Minister was accused last night by Deputy Ryan of prohibiting people from taking part in tenant purchase schemes.  I do not think there is any foundation for that accusation.  As Deputy Ryan himself pointed out, there is legislative provision already in existence whereby local authorities can prepare a scheme within their own areas covering all their estates or any part of them and allowing their tenants to purchase.</P>
      <P>If I remember correctly, in 1953, the Minister for Local Government issued a circular to each local authority indicating the ways and means by which they could compile schemes for tenant purchase.  That was followed by a circular from a Minister of the inter-Party Government in 1955 or 1956 asking them what they had been doing about it.  There was no indication in the second circular that the terms would be any more favourable than they were in the first case.  So it was a Fianna Fáil Minister who originally gave the local authorities a means by which they could arrive at a scheme and the inter-Party Government Minister condoned that and did not indicate that he would be any more generous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No matter what may be said, the Minister for Local Government is not in any way prohibiting people from buying their own houses.  It is the local authorities.  A number of local authorities have schemes and a number of people have availed of the schemes. There are a number of local authorities who have decided not to have schemes.  I do not know if there is anything one can do about it except get rid of the members of the local authorities and have new members elected.  If Deputies on all sides of the <Col N="1213" /> House were more vocal in their own local authority areas as to the importance of having schemes prepared, the tenants might get the opportunity of purchasing their homes.</P>
    <P>There are some 69 urban local authorities who have schemes covering 21,854 houses.  Dundalk, for instance, has a scheme of 1,136 houses, and 700 houses have been sold to the tenants.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">

      <P>Is the subsidy continued in these cases?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaugeBrennan" hpid="Mr. P. Brennan Mr. P. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The terms are the same in any part of the country.  In Monaghan, there is a scheme of 176 houses, and 85 have been purchased; in Sligo, a scheme of 95 houses, and 86 have been purchased; in Ballina, 90 houses included in a scheme, and 77 have been purchased by the tenants. So that, where a local authority have made the effort to provide a scheme, I do not think the figures would indicate that the tenants are prepared to buy.</P>
      <P>The arguments made during this debate would seem to indicate that the Minister was doing something to prevent people from having the opportunity to buy their own houses.  That is not so.  Each local authority has the power to draw up a scheme and to make it possible for tenants to purchase houses.  What the motion seeks is that the subsidy should continue so that the houses would be given to the tenants so much cheaper.  The Minister said last night that the scheme would be such that it would be impossible for a tenant to refuse to buy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The point could be made that in some local authority areas where we maintain that the price of a house on a purchase scheme is still low, nevertheless, the rents are so low that it is not a proposition for the tenant to buy.  That is one of the reasons why the purchase schemes are not being availed of in many parts of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An argument was put forward here <Col N="1214" /> yesterday evening that it was unreasononable to expect people who were paying the economic rent over a number of years to pay more money for the house.  I think it was Deputy Clinton who made the point.  There are very few people paying the economic rate in many housing estates.  Even where there are, they have been subsidised for every day they have been in it to some extent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The number would be very small in comparison with the number who are not on the economic rent.</P>
      <P>Deputy Jones talked about the figure given here by Deputy Ryan last night for vacancies in the Dublin Corporation estate in recent years.  There was some argument between Deputy Ryan and the Minister as to the figure. Deputy Ryan gave a figure of 250. Our information is that in the ten year period 1955-56 to 1964-65, the average was 981 vacancies.  This, no doubt, was a great help to the corporation in finding accommodation for other people.</P>
      <P>We, and I personally, are in favour of as many people as possible owning their own houses.  The terms laid down in the circular sent to each local authority in 1953 are very attractive and tenants can still buy houses from local authorities at a very reasonable figure.  It is almost certain that, if they do buy the houses, within a week they can put them on the market and double their money without the least trouble.  The same applies as far as county council cottages are concerned.</P>

      <P>The county. Arklow decided not to have a tenant purchase scheme and there is not a Fianna Fáil majority in Arklow by any means.  I understand Bray are trying to decide on a scheme.  It is under consideration at the moment.  Some local authorities want these schemes; others do not.  If those who tabled this motion would direct their attention to their own areas and try to get their various local authorities to bring in these schemes, they would have no difficulty.  The authority is there.</P>
      <P>There was talk of people paying very high rents under the differential renting system who would have to pay a very high price for their houses. There is a scheme in Dublin whereby a tenant can get a very high grant for the purpose of rehousing himself.  He can also get 99 per cent loan facilities, irrespective of his income, for an SDA house.  If a tenant wants to buy a house, he can certainly do so.  The facilities available provide every encouragement.</P>
      <P>Deputy Tully said last night that it was very hard to persuade a tenant that a house built for £80 to £100 40 or 50 years ago is now worth £400. That is true, too, of course, even in the case of houses built in the past 20 years.  Houses that cost £1,200 to £1,300 are being sold now for £3,500. We all know house property has appreciated in value.  I have no doubt the tenant knows it, too, and all he is waiting for is his local authority to devise a scheme which will enable him to purchase the house, even at £400.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Jones said the only reason the Minister would have for refusing <Col N="1216" /> to accept this motion would be the cost.  If the Fine Gael arguments are right, the Minister is at the moment subsidising tenancies and, therefore, it could not be a question of cost at all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaugeBrennan" hpid="Mr. P. Brennan Mr. P. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The attitude of the Minister is that houses are being made available to tenants in areas in which the scheme is in operation at a low figure.  He is not against continuing subsidising houses, but he does not think the time is opportune as far as this motion is concerned because there is already legal provision there.  If the occasion warrants it, the Minister can, by regulation, continue to subsidise a tenant purchase scheme.  In the areas in which the schemes are in operation, they have been quite successful and nothing the Minister has done in his term of office would suggest that he is against the principle of people owning their own houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The onus is on the local authorities and, if they do not bring in these schemes, there is nothing the Minister can do.  There is no reason why every local authority should not have its own tenant purchase scheme.  It would be quite wrong for Fine Gael to suggest that, because the Minister is not prepared to accept this motion, he is against the principle of people owning their own homes.  Deputies have already been unfair in suggesting, as Deputy Tully did last night, that the Minister rushed in here and in the shortest possible time indicated his views with regard to accepting or not accepting the motion.  I have been in the House now for about 11 years and the practice is that, when the proposer and seconder have spoken, the Minister gets in and indicates his attitude.  I cannot understand why it should be implied that he should have waited until 6.30 or 7 p.m. this evening.  Actually the Minister intervened at the stage at which he did because there was no one else offering. There were some Fine Gael Deputies present who have since spoken.  There was no one on the Labour Benches. The Minister's intervention gave those <Col N="1217" /> who followed him much greater scope. I am sure they would have been most disappointed if he had said he would accept the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not intend to intervene until I heard the Parliamentary Secretary state that corporation tenants who wished to purchase their houses can obtain a loan of 99 per cent of the valuation.  Surely that is evading the issue.  Resolutions on the lines of this motion have been adopted on more than one occasion, and with the support of the Parliamentary Secretary's Party, by Dublin Corporation.  In respect of these tenant purchase schemes, the Minister should indicate that he is prepared to continue the subsidies from State funds at present being paid.</P>
      <P>That approach is supported by members of his own Party, not purely on a local basis but as Deputies.  In view of that, it is surprising to hear the Parliamentary Secretary take that particular line.  Of course we are aware of the fact that a corporation tenant who is living in a three, four or five-roomed dwelling will get a loan of up to 99 per cent if he is prepared to surrender that dwelling, but does the Parliamentary Secretary think that corporation tenants are all mad?  If they are satisfied with the size of the dwelling in which they are living and with the facilities of that dwelling as suiting their family commitments, why should they leave it, even though the Parliamentary Secretary says they can get a loan to buy a house?  I do not know of any houses built under the Small Dwellings Act that have less than five rooms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite true that the corporation can adopt a scheme with regard to a particular area but if the corporation do adopt a scheme in respect of a certain area where the dwellings are subsidised, the Department say that they will stop those subsidies.  If there is no question of the subsidisation of these houses, the total cost will fall back on the ratepayers.  The Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister can weep salt tears for the ratepayers when the occasion arises, but, when the question arises of a local authority <Col N="1218" /> deciding to introduce a scheme for tenant purchase of existing dwellings, will the Department of Local Government continue to pay the subsidy? When that question arises, the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary lose all the sympathy they have previously been expressing to the ratepayers.</P>
    <P>There is also the problem as to what extent a scheme of purchase would require sanction by the Minister for Local Government.  In that regard would such a scheme be subject to sanction and would all its conditions be subject to sanction?  This is important, having regard to the fact that in 1932, 1933 and 1934, Dublin Corporation built dwellings at a cost of from £300 to £400.  In 1950, the cost of these dwellings had gone up to about £1,100.  In 1960, the cost was £2,000 and now it is about £2,500.  If a tenant purchase scheme were now presented to the Department by the local authority, would the Minister be prepared to sanction such a scheme for £300 and £400, based on the original cost of the dwellings or would the Minister insist that any such scheme would have to be related to the present market value?  I am not clear as to the extent to which the Minister's sanction is necessary and, if it is necessary, to what extent he would be prepared to consider the suggestion.</P>
    <P>In the Dublin area, there are a relatively small number of cottages that were originally built on the same basis as agricultural cottages and which were taken over under the greater Dublin Act of 1930.  Many of these cottages have not got the amenities of modern dwellings but what would be the Minister's view in regard to a purchase scheme for them?  It is a peculiar fact that if you cross the city boundary into County Dublin, these cottages can be and have been vested for a very moderate payment, but because the same type of cottage, built under the same conditions and about the same time was brought into greater Dublin under the Act of 1930, the opportunity does not lie with the tenants to have them vested.  This is a problem.</P>
    <P>There is also the problem that there <Col N="1219" /> could be a certain amount of trading in these dwellings if purchase schemes were brought in.  The extent to which such trading would take place is a moot point.  There were tenant purchase dwellings built in Dublin in 1954 and some of them were sold within a year or two.  There were others built in 1952 and within two or three years the people who went into them, for one reason or another, sold their interest in them.  That was also the situation with houses built in Dublin in the 'thirties.  I accept what the Parliamentary Secretary says that if a tenant purchase scheme is brought in, whether for new or for existing dwellings, there will be a certain amount of sale of those dwellings. Why should there not be?</P>
    <P>If a person buys a house under the SDA facilities, there are certain controlling provisions under which he may not sell that house for two or three years.  Yet where the owner of such a house can show the local authority that he has a legitimate reason for leaving, whether because of change of employment or for reasons of family health, the local authority are usually prepared to agree to a change of ownership.  Where the real problem arises is in connection with the situation that could arise if, in the case of some of these areas, a tenant purchase scheme was introduced and, as a result, a number of dwellings were withdrawn from the housing pool.</P>
    <P>This is where we come back to the basic problem.  If the Minister, the Parliamentary Secretary and the Department were doing their job, the problem should not occasion any great difficulty because at least by the time schemes were drawn up, negotiated and agreed&mdash;that would not be done overnight&mdash;there should be a reduction and some easement in the need for houses.  I use the word &ldquo;should&rdquo;, but having regard to the fact that advances for house construction schemes are being held up in the Department, I can well understand the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary taking the attitude which they take in regard to <Col N="1220" /> the question of purchase schemes for corporation dwellings.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the possible effects of the withdrawal of a number of dwellings from the housing pool.  This could be of importance in a situation where last year in Dublin, and for a number of years, vacancies were around 400 dwellings. If the construction programme were progressing as planned and anticipated and not being hindered by the Department, the Minister and the Government, the problem would not be so acute.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>The corporation put through a scheme in 1959.  A resolution was adopted at the Housing Committee, and which was supported by members of this House, and one of the conditions they sought was, in the interests of people who might be interested in buying dwellings, that in cases where subsidies should apply, the Government should be asked to continue them.  It is immaterial to me who was Minister or who was in Government at the time.  The fact is they have raised the matter on more than one occasion and on each occasion the answer was that the Government were not prepared to continue any form of subsidy in any case where a tenant purchase scheme was introduced.  That was the situation and as far as I am aware, that is still the attitude of the Minister and the Government.</P>
      <P>The problem then is whether, in those circumstances, the subsidy at present paid by the Government in respect of these dwellings should be thrown on to the tenant purchaser&mdash;in which case it may have the effect of making the purchase price unrealistic for him&mdash;or alternatively asking the ratepayer to bear a greater proportion of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dealing with one <Col N="1221" /> thing at a time.  The Parliamentary Secretary is entitled to ask these questions but he is only asking them to avoid answering questions put to him as to why the Government are not prepared to continue the subsidy.  Whether there are dwellings that do not carry a subsidy is another aspect but that aspect may well be taken into account by the City Manager, having regard to the possible effects of the withdrawal of dwellings from the housing pool.  My remarks on that still stand, that it could be a serious problem.  If a number of dwellings were withdrawn from the housing pool, and if a percentage of those were sold to people who did not qualify for houses, it could well be a serious matter at a particular time for those on a corporation waiting list. That situation is serious and could be very serious in the context of the Government's failure to do their job in regard to the housing programme.  If they concentrated on not holding up tenders submitted for their approval, the other aspect could be dealt with, possibly without too much difficulty.</P>
      <P>All Parties, and in fact local authority circles, are agreed that it is a good thing to establish the rights of tenants to purchase their own dwellings. That is on record from the Labour Party and on record from the Fianna Fáil Party, and I am sure Deputy Dowling will bear me out.  I think he was present when resolutions were adopted to this effect and I have no doubt he supported them.  Two questions arise, one being the equity of the Government making their contribution because it is more than likely if a scheme was produced, that the position would be that the prospective tenant purchaser would not qualify for a grant for a new dwelling because it would not be a new dwelling.  It is more than likely that he would not qualify for a remission of rates because it would not be a new dwelling.  Having regard to that, surely there would be an obligation on the Government, where a subsidy applies, to continue to pay the subsidy.</P>

      <P>That may be so.  The position I raised was in respect of certain circumstances where the subsidy exists.  I should like to hear the Parliamentary Secretary justifying the withdrawal of that subsidy.  There are Dublin Corporation houses on which the subsidy was not paid but on which grants were paid.  It was a capital payment.  That matter has been disposed of long ago.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Parliamentary Secretary will answer my question, I shall think about his question.  He is flying on two wings.  There is the question of subsidised houses and houses on which subsidies are not paid.  There are certain dwellings in fairly high demand.  Even though houses in certain areas were constructed at a fairly moderate cost many years ago, if there were a vacancy tomorrow, there would be queues running into hundreds seeking that house.  Consequently the <Col N="1223" /> approach would be different in that case.  I should like to hear the Parliamentary Secretary justify, if he can, the attitude of the Government in saying they will not continue the subsidy.</P>
      <P>On the question of withdrawal from the pool, the facts are there for anyone to read, the fact that sanctions for construction are being held up.  The pool should normally be getting smaller reasonably rapidly and the demand should be easing to such an extent that it would be possible, without doing too much damage to the people on the housing waiting list, to think in the terms in which the Parliamentary Secretary is talking, but the Department of Local Government and the Minister are continuing to impede the housing programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. T. O'Donnell Mr. T. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion has everything to recommend it, and I am surprised at the attitude of the Minister last night and of the Parliamentary Secretary now.  There are no grounds for differentiating as between the urban and rural areas.  I see no reason why the same facilities could not be provided for the tenants within urban areas as are available within rural areas.  I am very conscious of this fact myself because the constituency I represent has both urban and rural dwellers.</P>
      <P>The argument of the Minister that it was his function to provide houses and that there his responsibility ended is ridiculous.  Every encouragement should be given and every assistance possible should be made available to people to purchase their own houses.  Most people aspire to ownership and this motion is a timely one. The problem of the withdrawal of houses from the pool was raised by Deputy Larkin.  I would agree with Deputy Larkin that if the withdrawal of the houses from the pool was such as to interfere with the solving of the housing problem, as he says, it is a reflection on the housing policy of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true to say, as the Minister states, that tenant purchase schemes are in operation.  We have one such <Col N="1224" /> scheme being implemented in Limerick but my experience of that scheme has been that the response to the invitation to apply for purchase was poor.  It was poor by reason of the fact that the purchase conditions were not sufficiently attractive to induce the majority of tenants in the area to opt for purchase.  As I said at the outset, most tenants aspire to ownership and it is the duty of the Government to facilitate the fulfilment of that aspiration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Seeing that I have been named, I wish to say a few words on this motion.  First of all, I agree in principle with tenant purchase.  The Minister agrees with tenant purchase. I believe in the right of ownership. It is a social satisfaction that should be fulfilled, and the local authorities who have the power should present schemes to the tenants.  I mentioned some evenings ago at a council meeting that if a scheme was not being drawn up, I would ask the manager to draw it up.</P>
      <P>Much of what Deputy Larkin stated is correct.  That there is agreement among all Parties on the purchase scheme is a reasonable assessment of the situation.  We have the power in our hands to draw up these purchase schemes and we have been doing it for a considerable time.  There are periods of high and low demand which alter the policy and outlook of the corporation to tenant purchase schemes.  It has been said the corporation are doing nothing to assist people to purchase their own homes&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Many schemes were subsidised to the extent of approximately £1,000.  We make free sites available and will make them available in the future, whereby the tenant as well as getting the site, gets £275 supplementary grant, plus £275 Government grant, worth approximately £1,000 to each tenant.  Further sites will be provided when they become available.  At last Friday's meeting, we made several hundred such sites available for corporation tenants who <Col N="1225" /> are desirous of building their own homes.  Every single house counts. The chairman of the Housing Committee knows the efforts made by the corporation to get back even one house. It is a good investment to give a supplementary grant of £275 to get back a house worth £2,000.</P>
      <P>While the scheme proposed by the corporation had much merit, I was disillusioned with the way sites were allocated.  Individuals and groups brought pressure to bear on the members of the corporation and packed the gallery to ensure that political blackmail was applied to force members to vote one way or the other.  This was done in the corporation in recent months.  In regard to the older schemes, the more select schemes, the same type of pressure may be applied to public representatives&mdash;this political blackmail which has been a feature of local authority politics in the past 12 or 18 months so far as some members of Dublin Corporation are concerned. Therefore, we have to think twice before formulating purchase schemes and allowing ourselves to be bulldozed into a situation whereby valuable sites in selected areas are given away to selected tenants.  Until such time as we have a more mature outlook and less pressurising of public representatives, we should call a halt and have a second look at the situation.</P>
      <P>As I said, I am in favour of tenant purchase.  The important question is the subsidy factor.  When the corporation decide to formulate a purchase scheme, they will look for the best terms they can get for their existing tenants.  They will try to induce the Minister to give some addition to what is already there or give them parity with others, although there is not parity in relation to many of the factors concerning purchase schemes in rural and urban areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of the housing pool is an important one.  We make every effort to ensure that houses are channelled into the pool.  There is still high priority in the waiting list.  We are housing five in one.  There was no problem about a purchase scheme when we were housing three in one <Col N="1226" /> and there will not be again in the future.  Every single house is needed.</P>
    <P>The location of the site is important. The older houses are more valuable to the tenant than houses on the perimeter in such places as Finglas, Ballyfermot and Coolock, where you almost have to pay a person to live so far out.  The house built for £300 or £400 is the one on a centre city site.  The price paid, the market value, will be low in comparison with the price paid for a recently built house in a perimeter area.  The tenant who has the good fortune to be in the select site will get his house at a much more reasonable rate and deny the tenant in the perimeter area the chance of a suitable location.  This is very necessary for people like dockers whose employment takes them to centre city areas at inconvenient hours.</P>
    <P>The more I hear, the more I feel that this matter will have to be examined more thoroughly in the future than it has been in the past, in view of the fact that we have had this type of pressure being exerted.  At least, it happened in Dublin Corporation; I am not sure about other authorities.  If the same type of pressure is exerted elsewhere, it is about time someone took a positive step to ensure that further sites are not made available until they are allocated in a reasonable and responsible way, so that every person in a position either to build or purchase his own house will have an equal opportunity and that no section of the community will get special consideration because of the pressure exerted on officials and public representatives.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dowling is to be complimented on the effort he has made to ride two horses at the same time.  He is in favour of a purchase scheme.  We have the peculiar situation now that the Minister is in favour of a purchase scheme; the members of the Labour Party are in favour of a purchase scheme; and we on this side of the House have brought in a motion asking for a purchase scheme. Yet the Minister intervened early on in this debate to oppose a purchase scheme&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;even though he admits it is quite a desirable thing and that a purchase scheme could at some unspecified date in the future be brought in by ministerial order without any additional legislation.  At least, we have discovered that no new legislation is required and that the Minister is free to bring in a scheme by ministerial order to continue the subsidy.  That is quite clearly to be read into what the Minister said.</P>
      <P>The Minister has opposed this motion without giving even one good reason for doing so, and I believe the Parliamentary Secretary has also failed to give one good reason.  There is no question of its requiring more money.  It costs the Government the same amount of money to continue the subsidy if there is not a purchase scheme and they continue as at present. Therefore, money does not arise. The only thing that really does arise is the embarrassment that would be caused to the Government by a reduction of the number of houses available in the pool in any one year.  This only arises at the present time because of the failure of the Government to provide sufficient houses over the past eight years.  When the Government came into office, there was a pool of houses available every year of approximately 1,500.  That pool has now practically disappeared.  We are told there are now only about 500 houses.  Of course, those 500 are filled as soon as it is possible to fill them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have the situation here where all the people representing the corporation areas feel that this is a desirable thing.  In fact, we have had a deputation, on which members of the Government Party were represented, to the Minister asking for such a scheme.  We have every side of the House favouring it.  But, because of this embarrassment, because of the shortage of houses, the Minister says; &ldquo;You cannot have it.&rdquo;  That is the only reason.  It may be opposed also because it is brought in by Fine Gael. It is not the first time that this has been suggested or recommended.  But why the Minister continues to feel that <Col N="1228" /> this is going to be a harmful measure, I cannot understand.</P>
    <P>I do not agree at all with the contention that if we adopt this scheme, the pool of houses will be reduced drastically.  Quite a large number of our houses in County Dublin are in the urban areas of the county.  We have more than 75 per cent of them vested already and the amount of sale of these vested houses is quite insignificant.  The proof is there.  We have the record.</P>

      <P>The resale of vested houses.  Even when these houses come to hand for sale, I think that the council have complete control over their purchase.  If there were any doubt left in relation to this matter, I think it is completely taken care of in the recent Bill that passed through the Dáil, that is, the Labourers Bill, 1965.  Deputy Tully referred to this last evening. There is no question or doubt that the local authority has complete control over the type of person to whom these houses pass and, in fact, over the conditions that may be imposed before they can be disposed of.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I quote from the Minister's Second Reading speech in the Dáil on the Labourers Bill, 1965:</P>
      <P>In brief, section 2 of the Bill provides power for a county council to waive the restrictions on mortgaging, charging, subdivision or alienation of a labourer's cottage and plot during the period for the repayment of the annuity.  Section 3 enables an annuity to be redeemed, if the council entitled to it think fit, by payment to them of an amount approved by the Minister.  I should perhaps emphasise at this point that the amount which will be approved under the section will be related to the market value&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;and not to the original cost&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;of the relevant interest in the property, rather than to the present value of the annuity calculated on a strictly mathematical basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that all the power that is needed <Col N="1229" /> is contained in the Labourers Act to ensure that no undesirable traffic will take place as a result of a decision to bring in a purchase scheme and make available to people in the corporation areas the facilities available to the tenants of working class houses throughout the rest of Ireland.</P>
    <P>No case has been made by the Minister, by the Parliamentary Secretary or by anybody who has spoken, as to why this discrimination should exist.  We have the extraordinary circumstance here in Dublin where, due to extension of the boundary, we have people inside the city boundary who got these facilities from the county before they came in.  They are now within the city area and are able to purchase their houses.  They have very much reduced outgoings per week and at the same time, they are building up a capital asset.  I think there is nothing more desirable than that people in that class should be made responsible by enabling them to build up this capital asset.  It is a form of saving and, in my view, a very desirable form of saving. Why it is still opposed by the Minister beats me completely.  He spoke of the backlog of demand.  That is the kernel of his opposition.  It is quite obvious that he is afraid of further embarrassment, embarrassment that has been caused by the failure of the Government to come in and supply the houses in the numbers in which they they should be supplied.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with control.  I cannot see, really, what is left in this.  The Minister's contribution to this debate was extremely short.  It was obvious that he had no real grounds on which to turn down this motion and it was obvious that if it is possible to embarrass the Minister, he was embarrassed because he had to admit that the only ground for not accepting it was the fact that there was that vague sort of danger that the pool of houses becoming available would be lessened and the discretion of the county council in the selection of tenants would be interfered with.</P>
    <P>It is possible that, in the sale of these houses, they would not pass to the person most deserving on the council's waiting list, but, in any of <Col N="1230" /> the cases where I have seen these houses being sold, the sale was not agreed to by the local authority until the local authority were quite satisfied that the purchaser was in fact the person who would, in the normal way, be a housing obligation of the local authority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaugeBrennan" hpid="Mr. P. Brennan Mr. P. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the law, I agree; but, in view of the fact that that is the law, I think it is harder still to understand the attitude.  The Parliamentary Secretary has made the point that if people want to become the owners of their own property, there is a 99 per cent loan available to them. He has not considered this aspect.  It is true that, on paper, there is a 99 per cent loan available to them but, in fact, it is nothing like 99 per cent.  It is 99 per cent of the valuer's value of the house for sale and in many cases it bears no relationship to the selling price of the house.  In fact, the difference between the selling price of the house and the valuer's value, on which this 99 per cent is based, might be £500.  I ask the Parliamentary Secretary where ordinary working class persons are expected to get this £500. They just have not got it.</P>
      <P>I will put another point.  Suppose they were enabled, through the acceptance of this motion, to go into the market and sell their house, then that house, we are assured, passes to somebody who, in any case, is a housing obligation of the council.  If they wanted to improve their position, if they wanted to buy a house in a better-class area or to move up the scale, they would be enabled to do so through the sale of the local authority house.  The house would then become available for somebody in the working class and, at the same time, through the fact that they were more fortunate and were enabled to do it, the other people would move up the ladder and would be enabled to buy an SDA house.  I believe that, in this way, more houses would become available because the inducement would be there and could be availed of by people to buy an SDA house if they wished to do so.</P>

    <P>In page 63, between lines 7 and 8, to insert the following subsection: &ldquo;( ) Where a cottage purchased under the Act of 1936 comes within an urban area, whether before or after the commencement of this section, all the provisions of the Act of 1936 shall continue to apply in relation to the cottage and the functions in relation to the cottage which could formerly be performed by the authority by whom the relevant vesting order under section 17 of the Act of 1936 was made shall thenceforth be performed by the housing authority for the urban area and in case the cottage came within an urban area before the commencement of this section, the said provisions shall be deemed to have continued to so apply and the said functions shall be deemed to have been so performable as and from the date on which the cottage came within the urban area.&rdquo;&mdash;(Minister for Local Government).</P>

      <P>When we adjourned, I was trying to get clarification of a point in relation to this amendment. Supposing an extension of a boundary occurs from the corporation outwards into a county area and cottages are thereby brought in to the new boundary, cottages that have not been vested, are the corporation then obliged to provide a vesting scheme in respect of these cottages and is the Minister obliged to continue the subsidy?  I know it is fairly clear from the wording of the amendment that where houses vested under the 1936 Act come in, all the obligations will be continued in relation to those houses. Where, however, they come in without being vested, are the corporation obliged to provide a vesting scheme and is the Minister obliged to continue the subsidy?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as some people are concerned, they have a belief that they have, in fact, rights they never had in the area prior to its being taken over.  For instance, in relation to the non-payment of annuity, the corporation under whose jurisdiction they have newly come have not the same rights and may not exercise the same restraints as the county council would have.  That is one of the features we are trying to rectify here.  With regard to those who are not vested, they would <Col N="1235" /> still do their purchase from the council out of whose jurisdiction they have departed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not more or less indicated in the amendment that &ldquo;all the provisions of the Act of 1936 shall continue to apply in relation to the cottage&rdquo;?  If all the provisions continue to apply, then one of the provisions is this tenant purchase scheme. It says here that the new authority takes over all the responsibilities that existed under the 1936 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The tenant has a year after coming in to do the purchase from the county council from whose jurisdiction he has departed and thereafter, the council would have the right of transfer to the corporation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>But is it a fact that this must take place before the transfer takes place?  I know that before we handed over cottages in County Dublin, we had to put them into proper repair and have them vested before they were even accepted by the corporation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder would the Minister clarify another point for us? I am referring to people who are brought in by reason of an extension of boundaries to an urban area.  A person, a member of the family, is acquiring an interest in a cottage.  The Minister is well aware of the fact that the process is a slow one.  Administration can be slow.  Will it be confined to a period of 12 months or will people have a right to exercise it at any stage, people who had intended to apply for a purchase scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a section which lays down that after a date following the passing of the Bill into law, unless the cottage is vested within a specified period, and, irrespective of whether or not it is the fault of the local authority or of the tenant, that is not done, surely new conditions would apply to the vesting and surely they would apply to the cases Deputy Jones and Deputy Clinton have instanced. There is no point in saying everything will be OK, once the application is made because this other section will, I think, govern the whole thing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">

      <P>The obligation in that section is really an obligation on the local authority to provide the facilities whereby the purchase may be made. Provided a tenant with his present rights wants to exercise those rights, it provides that his rights will not be taken from him.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Minister clarified that point because it was not clear when we were dealing with the Committee Stage.  If the Minister says that, I accept it.  The argument on Committee Stage was that a local authority, by failing to provide the necessary money to carry out repairs, could prevent the tenant from purchasing the house.  The Minister will remember that but if he says that is not so now, I am glad to hear it.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 99:</P>
      <P>In page 64, line 22, after &ldquo;reserved&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;,whether before or after the commencement of this section,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to make it clear that the purchase annuity for the purchase of a cottage will be based on the current rent except where a revision takes place on account of current rates or because of differential or graded rents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>What is meant by current rents?  Is this normally based not on the current rent but on the economic rent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Not necessarily on the economic rent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be based in future on the current rent except in cases where the rate has increased or where an increase has taken place under the differential rent scheme.  If the change took place when the man was out of employment, it would be favourable to him but if it took place when he got a short period of employment at high wages, it would be unfavourable to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>If a purchase scheme were made 20 years ago, as some were, it could be that at that time the rent was 5/-, or even 2/6 per week.  Following on that, the purchase annuity, regardless of today's rent, would be half of the rent at the time of the purchase scheme.  What we are saying is that the rent will be based not on what the rent was at the time of the making of the purchase scheme but rather on what it was at the time of the application to purchase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The cost of producing the house has not increased in the meantime but I can see an instance in which the State has additionally subsidised the house in the meantime.  Is it on that that the justification will be based for increasing the purchase rent, the fact that the State has additionally subsidised the house since that time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I am being rather unfair to the amendment itself <Col N="1238" /> in not saying that in addition to the changes I have mentioned, it can work in reverse to the advantage of the purchaser. That can happen in a case where the rent might be less rather than more at the time of the beginning of the purchase scheme.  You could have your graded or differential rents related to incomes and a change of tenant from the time of the making of a purchase scheme could bring about a situation in which the earlier tenant was paying a rent of £1 or 30/- per week related to his circumstances and the change of circumstances relating to that change of tenant might bring about a situation in which the graded or differential rents would be at this time less than the original rent paid by the first tenant.  In this event he would benefit in the same proportion as the other chap would have lost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be on the existing rather than on the old rent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, with a certain number of exceptions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Purchase schemes are normally based on the economic rent. If we have a new scheme of houses and a purchase scheme is prepared, it is prepared on the basis of the economic rent.  In this instance, we are looking at houses built some years ago.  Say that at that time the economic rent was £2 a week and the purchase rent was 25/-.  A purchase rent fixed today for one of the houses in that scheme that did not accept a privilege should be based on the economic rent, plus what the State put in since by way of additional subsidy.  That is the truly equitable approach to this problem but this amendment is one that could prove to be inequitable in certain cases.  Under it you could have a case in one scheme of houses where a family that was well-off could purchase the house at a smaller figure than a family that was not well-off.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>

    <Col N="1239" />
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think this is the section that deals with that matter. What I should probably try to make clear is that Deputy Clinton made the point that the cost of producing a house will not have changed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that it did not change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Naturally, it would not have changed.  The cost of producing an equivalent, however, has changed a great deal.  If a purchase scheme has been in operation for all these years under these advantageous terms, why did they not avail of them?  Was it because it was cheaper or better value to be in at the low rent?  Surely the reasons could not have been financial reasons unless the gain was in the direction of maintenance costs?  There is also this to be said in clarification, and I may have misled the House somewhat in this connection, that the changes in rents would only affect the annuity when it occurs outside&mdash;I am afraid I said this incorrectly to the House before&mdash;of a differential or a graded rent scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not understand how they could.  At present they buy it under one of two arrangements. If it is pre-1948, they buy it at 50 per cent and if it is post-1948, they buy it at 75 per cent.  Under the new arrangement, the position seems to be that if they do not purchase it within 18 months of the appointed day, they can be stuck for whatever is an economic rent at the time, which is a different thing altogether.  I do not know whether there is any significance in this or not, and perhaps the Minister could help me, but a number of cottages have been built recently and no attempt is being made by the managers to have a vesting order made for them.  We notice that they do not appear on the Order Paper at all.  I have not seen them for quite some time.  In my own constituency houses have been built in <Col N="1240" /> the past 12 years and they have not been listed.  Does this mean that there is a little game being played to ensure that tenants will be put in the position that they cannot buy the houses at 75 per cent but will have to wait until the new Act comes into operation and will be stuck for the high rent?  Is that the situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as failure to make these purchase schemes is concerned, it was clearly a dereliction of duty on the part of the local authority. The legal position is that purchase schemes are obligatory in law within a year of the completion and hand over of the cottage, in respect of all such cottages up to 1st January, 1966.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is aware that no purchase scheme has appeared on the Order Paper, having been laid before the House, for a considerable time.  I am sure the significance of this must have struck the Minister.  Obviously, county managers are arranging to make a few shillings on the side for the county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am innocent of the implication.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has helped to make my case.  He said that if a tenant has failed over a number of years to take advantage of a purchase scheme which is in existence, the reason must be that it was cheaper to be a tenant and not a purchase tenant.  That may be, but the case I have been making is that it represents an additional subsidy which I agree should be taken into the calculation, but surely the equitable way to deal with this would be to add the additional subsidy to the original cost and then calculate the economic rent at present rather than leave it to a manager to decide: &ldquo;We must `up' the rent of these houses&rdquo;. We had a case where the manager decided to rocket the rents and a purchase scheme is to be based on the present rent which is now described as the present economic rent.  This could be quite unfair to the people living in those houses.  The houses were built at a particular figure and had many <Col N="1241" /> shortcomings because the Minister was extremely anxious to keep the price down&mdash;as he always is&mdash;and the standards were low.  Only kitchenettes were provided and these people feel that they have to add kitchens.  The rent decided on by the manager is, in my view, too high.  The new purchase arrangements will be based on that and not on the economic rent.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 103:</P>
      <P>In page 66, between lines 55 and 56, to add the following section: Section 46 of the Land Act, 1923, shall be construed as if the references to the original holding included references to a cottage in respect of which an annuity has been fully paid, or has been redeemed under section 3 of the Labourers Act, 1965, or section 98 of this Act.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Section 46 of the Land Act, 1923, deals with the provision under which the Land Commission may exchange holdings for the purpose of facilitating improvement or enlargement of uneconomic holdings throughout the country.  It is held that council cottages do not come within the terms of section 46 and the purpose of the amendment is to bring the cottages within the provisions of the section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>

      <P>Would the Minister say whether this clarifies the position which was raised on the Bill originally, as to whether or not under the Land Acts a tenant of a labourer's cottage can obtain an addition to the plot for consolidation purposes?  You have this question of consolidation occurring if the purchase scheme has been completed.  We raised this point before.  The question could arise as to whether the Land Commission would agree to sub-division again or detachment of the plot on which the cottage stands.  Does this set it right?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>What we are dealing with is not consolidation but exchanges which would arise in the case of migrants under the Land Acts.  We are advised that at the moment section 46 does not enable a vested or purchased cottage to be exchanged for the purpose of the tenant moving to a holding, as often happens, from another type of abode.  We are rectifying that in the Bill because it is the one most readily to hand.</P>

This concession is considered equitable since only an owner involved in the compulsory purchase proceedings was being asked to make any allowance towards such increase in value.  In addition, in cases where a diminution in value arises, due to the actions of the housing authority, the arbitrator was not obliged to have regard to it. It was one-way traffic, so we have knocked that out.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 11, between lines 13 and 14, to insert a new subsection as follows: &ldquo;(3)  Nothing in the foregoing provisions of this section shall require disclosure to a housing authority by a solicitor of any privileged communication made to him in that capacity.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I referred to this matter on Committee Stage and the Minister said he would consider it between that Stage and Report Stage.  The purpose of my amendment was not only to have the Bill amended but also to invite the Minister's comments on the amendment. I understand that since I raised the matter, the Incorporated Law Society has been in correspondence with the Minister's Department in the matter.  If it is permissible, I should like to quote from the letter which the Minister received from the Incorporated Law Society.  In the course of the letter of 27th October, 1965, the Society said:</P>
      <P>The council of this Society are somewhat concerned about the provisions of section 4 of the Housing Bill, 1965.  This section would apparently enable a housing authority to require a solicitor to furnish confidential information regarding a client's affairs without that client's consent.  This is contrary to the accepted law and the recognised right of clients to professional secrecy on the part of their solicitors. The council wish to submit that the section should be amended to protect that right.  If necessary, they are prepared to attend on the Minister to supply further information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Society received a reply from the Department to which, no doubt, the Minister will make reference.  The reply of the Department refers to the fact that there were similar provisions in the Housing Act, 1931, in the Local Government Act, 1960, and in the <Col N="1245" /> Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963.  Apparently the principle we are asked to accept is that because bad law is already on record, we should not change it.  If that is to be the guiding principle in determining what we should do, there would be no point in amending legislation. The whole purpose of amending legislation is to reform what we consider to be wrong and to make it better.</P>
    <P>This principle was also at stake in the Companies Act, 1963.  In the Companies Act, 1963, which is as close to us and closer than some of the other legislation which has been quoted by the Minister, it is provided that wherever people are required to furnish information, nothing in the provisions requiring the information should require disclosure by a solicitor of any privileged communication made to him in that capacity.  It is desirable that people could understand that this right, this privilege, exists not for the protection of the solicitor &mdash; it is a matter of total indifference to him personally whether the information is released to a Minister or anybody else &mdash;but for the protection of the individual, who should feel entirely free and protected in consulting his legal advisers.  A person should be entitled to take legal advice without the fear that information disclosed by him may, because of that, be released to other people.  If that principle is infringed, we put in jeopardy the liberty of the individual and that confidential, privileged relationship, which people are entitled to expect and have the right to demand, between themselves and their legal advisers.</P>
    <P>I do not, for one moment, compare the situation in all respects with that which exists between a penitent and his confessor under which the confessor may never break the seal of confession, notwithstanding the fact that the confessor may have information which could clearly establish responsibility for a crime.  It is the mere existence of that privilege and confidential relationship which justifies the institutions which we have and in which lay people can get advice from specialists. Once you breach that privilege and <Col N="1246" /> breach that right, then you put in great danger these privileges which exist for the protection of the liberty of the individual.  I can anticipate that the Minister will say that the right to withhold information cannot be any greater simply because information is given to a solicitor.  That is a legitimate point of view but it is not a question of changing the right or the degree of privilege.  It is simply a question of recognising the right of an individual to consult his legal advisers and not to put any person into jeopardy, into danger, simply because he has done the prudent thing and taken legal advice.</P>
    <P>I would earnestly ask the Minister once again to reconsider the matter and to be influenced, not by these earlier Acts, but by what can be found in the Companies Act, 1963, which in respect of seeking information is on all fours with what is sought in this Bill, but does maintain the integrity of the legal profession and the relationship which ought to exist between any citizen and his or her legal advisers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">

      <P>Section 4 which this amendment seeks to change would enable a housing authority to require a person to state the particulars of the estate, interest, etc., by virtue of which he occupies land or receives rent and also to give the name and address of everyone who, to his knowledge, has an estate or interest in the land.  Surely this is a far more restricted requirement than Deputy Ryan has indicated?  If I interpret what he has said correctly, it would appear that he suggests that we were trying to establish the right of a local authority to make a solicitor divulge any or all of the things that may be told to him as a result of being consulted by a land or property owner for legal advice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This relates to a person who occupies or receives rent.  If the legal profession wish to act as rent collectors, as many of them do, I do not see why they should look for special consideration above and beyond that which is meted out to rent collectors, estate agents and auctioneers, who are doing the same sort of service.  They are required under section 4&mdash;and would be, even <Col N="1247" /> with the acceptance of this amendment &mdash;to give this information.  I cannot see why, because the man should be a solicitor acting as an estate agent or as a rent collector, he should be exempted merely because he is a solicitor and treated, as the Deputy has said, as if he were in the role of confessor and had to keep his mouth shut about everything said to him.  It would be a queer situation to accept this amendment. By so doing, every solicitor would then set himself up to determine what was privilege and what was not. I assert in all seriousness that this is not the role of a solicitor in regard to this or any other matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am still anxious to get some information from the Minister rather than silence him for evermore. The Minister is well aware that solicitors are frequently asked to act in trust for undisclosed principals. Again, it is undesirable that people should be debarred from so acting. I am afraid the Minister is doing a disservice to the whole community and this society is not respecting this right which people should have uninfringed of having a solicitor act on their behalf in trust without disclosing on whose behalf he is acting.  I believe serious injustice will be done to some people on that account.</P>
      <P>I wish to emphasise again that the solicitors' profession do not seek this for themselves.  It is of no benefit to them to preserve this privilege for their clients, but it is in the interest of the clients.  I concede the Minister has a good debating point when he suggests the solicitors' profession would have the advantage over auctioneers and rent collectors if they enjoyed this privilege and auctioneers and rent collectors did not.  I do not think the Law Society would seek that advantage for that reason.  I do not know of anybody who has in the past transferred business to solicitors' offices in the rent collection and estate management side simply because by so doing they would avoid disclosure of their interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an undesirable trend.  It is an unnecessary trend.  I would earnestly ask the Minister to respect the views of the Law Society and do as his <Col N="1249" /> colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, did and put in the necessary protective clause in the section.</P>

      <P>The higher grants, the £450 housing grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems peculiar <Col N="1251" /> to me that if a working man builds a house in a rural area, he will qualify for £450, while, if he builds it in a built-up area, even though that built-up area might be a small provincial town, he will lose £150.  I cannot see what justice there is in, say, a carpenter getting £450 from the State and £450 from the local authority to build a house in a rural area, while a shop assistant, earning much less money, building a house within the confines of a town commissioner's area will get £150 less.  Surely there is just as much obligation on the State and on the local authority to help the man who may build his house just inside the boundary of, say, the urban district as outside it?  However, we shall deal with the State side of the grants in this case.</P>
      <P>On an earlier stage of this Bill, I mentioned two people in identical occupations who built houses.  One has been paid £900 and the other will be paid only £600.  That reflects the peculiarity of the regulations embodied in these sections.  A number of people at the present time, shop assistants and others in towns big and small and, indeed, I could say in cities just as well, are just as much entitled to the higher grants, if they provide their own houses, as people in rural areas.</P>
      <P>It is the desire of the State and of every local authority to induce as far as possible people anxious for housing accommodation to provide their own homes.  I believe the best incentive we can give them is this additional money. If, in an urban area, we get a person who is qualified for housing accommodation to build his own house and give him the higher rate of grants, it would be much cheaper on public funds than to have him a burden on the housing authority and on the State. That is a matter the Minister should look into on this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Many of us were disappointed, when the Bill was introduced, that a higher subsidy which we had hoped would be included in the new Housing Bill, was not included and it was generally accepted that this increased subsidy for people in rural <Col N="1252" /> areas was in fact an attempt to go some way with the clamour all over the country for increased subsidies because of the tremendous increase in housing costs.</P>
      <P>The point made by Deputy Murphy just pinpoints one of the anomalies which has arisen because of the situation where people in rural areas are able to get increased subsidies while those in urban areas are not. But everybody in rural areas does not get increased subsidies.  If the Minister remembers, even people who would normally qualify, according to the way we think of it and to the way the Minister appears to think of it, have been turned down by his Department. I instanced the last day the man building a house in a rural area who, because there was a water supply passing the road near where he was building it, was adjudged not to be in a rural area.  I think this thing of deciding that a rural area is not a rural area, if there is a water-pipe running through it, is stretching things a bit far.</P>
      <P>The other matter is the situation that has come to the fore recently of young people out of overcrowded houses getting married.  If they do not build their own house, the local authority, the county council, is responsible for rehousing them because they must go into some shack or one or other of the parents' houses and it is so overcrowded that the council will have to find housing for them.  I find that these people have extreme difficulty in being certified as people who should get the higher subsidy, even though the local authority certifies them as people entitled to rehousing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we were discussing this on Committee Stage some weeks ago, the Minister gave as his opinion&mdash;and it is in the Official Report&mdash;that people in that category should be entitled to qualify.  Unfortunately, that opinion does not seem to have trickled through to the very efficient officials dealing with the subsidy end of it.  The result is that it has to be sent from one group of officials to another and eventually a higher executive officer will come along and say: &ldquo;Those <Col N="1253" /> people do not qualify&rdquo;.  I think that while we are on this particular aspect of it, the Minister might confirm what he said the last day and possibly it might have the desired effect.  I would appeal to him, in addition, to take up the point and attempt to bring in people in bad housing conditions in other rural areas.  Originally, it was intended simply to deal with the farming community.  It was subsequently extended to other classes and, since it has so extended, I think the Minister should extend it the whole way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like again to mention the particular point mentioned by Deputy Murphy, particularly having regard to the area immediately contiguous to the Dublin city area and its environs.  In subsection (2) of this section, the qualification is &ldquo;ordinarily resident in a rural area&rdquo;. The original idea was in respect of a farm labourer or a person deriving his employment from agriculture. With the extension of factory building and so on, there are many people living in rural areas who may qualify under paragraph (b) but there are many hundreds of people who, just because they do not live in a rural area, are deprived of the opportunity of this additional grant when they have to provide their own dwellings even though, in their particular case, they may be the same class of person. They may derive their livelihood from the same type of employment.  The wage rate may be similar and the conditions may be similar.  The only disadvantage they are at is that of living in an urban area.  Surely this should not continue at this stage, having regard to the circumstances of many thousands of these families who have been affected in this way.  Because of the implications of this section, they are, in fact, being treated almost as second-class citizens.  I would add my plea that this matter should be looked at again by the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as town and rural treatments are concerned, the situation roughly is that borough areas, corporation areas, urban areas, town commissioner areas, are towns for the purposes of our administration of this matter together with any other built-up area the population of which exceeds 1,000.  In those cases, while we are not allowing the higher grants&mdash;in fact they will not operate in those areas as such&mdash;instead, we are operating the site subsidy scheme and it will be possible for the council of the town, whether it is urban, borough or whatever it may be, to avail of the subsidy scheme which is one-third of the cost and, I would expect, one-third of the cost not exceeding £450 per site, giving the possibility of getting by subsidy £150 which equates with the £150 additional to the ordinary grant for these special classes in the rural areas.</P>
      <P>On top of that, if the local council, urban or otherwise, wish to purchase sites, develop and divide sites for specific categories, not only can they avail of the subsidy of up to £150 a site, but, if they put the proposition and the scheme to me for certain categories who would be deserving, there is no reason why they cannot go the other £150 themselves and equate in that way the subsidy that those living outside the towns would get by way of grant and supplementary grant.  In no case&mdash;this is specifically provided for somewhere along the line &mdash;may anybody qualify for the advantage of both of those schemes.  This should clarify the situation in regard to the difference of treatment as between town and country.</P>

      <P>This subsidy effort is up to the councils of the towns in question.  If they feel that the situation requires the provision of developed sites, if, in addition to the subsidy, they feel further help is required for certain categories, they may propose to do that and I have no doubt that I would find it rather easy to agree if they wished to do more than give the benefit of the State subsidy to such people.  They are not being left aside and they are not being treated, as only Deputy Larkin of the group on the other side of the House suggested, as second-rate citizens. They will get their due, provided their councils believe they need it.  It is on this basis that the subsidy scheme can operate to their advantage to the point at which it can equate with what is being given by way of grants to classes in the rural areas.  Remember, not everybody in the rural areas qualifies for the higher grants.  Quite a few will, but not all.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 16&mdash;  (i)  in line 8, to delete &ldquo;in <Col N="1258" /> occupation of land&rdquo; and insert &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo;; (ii)  in line 10, to delete &ldquo;in a rural area&rdquo;; (iii)  to delete lines 22 to 24 and insert the following subparagraph:</P>

    <P>During Committee Stage, reference was made to the fact that section 17, which deals with dower houses, required that the person going into the dower house must live in a house situated on the same holding.  It was felt this was too stringent a requirement and this amendment accordingly deletes that provision.  There is instead a simple requirement that the person is transferring his holding, or a substantial portion of it, to a member of his family or to the Land Commission. It may be found desirable to have this dower house situated in a built-up area and paragraph (2) deletes the requirement that the house must be built in a rural area.</P>

      <P>I think it is an excellent idea that these people will no longer be required to live on the farm.  It is also a good idea that this does not require the transfer of the entire holding.  I have been speaking to old people who are anxious to avail of the provisions of this Bill but they resented the fact that the Minister required them to hand over all the holding in order to qualify.  They wondered what they would do with their time; if they are left a small portion they will be perfectly satisfied.  The amendment is an excellent one.</P>
      <P>With reference to Deputy Murphy's query about whether the dower house is for the old people or for the son, as far as I am concerned, and I do not care whether the Minister likes this or not, I will tell them that for a few weeks anyway, until the inspector has gone, the old people will have to move into the dower house.  What they do after that is a matter for themselves.  We have had experience of cowsheds being turned into houses and haysheds being converted into garages.  If that can be done, surely there is nothing wrong with a switch between father and son.</P>

This amendment will enable them to do that. Deputy Murphy asked must the dower house be for the son and the Minister eloquently implied that a shuffle was possible.  I wonder did the changed view come about to prevent this shuffle taking place.</P>

      <P>In page 19, line 10, to delete &ldquo;by the Minister&rdquo; and insert &ldquo;under any enactment (including this Act)&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment brings the wording of section 22, which deals with further grants for reconstruction, into line with the other grant sections and provides that these further grants may be paid for work which has qualified for a grant under any enactment, subject to the conditions in the section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>In recent years applicants for reconstruction grants have to some extent gone into this farmhouse holiday business during the summer.  That is particularly true in the case of uneconomic holdings around the coastal areas.  It is a good thing.  An extra room or two is provided and they intend to make a few pounds if they can get visitors to occupy these rooms during the summer, possibly when some members of the family may be absent from home.  If an applicant tells the housing inspector that he intends to take in these visitors, the reply from the Department is that the grants are given for residential purposes only and, since it is proposed to commercialise on the reconstruction, the matter is not one to be dealt with by the Department.  On the other hand, the applicant who makes no mention of his intention to keep visitors when the inspector calls has no difficulty in getting the grant. The former is deprived of a State grant and is subsequently <Col N="1261" /> deprived of the supplementary local authority grant.</P>
      <P>A proposal on the part of an applicant in a coastal area that he intends to make use of part of the house during the summer months to accommodate tourists and therefore make a little money for himself should not deprive him of the benefit of these grants.  I ask the Minister to amend the Bill so that it will be possible for a person who intends to keep visitors during the summer months, in rooms that will be occupied by members of his own family for the rest of the year, to get these grants.  I know many people who provide alternative accommodation for members of their families in outside buildings during the summer months so that they may take in tourists into the dwelling proper and it is a shame that such people should be deprived of this grant because they engage in the farmhouse holiday scheme which is recommended by the Minister and the local authorities.  I am asking the Minister to remove this clause which puts a penalty on straight-forwardness and truthfulness on the part of these people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is that in so far as the first reconstruction grant is concerned, everybody is entitled to it but for the second reconstruction grant, special and stringent regulations are laid down.  If the second grant is required for any purpose other than the relief of overcrowding of the householder's family, he will not get that grant.  It does not matter for what other purpose he requires it, he will not get it.  It could happen that one householder goes in for a first reconstruction grant and a second householder in the same area, the houses could be side by side, goes in for a second.  The man applying for <Col N="1262" /> the first reconstruction grant will get it and the man applying for the second one will not and there might therefore seem to be some injustice done.  However, that is not the case.</P>
      <P>There is no way by which anybody by being dishonest or misleading to the departmental inspectors can get the second reconstruction grant.  If we are to consider the question of farmhouses and tourist accommodation, it is far too big a matter for a housing reconstruction grant scheme.  The amount that we can give at most is so little in comparison with the cost requirements that the matter has been fully considered and rejected as not being sufficient to do the job in this regard. Without wishing to tread on the territory of my colleague, I can say that this matter will be dealt with by another Minister in this House and, I hope, in the not too distant future. That is all I can say about it.  If Deputy Murphy or any other Deputy feels, despite what I have said, that there is still any element of injustice or unjust treatment by my Department, I would like to have the details and I will deal with the matter, although not on any basis of recrimination of the inspector.</P>

      <P>I mave amendment No. 19:</P>
      <P>In page 23, line 24, to delete &ldquo;a supplementary grant&rdquo; and insert &ldquo;supplementary grants&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should say that during Committee Stage many Deputies were concerned about the wording of the section dealing with the payment of supplementary grants, concerned that they would enable housing authorities to impose unreasonable conditions in relation to making supplementary grants to individuals. I said that I would look into the question and, if necessary, put down a Report Stage amendment.  These amendments are the result of my undertaking. They will provide that a housing authority may impose, in relation to the making of supplementary grants, such conditions as they think fit.  The use of the plural rather than the singular, as previously, will ensure that the grants will be paid in accordance with schemes made by the authority; in other words that there will not be special concessions made for individuals, which might have been the danger referred to originally by Deputies.  I should also mention that a corresponding amendment will be <Col N="1266" /> necessary in line 39 of page 24 where the words &ldquo;supplementary grants&rdquo; should be substituted for &ldquo;supplementary grant&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately many local authorities have not adopted this scheme of supplementary grants and I think that there is an obligation on the Minister, even though the funds are provided from local revenue, to try to get the co-operation of local authorities to provide these grants as far as possible.  I appreciate the difficulty in some urban areas but at the same time, a person building a house and availing of the ordinary grant qualifies for only £275, while his neighbour, if he is outside the district, and irrespective of whether he is within the limits provided for in the supplementary grants, will get an additional £275.  There should be uniformity between local authorities in making these supplementary grants available.  I know that it is optional to do so.  There should be some move made by the Minister to ensure that the poorer housing authorities&mdash;by these I mean those with a small rateable valuation&mdash;should be helped in some way, either by loan or some other system, so that they could give supplementary grants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like again to protest about the fact that for some reason the amendments have not been listed according to sections.  It is extremely difficult, particularly because we have been on recommittal, to follow them.  It is difficult enough in normal circumstances but extremely difficult now.

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought the Chair said amendment No. 120.  I move amendment No. 20:</P>
      <P>In page 24, between lines 10 and 11, to insert a new subsection as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;( ) The making or amending <Col N="1267" /> of a supplementary grants scheme shall be a reserved function.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This means that this should be a function reserved to the members of the local authority.  The tendency has been to try to work in practically everything dealing with local government, and particularly housing, as an executive function; in other words, a function of the county manager.  We believe that the proper way is to reserve this function to the elected members.  We have heard a lot about the authority which was being restored to elected members but when one comes across a Bill such as this and reads all the things where the local authority is in fact the county manager, it would appear that the local representatives are only a facade to cover up what the officials are doing.  In order to try to hold on to some power, we suggest that this should be altered to read that the making or amending of supplementary grants should be a function reserved to the elected members of the local authority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support this amendment because, apart from the argument adduced by Deputy Tully, which is a very valid one, there is equally the fact that these supplementary grants come from local revenue raised by resolutions of the elected representatives, and it cannot be raised otherwise.  It is the elected representatives who have the statutory obligation of striking the rate.  On both grounds, there is every reason for the acceptance of this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support this amendment along much the same lines as those mentioned by Deputy Jones. I must say that my experience has been that where strong pressure was exerted on the county manager by the members of the council to have some conditions in a scheme altered, the manager met the members and made the necessary alteration in most cases.  I do know that a scheme which is unfair and inequitable to quite a number of people can be in existence for quite a long time and there is everything to be said for giving the public representatives discretion in this matter and the power <Col N="1268" /> and authority necessary to have a scheme drafted along certain lines. They meet many categories of people in their public work and they know the difficulties with which those people are confronted.</P>
      <P>Some of the schemes that are in existence are extremely restricted and, therefore, many deserving people are debarred from supplementary grants. Indeed, it often works against the better interests of the council itself and against the better interests of the ratepayers. In many cases the supplementary grant might make all the difference between these people providing their own houses and not providing them.  If they do not provide them, they are a housing responsibility of the local authority.  Sometimes one sees this penny-wise and pound foolish attitude on the part of the county manager.  It is only right that all responsibility possible should be vested in the members of the council.  They have to meet the ratepayers, and if the people feel the public representatives have been unjust and have done wrong, the people have a way to deal with that.  Public representatives as a body know what is needed and will deal with a matter of this sort in a very sensible way without going too far either to the right or to the left.</P>

      <P>Most local authorities, with the exception of those referred to by Deputy Murphy&mdash;and they are local authorities who, because of their set-up, would feel that they could not finance it&mdash;have supplementary grant schemes.  As far as I know, these schemes are acceptable to the council.  They must adopt the scheme and must provide the money to implement it.  Therefore, I do not see that there is any great necessity to place responsibility on the elected representatives to formulate a scheme rather than on the county manager.</P>

No. 137 of 1965) or regulations to be made under this section, any person who is qualified to receive a supplementary grant from a housing authority under section 26 of this Act shall not be disqualified from receiving a loan under section 39 (or by reason of any Departmental or administrative decision) where the applicant's income enables a housing authority to make a supplementary grant.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This was argued endlessly here previously.  We find that some housing authorities are playing off the loans against the grants and <i>vice versa.</i>  We are suggesting the Minister should ensure that this little game is no longer allowed.

It sounds ridiculous that a person should be eligible for a supplementary grant and, at the same time, not eligible for a loan.  The reason they are eligible for a supplementary grant is that they are in the lower income group, generally speaking.  We have the situation that people with families are debarred from a loan when in fact they are eligible for a supplementary grant.  I remember the Minister had no real argument to put up against this.  I hope since we argued this on Committee Stage, he has seen the good sense of having the two figures the same.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am.  The £1,200 limit on the eligibility for loans under the SDA scheme funded from the Local Loans Fund is complained of as being lower than the upper limit for the supplementary grants scheme, where there are at least four dependants, which is £1,440.  There is no stipulation about dependants as far as the £1,200 is concerned.  It deals with the availability of money from the Local Loans Fund for this purpose and should not be confused, as I think it is being confused at present, with the upper limit for the supplementary grants scheme where there are at least four dependants.  Even where there are four dependants, it is discretionary for the local authority.  They cannot be dictated to by the Minister or anybody else.  In regard to the loans, it is only the source from which the money is drawn that counts.  The £1,200 is not comparable and should not be compared with the £1,440, because there is no restriction so far as the £1,200 is concerned as to whether the applicant has one, four or no dependants.</P>

      <P>Suppose a tenant of a local authority dwelling desires to build his own dwelling and to take advantage of a scheme where he can get a 99 per cent loan.  If that loan is limited to four children, in the way in which it has been said, it means that that tenant will not be able to get sufficient money.  The chances of getting money elsewhere will be minimal and therefore the idea of helping him to provide his own dwelling will be negatived.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">

      <P>The biggest trouble is that when they reach that income of £1,200 they feel that if they were able to qualify for the loan they would be able to build a house and pay for it.  Unfortunately, the county managers do not agree with that point of view.  If they can get the loan and would be in a position to apply for it, they prevent the very class who could avail of it from availing of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>If you take the price of a house at a given figure, then the more you give by way of grant, the less you need by way of loan.  The fact that we have gone to £1,440 for these supplementary grants is not so much that it is a good argument as that the income limit for the availing of SDA moneys from the local loans fund should be the same figure.  It could be argued that it should be higher or lower.  In so far as tying it in law to the other one, on principle I would not be in favour of it because it could work <Col N="1278" /> against the view expressed here tonight in the not too distant future.</P>

That seems to be a fairly ridiculous situation to arise. It has prevented people who otherwise would have built their own houses from doing so.</P>

      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 39:</P>
      <P>In page 29, between lines 51 and 52, to insert a new subsection as follows: &ldquo;(10) The fixing of the rate or rates of interest to be charged by a local authority in respect of a loan advanced under this section shall be a reserved function.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Again, while in very many cases the members of the local authority can advise the county manager on the rate which is to be fixed for a loan and can, in fact, agree to give low interest rate loans to people with low incomes, there are some local authorities where the managers fix the interest and charge the maximum amount.  That results in the adding of one-half or threequarter per cent to the local authority loan rate.  It is not a very big issue, not anything like as big as that in the previous amendment, but it is still very desirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment as another way of providing assistance to induce people to provide their own houses and so relieve the <Col N="1280" /> ratepayers.  If it is done on a selective basis and for a well-defined category of people, it could be an advantage, but it is something that would have to be restricted and certain rules and regulations would have to be devised for it.  Otherwise, the point might be reached at which the dog would be after his own tail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>Acceptance of this amendment would leave it to the elected representatives to assist people to build their own houses.  At the moment there are certain things they can do, things that are more or less statutory, and these are all set down, with the exception of the supplementary grants.  The normal practice in regard to the loan scheme is that the City Manager adds on to the interest rate which the local authority has to pay a fixed sum for administrative costs.  That addition is made automatically. It might be that the acceptance of this amendment would provide an opportunity for local authorities to examine the whole situation and to see to what extent they would be prepared to use the power given in the amendment.  It might initiate another look at the way in which people providing their own houses can be assisted.</P>
      <P>Because of our present circumstances and all the things that go with house purchasing, in many cases the effect is that the State and supplementary grants go to benefit the builder of the house and not the person for whom it is being built.  This amendment would further the opportunities of local authorities to see whether they could use the authority given in it to assist house purchase and it would open further avenues to enable people to provide their own houses.  Members of local authorities would naturally have to have regard to their responsibilities as representatives of the local ratepayers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister in considering this amendment might have regard to the fact that for years we have been encouraging the provision of houses by people themselves. One of the encouraging factors is the <Col N="1281" /> fact that supplementary grants are available.  The time when a person is building a house is the time that the burden is greatest.  The family is arriving and growing up and the idea of a subsidised rate of interest could be a great inducement to a young couple to build their own houses.  It would be a very valuable incentive if the repayment of a loan could be stretched over a greater period of years and it would be a help to young people at a time when their burden is greatest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I will say that there is not a manager in Ireland today who would not agree to the expressed wishes of his council members if they wanted to have the interest rates reduced.  I do not believe there is a manager in the country who would not abide by such a request, if it were made to him.  However, the wisdom of doing it is a matter that not only the manager but the whole group of the council have to consider.  It is well known that Cork tried this some years ago and gave it up.  They had an interest rate down to something like three per cent.  Without having given the matter a great deal of thought before the Cork experiment, I might have been inclined to encourage the idea. Since then and considering what changed their minds in Cork, I am very much changed in mind about it, without being directly opposed to it. I would think a long time about it before including it in this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I know they do.  We are not all that long at the game but we have come a long distance in regard to encouraging private building by State grants, supplementary grants, tax remission and other matters.  If they could all be obtained in cash at the one time, they would practically build a house in many cases.  One <Col N="1282" /> wonders who has got all this money. By and large a very large amount is being given by State and local authorities to encourage and enable people to provide houses for themselves.</P>
      <P>As I say, had we started out at an early stage on subsidisation of interest rates on houses for owner occupation, it is quite possible we would never have evolved the various schemes of grants and rates and tax concessions now built in to our whole system, built in to such a degree that going over to the interest subsidisation inherent in these amendments would inevitably result in a situation in which we should have to think again about cutting out some, or all, of the present incentives.  That might be a good thing but one has to remember that the idea is being considered now in the light and against the background of a fairly widespread and diversified code of assistance by way of encouragement to private house building.  If a local authority wants it, however, I doubt if any manager would stand in the way of his council subsidising interest rates.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the most progressive schemes, irrespective of what Government was in office, you will find that where councils had a Fianna Fáil majority, they operated the schemes in advance and far more generously than did majorities of other kinds.  That may prove single-mindedness of purpose, but that is the way it works out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as the amendments are concerned, I question the wisdom of this reversal of the present situation.  It seems to me to be six of one and half a dozen of the other.  I believe anybody <Col N="1283" /> who wants this system can have it if a majority or unanimous decision of the council asks for it.  I believe that purposely setting about reversing the trend after all these years would be taken as a direct invitation, if not a direction, that this should be done.  I am not convinced of the wisdom of doing it in all cases judging it against the background of present aid and assistance.  I should be loth to rush into this merely because it would make the payments easier in future.  One of the anomalies at the moment is that mortgage interest is eligible for tax abatement.  People who qualify for an SDA loan would be unlikely to be worried initially about tax abatement but, as the years go by, many of these people become very well off indeed. Under the law as it stands, the richer a man grows the greater the benefit he reaps in tax concessions on foot of his mortgage.  We should ask ourselves then whether we should add to that this further advantage for an applicant who later on could pay three, four or ten times what he set out to pay originally.  As a result of improving his station in life and his income, he gets a bigger rebate from the State on the tax side.  That is an aspect that should be considered.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 40:</P>
      <P>In page 29, between lines 51 and 52, to insert a new subsection as follows: &ldquo;() In this section `house' includes a cottage included in a purchase scheme under the Act of 1936 or a house included in any housing authority purchase scheme.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister may be able to clarify the position for me in a couple of minutes.  This is an amendment to section 39.  Section 39, subsection (1), says:</P>
      <P>A housing authority may, subject to regulations made by the Minister for the purposes of this section with the consent of the Minister for Finance, lend money to a person for the purpose of acquiring or constructing a house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have put down the amendment because we find at local authority level that very often vested council cottages come up for sale, particularly if the annuity has been redeemed, and are sold to the highest bidder.  Very often local persons, farmworkers, road-workers <Col N="1286" /> or factory workers, who are in fairly low-paid jobs, would like to purchase the cottage.  If they purchase the cottage they would be removed from the local authority list of persons needing rehousing.  The only thing that stops them is the fact that they have not got the necessary ready money.</P>
    <P>What I suggest is that such persons should be eligible for a loan under this section for the purpose of purchasing one of these cottages.  It is a reasonable proposal which I do not think requires any long debate.  If the Minister tells me that that is already included in the section I am prepared to accept that immediately.  I cannot find where it is included.  My impression is that it is not included in the section.  If it is not, I think the Minister will agree with me that it is highly desirable that every effort should be made to allow these people to purchase houses which become available in the area, particularly vested cottages. That is what I had in mind in the amendment.</P>
    <P>The Minister is probably aware that at present some local authorities have found it necessary to repurchase cottages which were vested some years ago in order to find cheap housing for persons eligible for rehousing.  In order to prevent the necessity for their doing so and to allow people to own their own houses, my amendment suggests that persons in this category should be entitled to get the loan whereby to purchase a house of this type.  I should like to hear the Minister's view as to whether or not they are already included.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I just do not know what to say in relation to this amendment. I agree that a poor man of the working class should be allowed to buy such a house if it comes on the market.  What I would be afraid of is that a house might come on the market and you might have a number of persons similarly situated applying for the same loan for the same house.  It would increase competition and might defeat the very purpose Deputy Tully has in mind.  That is only one aspect. It is something that I have considered but felt that it would be better in most <Col N="1287" /> cases if the loan were not available and the price of the house kept at a reasonable level as a result.  People who are in immediate need of a house do not have regard to the consequences of putting themselves in debt in order to purchase a house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>That difficulty could be got over by the local authority putting a valuation on the house and refusing to give a loan beyond a certain figure.  The insurance companies do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>In that restricted sense it is only right, equitable and just that a poor man should be enabled to buy a house the same as a man who is better off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as the net point in the amendment is concerned, I can assure Deputy Tully that the amendment is unnecessary but it would be unfair if I did not also say that while under the Bill there would be no statutory objection to making a loan for such a purpose as that asked for in the amendment, nevertheless, there might be administrative objections.  The council might be precluded from paying money for the purchase of vested cottages or the interest in vested cottages, which is probably a better example.  We have already, as the House will appreciate, gone out of the way to try to meet this overall point which has been made, not merely on this amendment but on previous sections, by Deputy Tully and others.  We have brought about the situation that there may be a mortgage created in a vested cottage.  That is an advance in the right direction, that is, if Deputy Tully's direction ever was right.  It is an advance in that direction. Statutorily we are not saying that because the house is a cottage or vested cottage it may not be treated in the same way as any other house, in so far as an advance is concerned.  It would be unfair and misleading the House if I did not say that despite that freedom in the law there will be administrative difficulties, if not objections, to advancing such moneys but the law is all right as far as what we are talking about in the amendment is concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has partly answered my question.  It is one of the tricks which, unfortunately, seem to have grown up in this Parliament that when a Minister is making a comment on a matter such as this he leaves us in the position that he agrees as to 50 per cent of what we are saying but is not prepared to accept the amendment which would go the whole way and give us the 100 per cent we are looking for.  I do not know whether or not the Minister really meant what he said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am innocent on this occasion.  The amendment is unnecessary. Let me put it another way: even if we accepted the amendment I would still have said what I did in regard to administrative objections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It is all right for the Minister to say that.  I know he is trying to be helpful.  The administrative objections to which the Minister is referring no doubt have to do with this whole question of second mortgage which I thought we had cleared earlier. For a start, if the annuity on the house is redeemed fully, I assume there can be no objections, administrative or otherwise.  It is simply a freehold house and therefore should qualify for any loan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point is that if it is not a freehold house, if there is an annuity being paid on it, the Labourers Act. passed last year, enables the purchaser, who in this case is somebody who is <Col N="1289" /> getting a loan, to redeem the price of the house and in that way he would also have, after the sale, a freehold house.  Therefore I do not know where the administrative objections come in. The Minister was thinking of the situation before the passing of the Labourers Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I was unfair to the House and myself to suggest that there might be difficulties.  I could have said the amendment is truly unnecessary and that what is there encompasses everything better than what is in the amendment.  I could have said that and stopped, but I felt I would be unfair if I did not say that if we pass this without amendment there may still be administrative objections to giving moneys by the local authorities for the purchase of the interest in a vested cottage on which the annuity is still being redeemed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is purchased, it means the annuity must be redeemed and therefore where the difficulties arise I do not know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy does not know and is not afraid of them, all I have done is warned him of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the trouble.  If the Minister had said it is unnecessary, no county manager could take up tonight's Official Report and say: &ldquo;This is what the Minister said and he knew it could not be done.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>But the Minister has sown the seed.  I am sure the Minister will accept that the amendment is put down in order to try to help out in an extremely difficult situation which can be found all over the country at present. We have cottages locked up which local people would be prepared to buy but they have not got the money.  They live in shacks while these cottages are locked up.  If money were made available, they could purchase them.  If money were made available it would also relieve my council of spending £1,750 to £1,800 for new houses.  The Minister says that this can be done, <Col N="1290" /> but there might be administrative difficulties, without saying what they are.  My experience has been that officials are only too glad to be able to wave a copy of the Dáil Debates in the air, when it suits them, and say: &ldquo;This is what the Minister said.  He knew it could not be done&rdquo;.  He said that there might be administrative difficulties and an administrative difficulty appears.  I would be happier if the Minister would say what are the administrative difficulties which might occur.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>

      <P>In page 37, between lines 17 and 18, to insert a new subsection as follows: &ldquo;() The report shall include observations as the housing authority may, by resolution, consider should be notified to the Minister.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The section is section 53 which reads:</P>
      <P>(1) It shall be the duty of a housing authority, within such period after the commencement of this section as may be specified by the Minister and thereafter at such intervals as the Minister may direct from time to time, to inspect the houses in their functional area and to ascertain&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1292" />  (a) to what extent there exist in the area houses which are in any respect unfit or unsuitable for human habitation,</P>
    <P>(b) any overcrowding existing in the area, and</P>
    <P>(c) such other matters as the Minister may specify from time to time,  </P>
    <P>and having regard to the information obtained by the inspection, and such other information as may be relevant, to assess, as respects the area, the adequacy of the supply of housing and the prospective future demand for housing and to cause a report thereon to be prepared. (2) For the purposes of the preparation of a report under this section, a housing authority shall make such enquiries and keep such records as may appear to them to be necessary or expedient, or which the Minister may direct.</P>
    <P>The reason for asking for the insertion of this new subsection is that it has been found that when reports are being made by a manager to a Minister, he very often submits that the housing authority considers further housing is necessary but adds his own comments rather than the comments of the housing authority members.  Even as recently as last year this caused embarrassment to members of a local authority not 100 miles from here.  In order to prevent something like this happening again, the amendment suggests it should be mandatory on the manager to include in the report the observations of the elected members of the authority.  If this were done, the Minister would know what the elected members required to be done and would not make the mistake which was made when a manager included only his own observations.  The Minister would protect himself and ensure that he would not be misdirected in future by any manager.  I suggest he should accept the amendment.</P>
