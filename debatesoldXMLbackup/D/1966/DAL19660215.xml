      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 8 together.</P>
      <P>The medallions in question are not liable to duty.  Gold and silver medallions struck in England are subject to the laws governing hall-marking in that country.  Whether or not they bear an English hallmark, these medallions must be sent to the Assay Master of the Company of Goldsmiths of the City of Dublin for marking by him, before they are cleared through the customs.  The hallmark in such cases is commonly known as the Irish Foreign Mark and differs from the hallmark stamped on Irish-made articles.</P>
      <P>The sterling value of the gold contained in the gold medallion has not been valued for official purposes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance the reason for the delay in fixing the rateable valuation of <Col N="1446" /> O'Connell Bridge House, Hawkins House, St. Stephen's Green House, Ansley House and Liberty Hall; and whether, pending the fixing of such valuations, any compensation will be paid to Dublin Corporation in lieu of rates in respect of municipal services provided for accommodation in those buildings occupied by civil servants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume that, in referring to delay in fixing the rateable valuation, the Deputy has in mind the information given to him in reply to a question on last Wednesday, 9th February, 1966, that the accommodation occupied by the State in these buildings was not valued for rating in the current year.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Commissioner of Valuation that, under the Valuation Acts, the accommodation in question could not be valued hitherto, as that in Hawkins House had not been referred to him by Dublin Corporation in the Lists of Hereditaments Requiring Revision of Valuation, while the rest, although so listed, was not ready for occupation when the current Revised Valuation List was published on 1st March, 1965.</P>
      <P>As Dublin Corporation has not suffered any loss of rates on this accommodation by reason of the State occupying it, no payment in lieu of rates will be made until it has been valued.</P>
      <P>Question No. 10 postponed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government whether legal power exists to ensure that Irish beaches may not be fenced in, or in any way reserved, for purely private use; and, if not, if he will take such legislative action as may be necessary to guarantee permanent public access to beaches and to prevent them becoming restricted areas or the scene of undesirable commercial development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney) Neil T. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>Planning authorities have wide powers under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, to provide or preserve rights of access.  Such an authority may include as an objective in their development plan under the Act the preservation of any existing public right of way giving access to seashore, mountain, lakeshore, riverbank or other place of natural beauty or recreational utility, whereupon the authority must take all steps necessary to secure the objective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A planning authority may also enter into an agreement for the creation of a public right of way over land, or may create one by order subject to a right of appeal to the Minister, and payment of compensation where appropriate. Where a public right of way is created, or a provision relating to its preservation is included in a development plan, the way must be maintained by the planning authority and penalties are provided on conviction for obstruction. Development in seaside areas is subject to the controls provided in <Col N="1454" /> the Planning and Development Act in relation to development generally.  I am satisfied that these provisions are quite adequate to enable seaside amenity and public access rights to be safeguarded.</P>
    <P>It is, however, of vital importance that planning authorities for coastal areas should exercise the utmost vigilance and should fully utilise their statutory powers to preserve all necessary means of access to these beaches. I am bringing to the notice of the planning authorities concerned the nature and extent of powers and responsibilities which they should exercise in this regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not agree that while the powers in the Planning Act are laudable, they are not adequate to achieve the desired end, inasmuch as they will depend for their operation on the decisions of planning authorities throughout the country and, as we well know, planning authorities, like most other bodies in this country, are liable to take varying views on many matters and indeed are subject to all kinds&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of that, will the Minister not consider that in this matter, which is important, the rights of the public would best be protected by Government action in the form of a national trust, or some organisation of that nature?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The other thing omitted from the statement I have made is that these different plans are in due course forwarded to the Minister for Local Government, who, if he does not agree with them, if he has reason to feel that they are inadequate in any respect, may refer them back and have them amended according to what he feels, in view of what has been brought to his notice, is required in this respect or in any other aspect of the Planning Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Whether it is brought to the attention of the Minister or not, the development plan commitment as to access is only one part of the safeguard in the Planning Act.  The other is that now, and for all time until the Act is repealed, there is the right to create new rights of way either by voluntary agreement or compulsory acquisition, and this right will continue regardless of what may or may not be included in the development plan.  At any time in the future a right of way may be created compulsorily, if necessary.</P>

      <P>I am not so aware.  I am informed by the corporation that all possible steps are taken by them to expedite the letting of vacant accommodation. Six flats at Mountpleasant and Hollyfield Buildings are available for reletting at present.  Two of them have been offered to prospective tenants. Three of the remainder are one-roomed dwellings.  It is necessary for the corporation to keep a small number of vacant dwellings, particularly one-roomed dwellings, in reserve for persons displaced at short notice from dangerous buildings.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if, having regard to the desirability of not permitting the erection of defective dwellinghouses, he will have steps taken to prevent the payment of State grants or local authority loans in respect of houses built in pursuance of building contracts containing clauses which deem such houses to be built of proper materials and in a workmanlike manner, not-withstanding the appearance of defects after the date of first occupation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Payment of a State grant is made only when I am satisfied that the house has been erected in a proper and workmanlike manner, in accordance with the approved plans <Col N="1457" /> and specification and that any defects reported on inspection have been remedied.  Defects occurring at a subsequent date are a matter for the owner of the house and payment of a grant involves no warranty on my part as to the works carried out, or the structural soundness of the house.  The detailed administration of their house purchase loan schemes is a matter for the housing authorities.  It is their responsibility to take such action as they may consider necessary to safeguard their mortgage by satisfying themselves that houses in respect of which loans are made are built of proper materials and in a workmanlike manner.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The recommendations, issued by me recently in regard to the health authority ambulance service, arise from a continuing review of this service by my Department aimed at ensuring a constant process of improvement.  Arising out of earlier recommendations, all crews of accident ambulances have been trained in artificial resuscitation methods.  Recently, I recommended that where members of these crews have not also had first aid training they should now receive such training.  I have also asked health authorities to equip their ambulances with radiotelephones.</P>
      <P>These developments are all part of the normal process of improving the ambulance service, and, whilst they will ensure that crews will be able to perform their duties more effectively, it is not clear to me that they will impose new duties in the sense that the term is ordinarily understood.  However, should trade unions wish to discuss aspects of the proposed improvements with the health authorities, I would expect that there would be no obstacles in the way of such discussion.</P>

The choice of teacher for appointment as principal depends on the requirements of the particular school but should be such that he or she can be employed at the school for the appropriate number of teaching hours.</P>
      <P>For schools under the vocational education committees for urban districts and for Dún Laoghaire Technical School, the Chief Executive Officer acts as principal.</P>
      <P>Special qualifications may be required for posts as principal in certain large schools under the county borough vocational education committees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These qualifications are determined <Col N="1470" /> by me for particular vacancies arising from time to time, in the light of the requirements of the school in which the vacancy arises.</P>

      <P>I want to question the Order of Business.  Last Thursday morning I moved the First Stage of a Bill in the names of members of the Labour Party&mdash;the Offences Against the State Bill, 1966.  It was accepted by everybody present in the House, it was accepted by all present in the Press Gallery, it was announced on the radio and on television and in the evening papers and the following morning's daily papers, that the First Stage of this Bill had been accepted in the House by the Taoiseach.  Then, suddenly, <Col N="1471" /> from the record which we read here today, this First Stage would appear not to have been accepted.  I want to direct the attention of the House to the fact that no definite obvious indication was given in this House to the effect that the First Stage was not being accepted.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Hilliard)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £1,609,300 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1966, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Defence, including certain Services Administered by that Office; for the Pay and Expenses of the Defence Forces; and for payment of a Grant-in-Aid.</P>
      <P>When introducing the Estimate for Defence for 1965-1966 on 2nd March, 1965, my predecessor said that if the Cyprus operation should continue into 1965-1966&mdash;the then current United Nations mandate was due to expire on 26th March, 1965&mdash;additional money would be required for the payment of the allowances associated with overseas service, and that that would also be the case when revised pay scales came into operation for the Defence Forces.  There was no provision for these two matters in the Estimate for 1965-1966, so he feared that a substantial Supplementary Estimate would be necessary later in the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1474" /> It is this Supplementary Estimate which I am now introducing, and it is for a sum of £1,609,300.  It is attributable mainly to the increases in pay and allowances about which my predecessor spoke, as well as to other increases that have come about since; to the expenses of the Cyprus operation, which has continued, and to an increase in the strength of serving personnel beyond what was provided for in the main Estimate.  It would have had to be much greater were it not that substantial savings are being effected in a number of subheads and that appropriations-in-aid are also expected to exceed the original provision.</P>
    <P>If I run through the subheads briefly, it may be of assistance to Deputies. The additional sum of £50,000 odd required under Subhead A&mdash;Departmental Salaries&mdash;is necessitated by salary increases granted for certain Civil Service grades which had not been settled when the main Estimate was prepared.  Under Subhead B&mdash;Pay of the Permanent Defence Force&mdash;an additional sum of £1,687,000 is required.  Somewhat more than £1,000,000 of this relates to the pay increases to which I have referred already and to further increases in the pay scales of non-commissioned officers and privates which came into effect last August in connection with a rank and occupation re-classification scheme.  There is a sum of £605,000 odd in respect of Cyprus allowances up to 26th March next, when the present mandate expires, and a further £37,000 caused by the fact that, throughout the year, the strength of non-commissioned officers and privates has been running somewhat higher than the 7,000 for which the main Estimate made provision.</P>
    <P>There is provision for an additional sum of £198,000 under Subhead C&mdash; Allowances of the Permanent Defence Force.  Most of this relates to increased marriage allowance and children's allowances associated with the pay increases. A sum of almost £18,000 is required to cover two increases in ration allowance that have occurred during the present financial year and increases in subsistence allowances.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1475" /> The increase of £97,400 under Subhead D&mdash;Pay and Allowances of the Reserve Defence Force&mdash;is attributable to the increases in pay and allowances which were granted to members of the Reserve at the same rates as to the Permanent Defence Force.  There are small increases in Subheads E and I, but I do not think that I need delay over these.  Part III of the Estimate indicates the reason for the increases. Neither is it necessary to comment upon the small increases in Subheads R and V, which again are explained in Part III.</P>
    <P>In Subhead X&mdash;Incidental Expenses, there is provision for a sum of £19,000 odd to enable ex-gratia refunds to be made to certain health authorities.  The circumstances are that, some years ago, our military hospitals were approved by the Minister for Health under section 25 of the Health Act, 1953.  By reason of this, my Department was enabled on application to the various health authorities concerned, to be paid a certain daily sum for every eligible patient in a military hospital. One health authority objected to the basis of payment, and after a good deal of consideration, a new system has been worked out with retrospective effect.  This will involve refunds to a number of health authorities, and hence the necessity for the sum now sought.</P>
    <P>As publicly announced towards the end of November last, the Government decided that a special grant of £10,000 should be made available to the Irish Red Cross Society with a view to enabling the Society to relieve exceptional cases of personal distress due to flooding and storm damage arising from weather conditions during the present winter.  The necessary provision is now made in Subhead BB.</P>
    <P>It will be seen that expectations by way of appropriations-in-aid are now substantially greater than they were when the main Estimate was being prepared.  They result from additional revenue from lands and premises, receipts in respect of the services of personnel in the making of the &ldquo;Blue Max&rdquo; film, and receipts from the United Nations in respect of stores <Col N="1476" /> losses and certain administrative expenses. These last-mentioned anticipated receipts do not include any refunds of allowances.  As Deputies are already aware, the United Nations has accepted responsibility for the refund of overseas and <i>per diem</i> allowances paid to troops serving in Cyprus from 27th June last onwards, but it is not anticipated that any payment under this head will be received until the next financial year.</P>
    <P>I do not think that there is any more I need say at this stage.  I shall do my best, when concluding, to deal with any points that Deputies may raise and to answer any questions they may ask.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> The introduction of this Supplementary Estimate affords the House an opportunity of discussing defence policy in general, and the activities of the Department of Defence and the Army.  However, I do not propose to avail of this opportunity of going into these matters in any great detail, with the possible exception of the recent treatment meted out to the FCA, with which I will deal later.  It it, however, essential that the serving soldiers in the Army should be treated in a manner which will leave them happy and contented.  It also follows that when Army personnel are retired, they should be treated well and that when serving, they may expect fair treatment on retirement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that it is a fact that in November, 1961, a large increase was granted to the officers and men serving in the Permanent Army.  Those who were serving then and those who were retired after November, 1961, got the benefit of that large increase but Army personnel who had retired prior to that did not get the benefit of that increase.  It has been the policy of this Party to advocate that pensions should keep pace, so to speak, with the salaries being paid to retired officers' successors in the offices from which they have retired.  We think that is necessary in order to keep in line with the increases in the cost of living, but that has not happened in this case. The result is that there are very considerable <Col N="1477" /> discrepancies in the pensions being paid to officers who retired, for example, subsequent to 1961 and those who retired prior to that year.  I understand that it is a fact that a person in the same grade, an officer holding the same rank, who retired immediately after 1961, is as much as £112 per year better off than an officer holding exactly the same rank who retired shortly before.  I do not think that is right.  I think the man who retired shortly before 1961 should be treated as his fellow officer who retired after the increase which was granted in 1961.</P>
    <P>There appears to be a policy in the Army at the moment to reduce expenditure and to cut down the Estimates. I realise there is a shortage of money&mdash;one would want to be living in the moon not to realise that&mdash;but, at the same time, it is a mistake to save money at the expense of breaking faith with young men who have joined the Army on the undertaking that they would make it a career.  I understand that the age limit for joining the Defence Forces is 18 years but young men who have their parents' or guardians' consent are accepted between the ages of 17 and 18 years, are allowed to continue on and, if they are satisfactory, are accepted as full-time soldiers.  Many of them make a career of the Army.  During the year 1965, a considerable number of such men joined the Army with the consent of their parents or guardians.</P>

I did not intend to try to cover the entire field in detail but there were one or two points I did want to make.  I shall conclude on this particular topic by saying that quite a number of these men who were accepted in the Army under 18 were thrown out within the last year, having served a few months, without any valid reason.  That is not in the interests of recruiting in general. It discourages young men from joining the Army.  It is a policy that should not be pursued.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether it is possible to discuss the FCA under this particular heading, but I think it is.  The principal point I wish to make is in relation to the FCA.  There is great disquiet, unrest and dissatisfaction in the FCA.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i>&mdash;&mdash;but surely I can discuss the expenditure of the money provided for the Reserve Forces and, if I cannot make that point, that these Reserve Forces are going to be treated in a certain way in the not too distant future, then it is a positive waste of time voting this money.  In order to make that point, I shall have to discuss certain official announcements that have been made regarding the Reserve Forces.  With the greatest respect, I say the point I wish to make is in order: if the Reserve Forces, of which the FCA are part, are not going to be treated better in the future, then it is a positive waste of time spending this money and it should not be voted. I bow to the ruling of the Chair, but I submit that, seeing that is the case I intend to make, it is in order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1481" /> The FCA was established in 1940 as the LDF.  It was then a purely locally based reserve force.  In 1946 it became the FCA, or the Second Line Reserve, and, as I understand it, it may be mobilised at any time and sent for service in any part of the country.  I understand there are about 20,000 active members and, on paper, the force might be as many as 30,000.  It is a very worthwhile unit of the Reserve Forces because it is comprised of voluntary part-time soldiers suited to the type of service, in my opinion, that might be expected of them.  They do a good deal of training for which they do not receive any remuneration.  Up to this they had been given a fortnight's intensive training every year.  I shall deal now with the ordinary private. The private was given a gratuity of £6 and £5 per week pay during the training period.  A goodly number availed of this fortnight's training.  It was beneficial.  It fitted them to serve as a reserve force.</P>
    <P>It was not very easy to train the FCA properly in local halls without proper facilities, and so they did an intensive course of training for a fortnight once a year, which did them a lot of good.  Furthermore, they enjoyed that training.  They regarded it as a holiday, although during that holiday, they had to do this intensive course of training. That is why I say that the voting of this money, in so far as it will be spent on the FCA between now and the end of the year, is a waste of money.  There will be wholesale resignations from the force because of the change in Government policy towards the force.  The fortnight's training is to be reduced to one week and the already inadequate gratuity of £6 per week is to be reduced to £2.  That is the proposal.  I do not know what grounds could be put forward for it, other than the saving of money, but in my opinion, it is a rather miserable way of going about saving money.  There are many ways by which money could be saved other than by reducing this paltry gratuity of £6 a year to one-third of that amount, and, at the same time, reducing the period of training by one half.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1482" /> The point I am making is that the FCA is either a worthwhile unit of the Defence Forces or it is not.  If it is a worthwhile unit of the Defence Forces, as I believe it is, then it should be treated properly.  It should be treated in a reasonable manner, and it certainly should not be treated less favourably than it is being treated at the moment.  If it is not a worthwhile unit of the Defence Forces, it should be disbanded honourably, and not starved out as the Department propose to do at the present time.  That is the case I am making, and it is as simple as that.</P>
    <P>It is a well-known fact that the uniforms supplied to the FCA are quite unsuitable, quite unattractive, drab and uninteresting, and not calculated to encourage young men to come into the force.  I should like the Minister to say whether in fact we have entered into certain commitments with the United Nations Organisation to keep our Defence Forces up to a certain figure and, if so, whether the strength of the FCA is taken into account in arriving at that figure because, if it is, that would appear to be another reason for being serious about the force.</P>
    <P>The First Line Reserve were threatened with having no training this year either.  At least, those rumours were going around, whether or not they were well founded.  The people in the FCA think that because there were more powerful influences at the disposal of the First Line Reserve, they got the threat of having their training discontinued this year scotched.  They also believe that the First Line were called up as usual because whether they were, or were not, their gratuity would have to be paid at the end of the year, whereas in the case of the FCA, if they were not called up for training for the two weeks, they simply did not get the gratuity.  The Department have gone further than that because they have changed both the period of training and the amount of the gratuity.</P>
    <P>All down the years the FCA has afforded an opportunity in rural Ireland for young men to serve their <Col N="1483" /> country on a part-time basis in the Defence Forces.  This is an organisation which, thanks be to goodness, has always been completely non-political, although it is voluntary and part-time. That is something we can all be proud of.  Politics has never entered into the activities of the FCA in any way.  Even at this stage the Minister can undo this foolishness by affording an opportunity to the FCA this year again to go ahead with their annual training on terms at least as favourable as the terms in previous years.  If he does not do that, he should tell the FCA exactly where they stand, whether he wants to continue the force as it is, or whether he does not.  If he does not, these men can spend their spare hours in the service of the country in Civil Defence, in the Red Cross, or in any of the many other voluntary organisations. When the Minister is replying, I should like him to deal in particular with the questions I have raised about the FCA.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the third occasion on which Army matters have come before the House for debate this year.  Therefore I do not intend to go into any great detail about Army matters in general.  About a year ago, the Minister for Finance referred to the Army groups in this House and said we are worse than the Freemasons.  I am proud of the fact that we try to protect our former comrades, and try to make fair criticism of the Department of Defence.  The Minister and his predecessors have appreciated that and therefore I am sure that anything I may say will not be taken by the Minister on a personal basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am rather surprised at the limitation on this debate because a very substantial amount of money is involved. If it were simply a matter of a few thousand pounds, or a few hundreds of thousands of pounds, I could understand it, but the sum concerned is £1,609,300, which is no small beer, even, in the Department of Defence. The subheadings under which this money is being given show that it covers the Office of the Minister for Defence, and salaries, wages and allowances.  That covers practically <Col N="1484" /> everything in defence.  It also covers pay of the Permanent Defence Forces, the allowances of the Permanent Defence Forces, the pay and allowances of the Reserve Defence Forces and so forth.  The pay of the Permanent Defence Forces has been increased considerably and at the present time, though it is not what we should like it to be, it is moving in the right direction.  Even though the Minister refers to some increases in allowances this year, it is not the number of increases but the amount of the increases that counts.  The amount of money given to serving soldiers living out of barracks is absolutely ridiculous. It would not buy a lunch; as a matter of fact, it would not buy half a lunch for any Member of this House.  It is ridiculous to expect serving soldiers to live on the amount they get when living out of barracks.</P>
    <P>The question of our commitments in Cyprus was mentioned by the Minister. I should like to know where we are going in this respect.  I understood that while we had to take part in UN policing of trouble spots, we would not be asked to maintain our share.  I do not think there is anybody in this country who would say we have not done our fair share.  We have done far more than our fair share.  The Minister says we shall get a refund of the money and the Minister for External Affairs made a similar statement several months ago.  It appears that this will not be made available in this financial year.  All right; if it comes it will be very welcome, but I feel that as far as Cyprus is concerned, the Government should make up their minds whether we are to continue our forces there indefinitely.  I do not believe we should.  Having done more than our share, we should decide that we cannot continue to supply a force out there.  A token force may be all right but we are doing far more.</P>
    <P>I know that a number of soldiers serving in Cyprus and those who have served in the Congo like to get some service abroad.  It gives them an opportunity of seeing the world, something to interest them in the Army, but I do not think that should be taken as an excuse for keeping them indefinitely <Col N="1485" /> in Cyprus or elsewhere.  We should attempt to make the Army at home attractive enough without having to resort to gimmicks like this in order to keep serving soldiers interested.</P>
    <P>As far as the strength of the Army is concerned, I expressed surprise last year when I found the strength was so great&mdash;that it was over the complement required.  I noticed recently that an attempt has been made to reduce the number.  I do not think waist measurements or things like that are the proper way to reduce the Army personnel.  If we have got too many, it may be necessary to stop recruiting and the normal shrinkage from retirement should reduce the Army to the proper size without going to the extreme of taking somebody to the doctor, saying he was one or two stone overweight and consequently deciding he was no longer fit for Army service.</P>
    <P>The FCA are the Second Line Reserve. I believe the Government must make up their minds either that they want them or that they do not.  If they want the FCA as a well-trained second line of defence, they should treat them properly.  I know quite a number of young men, and some not so young, throughout the country who have been giving a lot of their free time and a tremendous amount of effort to try to keep the standard of the FCA up to what it should be.  I know also that the wastage in the FCA is far too high. There must be a line drawn somewhere and the Minister would be well advised to carry out a survey to find out why it is happening and make an attempt to prevent it happening.  I believe the FCA, even at reduced size, would be a far more effective group if they were kept at the one strength over a period of years.  The system of having men coming into the force, staying for a short time, being issued with uniforms, attending a few parades and taking no interest, is doing an immense amount of harm and it is most unfair to the force as a whole.</P>
    <P>It must be most disheartening to the training officers who are attempting to build an Army out of a group, some of whom show very little interest.  Let us face the fact that if the Department <Col N="1486" /> of Defence are to keep the FCA, they must attempt to make the FCA as efficient as possible, as attractive as possible.  Do not let us start cutting down on a couple of weeks' training each year.  This has become accepted as annual holidays for many of those who go into camps for a couple of weeks each year.  Instead of resorting to that, membership should be confined to people really interested in the force, people who are prepared to stay in it.  Leave out the man who blows in and blows out and who does no good.  Everybody is not cut out to be a soldier.  Numerous people who don uniforms find before long that the last thing they want is to be a soldier and such people should be told politely, or maybe not so politely, that they should get out.</P>
    <P>While we must make available the required amount of money to keep our defence services going, I believe I have mentioned the matters which require immediate attention.  As far as the First Line Reserve of Officers are concerned, here again the Minister might very well take the trouble to separate the efficient ones from the inefficient. We all know people who became Army officers during the Emergency, from 1939 to 1945, and that some of them are having an extremely difficult time getting around, yet they are still Reserve officers who report annually for training.  God help us if we ever need some of them in a war.  It would be sensible to keep only the efficient Reserve officers as is done in the Army itself where men are kept only as long as they are able to do their job.  If that were done in the Reserve, we would have a more efficient Army and less trouble.</P>
    <P>I commented here a few months ago that I noticed a tendency among ordinary civilians during a period of stress or emergency to think that the Army is wonderful; but when the danger is over, some people do not wish to be associated with the Army. People in dancehalls do not wish soldiers in uniform to be admitted and unfortunately many cafés adopt a similar attitude.  They should remember that the soldier in peacetime is in <Col N="1487" /> training for wartime duties.  If they did so, they would give far more consideration to the serving soldier than they do at the moment in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I expressed the hope earlier in the year that if a Supplementary Estimate for this Department were needed, it would be used to bring about the improvements mentioned during the debate on the original Estimate. I am glad to support any Supplementary Estimate the object of which is to bring about reliefs and permit increases in allowances to serving personnel and to members of the Reserve. In this Supplementary Estimate we are making provision for a number of increases.  I should like to say to the Minister at this stage that harmony between the regular Army and the Reserve and the FCA is essential.  I served in a voluntary and in a professional capacity.  I understand how the member of the FCA feels at the moment.  I feel disgusted about this situation.  This shabby treatment is something that probably is not of the Minister's making.  I believe it is the dictate of somebody in the Civil Service. I do not think any man with an interest in the Army would think of such a degrading scheme for any man who is prepared to give voluntary service to the nation.</P>
      <P>The scope of this debate is very limited but I should like to cover one or two items.  Allowances to the Reserve have been mentioned.  Reserve grants were sought here some time ago.  They have not been included and the position is deplorable.  I am sorry the Minister does not ask for more money so as to increase the pay to Reserve personnel.  While a sum of £79,400 has been set aside for pay allowances of the Reserve forces, it is not enough.  If the Minister had brought forward a much larger Supplementary Estimate to cover some of the increases that were suggested and that were justifiable, he would have had the goodwill of Members of this House because, as was mentioned, a Reserve member in 1927 had more money than a Reserve member is getting in 1966 and surely that is something that needs examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1488" /> There is a sum of £198,000 for allowances for the Permanent Defence Forces by way of increased marriage allowances and children's allowances. There, also, I think much more could be done.  If the Minister had asked for more money, I am sure all Parties would have supported his request for an even greater increase.</P>
    <P>I want to mention the early retiring age of the officers of the Permanent Defence Forces.  This is a matter to which the Minister should give attention and he should not allow himself to be bluffed and misled by other people.  It is deplorable that a person has to retire at 54 or 56 years of age to be thrown on the labour market after having served the nation faithfully for 20 or 30 years.  The officer of today is quite different from the officer of some years back.  Our Army is now mechanised.  The same degree of physical fitness is not required now as was required at one time but our men have experience and to throw them on the scrapheap at 54 or 56 years of age is deplorable.  I am sure every Party in the House would support the Minister in a request for any amount of money to alleviate this particular type of distress.</P>
    <P>Many other items could be covered and probably will be covered before the debate concludes.  When the Estimates for the coming year are introduced, I am quite sure that, unless the Minister has something special to offer, the debate on the Estimate for the Department of Defence will be lively.</P>
    <P>Once again, I would add my voice to what has already been said in connection with the FCA and the Reserve. I appeal to the Minister not to allow this shabby treatment to be meted out to these men: they are worthy of more than that.  I believe that the advisers of this type of hatchet-work should be ignored.  I know that the Minister is a man of outstanding responsibility.  If he further examines this matter, I feel sure he will cast aside the present plans, if they exist, and will do justice to the FCA, the Reserve and the Regular Army.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>This Supplementary Estimate for £1.6 million is just another indication to the House of the dwindling value of money which is due to the overall policy of the Government to which the Minister belongs.  In his opening address, the Minister said he is anxious to save money.  It seems to me that he is going the wrong way about it.  We have a Permanent Defence Force of some 7,000 troops, officers and men, and a Reserve, which is the FCA, of 20,000 men.  These 20,000 men, to my mind, constitute a cheap reserve for the nation to fall back on in a time of emergency.</P>
      <P>The policy of the Minister, as far as one can read it from what one has seen in the newspapers, is to reduce the time service of the Defence Force, and therefore greatly to reduce its efficiency, and very likely to reduce its overall personnel.  It is necessary for any Minister for Defence to have sufficient troops or trained personnel at his disposal so that he may bring into effect a larger army in a time of emergency.  In my view, an entirely wrong policy is being adopted here.  We are asked to vote money for the purpose of stabilising the defence budget as it exists but, in actual fact, to economise as well.  The policy the Minister is now adopting means that he will probably be back again to this House very soon after the main Estimate for more money if he finds he has no Reserve personnel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also the question of the security of the State.  Does the Minister believe that, if he does not get the Reserve forces, if he does not get the recruits in the light of halving the fortnight to one week for training, he will have sufficient military personnel in the country to meet any emergency we may have to face in the light of the Permanent Force which numbers 7,000?  On top of that, we have at the moment a certain number of troops serving overseas.  The Minister mentioned Cyprus.  I am not quite sure if we have troops other than in Cyprus: perhaps he will indicate how many troops we have in Cyprus and how long they are likely to remain there? <Col N="1490" /> Furthermore, as far as I know the position, if we send serving personnel overseas on behalf of the United Nations, the Government who send them pays them the ordinary rates of pay and any extra charges, such as overseas service money, transport, and so on, come out of the United Nations fund.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in this Supplementary Estimate, is looking for more money. True enough, he says that money is due to us by the United Nations but he has not made it quite clear what the United Nations have paid and what we are paying.</P>

      <P>In this administrative policy which the Minister is adopting in relation to the Army, what will the position be in the event of a further demand for troops?  Are we in a position to meet a further demand, with the money and the troops at our disposal and the policy the Minister is carrying out generally? If there is a fracas in any part of the world, it is always to Ireland that they come to look for troops, and that is to our credit.  We have never tried to subjugate anybody else and our overseas personnel have behaved with dignity and distinction wherever they have been.  If he gets no recruits, is the Minister in a position to satisfy another demand to send troops to other places? Quite recently, it very nearly did come, if things had not quietened down in Nigeria.  I am perfectly certain Ireland would have been the first place that would have been looked to for troops because we have associations with that country and a good name there through the distinguished service our missionaries have given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to see the special grant to Red Cross funds, though I think the Government could have been a little bit more generous in that matter. I believe that the money transferred to the Red Cross is immediately transferred overseas to relieve the famine in India and, in fact, the famine conditions which are on the increase in very many parts of the world.  The Minister spoke about saving.  If he <Col N="1491" /> succeeds in saving, which I very much doubt he will be able to do, I suggest that he give a bigger contribution to the Red Cross so that they may be enabled to carry on this necessary work in relation to the relief of famine conditions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think we should allow this opportunity to pass without at least making some comment on the reorganisation scheme applicable to the FCA.  In view of the service and the application shown by the FCA, it would be too bad to let this Estimate pass without comment. In general, up to now, the image of the FCA is not very good.  That is brought about by a number of factors. One of the factors, indeed, is the general appearance and dress.  I am informed that the personnel of the FCA are issued with only one uniform and, having regard to the various duties which the men are called upon to perform, that is too bad at this stage. They have to attend not merely the annual training period but also week-end parades.  They also have to take part in ceremonial parades and different other activities.  Therefore, regardless of the elements, the least they could expect is to be issued with at least a fatigue suit and an extra pair of boots.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The general picture of the FCA, to my mind, is poor.  It is poor because of the general dress.  We all subscribe to the view that the members of the FCA respond to training.  Those men are what may be described as part-time soldiers.  They give their time and their ability without regular pay or reward.  They are called up each year for a period of 14 days' training. The experts, or the alleged experts, in Parkgate Street&mdash;I assume they are well behind the lines&mdash;have drawn up a scheme to reduce the period of training to seven days.  As an ex-Army man, I would be in order in submitting to this House that one could not, with the best will in the world, train a soldier in seven days.  In fact, if one were to take men to a week-end camp, the camp would not be properly set up within a period of seven days. Therefore, one would be in order in <Col N="1492" /> submitting that this is a waste of public money instead of being a help.  The defence of this country is not merely involved but also the general morale of the FCA</P>
    <P>It might be submitted, at this point, that the men in charge in Parkgate Street should stand up for the part-time soldiers and ensure they would get a better deal.  It will be generally admitted that there is, in fact, a duplication of services between the FCA and the local authorities when it comes to matters of defence.  It could be further submitted that not only might the personnel of the FCA be more properly engaged in local defence but that certain members of that unit should be permitted to take over some of the exercises which the local authorities are now deemed to be performing.</P>
    <P>The men of the FCA are men with a certain background and training.  If we are not prepared to push them into the limelight and keep them there, then we will not be able to call upon them in time of need.  Does anyone think for a moment that any young man at this stage, will respond to a call for seven days' training and merely be given his usual pay and a fee of £2 at the end? Rather, I should have thought that the period of training would be extended, that, in fact, not merely 14 days but 21 days, or, indeed, a month, would be stipulated and that not merely would a grant of £6 be paid at the end of the period of training but double that amount.  If we are to keep a unit, such as the FCA, in this country at all, we are certainly not going about our business in the right way by so drastically interfering with the terms of service of that particular unit.</P>
    <P>I referred in general to the poor picture and the poor image presented by the FCA.  What will it be like in two years' time?  We will lose personnel wholesale because any young fellow in the country at the present time could be far better engaged, even in a part-time activity.  Indeed, for that matter, he could earn real money rather than spend a few weekends and an annual fortnight for no return, no reward.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1493" /> I want to bring home to the Minister the desirability of not merely dressing the troops properly but, in general, presenting to the country and to the public a better image of the FCA. Indeed, I may be at fault myself, as an ex-Army man, in this matter.  I am sure many of my colleagues on all sides of the House will agree that we in this House are fairly fully occupied but if we want to promote a better relationship between the public and the FCA, then we should take a more active interest in the affairs of the FCA.  In the last analysis, if we were unfortunate enough to have to call on this unit, then we would recognise its worth but we are not going about making the unit a very worthy force.</P>
    <P>I referred to the fact that one would not be able to establish camp in seven days, never mind to set up house, to issue equipment, to fall in the troops, to exercise them, to give them a run through small arms drill and even to take them out on the range.  There is time and money involved in this unit. One can waste time and waste money by being too penurious.  That is what could be said and inferred by any member of the Defence Force regarding the scheme which emanated from Parkgate Street.  I have a suspicion that it did not come from Army officers conversant with the facts but from Merrion Street.  It is time the claws of Merrion Street were clipped in regard to defence and now is the time to do it when a vital matter like the training, equipping and general presentation of the FCA is involved.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to extend the debate but I shall pitch into it at a later stage when I brief myself properly on the various items.  I shall go through the subheads item by item until we see the worth of this halfbaked scheme which has just issued.</P>

      <P>In dealing with a Supplementary Estimate, we recognise that it is not always possible to keep within the rules of order and some Deputies have gone outside what is provided for in the Estimate.  Because of that, I shall have to make some <Col N="1494" /> effort to reply to their points as well as deal with the general points raised in the debate.  I do not object to the ruling of the Chair and I make no adverse criticism of any Deputy who went beyond what is provided for in what we are asking the House to vote because I realise it is not easy to keep within the rules of order on a matter like this.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick raised the question of retired pay for officers and men who retired prior to November, 1961.  Retired pay, as the Deputy knows, is related to the pay at the time of retirement and therefore a person who retires after a pay increase has been granted gets a higher rate of retired pay or pension than a person of the same rank and service who retired before the pay increase.  This is common to all State services and is not peculiar to the Army.  From time to time those low pensions based on earlier pay rates are increased, usually as a result of Budget arrangements.  I cannot improve on that situation. Whatever increases may come will come as a result of the budgetary situation as it emerges each year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of the FCA was raised by practically every Deputy who spoke and we had the history of the foundation of the FCA from Deputy Fitzpatrick.  The FCA is a voluntary organisation, part of the Defence Forces of the State, the Second Line Reserve, and it is very valuable to the State.  It is a force that the Government certainly want to see maintained. I, for one, think that the FCA is a force we should have: it is the only method by which this State, with its small population and limited resources, can provide a worthwhile supplement to the Permanent Defence Forces.  I would like, and so would the Government, to increase the strength of the Permanent Defence Forces and bring them up to the standard at which we could with certainty say that, in the event of any emergency, we could fully depend upon them to render a good account of themselves, whether the emergency arose out of world events or otherwise. <Col N="1495" /> The same applies to the FCA, but the Minister and the Department and the Army heads must fit the pattern of our Defence Forces to the amount of money made available by this House in the Estimates each year on behalf of the people.</P>
    <P>We cannot afford a very expensive defence force.  We have to tax the people to provide the funds to pay the Defence Forces, maintain and equip them and pay the appropriate grants and emoluments to the first and second lines of the Reserve.</P>
    <P>Alongside the FCA, we have the Civil Defence Force which is a purely voluntary service, rendered without any pay or reward.  Some Deputies suggested that if the FCA were not wanted, they could spend their time with the Civil Defence force, or the Red Cross or some other organisation of this kind.  These are purely voluntary organisations in which no payment is expected and in which the people render the voluntary service so essential to the wellbeing of the country.</P>
    <P>The decision was taken to call the FCA for one week only.  There is a question down by Deputy Cosgrave for answer tomorrow as to what is the amount saved by this.  I think I shall wait until tomorrow to answer.  If the Deputy were here, I would ask his permission to answer it now.  Every item in the Estimate for the Defence Forces was scrutinised by the officers of the Department and by myself to see where we could make savings in the 1966-67 Estimate so as to bring it into line with the budgetary situation when the budget comes to be finally fixed in a short time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister will agree that a gratuity of 40/-a year is an insult.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>Many things may be regarded as insults.  It could be said that even the gratuities payable to the First Line Reserve are an insult.  We must do the best we can in the circumstances in which we find ourselves this year and deal with the situation confronting us and the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1496" /> There was no decision taken not to call out the First Line Reserve.  We certainly looked at the matter and I decided that we would call the First Line Reserve this year.  It is true that the First Line Reserve was not called out some years ago, in 1949, I think.  I do not know what the reasons were for not doing so at that time.  The decision has been taken not to call the FCA for two weeks, but for one, this year and that has been done for economy reasons.  We shall not be able to make a real comparison between the various heads in the Estimates for the Defence Forces as to where saving is being when published in the Book of Esti-effected until we see the main Estimate mates.  Then people will be in a better position to judge whether the decision was a justifiable one or not.</P>
    <P>I think I have dealt fairly fully with the question of the calling-up of the FCA.  The same of course applies to An Slua Muiri.  They will be called up for one week also.  The decision to call the two components up for one week instead of two does not involve any new principle because the regulations provide for seven days' training as well as 14.</P>
    <P>Either Deputy Fitzpatrick or Deputy Esmonde asked if we had entered into any commitments with the United Nations to keep our Defence Forces up to a certain figure.  We have not entered into any such commitment, either as to the Permanent or the Reserve force.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully raised the question of the Cyprus operation and wished to know if it has been decided to continue this operation.  That is a decision for the Government to make.  The present mandate expires in March next and no decision has yet been taken as to whether we will continue or replace the battalion at present serving in Cyprus or not.  In answer to Deputy Esmonde, there are in Cyprus at the moment 45 officers and 475 other ranks, making a total of 520.  There are 12 officers serving with the United Nations as Observers in Kashmir and ten officers with the United Nations as Supervisors in the Lebanon.</P>
    <P>The question of uniforms was also raised but this is a matter more for <Col N="1497" /> the main Estimate.  In 1964 a new style uniform was approved for the Permanent Defence Forces and also for the FCA.  The clothing provided for the FCA consists of a blouse, trousers, overcoat, leggings and boots and only differs from the Defence Forces uniform in regard to the blouse.  I do not think at this stage that there will be any further change in the uniform for the FCA.  In my estimation, the uniform looks well and nobody need be ashamed of the material, the cut or the make of the uniform.  The men whom I have seen wearing it look fairly well and are smart and well-trained.  The men in the FCA do not depend on the week's or fortnight's annual training as they are being trained every time they attend a parade.  There is a good deal in what Deputy Tully said in regard to those who join for a short time and then leave.  I would much prefer to see continuous attendance by members and have the FCA made into an efficient and effective force, even if it had to be reduced in numbers.</P>
    <P>The question of soldiers who are under age was also raised.  This is something which gives trouble to the Army authorities and myself.  It is true, as Deputy Fitzpatrick said, that they can get clearance from their parents or guardians and join before they are 18, but if they are sent overseas on service and if anything happens to them, it can create difficulties. We would prefer to have soldiers coming in at 18 rather than under 18.</P>
    <P>The ration allowance paid to soldiers living out of barracks was raised by Deputy Tully who considered that it was not sufficient.  You could not deal with this matter in isolation.  You would have to consider it in relation to all the other elements which go to make up a soldier's emoluments.  There is quite a sizeable list of other allowances which a soldier gets, apart from the ration allowance, and one would have to take the whole thing into consideration.</P>
    <P>This Supplementary Estimate provides for an increase in pay to the Permanent Defence Forces of £1,687,000. <Col N="1498" /> This increase is over and above the amount already provided for in relation to 1965-66. The increase will have to be carried into next year also and that is one of the problems with which the Minister for Defence was confronted in the preparation of the 1966-67 Estimate.  He had to look at the whole Estimate.  He had to ensure that the money was provided to pay the Permanent Defence Force and keep them provisioned.  He also had to see where effective economies could be made that would not, for the time being, interfere with the maintenance of a defence force of a standard capable of carrying out efficiently the functions for which the Defence Forces were established.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £95,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1966, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Education (including Institutions of Science and Art), for certain Miscellaneous Educational and Cultural Services and sundry Grants-in-Aid.</P>
      <P>Additional sums are required as follows in certain subheads of the Office of the Minister:&mdash;A. 1&mdash;Salaries, wages and allowances, £88,000; A. 3&mdash;Post Office Services, £5,200; A. 4&mdash;Higher Education, £940; B. 2&mdash;OECD Survey, £910; F. 3&mdash;Grants to Colleges providing courses in Irish, £2,800; G. 1&mdash; Royal Irish Academy, £500; and G. 2 &mdash;Royal Irish Academy of Music, £5,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The additional sums being provided in this Supplementary Estimate are required for the following purposes. Provision is made in the Supplementary Estimate for payment of increases in salary with effect from 1 January, 1964.  The increases result from awards made under the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme for civil servants and other salary negotiations.  The <Col N="1499" /> awards were not made in time to allow of the appropriate provision being made in the original Estimate for 1965-66.</P>
    <P>Higher postal rates were introduced as from 1st June, 1964.  Consequently, the amount payable by this Department will be greater than originally estimated.  The additional sum required is £5,200.</P>
    <P>Only a token provision of £10 was made in the original estimate for 1965-66 as it was anticipated that the Commission on Higher Education might be in a position to complete its work by the end of the financial year 1964-65.  The Commission did not, however, find it possible to make such progress with the preparation of its report that only minimal expenses would fall to be met under Subhead A 4 of the Vote in the financial year 1965-66. The actual amount required for the subhead is now estimated at £950.</P>
    <P>It was anticipated that the Report on the survey of long term needs for educational resources conducted in conjunction with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development might have been submitted early in 1965, and only a token provision of £10 was made in the estimates for the financial year 1965-66.  It was not found feasible to complete and publish the report, however, until December, 1965, and accordingly a provision of £910 is necessary to meet the additional expenditure required.</P>
    <P>In regard to subhead F. 3&mdash;Grants to Colleges providing courses in Irish &mdash;the extra sum required reflects the continuing increase in the number of students attending courses in the colleges in recent years.  The extent of the increases has been such as to cause excesses in the original estimates for the subhead in recent years.  The original estimate for 1964-65 was put at £44,000 but expenditure was some £47,000.  For the current financial year provision was made for an estimated expenditure of £47,500 but it is now anticipated that an additional sum of £2,800 will be required.  This upsurge in the numbers attending the courses is very gratifying and I feel confident that it will be maintained.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1500" /> The number of students in respect of whom grants were paid increased from 8,726 in the financial year 1961-62 to 12,650 in 1965-66, while the number of colleges providing courses in Irish increased from 20 in 1959 to 36 in 1965.</P>
    <P>The additional amount of £500 required in the case of subhead G1 is to enable the Royal Irish Academy to continue work on the Dictionary of Old Irish.  The Academy plans to bring the dictionary to completion in seven years, including the current year.</P>
    <P>A special sum of £1,000 was provided for this purpose in the original Estimate for 1965-66.  The original estimate of cost for the year furnished by the Academy was found to be too low, however.  An additional sum of £500 is now requested.  I am fully satisfied that this extra sum is required</P>
    <P>An additional sum of £5,000 is required for the Royal Irish Academy of Music.  £2,000 of this sum is needed to meet increased operating costs and to provide for a superannuation payment to the widow of a Professor who died recently.  The balance of £3,000 is being provided as a further State contribution towards a reduction of the capital debt incurred on the renovation of the Academy's premises.</P>
    <P>During 1960-61 a complete renovation of the Academy's premises was carried out.  This included rebuilding portion of the brick work, laying new floors, renewing ceilings and internal walls and refacing the front of the three houses.  The cost was £27,500. Some further additional work of the same nature in the following two years brought the total figure of expenditure on the work to £30,000.  The Governors launched a public appeal for funds to liquidate this debt and have succeeded in collecting over £6,000 for the purpose.</P>
    <P>The original provision made in the Estimate for 1965-66 for a grant-in-aid to the Royal Irish Academy of Music was £17,500, that is, £10,000 towards current expenses and £7,500 towards a reduction in the capital debt.  Having regard to all the circumstances and the excellent work which the Academy is doing for music teaching, I recommend to the House that <Col N="1501" /> the additional sum of £5,000 being provided in this Supplementary Estimate should be granted.</P>
    <P>In regard to Vote No. 29&mdash;Primary Education&mdash;this Supplementary Estimate is required to meet increases in salaries to teachers in classification and capitation national schools and in grants to conductors of capitation national schools arising since the date of the preparation of the original Estimate for 1965-6.</P>
    <P>Following an award made at arbitration new salary scales were introduced for national teachers as from 1st December, 1964.  A similar increase was made from the same date in the rates of grants to the managers of national schools paid on a capitation basis.  The additional cost of the new salary scales and capitation grants for the period from 1st December, 1964 to 31st March, 1966 is estimated to be £1,400,000.  A further sum of £45,000 is needed to meet increased superannuation awards resulting from the increase in salaries allowed from 1st December, 1964 in accordance with the arbitration award to which I have already referred.</P>
    <P>Provision is also made for increased grants to the training colleges towards the cost of revised salary scales from 1st December, 1964 to the training college professors.</P>
    <P>In regard to Vote No. 30&mdash;Secondary Education&mdash;in addition to the current estimate of £5,515,400 for Secondary Education, it is necessary to provide a further £340,000 to meet additional expenditure under two subheads.</P>
    <P>Following an agreed recommendation of the Conciliation Council for Secondary Teachers increased scales of incremental salary were introduced on 3rd March, 1965, with retrospective effect to 1st November, 1964.  At this time the Estimate for 1965-66 had already been prepared on the basis of the old salary scales and it is now necessary to provide £250,000 to meet the additional cost of these increases in the current financial year.</P>
    <P>The erection of three new comprehensive schools was commenced during the year at Carraroe, Cootehill and Shannon Airport.  Progress with the <Col N="1502" /> erection of the schools has been greater than anticipated and an additional provision of £90,000 is required in the subhead.</P>
    <P>On Vote No. 31&mdash;Vocational Education&mdash;the educational schemes drawn up annually by vocational education committees are financed mainly from local rates and from State grants to the committees. The amount which may be contributed by the local rating authorities is limited, as a maximum, to the product of 24d per £ of valuation.  The balance of the current expenditure of vocational education committees is met for the most part from the State grant from Subhead A of this Vote.</P>
    <P>In 1965-66 the amount provided in the Subhead, namely £3,145,780, was made up of two elements, firstly, annual grants which are paid by the Department to all committees in proportion to the amount contributed from the local rates and, secondly, special grants which are paid by the Department to certain committees whose resources would not otherwise be sufficient to finance their approved schemes.</P>
    <P>Due largely to the increased expenditure on salaries resulting in the main from the Scheme of Conciliation and Arbitration for Vocational Teachers, it has been found necessary to increase the total amount of the special grants for 1965-66 in the case of a number of vocational education committees. The extra amount involved is £260,000 and this is the sum now requested in the Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, I want to refer to the provision for these moneys in relation to the OECD survey.  The Minister for Education introduced the Estimate for the Department of Education completely in Irish and referred to the necessity to set up an advisory body on educational matters.  He pointed to the necessity for such a body stating that up to this, in Irish education, the various interests in education had spoken each with their own minds on the matters that concerned themselves solely.  He said there was a need to co-ordinate the various aspects of education and, to <Col N="1503" /> that end, it was desirable that this type of body be set up.</P>
      <P>The Minister went on to say that one of the matters that might be referred to this body was the question of larger schools.  The question of post-primary education, equally so, would require attention.  His statement also referred to the factors in regard to small schools: there seemed to be a volume of evidence which would indicate that the rate of progress in the small schools was less than that in the larger schools.  The Minister made the statement that the pupils in these schools were one to two years behind in educational attainment.  At that stage, I asked him about that assertion as I felt the Minister could hardly make it without justification. Of course, at that time, this document, <i>Investment in Education,</i> was not available to us: I am inclined to think it was available to the Department. What the Minister said on that occasion was, I think, based largely on this document which was not available to Deputies at that time but the Department had the advantage of it and of knowing the type of study that had been carried out on it.</P>
      <P>When he came back here in July, 1965, the Minister again referred to the smaller schools.  He had spoken, in the first instance, on 16th June, 1965, and he referred to the matter again on 27th July, 1965.  When the Minister came back here in July, he said he had been giving some further thought to this matter and he had decided what should happen in the matter of the bigger schools versus the smaller schools.  I quote the Minister as reported at column 1968 of Volume 217, No. 11, of the Official Report of 21st July, 1965:</P>
      <P>I made a reference when introducing the Estimate to the necessity to have another look at the problem of small national schools and since then I have been having another look at the problem.  It seems to me quite clear that we have to take a very firm decision on this matter of the small schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When introducing the Estimate for his Department on 16th June, 1965, he <Col N="1504" /> did not seem to be as definite as he was on 21st July, 1965.  He spoke of this dáil chomhairlitheach which he was going to set up and pointed out the advantages that would flow from it.  I quote from the Minister's speech as reported at column 969 of the Official Report, Volume 216, No. 7, of Wednesday, 16th June, 1965:</P>
    <P>Leasú amháin, abair, den chuid atá i mo cheann is ea an riachtanas, mar mheasaim, atá le scoileanna is mó ná roimhe seo a thógháil as seo amach, má tá an t-aos óg uile le leas iomlán a bhaint as éifeacht ár gcuid múinteoirí.</P>
    <P>This is one of the matters which the Minister, as I understand it, would submit to a body which would act in an advisory capacity so far as the Department of Education and the Minister for Education are concerned.</P>
    <P>He took some consolation from the fact that some Deputies from this side of the House had at some time expressed an opinion on this matter of the larger schools.  As I see it now, it is all based on this document <i>Investment in Education,</i> which document, from start to finish, is concerned with an economic survey by a team engaged on that work.  Certain assumpions were made which were founded on the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> and other assumptions were made which were population and population trends.  As far as I can gather from this document, the whole thinking is based on the premise that good economics dictate that small schools are not justified.</P>
    <P>There is here in this document also a view which is not substantiated, or is not capable of being fully substantiated, that the rate of progress in the smaller school is less or that the ability of the pupils is less and that that is due solely to the fact that the school is small.  The survey, in so far as it goes, does make reference to the fact that other factors could enter into it.  I am sure the Minister would agree that there are many other factors that could enter into it.</P>
    <P>These are things that properly ought to have been submitted by the Minister to such a team and the Minister should have followed up what he <Col N="1505" /> said here in introducing his Estimate by setting up this type of body to which these matters would be referred.  Instead, the Minister was able to come back here inside a few weeks to say that he had had another look at this and had taken a firm decision.  If the only conclusion that could be reached by a team that worked for three years on a survey of Irish education and manpower policy in the 1970s was that there ought to be set up in the Department of Education a section which would inquire into these problems and which would require skilled personnel to conduct the type of survey that would be regarded as useful, needful and required in terms of education in 1970, one would have imagined that that is what the Minister would have done.  In the meantime what has happened is that we have had the Minister, at the end of this statement, telling us that they have made certain firm decisions on this matter.</P>
    <P>One of the things that this survey clearly set out was that in a matter like this the thing to be done was to put it to the test in a pilot area before it was introduced on either a regional or a national basis.  Why did not the Minister for Education do such a thing as that?  Why not follow up what he felt was useful, the setting up of a body which would give guidance to the Department of Education in this matter?  The answer seems to be that the Minister decided that the smaller school, whether one-teacher or two-teacher, at the present time, was not able to fulfil its function in so far as giving the type of education that was desirable.</P>
    <P>It has been said here on many occasions that education is a continuing process, that there is no system of education which cannot be continued. Again, as the survey team from time to time during its studies points out, there are other factors entering into the winning of scholarships or the regression or progression of pupils through any system of education. I want to put it on record in regard to the smaller schools that one thing that is being lost sight of in this document is the fact that education is a social service; education is the <Col N="1506" /> highest social service that any country can render to its citizens.  It is not an economic service and could never be classed as an economic service.  It is a social service based on community need.  If we ever lose sight of the fact that economics should not decide what is socially desirable we will lose a great deal of the values with which we are associated.</P>
    <P>The basis of the argument against the smaller school has been this question of scholarship attainment.  I wonder did it ever occur to people who might have a certain uninformed approach to the matter, to consider the basis on which the rural schools of this country have been working in regard to scholarships?  The Minister is aware that post-primary education has not been provided in this country and that one of the basic needs, as indicated in this study, was that we should have post-primary facilities if we were going to have the type of manpower available in 1970 which was the aim within the terms of reference of this body. Consider that in conjunction with the position in regard to primary schools and their operation.  Take a primary school located in an area where there is not a secondary or vocational school, perhaps, within ten or 15 miles of it. The inducement that was offered for post-primary study for pupils in such a primary school was that a scholarship of £40 would be awarded for day attendance at a secondary or vocational school or £60 if resident at a secondary or vocational school.  Does the Minister think that that was the kind of inducement that would represent to the pupils in these schools a golden opportunity?  If they accepted scholarships it would mean that they would have to cycle ten or 15 miles to a secondary or vocational school.</P>
    <P>The survey says that of a sample of 12 per cent of schools, it was found that in one-third of the schools, there was not this interest in scholarship examinations.  The position in regard to scholarship examinations is that they may provide a useful type of test but they certainly do not give a hallmark in so far as the ability of a student or his educational attainment are concerned. We are all well aware that <Col N="1507" /> circumstances may prevent even a very clever student from obtaining a scholarship by reason of the system of examinations.  There are a variety of reasons that might interfere with the attainment of a scholarship.</P>
    <P>It is stated in this document that a certain number of pupils would finish primary education without attaining even the primary certificate.  Dealing with the question of the ability of the small school, they cited regression in the smaller school.</P>
    <P>I am sure it would strike Deputies and the Minister that there are many causes for regression in the smaller schools.  A pupil may become ill and be absent from school for three, four or five months.  A pupil who has to come two miles to school may find the weather so inclement that he does not come.  When his attendances are calculated at the end of the year it may be found that he has an attendance of less than 100 days instead of the 190 days that he is supposed to have as a minimum.  In the interests of such a pupil, is he to be catapulted forward or given the opportunity of finding his feet before proceeding to a higher grade?</P>
    <P>These are all questions which should have been submitted.  If they had been put before such a body as the Minister had in mind when he introduced his Estimate, a study could have been made of these problems.</P>
    <P>There is equally this question of the pupils of the primary schools.  We are told that some of them do not obtain their primary certificates and there must be a reason for this.  There are always reasons for everything but sometimes they do not seem to make sense, but that does not render them value-less. If the advancement of pupils and the standard they attain were the yardstick by which to measure this problem, and accepting for the moment that the smaller school would not compare favourably with the larger one, there are other facets we might examine in this connection.  We might look across at Britain in which there is a system that we might regard as a considerable advance on ours, <Col N="1508" /> believing that the opportunities available to primary schoolchildren there are a great deal better than our own and that the larger schools there make for better educated children.</P>
    <P>In England, however, no less than here, we have the position that the standard of examinations is not infallible. I refer the Minister to the leading article in last Sunday's <i>Sunday Express</i> in which it is pointed out that examinations are no criteria in regard to what is attained in various parts of the country.  There is the extraordinary statement with regard to the GCE examination that, while one board was passing less than 60 per cent of candidates in English literature, another was passing more than 70 per cent. In chemistry, one board passed 80 per cent of the candidates but another board failed 55 per cent.  The question is asked: is it seriously suggested that boys and girls in Newcastle are more intelligent than those in Exeter?  The unequivocal answer is: Of course not. The differences result simply because the pupils are being judged on different standards and it is suggested that the Ministry of Education should make a thorough study of what is happening.</P>
    <P>A similar study is called for here.  I was very pleased when the Minister referred to this matter.  I was not aware of this document <i>Investment in Education,</i> but the Minister mentioned in his opening statement the setting up here of an advisory body.  There are a number of points I might take from this document and quote.  I might quote them just as effectively in favour of my arguments as the Minister might quote them against the argument.  If the Minister wants to quote them from the economic point of view, I am entitled equally to assert that economics is not the be-all and the end-all in relation to education.  This document recognises that.  There is a social problem involved.  The Minister would be very well advised, even at this stage, to set up such a body, the type of body I thought he envisaged in relation to educational development.  Such a body, having the services of the type of officers implied, would be able to give the Minister the kind of guide <Col N="1509" /> lines on which to proceed; but again with the proviso that, particularly with regard to innovations, this would be done on a pilot basis and the results tested before anything is introduced on either a regional or a national basis.</P>
    <P>If the assumptions that certain things will happen by 1970 are correct&mdash;in the past week the threat of a strike across the way in transport caused us some sould searching and such an eventuality could upset our calculations here completely&mdash;and assuming that it is correct that the population will increase and the present trend be reversed before 1970, and that there will be this flight from the land, then pupils will need to be schooled for an urban environment rather than a rural one.  There are other assumptions one might make.  I am sure everybody would be horrified were I to suggest, on the basis of these assumptions, that we ought to forget the Gaeltacht and forget the west and let them vanish. But the Gaeltacht and the west are no greater or no less a social problem than the problem we are now discussing. I am sure, however, that everyone would be horrified if assumptions were taken to such a point; yet they would be just as valid as some of the conclusions being inferred as a result of this document.</P>
    <P>This document is a very valuable document inasmuch as it provides data on which we can make an examination of the problems confronting us so far as education is concerned.  However, all this data is framed in the background of the problem which will arise by 1970 with regard to manpower. If our plans come to fruition, we will find ourselves with the kind of economy in which the semi-skilled labourer will no longer be available. We should then provide the type of post-primary education to make such labour available.  We all recognise the value of post-primary education.  For my part, post-primary education cannot be provided a moment too soon for all our children who would like to avail of it.  I do not think it is a valid conclusion, however, to say that, in order to provide this post-primary education and the kind of economy which will give us this type of education, <Col N="1510" /> we must deal with the primary sector first before we deal with the post-primary.</P>
    <P>I thought the Minister would proceed along the line of increasing post-primary facilities.  I thought the comprehensive schools, and the Minister's predecessor must have been aware of the trend when he adverted to these schools, were to be designed to serve a particular need.  We now discover that this may be double-edged.  During the week on television we had the question of a new school in Cavan which will be drawing its pupils from a radius of ten or 15 miles.  That radius will result in turning three-teacher schools into two-teacher schools and two-teacher schools into one-teacher schools in that area because the pupils will be taken into this new school at 12 years of age.  Nobody objects to this if it is for the advancement of the pupils but I do not think we can draw fallibly or infallibly from the data which is here, or infer the things which might or would seem to be inferred from it, without having regard to the other factors which could militate against the smaller school.</P>
    <P>To speak, for instance, of children not completing their education at the age of 12 years&mdash;again anybody who is a rural Deputy will know that nobody will send out a four-year-old to walk two miles to school, and certainly not if the day is wet.  You will get them to go out at that age in towns and villages.  But you have children in the primary schools going at the age of six.  Mind you, when this House of the Oireachtas passed the School Attendance Act of 1926&mdash; which has never been amended or never thought to have been worthy of amendment&mdash;it laid down the school attendance age for children at six to 14 years.  That has been a yardstick by which people have judged their obligation in this matter, particularly in the more remote rural areas.  One of the factors in regard to this Act, of which I would like to remind Deputies and which now will need to be changed, is that no child under the age of ten years need attend school in inclement weather if the distance of his home from the school is more than <Col N="1511" /> two miles.  If he happens to be three miles or over from the primary school, he need not go on any day, in so far as the School Attendance Act is concerned.</P>
    <P>I mention these things as some of the factors which are concerned in this problem of the smaller schools, the rural schools; and the rural schools amount to approximately three-quarters of the schools of the country. There are something over 3,000 schools in this country&mdash;between the one and two-teacher schools&mdash;and the extraordinary thing about it is that 90 per cent of the one and two-teacher schools are located in rural areas. Therefore, it is quite a shock to think that the Minister had formally decided without inquiring, that the days of the one and two-teacher schools were coming to an end.  Again, of course, economics entered into it.  The survey team, in dealing with this matter, pointed out that so many schools would fall to be either remodelled or replaced.  There is a fond hope in the countryside&mdash;and it is one the Minister is obliged to say something about&mdash; that where the smaller school would be wiped out of existence&mdash;the one and two-teacher schools&mdash;the teachers concerned would be available, with their pupils, in a central school.  If I can read this document properly and if I am drawing the conclusions which this team seem to draw from it, they would seem to suggest that if you were able to do away with these schools within a measurable period&mdash;which they measure at ten to 16 years&mdash;you would make a supply of teachers available from these schools which could be drafted elsewhere to reduce the larger classes to the optimum of 40 pupils which was recommended by the Commission on Education.</P>
    <P>Of course, the Department of Education has its regulations in regard to the staffing of schools and there is no question that these regulations will be changed.  So, the position is you can certainly&mdash;if this were followed to a logical conclusion &mdash; make these teachers available for service elsewhere. Again, using the economic argument, that would be a justifiable <Col N="1512" /> thing to do.  But I want to remind the Minister&mdash;and this cannot be over-emphasised&mdash;we are dealing with a social problem; we are dealing with a community problem, when we speak about education.  This House, each year, has voted a subsidy to make available a social service, an amenity, for the people by making it available to CIE, a body which is subsidised to the tune of £2 million a year, to ensure that the community in the far-flung portions of the country will not be left without the services which are available to those in the more populous regions.  There are many other types of social services provided by funds of this House to enable the community to have this type of equality on the basis of its being a community need. Surely it is just as valid to say we can put up a similar type of subsidy for education in so far as rural areas are concerned?</P>
    <P>A case can be made for closing the one-teacher schools, but I think there can be no blanket case for closing these schools.  I think the Minister mentioned that the majority of one-teacher schools are connected with the religious minority in this country.  Of course, if we except them from the type of treatment which is to fall to the other ones, then education, in so far as the minority is concerned, would be safeguarded because the vast majority of the small schools are the schools of the religious minority in the country. As such, I think they are entitled to educational facilities of the type they require.  Indeed, all during this study we come across the same phraseology &mdash;that the small school is uneconomic; the closure of the small school can be based on economics.  The whole basis for this policy is economics but there are no conclusions reached, at least there are sets of conclusions arrived at, but no recommendations have been made except one to the Minister that he would set up within his Department a body which would study development in so far as education is concerned.</P>
    <P>Questions have also been asked in regard to one of the things concerned in education and that is the schools side by side.  This is something which <Col N="1513" /> has existed in this country&mdash;boys' and girls' schools have existed side by side in separate rooms.  Again, I believe this is a matter on which a blanket decision could not be taken.  This is a question that should have been referred to such a body as was recommended in this study.</P>
    <P>The projections made in this document very clearly point to savings that could be made, savings from the point of view of teachers' salaries, and from the point of view of the capital involved in the provision of smaller schools.  I do not know if the Minister has made any estimate of the extra cost involved in providing extra facilities elsewhere, and in this connection what estimate has he made in regard to transport costs?  Up to the present, primary education, or national education, was free in this country.  Under the old education boards long ago, and under the Commissioners of National Education, provision was made whereby fees could be charged to pupils, but that day has passed, and education has been freely available to every child who wanted to avail of it. Does the Minister intend that if the small schools are closed, education will still be free to the pupils, or are the pupils to contribute something?</P>
    <P>Again, these are matters which I believe should have been put to such a body as the one I have referred to, a body that would have been able to call, not only on the officials of the Department of Education but on the various educational interests concerned, and on the parents who have the first right to be consulted in any changes in regard to education.  They are the people who have the primary right in this matter, and no one can take from them their primary right of deciding what is best for them in their circumstances.</P>
    <P>I feel that the Minister has moved too far, too fast.  In regard to one-teacher schools, I said that a case might be made for the abolition of a particular one-teacher school, but equally I believe a case might be made for keeping a particular one-teacher school open in another part of the country.  Nothing should be done in <Col N="1514" /> regard to closing one-teacher schools without the local inquiry that is necessary to get a firm decision on a social service and a community need.</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear in regard to two-teacher schools as they have existed, that this question should have been put to such a body as was envisaged when the Minister spoke on 16th June, and no two-teacher school should be closed without a local public inquiry.  No Minister for Education and no Department of Education should attempt to close a two-teacher school without having a local public inquiry conducted, at which the parents can be advised on the arguments, social versus economic.  That is a fundamental principle so far as the people are concerned in regard to this question of two-teacher schools. The Minister would have been fairer to himself, fairer to the Department, and fairer to the interest of the pupils, if this matter had been submitted along with the other matters which fell for review in this document.</P>
    <P>One cannot go through this document without reaching the conclusion that the terms in which university education are studied in it seem to suggest that our university entrants are entering with low standards, and they infer that there is a waste of the professorial and tutorial staff in dealing with people of a pass standard rather than the type of pupil who might be available to them if education were directed in such a fashion that those people who are now availing of university education&mdash;in the main, at their own expense, although university education is subsidised like other systems of education&mdash;were screened, and that some of them became, to use the phraseology used in this book, part of a small labour force, or the type of semi-skilled labour force that will be needed in the 1970s.</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear from this side of the House, therefore, that a case might be made for the closing of a one-teacher school, but no closing should take place without an inquiry being carried out.  There should be no closing of a two-teacher school without <Col N="1515" /> a local inquiry at which the parents could be advised on the question of the economic versus the social effects that the closing of schools might have. It is very important that there should be this type of investigation rather than a blanket policy and a blanket decision to do these things without an investigation to justify them.</P>
    <P>I had hoped that in the period since the Minister made his statement here last June, he would have set up such a body, and that he would have referred this matter which seemed to be first and foremost in his mind at that time to them for their advice.  Of course the Minister had the advantage of having this document which Deputies did not have at that time.  The thinking in this document is completely economic. I do not blame the team for that. I commend them for the work they did on it.  It is solid and well-founded so far as economics are concerned.  It draws economic conclusions, but it did not go into any other considerations except economic considerations.  It does admit that there are factors other than economic factors, but it was not concerned with them.</P>
    <P>They stated again and again in the document that they were concerned with the economic end of this increase. Therefore, all their thinking has been in terms of economics and not of education. They have been concerned with the economics of education but not with education.  They are two distinct things.  I believe the Minister is being less than fair to himself when he turns around at this stage and decides that economics is to be the guiding line.  I could understand the Minister for Finance deciding that economics in education was a line he would like to pursue.</P>
    <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Offences Against the State Bill, 1966: First Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I have moved the <Col N="1516" /> First Stage of this Bill, the Long Title of which is:</P>
      <P>Bill entitled an Act to repeal the Offences Against the State Acts, 1939 and 1940.</P>
      <P>It is generally accepted that a Government elected by the people should be prepared to undertake the obligation of protecting the rights of the citizens. The laws which they enact must, therefore, be founded on the principle of individual liberty.  This is the bedrock of democracy, or government by the consent of the governed.</P>
      <P>The Offences Against the State Acts of 1939 and 1940, which we seek to repeal by this Bill, are a clear example of how the bedrock of freedom may be shattered and the edifice of law, built at a cost of great effort and the tremendous exertions of civilised man over the centuries, may be levelled, dismantled and taken away for so long as it suits the Government of the day. These Acts, for so long as they are on the Statute Book, remain as a lurking background threat of imprisonment without charge at the Government's pleasure and a denial of the accepted right of trial by jury.  They are, therefore, undemocratic, false and bad and are inherently offensive to our concept of a free society.  These are the Acts&mdash; the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, and the amending Act of 1940&mdash; which the Labour Party Bill would repeal.  We seek, in this Bill, to restore to the citizens that of which they stand deprived &mdash; liberty guaranteed by statute.  I commend to our narcissistic rulers in the consideration of this Bill the words of the Book of Leviticus:</P>
      <P>And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year and proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto the inhabitants thereof; it shall be a Jubilee unto you; and ye shall return every man unto his possession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In general, the Acts created a new series of offences which are made crimes.  These crimes are by law required to be tried in secrecy before special criminal courts.  The right of trial by jury is abolished, the accused is presumed guilty in most instances. The accused is required to testify whether he desires to do so or not. <Col N="1517" /> Upon conviction, the accused is not allowed to appeal to a higher court unless the special criminal court gives its consent.  In actual practice, there is no appeal.  Part II of the Act, as passed in 1940, is even more drastic because it allows the Government to imprison a person without ever holding a trial or making a charge.</P>
    <P>It should initially be pointed out that the Act is not effective except when it is declared so by a Proclamation of the Government.  Civil liberties are suspended by the Government's proclamation.  No limitations are placed on the Government's right to issue the proclamation suspending civil liberty.  Any time they wish to do so, they may publish the proclamation, suspend all personal rights and deprive our criminal courts of all jurisdiction.  Part II of the Act contains some of the most radical provisions in the law, as it contravenes and nullifies every recognised principle of our criminal law as established by our courts.  This Part of the Act out-lines numerous things which are made crimes but fails utterly to describe with clarity the acts or things forbidden.</P>
    <P>It is an elementary rule of criminal law in any country where Anglo-Saxon law prevails&mdash;and this includes Ireland&mdash;that a law which labels an act criminal must satisfactorily describe in some detail the exact acts outlawed.  The rule is such because the law recognises that fairness requires that a person be appraised in clear and concise language of the acts forbidden so that he can avoid them or, if accused of committing an act, answer the charge against him.  The courts in this country, as well as England and America where Anglo-Saxon law prevails, have consistently set aside and avoided convictions based on vague and indefinite criminal laws.  In effect, the courts have ruled that a criminal law must be clear and definite so as to enable the general public to be in a position to avoid breaking it.</P>
    <P>Part II of the Offences against the State Act, 1939, fails to specify the acts forbidden as criminal, and as a result almost anyone is liable to be <Col N="1518" /> picked up off the street and charged with a violation of some part of the Act though, on reading the section allegedly violated, he is unable to learn what exactly is forbidden by the law. For instance, under section 7 of Part II of the 1939 Act, anyone who &ldquo;prevents or obstructs&rdquo; the &ldquo;carrying on of the Government&rdquo; is guilty of a felony and subject to seven years' imprisonment. One may well ask what is an act of prevention and obstruction as referred to in the law.  Would, for instance, the refusal to pay part of one's income tax be deemed such an act?  Who is to say, except apparently the Government or a Minister of the Government?</P>
    <P>Section 9 of the 1939 Act makes it a crime to &ldquo;encourage any person&rdquo; in Government service &ldquo;to be negligent&rdquo;. We are not told what the section means by &ldquo;negligent&rdquo;.  Obviously the word means many things to many people and as long as the act prohibited is not defined, we must only guess at its meaning.  Those sections, like so many others in the Offences against the State Act, expose a person to any type of charge any Government official or police officer cares to make. In fact, the Act allows the Government official to say what the alleged crime is. This vitiates the entire Irish system of justice.  The Government is allowed to act as a press censor under section 10 of Part II of the Act which violates our basic right to a free and uncontrolled press.  Even Cromwell in Puritan England did not get away with that without protest and exposure by Milton.</P>
    <P>Specifically, section 10 forbids the printing and publication of any document which is incriminating, whatever that means, any document which is treasonable, whatever that means and any document which is seditious, whatever that means.  None of those terms is defined in the Act and so we are all at the mercy of the personal interpretation of this section entertained by the Garda who happens to jail us. The great danger in all of those provisions lies in the fact that we are not appraised of what is unlawful and so we have nothing to guide our conduct.</P>
    <P>The Offences Against the State Act rejects any principles of criminal law <Col N="1519" /> and procedure.  Perhaps the most glaring violation is found in the provisions of the Act which state, in the very first instance, that the accused shall be presumed guilty and shall be required to prove his innocence.  Our own courts, as the courts in England and America, have always followed the principle that an accused is, in the eyes of the law, presumed innocent and the State must carry the burden of proving the accused to be guilty.  Unfortunately, the Offences Against the State Act reverses this process and the accused is in many instances presumed guilty and the State is not required to prove his guilt.  As an example of this section 15 of Part II of the Act provides:</P>
    <P>In any prosecution under this section the burden of the proof that any act was authorised under this section shall lie on the person prosecuted.</P>
    <P>Section 19 contains a similar provision and states that:</P>
    <P>The charge itself carries with it a presumption of guilt on the part of the accused.</P>
    <P>The presumption of innocence in a criminal case, how I cannot say, has been universally accepted in all jurisdictions following Anglo-Saxon law. This includes Ireland, Great Britain, Canada, the United States and many other Western nations.</P>
    <P>As if motivated by fear of the people, the organisation of groups of people is forbidden by Part III of the Offences Against the State Act.  The Act provides that the Government can ban any organisation which in its opinion is unlawful.  The ban is effected by a suppression order.  All this is done, of course, by the personal edict of a State official without a trial or hearing.  Moreover, section 19 provides:</P>
    <P>A suppression order shall be conclusive evidence for all purposes that the organisation to which it relates is an unlawful organisation within the meaning of the Act.</P>
    <P>As you can see, this section is very sweeping.  In effect, a Government <Col N="1520" /> official can ban and suppress any organisation he personally declares to be unlawful.  Not only is the organisation found unlawful without a hearing or trial, but any member of such an organisation is automatically guilty of a crime and subject to two years' imprisonment and heavy fines under section 2.</P>
    <P>All property of the unlawful organisation, both real and personal, is forfeited to the State under section 22. In addition, a chief superintendent of the Garda can if satisfied that a building is being used or has been used in any way for the purposes, direct or indirect, of an unlawful organisation, close any such building.  The closing is automatic and no hearing or trial is held beforehand.  Although opinion and hearsay evidence is not allowed in our criminal courts an exception is made to this rule by the Offences Against the State Act.  An example of this is found in section 26 of Part IV of the Act which allows the chief superintendent of the Garda to testify that an outlawed publication was published by an accused despite the fact that the police officer has no personal knowledge of the subject.  Although our criminal courts and Constitution forbid the use of testimony based on rumour and suspicion in criminal prosecutions, an exception is made in the Offences Against the State Act and an accused can be convicted solely on the basis of hearsay and rumour testified to by one who, admittedly, has no personal knowledge of the commission of the alleged crime.</P>
    <P>Public meetings of citizens can also be banned by a chief superintendent of the Garda merely because he is of the opinion that the meeting will aid or encourage an unlawful organisation. Anyone attending such a meeting can be imprisoned and fined.  The Act also permits any member of the Garda to arrest without warrant.  In this respect the Offences Against the State Act militates against our criminal laws which ordinarily require that an arrest must be based upon a warrant. Penalties under the Offences Against the State Act are extremely severe and go beyond the normal criminal penalties of imprisonment <Col N="1521" /> and fine.  Section 34 provides that accused persons convicted by a special criminal court who are in the employment of the State shall forfeit their office, employment, place or emolument and the same shall forthwith become and be vacant.  This means that a person, in addition to fine and imprisonment, will also suffer loss of his job and pension rights.  The section also deprives the accused of the right to public employment for a period of seven years in the future.</P>
    <P>One of the most significant departures from our system of criminal law is found in Part V of the Offences Against the State Act.  This part creates what are called special criminal courts. Those special criminal courts deprive our regular criminal courts of all jurisdiction in criminal matters.  The special criminal courts are, in fact, military boards which try non-military persons.  All proceedings are held in secret.  No appeals are allowed except where the court gives its consent. All special criminal court judges are subject to removal at will, unlike judges in our regular criminal courts. In practice, all special criminal judges are high ranking military officers.  The Government, in effect, is the accuser, prosecutor and judge of the accused, like Hempenstall.  Under such a system justice is neither sought nor applied. The courts merely provide the Government with a device to arrest, jail and impoverish persons who may disagree with the Government's policy.</P>
    <P>By an ingenious device the Act allows the Government to deprive the accused of a jury trial in our established criminal courts.  This may be done any time the Government is satisfied that the ordinary courts are inadequate to secure the effective administration of justice.  Even the Dáil is helpless; it cannot invalidate any action of the Government under Part V.  In other words, the people have no recourse in the case of Governmental abuse and tyranny.  As a matter of fact, Part V of the Act is so sweeping that it allows the special criminal courts to try any offence under any particular enactment.  This means that the Government's special criminal courts are <Col N="1522" /> not limited to the trial of offences and crimes listed in the Offences Against the State Act, but may try any other type of criminal offence.</P>
    <P>This, in effect, allows the Government to try anyone in a special criminal court for any offence whatsoever, thus depriving the accused of his basic right to a trial before a jury and judge.  The Act is so sweeping in this regard that the Government is allowed to divest and deprive our regular criminal courts of all criminal jurisdiction.  The Government is granted complete control over the special criminal courts.  This is made clear by a reading of Part V of the Act.  Each court is required to have at least three members.  Each member can be removed at will by the Government.</P>
    <P>The average layman thinks of a judge as a barrister or solicitor of several years' experience but the Act provides that a judge of the Special Criminal Court may be &ldquo;an officer of the Defence Forces not below the rank of Commandant.&rdquo;  As a practical matter, all judges of the Special Criminal Courts have been high-ranking military officers, none of whom has had legal, judicial education or experience.  The judges of each Special Criminal Court are unfettered as to procedure, as section 41 of the Act allows each court to adopt its own procedure without restriction.  Criminal procedure is as vital to an accused in a criminal case as the substantive law and yet the special criminal courts can employ whatever procedure they see fit, without limitation of any kind.</P>
    <P>Section 41 (4) acknowledges that the Special Criminal Courts need not employ &ldquo;the practices or procedures applicable to the trial of a person on indictment in the Central Criminal Court....&rdquo;  The military overtones of the whole system of special criminal courts are emphasised by section 50 which provides for &ldquo;military custody of any particular individual so sentenced.&rdquo; The right of appeal is basic to all systems of justice but despite this a person convicted by the Government's Special Criminal Courts has no right of appeal except when permission to appeal is granted by the court itself <Col N="1523" /> as provided in section 44.  The realities of the situation make it obvious that a special criminal court will hardly consent to an appeal concerning errors allegedly made by itself.</P>
    <P>It is elementary in our law that an accused can also question and contest the jurisdiction of the court which seeks to try him.  The question of jurisdiction can be raised in a number of ways.  However, an accused who questions the jurisdiction of a special criminal court is guilty of criminal contempt of court under section 51 of the Act and can be imprisoned for this crime.</P>
    <P>A person in custody has no rights under section 52 of the Offences Against the State Act.  He must answer all questions and explain his whereabouts to the police.  If he fails to do so &ldquo;he shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to imprisonment....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>An accused, in effect, is deprived of his right to remain silent, a right commonly referred to at times as the right against self-incrimination.  The right to remain silent and not assist the accuser in his charges against you has been recognised in Anglo-Saxon law for centuries.  The rule is codified in the American Constitution in the Fifth Amendment:</P>
    <P>No person ... shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself...</P>
    <P>The Offences Against the State Act gives the Government broad powers of detention.  These provisions are found in Part 2 of the Act which was passed in 1940.  Under Part 2 the powers of detention come into operation any time the Government decides to use the powers it has.  It has only to issue a proclamation under section 3. Part 2 is the most radical of all sections of the Act and permits detention without a trial of any kind.  Detention as used in this section is, of course, imprisonment.  The Government is given special powers of arrest and detention.  A citizen may be arrested and detained any time a &ldquo;Minister of State&rdquo; desires the arrest and detention. <Col N="1524" /> The Minister need only feel that the person to be placed in detention is dangerous to the public peace or to the security of the State.  It does not say, I emphasise, that the Minister for Justice should be the person to determine whether a citizen will be detained, interned or imprisoned; any Minister will do.</P>

      <P>Even the Minister for Transport and Power who is now pushing the use of Irish.  The detained person is hauled off to prison where he stays until released.  The release of prisoners is dealt with in section 6 which reads as follows:</P>
      <P>A Minister of State may by writing under his hand,&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>it is ironical how apt some of these legal phrases are such as &ldquo;writing under his hand&rdquo;; we know that a lot of things that happen are underhand, God knows, in relation to the law and especially in relation to this Act&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>if and whenever he so thinks proper, order the release of any person who is for the time being detained under this part of this Act, and thereupon such person shall forthwith be released from such detention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no limit to the length of the imprisonment under this Part of the Act.  The Government decides who is to be imprisoned&mdash;a Minister decides; one individual may decide&mdash;and where he is to be imprisoned and for how long, without trial.  The accused need not be charged with any crime and need not be brought before a judge or magistrate.  The Government alone decides what the punishment shall be. There is no charge, no hearing, no trial. There is just the imprisonment and the punishment.  Putting the matter simply, a person can be picked up off the street or from within his home and imprisoned without charge or trial for any period the Government desires. He has no recourse to the courts or to the law.  Under the Act he has no rights whatever.  There are no court proceedings.  The only obligation of the Government under the Act is to <Col N="1525" /> furnish the Dáil with a list of persons imprisoned every six months.</P>
    <P>Thus does the Government operate under the Offences Against the State Act.  A reading of the Act makes it clear that as citizens we can enjoy our civil liberties only when the Government wishes us to.  Our freedom is ours only so long as the Government wishes us to enjoy it.  Our property is ours to use only so long as the Government sees fit.</P>
    <P>The Commission of Human Rights in its consideration of the submissions of the Irish Government relative to a case brought before it concerning internment without trial and in which the Government sought to defend its actions by citing Article 5 of the Convention of Human Rights pointed out:</P>
    <P>...that the construction advocated by the Government would open the door wide to arrest and detention on suspicion without the requirement of bringing to trial&mdash;which is contrary to the whole spirit of the Convention.</P>
    <P>This quotation is from page 23 of the book <i>Human Rights in Europe</i>, being an account of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms signed in Rome on 4th November, 1950, of the protocol thereto and of the machinery created thereby: <i>The European Commission of Human Rights and the European Court of Human Rights</i> by A. H. Robertson, BCL (Oxon), SJD, Harvard, published by the Manchester University Press.</P>
    <P>The Act of 1939 was found by the High Court to be repugnant to the Constitution in that a Minister of State in signing a warrant under section 55, was not only acting judicially but was purporting to administer justice, which was unconstitutional.  The Act, in Part 6, did not respect the citizen's right to personal liberty as expressed by the Constitution.  This was remedied to the apparent satisfaction of the Supreme Court by the amending Act of 1940 which had the effect of permitting detention and imprisonment without trial in any case in which a Minister of State was of opinion that this was necessary.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1526" /> Whatever may be argued about the niceties of legal phraseology in this connection, there is no doubt that this power to inflict imprisonment, exercisable at the whim of even the most obscure and irresponsible Minister of Government, is a gross denial of the natural law of human liberty and dignity and is dangerous in the extreme.</P>
    <P>Part II of the Act of 1940 which enables the Government to intern persons without trial of any kind was considered by the Court of Human Rights.  In the Court's judgment of July 1st, 1961, it was found that the Offences Against the State Act was contrary to the provisions of Article 5 of the Convention of Human Rights.  Only by a frenzied straining to the uttermost of the words &ldquo;in time of war or other emergency threatening the nation&rdquo; did the Government on that occasion barely escape the opprobrium of the Court of Human Rights at Strasbourg and then only by a majority opinion of eight votes to six.  Finally, I should like to make this brief reference to the employment of the cumbersome legal steamroller to deal with strikers picketing outside the Dáil some time ago&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. B. Lenihan) Brian (Snr.) Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>May I begin by saying that I want to put it on record that Deputy Dunne's statement as to what these Acts provide is to a very large extent without foundation?  I cannot undertake here to correct all the <Col N="1528" /> errors which we have just heard, but I should like to make it clear, particularly in respect of the rights of Dáil Éireann in the matter, that we have in Part V a specific right to annual the proclamation bringing Part V into force.  Deputy Dunne sought to say that Part V gave the Government arbitrary or unlimited power in this respect without any safeguard whatever. This was the main theme running through his remarks.  I would refer Deputy Dunne to Part V, section 35, subsection (5), in which it is stated:</P>
      <P>It shall be lawful for Dáil Éireann, at any time while this Part of this Act is in force, to pass a resolution annulling the Proclamation by virtue of which this Part of this Act is then in force, and thereupon such Proclamation shall be annulled and this Part of this Act shall cease to be in force,</P>
      <P>So we have there the supremacy of this House in regard to whether or not a proclamation made by the Government of the day bringing Part V into force is to remain an effective proclamation or not.  That very fact emphasises the basic supremacy of Dáil Éireann in this matter and is sufficient to indicate that Part V of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, cannot remain in force unless it has the democratic sanction of this House.</P>
      <P>Another point made by Deputy Dunne was in regard to his statement that a man was liable to be convicted on hearsay evidence relating to a document. That is absurd.  He also suggested that in some way the accused person's right of appeal was negatived under the terms of Part V of the Act. This allegation is without foundation. The Deputy said that the appeal may be brought only with the consent of the Special Criminal Court.  This is false.  Section 44 of the Act allows an appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal, if he obtains a certificate of appeal.  The Appeal Court is the ultimate arbitrator whenever the Special Criminal Court refuses a certificate of appeal to an accused person.  I would refer the Deputy to section 4 which rebuts his statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not had an opportunity in the <Col N="1529" /> short space available while Deputy Dunne was speaking, to go through his various allegations in detail but there were these three specific errors and in particular, the two very fundamental ones in which he sought to imply that the democratic right of Parliament to interfere with the Government was frustrated by Part V of the 1939 Act and I have shown that that is not so because the supremacy of Dáil Éireann is spelled out in section 35.  There is also the other point in regard to the supremacy of the Court of Appeal being the final arbiter as to whether the person has a right of appeal.</P>
    <P>I may say that the acceptance of this Bill is entirely out of the question as far as the Government are concerned. Any idea that the 1939 Act as a whole is, in any sense, emergency legislation, or was ever intended as such, is totally without foundation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not what Mr. de Valera said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to that.  One Part of the Act, namely, Part V, can be said to be in a certain sense emergency legislation, and so can the 1940 Act which replaced Part VI of the 1939 Act.  However, these what I may call emergency provisions of the Act can be brought into force only by special proclamation of the Government when certain specified abnormal conditions obtain and they are not in force at present.  There are incorporated as well the essential safeguards as to the supremacy of Dáil Éireann and the Court of Criminal Appeal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In saying that Part V of the 1939 Act is not in force at present, I should like to remove any possibility of a misunderstanding either inside or outside the House.  When I say that Part V is not in force at present, I am only stating what the present position is and I do not want it to be thought that I am implying that there is no likelihood of its being brought into force again. Unfortunately there are grounds for fearing that some or all of these provisions may need to be enforced and I think I should make it clear to all concerned that the Government will not tolerate any renewed resort to force or <Col N="1530" /> violence but will take all measures necessary to preserve the peace.</P>
    <P>The provisions now in operation, that is, the first four Parts of the 1939 Act, are and were designed to be part of the ordinary permanent legislation of the State.  I refer the House to the speech of the then Taoiseach reported in Volume 74, column 1382:</P>
    <P>If you look at the Bill you will see that it is composed, I might say, of two main parts.  One part is a consolidation of what might be called ordinary legislation such as would be available in any country under normal and peaceful conditions for the protection of the State.</P>
    <P>Here, of course, he was referring to Parts I to IV.  Similarly, the Minister of the day, referring to Parts I to IV, said, at column 1290:</P>
    <P>Those provisions are provisions that you will find in any civilised State.  They are precautions that are taken by any civilised State to protect itself.</P>

      <P>Whatever views the sponsors of the Bill may have on Part V&mdash;and I can well understand that Deputies on the Opposition benches without the responsibility of Government and without the same sources of information may feel tempted to say that we can do without Part V&mdash;whatever views, I say, they may have on this, I simply cannot understand their attitude in proposing to repeal the entire Act, except on the assumption that they have not read it.  In effect, they are asking that Parliament should now declare that it is no longer an offence to commit treason, and that anybody may raise a private army, engage in military exercises and by force of arms or violence obstruct, threaten or intimidate Parliament, the Government and the courts.  They are asking that Parliament should declare that people may organise to overthrow the Constitution by force and may get up on a public platform and incite their listeners to defy the law and use violence to attain their ends.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That a Select Committee of Dáil Éireann consisting of fifteen members of whom five shall be a quorum, be appointed, with power to send for persons, papers and records&mdash;(1) to examine methods of recruitment to all grades of service in CIE; (2) to examine the manner in which contracts are sought and placed by the company; (3) to review its working methods and practice; (4) to examine its advertising methods; (5) to review its income and expenditure generally; and (6) to make recommendations on these matters and such other matters related to public transport <Col N="1535" /> services and their operation as the Committee think fit.</P>
    <P>I want to state at the very outset that I move this motion in what I consider to be the public interest and as a result of widespread dissatisfaction expressed to me and to others verbally and quite frequently expressed through the medium of letters to the public press. I shall have to refer to some recent statements by persons closely associated with the administrative side of Córas Iompair Éireann and, in order to get the picture into proper perspective, it will be necessary, in my view, to engage in some historical research with regard to this company.</P>
    <P>It dates from 1944 when the then Dublin transport company was amalgamated with the Great Southern Railway Company and CIE was born.  At that time, the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, the present Taoiseach, had great plans for CIE and great hope, if not well-founded hope, that it would supply the people of this country with means of transport for passengers and goods at fares that would be equitable and reasonable. The present day picture falls very far short of what were then the Taoiseach's very firmly expressed expectations.</P>
    <P>Let me say at this stage that I should like this discussion, within the time at our disposal, to be conducted as far as possible from an atmosphere of acrimony or any suggestion that political prejudice or political advantage has played any significant part in the failure to achieve the expectations then expressed.  I want to make that very clear at the outset because in my view&mdash;and this is the reason for the motion&mdash;it is time that this House, through a Select Committee, considered calmly, fairly and as equitably as possible the whole of this situation, with a view to ascertaining what can be done to help in a situation that is economically somewhat appalling and where Parliament is annually voting money by way of subsidy to this company.</P>
    <P>Having made those general remarks, I should like now to refer to the matters <Col N="1536" /> for which I seek an inquiry.  First, I have asked that the methods of recruitment to all grades of the service of CIE be examined.  I am not prepared at this stage to make any specific allegation in any way but I do hear from time to time remarks made that recruitment to the various grades of service in CIE leaves something to be desired and, as I have said on a previous occasion in relation to semi-State companies of this kind, once there are rumours and once people are talking in terms of rumour without specific proof, an obligation is placed on those responsible to examine the situation and have the rumours dispelled once and for all, because&mdash;let me say this straight away&mdash;I do not accept the allegations that I have heard made from time to time, that one has no chance of a job in Córas Iompair Éireann or in certain other State companies unless one is a card-carrying member of the Fianna Fáil Party.  I do not accept that but, perhaps, because of some isolated instance here and there, a rumour grows and gathers such force that it brings the whole method of recruitment into disrepute, and quite wrongly probably in the majority of cases.  This is the kind of thing that I want to have examined under that heading.</P>
    <P>One hears from time to time about CIE contracts.  I want to have examined the manner in which the contracts are sought and placed by the company.  I am told, for instance, that CIE will quote a figure for a contract for the transport of agricultural or other produce and when one bargains with them, they will come down substantially below that figure, very often to onehalf. That appears to me to be a business method not calculated to attract support for the company.</P>
    <P>If I might at this stage talk about fares in relation to certain parts of the country, I am told that the fare for Cavan town-Dublin, return, is substantially lower than the fare Monaghan-Dublin, which is virtually the same distance. The reason I am given for that is that Cavan has got private bus services which can compete with CIE and that Monaghan does not appear to have the same kind of private services. <Col N="1537" /> If that be so, it is time the matter should be remedied in some way.  I am not going to suggest how.  That is something that could be examined by a Select Committee such as I suggest.</P>
    <P>In relation to this question of private buses and public buses, I understand that CIE will offer to provide a bus on charter in areas where there are private buses at lower rates than those operating in areas where there are no private buses.  This gives rise to a very bad anomaly resulting from monopoly, where a company can proceed, on the people's money, to compete with the people themselves in private enterprise. It is something that should be examined. While it might be suggested, of course, in reply to a Parliamentary Question, that it is a matter of day-to-day administration of the company, nevertheless, it is something that can be discussed and dealt with on a motion such as this.  To review its working methods and practice is, of course, related really to No. 2. No. 4, then, is to examine its advertising methods.  This is important, I think, because CIE does advertise considerably and pays a considerable amount of money for advertising.  In return, of course, they would have a certain revenue from advertising by carrying certain posters for certain enterprises on their buses and trains.  However, the manner in which they advertise themselves is, in my opinion, something that requires very careful examination.</P>
    <P>Some time ago, not so very long ago, I asked a question about the placing of a contract for scrolls in Irish to show the names of intermediate stations on buses.  I was told that the contract for the printing of these scrolls had been placed in England and the work was being done in England.  It was incredible; I did not believe it.  The matter was pressed upon me and I asked a question.  The Minister very fairly told me that that was the situation, initially at any rate. He also added that there were not any Irish companies anxious to take on the particular job.  I do not know how accurate that was.  The Minister must rely on the information given to him by the company, but I thought I saw <Col N="1538" /> afterwards something to the effect that the printing trade were not quite in agreement with that statement as a statement of fact.</P>
    <P>I asked the cost of producing these particular scrolls in England&mdash;I do not know where exactly the contract was placed&mdash;and the Minister was able once more to shelter behind the phrase that this was a day-to-day administrative function and he had no responsibility in the matter.  I am told that the cost, whether initially or not, whether it is up to date or not I do not know, is somewhere between £25,000 and £35,000.  I hope that is not an accurate figure.  I am giving the figure I was given and nobody will be more pleased than I shall be if the Minister is able to reduce it and give us the correct version.  I hope it will appear somewhere in the Board's report and accounts.</P>
    <P>To review its income and expenditure generally is something that speaks for itself.  Then, the Committee having examined these five matters and such other matters as may relate to them, can make recommendations on these matters and such other matters related to public transport services and their operation, as the Committee think fit. Having regard to the history of the company and all that has happened in relation to it in the past 22 years, the Committee should, I think, be a Committee of this House to examine in detail, and particularly in the light of our responsibility for it.</P>
    <P>The company was first set up in 1944.  I have referred already to the high hopes and expectations then expressed by the present Taoiseach for its future.  How far his hopes and expectations have been defeated by the reality of the present day is shown more clearly by giving the relevant extracts from the statement he made at that time.  I quote from volume 94 of the Official Report, column 636; the Taoiseach, amongst other things, asked:</P>
    <P>Are we to take no account of the fact that the Dublin transport company by more efficient management succeeded in replacing obsolete equipment for fresh equipment and <Col N="1539" /> not merely repaid loans but reduced capital liability while, at the same time, giving cheaper fares to the public as well as improving conditions of employment for the workers?</P>
    <P>There he was so obviously impressed by the excellent work being done at that time by the Dublin transport company that he felt that the scope of that kind of work could be broadened. He went on to say:</P>
    <P>What was done in the case of the Dublin transport company can be done for transport as a whole in this country.</P>
    <P>That was in Dáil Éireann in September, 1944.  At another part of the same debate the Taoiseach told the House:</P>
    <P>It is obvious that Dublin transport facilities will be substantially extended and cheapened.  Cheap fares to housing districts and to suburban dwellings generally will be the function of the new company.</P>
    <P>In May of that year he spoke in Carlow.  For the reproduction of his speech, I am indebted to the <i>Sunday Independent</i> of 9th January, 1966. Here is what he said in Carlow:</P>
    <P>The Government proposes the establishment of a national transport organisation operating under Government supervision, charged with the reorganisation of transport services so as to ensure that cheap and adequate facilities will be available in every area.  The new company will be constituted from the amalgamation of the Great Southern Railways and the Dublin United Tramways Company.  The economies resulting from the scheme will mean cheaper rates for transport, better services, and will give transport workers better security of employment and remuneration, which they can never have unless such a reorganisation is effected. The Government believes that a really efficient national transport organisation with up-to-date equipment can give private traders a better and cheaper service than they give themselves in normal circumstances.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1540" /> That hope and that policy have not resulted in what was promised.  It is true that in the course of the debate on the formation of CIE, the Taoiseach said&mdash;he was then Minister for Industry and Commerce, of course&mdash; that they were setting their target high and it was for the purpose of getting a very high standard that this high target was being set.  In addition, he said that, perhaps in ten or 12 years' time, which would be about 1956, or so, they could have another look at it and see what had happened.  They had another look and, in 1958, we had another Transport Bill which showed quite clearly that, whether because of operational inefficiency or because of administrative difficulties, or because of wrong policies being applied, the company was certainly in trouble.</P>
    <P>One of the ways adopted at that time in order to get out of trouble was to take up more branch lines.  Some of them had been taken up further back, but the intention was to take up more and more branch lines.  It is not necessary for me to go into again all the discussion about that at that time. They were taken away in Monaghan, Donegal, Cavan, West Cork, and some lines in County Mayo.  In passing, I think it is interesting to note that the Derry and Lough Swilly Transport Company&mdash;if that is the right name for them&mdash;pay a dividend as a transport company.  The same cannot be said&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Without wanting to interrupt the Deputy&mdash;he has just interested me&mdash;he has made a very long string from 1944 to 1958 but there were two Bills under the Coalition Government in between.  The Deputy ought to read the Minister's comments at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister will read them.  As I said at the very beginning, I do not want any political acrimony brought into this at all.  I want this thing considered on its merits and I am sure the Minister will accept that spirit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>It was simply that I felt the Deputy really ought to comment on the 1950 Bill, at least.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I can do that at a later stage.  If there is anything I feel I have to concede, I will be the first to do so.  I am talking about the whole history of this.  At any rate, it does not seem to have worked.</P>
      <P>Then, in 1958, we were told CIE was to get a subsidy for five years and, after that, would have to pay its own way.  So far, all that being a fact, we are still subsidising them somewhere to the tune of £2 million per annum.  That is a lot of money. It is a sum this Parliament votes and, therefore, I say it is something in which this Parliament should take an interest at this stage because we cannot go on from year to year listening to complaints daily, weekly, monthly, or even yearly, about the operation of this company and what is happening in it without having some exact details.  Apart from the annual report&mdash;and not everybody understands an annual report, not everybody is able to get a breakdown of the figures given under the various headings and, accordingly, cannot understand it&mdash;a Parliamentary Question asking about certain things is virtually useless.  I think it is time the Minister departed from the principle which he seems to have made universal now by saying he has no function in the matter.  I think he has a function, because the Government have an overriding supervision.  The Taoiseach said that in 1954 through the relevant Minister.</P>
      <P>I suppose the most up-to-date account we have of the company's workings is the expression by the General Manager of CIE, Mr. Frank Lemass, when he said&mdash;and I quote from <i>The Irish Press</i> of 4th January, 1966.  Mr. Lemass was speaking to a conference in Dublin and was complaining, I think, about demands being made by workers at the time for wage increases.  He said:</P>
      <P>It was now a question of survival for the company.  Unless there was some change of attitude, unless the winds of sanity blew very strongly through the trade unions, the prospects were very serious.</P>
      <P>He continued:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1542" /> We are in a straitjacket: we cannot increase rates and fares and we cannot get more subsidy.  We are losing more than the subsidy we are getting, so that we have no money; we are absolutely broke.</P>
    <P>Sad words, but frank words, very frank indeed in that particular speech and quite different from the security of employment envisaged in 1944.</P>
    <P>Even though CIE has got a monopoly here, it has, during certain times of the year&mdash;particularly during the wheat and beet seasons&mdash;to give plates to private hauliers to do the work for it, or assist it in the work.  That, in itself, is something into which an inquiry should be made; with regard to how a monopoly works in that way.</P>
    <P>To sum up at this stage&mdash;in 1958 we gave CIE five years to pay; they were unable to pay their way at the end of that time and they are now running on a subsidy from us of round about £2 million per annum, a subsidy which the General Manager says they are losing, losing more than the subsidy in every year.  It is in circumstances such as those that I think it would be to the advantage of the House, of the country and, very probably, to the advantage of the company itself that a Select Committee such as I propose be set up to make the relevant inquiries and make constructive recommendations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The time has come for us to get the problems of CIE into proper national perspective.  The time has more than come for people like ourselves, who have a very deep responsibility in the matter, to get an opportunity of making a frank and factual review of the situation.  The proposal by Deputy Lindsay is an eminently reasonable one if we keep matters on a proper keel.  We have got to face the responsibility of realising that for a very large number of people the national transport company, under the name of CIE, is not only a means of livelihood but virtually a way of <Col N="1543" /> life, because we are well aware of the fact that many of the employees of CIE are now running into the second and, indeed in some cases, into the third generation.  Therefore, we are facing a very complex problem when one views it in the light of statements made so recently by the General Manager of the company.</P>
      <P>It is true that CIE was born in hope and, as I have said previously in this House, it faltered in many degradations but it is time for us to make a factual review as to what can be done to save it or what can be done, if it must go, to supply alternatives by way of municipal transport, national transport or rail transport.  I feel it is time we faced, with some sincerity, the responsibilities owed to the Irish people as well as the employees of CIE in this whole problem.  We have undoubtedly been the agency through which a tremendous volume of public money has been expended in bolstering this service.  We have seen a spectacle of haphazard effort to improve, and some catastrophic mistakes made.  Surely we are big enough to realise that this problem is so vital that we should take as broad a view, and have as full an investigation, as possible.  A Select Committee like this could bring an air of investigation and sincere interest that might lead to the finding of something practical in the line of a solution to the problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>In referring to this document, <i>Investment in Education,</i> I have already said&mdash;and it cannot be said too often&mdash;that running right through the document is this question of economics.  It is stated in Chapter 9:</P>
      <P>An economic study of this nature would preferably be conducted in cost/benefit terms... the paucity of relevant Irish data compels us to place the major emphasis on the cost aspect of the problem.</P>
      <P>I think I have referred sufficiently to the fact that this is an economic document of great value, and containing a great deal of statistics which will be available to the Minister and the Department to carry out a further study which will be necessary in arriving at decisions which ought to be taken by the Minister in the light of the advice tendered to him by such an advisory body.</P>
      <P>It is significant that this survey team mentioned in the introduction to this document:</P>
      <P>In this Survey we have tried to keep before our minds at all times the character and purpose of education and that the term &ldquo;educational system&rdquo; has little meaning if it is considered apart from the human needs which it is there to serve.  Our limited task, however, was the prosaic one of examining these resources which are indispensable to any system of education.</P>
      <P>It is significant also that in this document which is of vast importance, the only formal recommendation which is made is one which comes at the end of the document where it advises the creation of educational development units within the Department of Education.  It also states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We would finally like to emphasise <Col N="1545" /> the need for experimental testing of new educational strategies on a local and pilot basis before such strategies are introduced on a regional or national basis.</P>
    <P>Incidentally I do not like the word &ldquo;strategies&rdquo;.  However, whether it has any deeper significance than just the use of the word, I am not prepared to say at this stage.  Somehow the word &ldquo;strategies&rdquo; seems to envisage something more than a mere statement of fact.</P>
    <P>One of the things which the survey team did refer to is the fact that a number of young children leave school at an early age.  This is something that should be corrected.  The Minister indicated last year that he intends to do something about it by raising the school-leaving age.  On a comparative basis, we would seem to be not alone in this respect, and in a survey which was issued by the Council for Cultural Co-operation of the Council of Europe dealing with school systems, we find that the countries of Europe in presenting statistics on education recorded the fact that in Europe children are leaving school at an early age.  Perhaps in some cases they are leaving earlier than our own children, but at least they are leaving just as early.</P>
    <P>In France, we are told that at the end of 1960-61, 236,000 pupils left school at 13 years of age, or 28.1 per cent of their age group; and 119,000 pupils left school at 14 years, or 14.8 per cent of their age group.  That type of projection is to be found more or less in the various other countries which have produced statistics of that kind.  Even in a country like Germany, we are given statistics of school-leavers who completed the final class of compulsory general education and did not continue their studies in general education, and we are told that 406,900 children left in 1960; and when we come to 1963 we find that figure has grown to 537,600.  If these figures are compared with population in the corresponding age group we find that 406,900 of 610,000 in the age group left school in 1960, and 537,600 of 776,600 in the age group left school in 1963.  We have not the same proportions but we have the same problem. <Col N="1546" /> When we compare the statistics for Belgium and Austria, we find that we are not alone in this problem which is not unassociated with the question of economics so far as individuals are concerned.</P>
    <P>One of the things that determine the age at which children leave school, particularly in the rural areas, apart from the fact that post-primary facilities are not readily available to them, is the question of economics so far as the individual families are concerned. This is a tendency which we should all like to see corrected and redressed.  The whole trend of this document lays far more emphasis on economic statistics than on the social end of the problem.  Therefore, I regret that the Minister did not set up the body to which he referred when he introduced his Estimate, and did not submit these problems to that type of body which could gather information from all sources in regard to problems not only in the economic field but also in the social field.</P>
    <P>I want to dwell on the social and community aims in regard to education. Undoubtedly, Deputies will address themselves to this problem from the point of view of the districts in which they live.  People from the cities and the larger areas will attempt to defend this policy as being desirable &mdash;that it will provide opportunities for an advance in education.  I agree, and have said so before, that anything the Minister can do to reduce the size of classes in national schools, particularly in the national schools in cities where teachers are dealing with large numbers of pupils, will be commendable.</P>
    <P>I am glad to congratulate the Minister on the steps he is now taking to make more teachers available for this purpose but we should not like to see this done in a blanket way at the expense of the rural community.  We should not have this applied without, I suggest, adequate study.  The Minister may say this is an alternative.  I am sure he is well aware of the problems which might form the basis of a very necessary study in this matter.  Therefore, I shall conclude by expressing regret that the Minister has not seen <Col N="1547" /> fit to have an inquiry instituted into the position in regard to one-teacher schools before abolishing them in blanket fashion.  In regard to two-teacher schools, I think no steps should be taken to rid an area of such a school without a local inquiry to ensure that the parents would have an opportunity in conjunction with the other educational interests involved&mdash;the State and the managers&mdash;of determining whether it is wise in the interests of the pupils and the community to consider the economic factors and allow them to take precedence over social and community ones.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>By far the larger portion of the moneys required in this Supplementary Estimate is for payment of increased salaries to members of the Departmental staff and to teachers engaged in the various spheres of education.  We in the Labour Party believe, particularly in cases of lower paid civil servants and teachers, that these are justified.  In many cases, they are long overdue.  We have no hesitation in agreeing with the Minister that the money is required.  Indeed, according to the report which came into our hands recently, five-sixths of the cost of national school education goes in the payment of teachers' salaries.  Our teachers, on the whole, are doing a very excellent job for our children. There can be no doubt about that. They are the people to whom we commit our children for a large portion of their young lives and they contribute an important part in forming the characters of the men and women of the future.  Their vocation calls for a very high degree of dedication to duty. Accordingly, only the best we can offer them by way of reward for their work and of training facilities to fit them for it should be theirs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We in the Labour Party&mdash;I think the Minister for Education agrees with us&mdash;feel that with present trends in education we should look forward to a system of teacher-training that would allow for a ready transfer of teachers throughout the various branches of education.  In that context, it will be necessary to provide for national teachers, in addition to the training <Col N="1548" /> given in training colleges, the opportunity of having university degrees. This opinion has been expressed by the Minister and we could not agree with him more.  The sooner the training of our teachers is organised along these lines the better it will be for education in this country.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult, and I could say perhaps it would be presumptuous, for us to speak on education without reference to the very excellent report placed in our hands recently.  I am referring, of course, to <i>Investment in Education.</i> While, as Deputy Jones pointed out, it refers to education more from the economic viewpoint than the social aspect, it has placed a wealth of information at our disposal which was not available heretofore.  We commend those responsible for the report in the strongest possible terms.  They have done an excellent job.  We are grateful to them and say that the money spent on the compilation of the report was well spent.</P>
    <P>I refer to it now in the first instance because, in trying to project the number of teachers that will be available in the period 1970 to 1971, it arrives at the conclusion that under present training facilities we should have 15,100 teachers in our national schools by that year.  The report goes on to tell us that following an examination of the data available and taking into consideration all relevant factors, we will require 16,000 teachers to maintain a ratio of 25 pupils per teacher for one-teacher schools, 30 pupils in two-teacher schools, 35 in three-teacher schools and more than 40 pupils per teacher in four-teacher schools.  It may be argued that with the Minister's present policy of amalgamating a number of the smaller schools, many more teachers will be needed to ease the pressure on the large schools.  We should, therefore, press ahead with the training of more teachers and the making of provision for that training.  A class of 40 pupils in any school, big or small, is too large to permit the individual tuition necessary for each child.</P>
    <P>Deputy Jones dealt at great length with the burning question of the two-teacher schools.  I might say that as far <Col N="1549" /> back as 1962 and 1963 the Labour Party issued a policy document in which they&mdash;I was not a member at the time&mdash;advocated the type of policy the Minister is now trying to implement. We examined the whole position thoroughly and, in view of the desirability of having as far as possible one teacher for one class, in view of the desirability of providing additional courses in schools, such as rural science and domestic economy, particularly in rural areas, in view of the appalling condition of some of the small schools throughout the country, we felt that where practicable, amalgamation should take place.  We have slight misgivings about part of the attitude being adopted now by the Minister.  We should like him to answer a question on which we are most concerned. Where a small school is about to be closed, transport for the children will, of course, be necessary.  We want the Minister to tell us&mdash;I hope he will be able to do so when replying&mdash;if the transport will, in fact, be free.</P>

      <P>We are making provision for a token payment by the manager to preserve the manager's position, if he wishes to do so, but the payment will be so nominal there cannot be any question of collecting from the parents.  This is in the case of amalgamation of schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EileenDesmond" hpid="Mrs. Desmond Mrs. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to hear that.  I am sure the Minister knows that there have been many meetings at the moment by groups of parents' organisations protesting at the closing of our national schools and this question of payment has been raised.  Deputy Jones stated that a special inquiry should be held into each case before a school is closed. <Col N="1550" /> I do not know whether that would be possible.  I think the Minister, up to a point, is being fairly consistent. He is receiving deputations from the various areas where schools are being closed and he is apparently considering every case but I think, by and large, the only argument which will carry any weight with the Minister is whether or not a certain number of pupils will be available on the rolls within the next five years and whether there will be enough pupils for the appointment of a third teacher.</P>
      <P>There may be other considerations to be taken into account besides the number of pupils on the rolls.  Those who are conversant with education and with rural communities in general have opposed this.  While we are in agreement with the Minister's policy, we feel certain local considerations may, in some instances, make it necessary to retain two-teacher schools.  We all know that there are some areas which are very thinly populated and a great deal of transport would be involved if individual schools were closed.  I shall not go into as much detail as Deputy Jones did with regard to this matter but I should be glad if the Minister would guarantee that every case will be examined on its merits and that other considerations will be taken into account as well as the number of pupils on the rolls.  We feel, by and large, that a case can be made for the closing of quite a number of the small schools at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to come back to the question of the recruitment of teachers.  The Labour Party have repeatedly referred to the qualification requirement, particularly in the case of girls taking up teaching as a career, that they should be able to sing.  We feel that requirement should not be as binding as it is. Very many girls who otherwise would make excellent teachers just cannot sing.  Singing is a natural talent but it is by no means the only talent required to become teachers.  Only a small proportion of the girls will, in any case, teach singing so we feel, particularly in the case of girls who receive high places in their examination, that this qualification should be waived.  We should, at this stage, look <Col N="1551" /> forward to the day when the teaching of singing and music in general will become a more specialised job to be dealt with by the people who have particular qualifications for teaching singing and music in general.</P>
    <P>The Minister has, in the past, made several references to the question of teachers&mdash;I think, in this context, he was referring to secondary teachers&mdash; teaching subjects which they had not taken in their degrees.  I was very surprised, on reading through the reports on <i>Investment in Education</i>, to find that out of a total of 353 girls and 91 boys who sat for the teachers' final examination in 1963, no girl took mathematics and only 14 boys took that subject. This seems an extraordinary state of affairs considering that mathematics is a major subject in national schools.  It is a subject to which, I think, teachers devote a quarter of their total teaching time.  Therefore, I was appalled to discover that mathematics was taken by so few teachers in their final examination. Indeed, a total of only 14 out of 444 teachers who qualified in 1963 took mathematics as a subject.</P>
    <P>There are very many matters to which we could refer but perhaps this is not the Estimate on which to refer to them.  Before I leave the question of teachers, there is an innovation which has been introduced recently into junior classes in national schools, that is group teaching.  I have discussed this matter with a number of teachers who have spent a number of years teaching junior classes.  They are not at all satisfied with this system of teaching in groups.  In classes of roughly 48 children, they teach obviously in four groups of 12.  This is not very widespread at the moment and judging from the opinions of some of the teachers, I hope it will not become widespread.  Apparently, while the teacher teaches one group of 12, the other 36 are free to occupy their time as they think fit.  The teacher finds it particularly difficult to get anything into the minds of the 12 because of the noise.  As well as that, the particular instruction must be repeated four times.</P>
    <P>Last year the Parliamentary Secretary <Col N="1552" /> to the Minister for Finance, when introducing his Estimate, told us that there were 650 national schools listed for replacement, that there were 400 schools without sanitary arrangements of any kind and without adequate heating and that a further 1,100 defective schools were being examined with a view to seeing whether they should be replaced or not.  I presume that 1,100 now comes into the category of schools which may not be replaced.  I just state this for the purpose of comparison with figures given to this House in 1944 when the then Minister for Education, I believe, told the House that there were 1,000 schools in need of replacement and 1,500 were defective. In that case, the total number of defective schools was reduced, within a period of 21 years, from 2,500 to 2,150.  This gives us an idea of the appalling job which the Minister has to deal with.</P>
    <P>When speaking about two-teacher schools, I referred to the sanitary conditions which obtain in some rural schools.  Every Deputy representing a rural area must be familiar with the appalling conditions which exist. Assuming, as I am, that the Minister's programme for amalgamation or rebuilding of schools, as the case may be, will take some time, I appeal to him to impress, if necessary on the managers, the need to take some steps to ensure that school sanitary conditions are improved.  We who are members for rural areas have seen children of tender years playing around the appalling dry closets which are the only sanitary arrangements in very many small rural schools.  They have no water to wash their hands before a mid-day meal.  The conditions in which these children live for several hours each day are a positive danger to their health.  This is something which requires immediate attention, regardless of any programme that may exist for the amalgamation or replacement of rural schools.</P>
    <P>One of the most alarming things which came to our knowledge in reading the Report on education was that 8,000 of our children leave school every year without passing the Primary <Col N="1553" /> Certificate examination and that a further 3,000 either fail or do not sit for the examination at all.  There may be doubts about the value of the Primary Certificate as a means of estimating the attainments of a primary school child, but the position is at present that it is the only criterion we have.  It is dreadful reflection on our educational system that 11,000 children leave school each year without achieving even that standard.</P>
    <P>Further on in the Report, we are told that of the 55,000 children who left our national schools in 1962/63, 21,700 carried on to secondary schools and a further 2,200 carried on in the secondary tops and that 13,600 went on to vocational schools but there was still a balance of 17,500 who left full-time education at that stage.  This figure, I believe, is expected to drop to 10,000 by 1970.  When the school leaving age is raised to 15, these children will have to stay on.  If we are to raise the school leaving age to 15, which is very desirable, we must arrange for continuing education for those children.  One may assume that a great number of these children will belong to the poorer sections of the community.  That is one forceful thing the Report brought before us.  We all suspected, and indeed we knew, that the vast majority of children who did not receive post-primary education were children of the poorer classes but, having read the recent Report, there can be no doubt about it.  We found that participation in education at the age of 14 ranged from 70.2 per cent in the case of children of the professional classes, managers, higher salaried classes, and so on, down to 29.1 per cent in the case of semi-skilled and unskilled workers.  We can assume that the balance of the children of the higher-paid classes in our society either did not continue through the decision of their parents or they, in fact, received their further education abroad.</P>
    <P>The position worsens when we consider the age group 15 to 19 years.  In that group 46.2 per cent of the children of the former classes, managers, professional people and so on, were in full-time education.  The figure for the <Col N="1554" /> unskilled and semi-skilled workers was reduced to 8.9 per cent.  I see that for farmers the figure was as low as 26.8 per cent.  It may be assumed that these were children of the smaller farmers. A noteworthy feature is that the unskilled and skilled workers and the farmers combined make up half our population.  We cannot afford to have the majority of the children of half our population denied any education beyond the primary school simply because they cannot afford it.</P>
    <P>Much more positive measures must be taken to cater for these classes.  The number of scholarships must be greatly increased.  We congratulate the Minister on what he did in regard to scholarships in the last financial year, but it appears to be only a drop in the ocean when compared with the position in the case of our nearest neighbour, Northern Ireland.  With less than half our population, we find that in 1962 they had roughly&mdash;I have not got the figures here&mdash;one and a half times as many recipients of post-primary and third level scholarships in each category as we hope to have by 1970.  We must do much better than that.</P>
    <P>I feel very strongly that there is an urgent need for subsidisation of transport for rural children.  The position is that 10,000 of our children, 26.5 per cent of our girls and 28.8 per cent of our boys, live more than five miles from the nearest source of post-primary education, either technical or secondary.  Most of us in rural Ireland realise, and I am sure those of us who represent rural constituencies can speak more for such areas than for urban areas, that parents in rural Ireland are particularly keen on education for their children.  Most of us have attended meetings organised by parents in an effort to arrange transport for their children to post-primary schools.  We have seen them trying to fix economic fares and we have seen them succeed in arranging for a private bus where CIE fares are exorbitant or where it was uneconomic for CIE to run a service.  We have seen the efforts they have made to arrive at economic fares but saddest of all, I think, we have seen that if that fare goes beyond a certain sum, mothers in the audience suddenly <Col N="1555" /> shaking their heads and deciding that at such a cost education was not for their children.  That is exactly the position.  Some parents can ignore the cost of transport of their children as it makes very little difference to them but many others simply cannot afford it.  That being so, it is still very much the position in this country that post-primary education, at any rate, is only for those who can afford it, particularly in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>It is absolutely necessary that we should do everything we can to ensure that as many as possible can avail of post-primary education and that such education should be available.  We know that if every child could be encouraged to go on to post-primary education, many difficulties would arise in regard to accommodation and staff, difficulties which might take some time to overcome.</P>
    <P>Deputy Jones referred to a comprehensive school, the opening of which we heard about on television and read about in the newspapers.  I am too far from the site of this school to be able to evaluate the considerations which went into its choosing but I was rather surprised, in view of the fact that in this town there is already accommodation for 70 secondary students and 200 vocational pupils, by the decision to build a comprehensive school to cater for 300 pupils.  I agree that there were probably other considerations but it did seem strange to me, in view of the Minister's references to overlapping in school accommodation and when in many other places sanction has been refused for applications for vocational schools and the sanctioning of loans was refused in places where there were no post-primary education facilities at all within miles of the proposed site.</P>
    <P>We all know that in regard to post-primary education, the best facilities can be provided in the larger schools but personally I am doubtful about the decision to limit building grants for vocational schools to those places which can provide a basic complement of over 150 pupils.  We have been told that there are only 154 such areas in the country and even if there were no segregation of boys and girls in some <Col N="1556" /> areas, it would be practically impossible to establish schools catering for 150 pupils at the outset.  In the interests of making post-primary education available to all children, it would be a good idea to look at this matter again and see if it would not be possible to make exceptions in specific cases of schools which could not hope to have a pupil enrolment of 150 at the outset, or maybe not at all.  We know that difficulty will arise in regard to staffing and it will arise in particular if the restriction is to be put on teachers to teach only those subjects which they took for their degrees.</P>
    <P>We find in this context that only 44 of our mathematics teachers took mathematics for their degrees and much the same situation applies in the case of science, history and geography. A motion was introduced by Fine Gael some time ago to the effect that teachers who had emigrated to England and who wished to return and teach here should be facilitated by being allowed their service abroad for increment purposes here.  This is a motion which the Minister should have accepted with a view to making it possible to have more post-primary teachers here to have the qualifications which are so lacking in regard to mathematics and science.  There should be no obstacle in the way of these teachers returning to teach here.</P>
    <P>Personally, I have a very high regard for vocational schools.  They are the nearest thing we have to free post-primary education which should be the ultimate aim for all children.  In this regard I heartily congratulate the Minister on his recent decision to introduce a common certificate for vocational and secondary school pupils.  I have no doubt that there will be some objection to this as some people may feel that it will lower the standards but I hope that will not happen.  This is one sphere of education in which no social barriers exist and I am very glad that the status of these schools will be raised and that pupils will now be able to sit for the Intermediate or Leaving Certificates.  I hope this will attract a better type of pupil in the future, a <Col N="1557" /> pupil who will be more concerned to continue his or her education, rather than, as happens at the moment, biding time for six months or a year until a job turns up.</P>
    <P>There should be no question of lowering the standard of the Intermediate Certificate or the Leaving Certificate for I am quite sure that the vocational teachers are quite capable of getting children up to the required standards.  This uplift was very necessary in the case of vocational education which for long has been the poor relation of our secondary system. Indeed, a very large majority of pupils did not sit for the certificate at all but went to vocational schools because transport was available to them.  There seemed to be no future in that type of situation up to now and no outlet for entering higher education and they left it as soon as a job became available.</P>
    <P>One thing about which I am disappointed is that a very small proportion of boys in rural Ireland avail of secondary education or post-primary education of any kind.  These boys are the agriculturists of the future, the people on whom the economy will be depending, and certainly in view of the recent trade agreement, particularly from the agricultural side, this is one field in which a great deal more could be expended.  Farmers of the future will require to have made available to them the best type of education suited to their particular problems and perhaps some arrangement could be made between the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Education to ensure that more of our boys in rural Ireland continue their education beyond the primary schools.  As I said, rural science should be introduced into the primary schools and should be followed up in the technical or comprehensive schools.</P>
    <P>In the industrial sector we know that there is a need for highly-trained manpower with a scientific background. A recent survey undertook a detailed analysis of present trends in the retraining of technicians with a view to determining the needs by 1970.  While it is not possible to go into the pros and cons of the arguments <Col N="1558" /> put forward in support of the conclusions they reach, it is sufficient to say that the conclusion was that with a most optimistic forecast, with present facilities for training, we will fall far short of our requirements by 1970.  That is even taking into account the lopsided ratio which exists between technician and technologist.  The idea would appear to be three technicians to one technologist.  Should that be the target, they maintain the deficiency in technicians by 1970 would assume enormous proportions.  That being so, this is one field which must receive very specific treatment in the immediate future.</P>
    <P>Chapter 8 of the Report deals in great detail with educational requirements in the labour force as a whole. A target was selected for educational/ occupational relationships.  It was emphasised that the target was a minimum one and that a much higher one could have been selected in many cases. When applied to the whole labour force the conclusion was that by 1970 there would be enormous deficiencies&mdash;a deficiency of 340,000 with junior post-primary qualifications, of 160,000 with senior post-primary qualifications and a further deficit of 90,000 with third level qualifications.</P>
    <P>It is incumbent on us to ensure that the Irish economy will hold its own in the industrial sector when meeting unbridled competition from Britain and the countries of EEC and EFTA in the years to come.  Far from telling us in the Labour benches that we have no confidence in our workers, we should be training our workers to raise their educational standards to the levels enjoyed by those with whom they will be competing when free trade makes itself felt.  Such a back-log has been created that it cannot be rectified in time now. For that reason further training of the persons already in the labour force must be commenced.  That is something we should consider very seriously indeed. These are people who, through no fault of their own but through faults in the educational system provided for them, have not the required training and basic scientific background to enable them adapt themselves to the new <Col N="1559" /> forms of employment which might be necessary for them in the future.  We must think very much about this and do all we can to ensure that as far as possible retraining and scientific technical training will be available to those already in the labour force.</P>
    <P>With regard to our secondary schools, the education generally provided in them is satisfactory to a point. At this stage we do not want to go into too much detail on the curricula in the secondary schools and the vocational schools.  But it has been argued that a great deal of cramming and attention to detail has occurred and that possibly it would be a better idea at all levels to develop a love of education and an interest in particular subjects in pupils rather than concentrating on details which they will possibly forget.  We have all gone through that and forgotten most of what we learned at that stage.  Therefore, it might be better if less emphasis was placed on cramming and more on arousing interest in subjects and equipping children with a background that would lead to a voluntary following up of these subjects at a later stage.</P>
    <P>Without doubt the standard of general knowledge of our secondary school pupils has been considerably raised over the past ten or fifteen years.  One need only look at television programmes such as <i>Mark Time</i> and <i>Teen Talk</i> to realise that the children attending secondary school now have a great deal more general knowledge than we had.  This is only a personal view but I feel, however, that the standard of Irish displayed by pupils in secondary schools is, if anything, lower than what we had ten, fifteen or twenty years ago.  Children are given a simple sean-fhocal and asked to give the English counterpart of it.  In many cases you find the children cannot even translate them.  Those of us who left school fifteen or twenty years ago have no difficulty at all.  I hope I am wrong, but I feel the standard of Irish may have gone down a little bit over the last ten or fifteen years.</P>
    <P>I know this is something in which the Minister has a keen interest.  I <Col N="1560" /> know he is keenly interested in the revival of Irish, in seeing that as many people as possible speak Irish and that the last thing he would want would be any deterioration in the standard of Irish.  Perhaps I am wrong.  Perhaps this is just something I observed and possibly does not hold good.  But certainly there is a variation in the standard of Irish between the various schools.  We all know that the schools with the least amount of snob value attached to them have always been the schools where the standard of Irish was the highest.  On the credit side it must be said that the general knowledge of the pupils has increased considerably.  These schools are now turning out young people much more fitted for life today than we were so many years ago.</P>
    <P>While welcoming the introduction of civics, which is very necessary in present conditions, I personally deplore the complete lack of physical training and games of any sort in many of our girls' schools.  This leads to a very unhappy school life.  Games build up a team spirit and develop a sense of give and take in people very necessary for the life they will lead when they leave school.  Apart from that, they allow for a certain amount of diversion which is necessary in view of the very extensive studies children have to undertake.</P>
    <P>I would like to see much more emphasis on games and physical training in all our schools, but particularly in the girls' schools because it is there the deficiency is greatest.</P>
    <P>On the whole, what I am mostly concerned about are those children who cannot avail of post-primary education.  I would appeal to the Minister&mdash;I know this is something which presents enormous difficulties&mdash; to realise that this cannot wait.  Apart from the economic side, it is in the interests of social justice.  Whatever else is economised on, education should not be economised on.</P>
    <P>I am glad that great strides have been made in the matter of the education of mentally and physically handicapped children.  However, there is one section which does not seem to <Col N="1561" /> be catered for as it should.  I refer to blind children.  Down through the years the system appears to have been to provide them with some sort of social welfare allowance and then allow them sit there and live out their lives. They are very often highly intelligent people and, with proper training, could contribute to the society in which they live.  They deserve the right to take their place in normal society.  Emphasis must be placed on the provision of qualified teachers for the education of blind children in general.</P>
    <P>I realise that the Minister has come into the Department of Education to improve educational facilities and in particular to extend them to a large section of the community.  He is hampered by the fact that he has come into office in a year of particular financial difficulty.  As against that, he has come into office in a year when the interest displayed by the public in education has never been greater. Anything he will do to extend education will be welcomed by the public generally.  The money derived from increased taxation can be utilised to the greatest effect on widening our educational services and that fact would be accepted by the public in general&mdash;certainly it would be accepted by us on these benches.  Whatever else can be cut back on this year, or whatever else can be left as it is with no further improvements for the time being, education is not one of them. As the report says, it is an investment and an investment which cannot further be delayed.  It is also a matter of social justice which has for too long been delayed to a great number of people in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a far greater awareness of education in this country at the moment than ever before.  This, indeed, is a very healthy sign and, I think, is very much due to the Minister whose various appearances throughout the country, wherever he has spoken, have been widely reported. This is an extremely important matter. In his speeches, the Minister has stressed that it is most important that people should talk about education because the more vocal people are, the more opinions are heard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1562" /> I understand that in this country at the moment we have the longest holidays of any country in Europe and one of the shortest school weeks.  This makes a case for the larger school. I listened to Deputy Jones.  One thing I must say is that education always seems to me to be one topic on which everybody can voice his opinion.  More often than not, you get more honest opinions on the subject of education than on any other matter dealt with by a Department of State.  However, I would disagree with Deputy Jones on a number of the points he made.</P>
    <P>The Minister has never said it was his intention to abolish all the one-and two-teacher schools <i>en masse.</i> What is his intention, as each one-and two-teacher school becomes ready for replacement, is that that particular area will be judged on its merits, having regard to the number of schools nearby, the proximity of the schools and the condition of the schools&mdash;all the factors leading up to having a larger school.</P>
    <P>With larger schools, there are, naturally, greater amenities.  Extra subjects can be taught in them.  For example, civics can be taught and we understand that the teaching of that subject has already started in some schools.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in his speeches, has said that, in preparing children for life, it is not enough that they should be crammed for examinations without learning something about what is going on around them.  In other words, it is necessary that they be given a social awareness.  This cannot be done in one- and two-teacher schools where teachers are worked to the limits of endurance, frequently teaching as many as six to eight classes, and it is understandable that extra subjects could not even be entertained.</P>
    <P>Many arguments have been put forward that these larger schools&mdash;the merging of schools&mdash;will lead to people leaving rural areas.  On the contrary, it will help to keep them there.  Many people in rural areas today are very dissatisfied because they feel their children are not getting as good an education in a one- or two-teacher school as they would get in a larger <Col N="1563" /> school and, in fact, it will tend to keep these people in rural areas if larger schools are available nearby.</P>
    <P>There has been a lot of comment about transport.  It has been said that it will be impossible to operate a satisfactory service.  Some people allege that the children will have to get up at 5 a.m. in order to get to school in time if they have to rely on transport.  This, too, is one of the problems which will have to be examined and will also, no doubt, come into the considerations that, shall we say, will be looked at when the local conditions are being examined.</P>
    <P>I should like to make a point about teachers who have left training school. I believe that any teacher with any ambition would be very anxious to go to a larger school rather than to a one- or two-teacher school especially if he wants to improve himself and to have a chance of going up the scale, maybe to being the principal of a much larger school.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Too far too fast&rdquo; was a term used by Deputy Jones: I do not agree. I do not like using quotations but there seems to be one that is very apt here and it came into my mind when he said that.  The late President Kennedy, addressing a university gathering in the United States, said: &ldquo;Our progress as a nation can be no swifter than our progress in education.&rdquo; This applies as much to us as it applies to any other country and I think it is true.  In order that we can compete with other countries, particularly when free trade comes&mdash;as it will&mdash;our children must have the same opportunity for education as children in other countries.</P>
    <P>I should like to make one comment about the Primary Certificate.  I am one of those who believe that a certificate is only a piece of paper that tells you that you knew so much at a particular time.  People are very often penalised for the rest of their lives ticular standard at that particular time because they did not reach that parand I think this is wrong.  However, I understand, also, from one of the Minister's speeches&mdash;he can correct <Col N="1564" /> me if I am wrong&mdash;that he is considering giving a certificate to children who have had a primary education to say that they took various subjects and so that they may have something, anyway, if it is at all necessary.</P>
    <P>I firmly believe that the linking of the Intermediate Certificate and the Vocational Certificate is an excellent idea&mdash;the idea that there should be a Vocational Certificate to rate equivalent to the Intermediate Certificate.  I say this because I know of instances where people are far better qualified to take up a trade than an academic career but they seem to have an inferiority complex very often about this and people find themselves very unhappy maybe as clerks in shipping companies when they would be much happier, perhaps, as cabinet makers.  To give them the status of a Vocational Certificate, equivalent to the Intermediate Certificate, would go a long way towards alleviating that embarrassment.</P>
    <P>I know there has been a great deal of controversy recently in regard to one- and two-teacher schools.  This is due mainly to misunderstanding of the situation.  The vast majority of teachers are very much behind the Minister in this and many of them have been very vocal in this regard.</P>
    <P>Deputy Jones said that nothing was being done for post-primary education. He did not mention that there are four comprehensive schools to be built in the immediate future, three of which are already in course of building and one being planned.  There are also vocational and secondary school committees meeting in various parts of the country with a view to seeing what they can contribute towards providing better post-primary education or getting it to many children who are not getting it at the moment.  So I would not say that nothing is being done in regard to post-primary education.  It is very much a part of the Minister's policy to see that something is done.</P>
    <P>Deputy Jones also asked why not try the scheme out on a pilot area.  I can imagine the screams when it would be announced that an area was selected as a pilot area for testing the abolition of one- and two-teacher schools.</P>

      <P>I would disagree with them on that point.  I beg the Deputy's pardon for attributing it to him incorrectly. People will object.  It would not work out in practice.</P>
      <P>I should like to take this opportunity of saying that at the moment there is insufficient attention paid in schools to the teaching of hygiene.  That is a very simple thing.  Unfortunately, I do not think we are giving enough attention to this very important subject.  I want to lay particular emphasis on its importance.</P>
      <P>I want also to praise the Minister for his attitude towards the training of teachers.  The Minister, I understand, is now paying attention not so much to the person who gets the highest marks in the examination as to the person who is dedicated, who wants to be a teacher, not necessarily the academically brilliant person who can pass an examination even without studying very hard.  Dedication to teaching is very necessary.  The Minister has all this in mind.</P>
      <P>It was very encouraging to listen to Deputy Mrs. Desmond praising the Minister for the many things he has got under way since he has taken over the Department.  I am very happy that we have a very dedicated Minister. People on all sides of the House are aware that we do have a man who will always listen to criticism of his Department, provided it is constructive.</P>

I should like to conclude as I began by saying that it is not the intention of the Minister to abolish the one and two-teacher schools <i>en masse.</i> That will all be done subject to local conditions over ten to 15 years.  It will take quite a few years to do this and no one will be walked over and told: &ldquo;You are going to have this, whether you like it or not.&rdquo; People will be consulted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister first mentioned the closure of <Col N="1566" /> the one- and two-teacher schools, I confess I thought it was something that would come very gradually, a decision that would not be taken without first consulting with the INTO, the managers and people in these schools. Perhaps I was wrong.  I confess I did not quite understand the Minister's speech when he made it.  He made it in Irish.  It was some time later when I read the translation.  I find that, indeed, this closure is going ahead straight away.</P>
      <P>Even at this late stage, I should like to ask the Minister to exclude the west of Ireland from his plan.  We in the west labour under different conditions from those obtaining in the areas of Deputy Briscoe and, indeed, the Minister.  With all due respect, it is quite obvious, listening to Deputy Briscoe, that he does not know the first thing about rural Ireland.  He does not understand life in rural Ireland and certainly does not understand life in the west of Ireland.  We on all sides are asking Ministers please to save the west but you cannot save the west by closing the one- and two-teacher schools.</P>
      <P>I think Deputy Carty will agree with me that in our constituency, to close the two-teacher schools would mean in point of fact closing more than half of the schools.  Only last Monday night, that was brought home to me very clearly when the parish priest of the parish in which I live said: &ldquo;Will you attend a meeting tonight because we received communications from the Department of Education to say that the four schools in this parish are being closed and that a new school is being built in the centre of the parish, which is Cappatagle.&rdquo;  I attended the meeting and will try to convey to the Minister the feeling of the people there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First of all, let me say to the Minister that of these four schools, three of them are two-teacher schools and the other is a one-teacher school.  To be quite fair to the Minister, let me say that the one-teacher school is going anyway.  There are only 16 pupils in it. One other school is in very poor condition. That is Killarton.  Another school, Cappatagle school, is in excellent <Col N="1567" /> condition.  It was built as a three-teacher school not so very long ago and has been repaired and is always in good condition.  It has only two teachers now.</P>
    <P>It was the feeling of the parents of the children of the four schools that if these schools had to be closed&mdash; none of them wanted any of them closed but they recognised that one would have to go, the one-teacher school&mdash;it would be more sensible to enlarge, and to instal water and sanitary facilities in, the best of the schools, the Kilrickle school, rather than close the whole four and build another school in Cappatagle.</P>
    <P>I know the letter from the Department stated that the Department would be prepared to give a grant.  I understand the grant is two-thirds of the cost.  The Minister must realise that we in the west of Ireland are economically with our backs to the wall and cannot afford to pay any more for schools and that you will not get parents paying for schools that they feel they do not need.  They would say: &ldquo;We have a perfectly good school here and why not use it?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not agree with the Minister that the children in the two-teacher school are not getting as good an education as children in the larger school.  In fact, I hold that in the smaller school the slower children get a better education than they would get in the larger school.</P>
    <P>Last week-end I spoke to a parent who has a child in a large school in the largest town in my constituency who said to me that she was very anxious about her eight year old son who was not making any progress. This child is in a large school.  The mother went to see the teacher.  The teacher asked her her name.  He did not know her.  She gave her name and the child's name.  The teacher asked: &ldquo;You are sure this child is in my class?&rdquo; When the facts were sorted out and it was found that the child was in his class, he admitted that the child was slow.  The class was big and the teacher was not able to get around to him.  If that child were <Col N="1568" /> in a small school, he would have got better attention.</P>
    <P>There is another thing that worries me.  This is not the place in which to say it but certainly outside the House is not the place to say it.  The Minister proposes to take these children, I suppose by bus, to school.  I have small daughters.  The Minister has small daughters.  Would the Minister be prepared to let his four year old daughter travel to school along with boys of up to 12 and 14 years of age? I would not.  It worries quite a number of parents.  Many parents have said to me: &ldquo;I am not letting my children go on a school bus unaccompanied&rdquo;. You cannot expect mothers of young families to ferry children in and out to school on buses.  As it is, they give them in charge of bigger children on the roads and all the parents watching the children as they go along can know what is going on.  I know that parents are not all the time watching their children, but, when a mother pops a child on to a bus early in the morning, that child will not return home again until late in the evening and, from the moment she puts the child on the bus until the time the child returns safely home again, the mother has not really one moment's ease.  That is a small thing, perhaps, but it is an important thing from the point of view of the parent.</P>
    <P>The economics may be good but there is something repugnant to me in the whole idea.  Even the title of the Report, <i>Investment in Education,</i> creates the impression that the Minister is really more concerned with £.s.d. than with the education of the child.  That is the way I look at it, I must confess.  What is money, after all, compared with the education of our children?  The whole country depends on the education of our children.  The children's livelihood depends on their education.  The future of the country depends on it and on them.  One just cannot close two-teacher schools and allege that children will get a better education in a larger school in a bigger town or parish.  Doing this will change the whole structure of rural life.  It is a gigantic step for any Minister to take and one which he should be very slow to take.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1569" /> Comprehensive schools and larger schools may suit Sweden and other countries, but they do not suit our temperament.  My own feeling is that in the small national school, there is a different atmosphere.  The child goes to school at four years of age.  Before he goes, he knows what the teacher looks like.  The parent knows the teacher.  The teacher knows the children. The same teacher will have the children for three, four or five years. Teachers can observe the children's habits and how their characters are developing.  They can inform the parents about trends so that they can be corrected.  They have time to do more than just teach the programme laid down by the Department.  In these smaller schools, teachers are in a position to take an interest in the children, an interest which is denied to the teachers in the bigger schools.</P>
    <P>Another aspect I should like the Minister to consider is the fact that the closing of these schools will create unemployment. Once you start closing two-teacher schools in the west, you start creating redundancy.  We have not got a population to absorb these teachers in other areas such as you may have here in the city.  I think&mdash; I speak subject to correction&mdash;that teachers who are not graduates are not eligible to teach anywhere else.  What will be done with these after all their years of teaching?  The most important thing, of course, is the education of the children.  But the point I raise is one that should be considered.  The new system will do away with the untrained teacher.  I sympathise with the untrained teachers, but that day was, of course, coming in any case.  Even at this late hour, I beg the Minister to give the west of Ireland the fullest consideration. Ours is a different problem from that of the rest of the country. We are working on a declining population. Once you start closing the two-teacher schools, it will be only a short step to closing the four- and five-teacher schools.  Where will it end?  I do not know.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister is encouraging vocational education.  That has long been neglected.  There is a tendency in the rural areas to look on <Col N="1570" /> vocational schools as being not quite the thing.  That is encouraging the growth of secondary schools.  It seems to me to be a pity.  Youngsters tell me they are going to Dublin to learn shorthand and typing.  I ask them why they will not do it in the local vocational school and they say: &ldquo;Oh, the tech!&rdquo;, as if it were an inferior place, a place carrying some kind of slur, instead of their being proud of the fact that they have a vocational school.  Vocational education needs a boost.  There is not enough of it and children do not avail of it to the extent they should.  Vocational agricultural training could be very useful to those who will remain on the land.  Our aim should be to encourage them to stay on the land.</P>
    <P>There is one aspect that worries me in relation to this plan for vocational schools.  The Minister said he would try to get the secondary and vocational schools to pool their resources.  Last week-end the reverend mother of a secondary school&mdash;it is not in the west of Ireland&mdash;told me she had applied for a grant to build an extension. She got a polite reply telling her the inspector would call.  At the end of six months, she was told the grant would depend on co-operation in relation to this question of integration between schools.  I should like the Minister to tell us what sort of integration exactly he has in mind.  Does he mean sharing classrooms or teachers?  This reverend mother felt that, if it were a matter of sharing teachers, the children in the vocational school would be just nobody's children. They would fall between two stools and get a worse education than they are getting now.  When the Minister comes to reply, I should like him to tell us more fully what he means when he talks about pooling resources.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect that rather shocks me about vocational schools. About a month ago I read in one of the newspapers that there are over 1,400 vocational teachers and of those 1,400, only a little over 300 are permanent. That is a bad thing.  A teacher who is not permanent can never be as interested as a teacher who is.  Temporary teachers are here today and gone tomorrow.  That is a bad thing <Col N="1571" /> for the system as a whole.  It should be the ultimate aim of the Minister to make as many as possible permanent and not have these permanent-temporary teachers, if I may so describe them.</P>

It knocks some of the &ldquo;divilment&rdquo; out of the children.  It fosters the team spirit.  If there were more of it, there would be fewer flick knives and less vandalism.</P>

      <P>Why not? That is not fair.  What is sauce for the goose should be sauce for the gander. The children in all primary schools should be similarly treated.  Discrimination seems wrong.  It is not fair to the children.  Perhaps the Minister will explain more fully about this when he is replying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Just a brief word now about secondary schools: on the whole, secondary education is becoming available to a greater number of <Col N="1572" /> children.  That is an excellent thing.  In nearly every town in my constituency, there is a secondary school.  They are not very expensive.  I think the system of giving an extra ten per cent for any subject when an examination is done through the medium of Irish while it may improve the Irish, tends to harm the other subjects.  I find girls particularly, who do French, mathematics, and so on through the medium of Irish, tend to speak grammatically very badly after leaving school.  I know a girl who applied for a job with Aer Lingus.  She had her honours Leaving Certificate and she was turned down because she made a grammatical error&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>In which language?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>In English. I do not think it is fair to over-emphasise one language against the other.  After all, she was not interviewed in Irish but she lost her job because her English was not up to standard.  If we give our children a secondary education, let us give them a good secondary education.</P>
      <P>Then, there is another thing in secondary schools&mdash;I think domestic economy should be made compulsory for girls.  I do not care what a girl may do afterwards but she will always know how to make a cup of tea or boil an egg and believe you me, they do not know how at the moment. There is a tendency at the moment to scrap domestic economy if you are doing science, history, or even Latin. I think domestic economy should be made compulsory for girls.  No matter what they may do in life, it will always stand to them.  Most of them say they hope eventually to get married. Surely they are not supposed to practise on their husbands.  I feel they should have learned it at school.  I find most parents say that by the time the children have finished their homework in the evening they are too tired to be taught how to cook.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one other matter on which I want to say a few words, that is, the facilities for mentally handicapped <Col N="1573" /> children.  There are a few schools in this country for mentally handicapped children; they do tremendous work but there is not half enough money spent on them.  Going around my own constituency time and time again parents say to me: &ldquo;Is there any hope of getting these children into institutions where they will be cared for and where they will be taught a little?&rdquo; Gone are the days when parents tended to hide these children away. People have become enlightened and they know now that these children can be taught a certain amount but it needs specialised training and teaching, and I think a lot more money should be made available for building schools, building units onto existing schools or even hospitals, for the care and education of mentally handicapped children.</P>
    <P>After all, the State is supposed to provide every child with an opportunity for education.  The mentally handicapped child is just as entitled to a reasonable chance in life as a brilliant child.  I have a &ldquo;thing&rdquo; about this and I feel it is something about which we do not do enough.  A certain amount is done, mostly by the religious orders, and they deserve great credit for it, but I think an awful lot more could and should be done.  I know voluntary organisations do a lot, individuals do a lot, but I feel the State does not do a lot.  I know at this time we are in the middle of a credit squeeze, but even a credit squeeze and economic difficulties should not keep the Minister from allowing a certain amount of money for these schools.</P>
    <P>That is all I have to say but I am very anxious about this question of closing the two-teacher schools.  I feel that in the west of Ireland it would be an absolute disaster.  I think no school should be closed until each one is examined on its merits.  If any way possible can be found to keep it open, it should be kept open.  I sympathise with the Minister and Deputy Briscoe because they are city people and they do not recognise&mdash;&mdash;</P>

By reason of his education and the hours he works, if you take a teacher out of a parish, I stress that you take part of the soul out of the parish.  You change the whole set-up.  Children tend to look up to the teacher and even a teacher in the church will keep the children quiet.  I have seen it&mdash;a good teacher is an asset to a parish.  I believe that, on the whole, the teachers we have in the country are excellent and do far more than teach.  If you take them out of the parish, you will do it a terrible disservice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>It has happened in many cases that those who wish to bring about change are stoned with abuse but very few, if indeed any, can deny the fact that the educational system of this country does need a dynamic re-appraisal and the Minister is giving such dynamism to our most vital need.  In this, unpopular measures must be taken if we are to get away from the minor and parochial level. The Minister is not responsible for a parish; he is responsible for the welfare, the education, of the nation and the children who are the future possessors of this nation.  The nation is composed of each and every individual, the family being the unit and the Minister being vested with the authority and responsibility of seeing that the best interests of the people <Col N="1575" /> are served, not just for any political whims from the west.  I agree whole-heartedly with the fact that one-teacher schools for the majority religion in this country must go.  Any thinking person will agree with me on this because a close examination of the facts must prove that down through the years these schools have been no-teacher schools for long periods, a junior assistant mistress schools for many periods, and temporary teacher schools staffed by teachers who are only marking time until a suitable vacancy presents itself elsewhere.  It is not fair to the children concerned.</P>
      <P>There are schools in my own constituency, schools where up to 20 and 25 pupils have been committed to the care of one person.  It is neither fair to the teacher nor the children to have seven classes with children ranging in age from four to, maybe, 13 years in an ill-equipped school, in many cases a school which is not adequate to carry on seven classes, to keep seven different groups of people apart, even if there were only one or two in some groups.  How, short of a miracle, can a teacher give fair treatment to each and every pupil there? It has been accepted as a basic fact that these schools can no longer exist in our modern system and in view of our requirements.</P>
      <P>Being a rustic from a rural community, I find that there is great opposition to the closure of many two-teacher schools which have given results down through the years, and when I say &ldquo;results&rdquo;, I do not mean passing the Primary Certificate, but giving a sound, basic education which enables the pupils to leave the national schools and go to the local secondary or vocational schools and compete favourably with the pupils from a one-teacher one-class school.  There are exceptions to every rule, and I am glad to know that the Minister has taken full cognisance of all the facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not happy about the problem of transport.  I think a mass transport system could have inherent dangers, such as strikes, which would affect school attendance.  Even the mechanical devices bringing children from out-lying <Col N="1576" /> districts are susceptible to break-downs. These things will all have to be thoroughly investigated before any firm approach can be made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonalDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>It can also be minimised. The whole system can be held up to ransom if the Minister does not make proper provision for the transport of the children.  If private individuals got a monopoly, after a time they could make their own conditions, and adhere to them rather than to those laid down by the Minister unless a firm contract is entered into in the first instance.</P>
      <P>Up to now we have had three separate entities in our educational system.  We had primary, secondary and vocational schools, all working away in their own tight, neat, little compartments, with none of them communicating to any great degree with the other.  A greater liaison between the vocational and secondary schools is a must.  Contrary to what Deputy Jones said, the school leaving age was not raised since 1902.</P>
      <P>Most of our schools&mdash;and I think rural Deputies will agree with me in this&mdash;are insanitary, due to the fact that water supplies are non-existent or inadequate.  With the advent of water supplies, we can hope to raise the standard of sanitation and facilities of that nature in our schools.  It is very difficult indeed to blame the Minister, or any other Minister, for not providing proper facilities in our schools where there is no availability of water. One goes hand in hand with the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the raising of the school leaving age, one very important aspect is that poorer people who, in many cases, are forced to take their children away from school at 14 years to earn a paltry few shillings, should be encouraged by direct subvention to leave their children in school for another year or two.  If a means test <Col N="1577" /> is applied, this would not mean very much.  It certainly would not mean very much in comparison with our national budget, but it would mean a lot to these children who, through lack of education, will be forced to take up manual work, and will be denied the privilege of bettering themselves.</P>
    <P>We cannot condemn anything without putting something in its stead. Until such time as concrete proposals from those who oppose the Minister's proposition are laid before this House, they have not the right to reject out of hand the proposals which he has made.  We must gear ourselves for the late 1960s and the 1970s, and not think in terms of: &ldquo;What was good enough for my father is good enough for me&rdquo;. The day of the small parish school has gone.  We must equip each and every child to the best advantage and ability our educational system can afford.  Investment in education is investment in the future wealth of the country, because on it depends the advancement of our country as a nation.</P>
    <P>As regards the certificates, the present system is not outmoded but it has been abused no end, because it is common knowledge that cramming takes place, that set programmes are laid down, and that specific periods in history are thoroughly gone into.  We have set courses in history and geography and the questions which are likely to be asked are known.  They are gone through minutely.  The teacher knows the questions which were asked on the last occasion and he can leave them out.  I should far prefer to see a child getting 50 per cent. in an examination and having a good education, than to see a child being crammed in one period of history and getting 80 per cent in an examination, and being ignorant of the history of the century before or the century after. This applies also to other subjects.</P>
    <P>Our vocational schools have much to gain by a reappraisal of the system. It is not snobbery, as was inferred, that keeps children from going to vocational schools.  It is the unfortunate fact that many children who go to vocational schools have not got <Col N="1578" /> the foundation to take advantage of the educational facilities that are afforded there.  We should ensure that children leaving the national schools&mdash; and obviously this is the Minister's aim&mdash;have a sufficient grasp of the generalities of education to be able to avail not only of the vocational education system but of the academic system in our secondary schools.  Vocational guidance officers should be introduced into our schools and they should assess the children's ability at a certain age, and channel them into technological education or academic education. For far too long there have been too many round pegs in square holes.</P>
    <P>These things are all very laudable but the practicalities of working them out unfortunately are left to one man, the Minister, and his Department, and no doubt whatever solution he suggests will be criticised, by some without reason, and by others possibly with good intent but misinformed.  I welcome the Minister's fresh thinking on the educational requirements of the country.  We can safely say that if his plan is implemented, it will redound to the success and advantage of the rural population.</P>

There is always need to put somebody in charge of the child and I think something should be done.

      <P>I do not intend to delay the House very long because I think nearly every aspect of the one-and two-teacher schools has already been covered, but there are a few comments I should like to make.  I have listened to the chief speakers of the Fine Gael Party saying they are against the closing of the small schools and that it is a bad practice to put the economy before social matters.  I was amazed to hear the Fine Gael Party changing sides completely in this respect. I would like to refer them to the Dáil Debates of 21st July, 1965, Volume 217, No. 11, when the Minister was replying to the debate on the Vote for Education.  He gave his views on the one- and two-teacher schools and the decision he was taking.  There were some remarks made by Deputy P. O'Donnell and I should like to quote from the Official Report of that day, column 1970:</P>
      <P>Mr. P. O'Donnell: This is what Fine Gael have advocated on many occasions, as the Minister has pointed out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1583" /> Mr. Colley: Deputy Dillon pointed it out, as Leader of the Party.</P>
    <P>Mr. P. O'Donnell: I did, too.  We will always find the individual school and have no option but to make representations when requested but the policy adumbrated by the Minister is one that Fine Gael have been advocating.</P>
    <P>Mr. Colley: I feel that I will have the full support of Deputy O'Donnell in any such case.</P>
    <P>Mr. P. O'Donnell: You certainly will.</P>
    <P>I ask the Fine Gael Party where do they stand?  They cannot have it both ways.  They are trying to take both sides, running with the hare and hunting with the hounds and are making a mockery of the whole educational system.  You have either one policy and you stand by it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It was also stated that it was for economic reasons that the one- and two-teacher schools are being closed and larger schools being built. I for one cannot see that.  As regards finance, it may be economy, but it is getting more value for the teachers because in the long run the schools with one or two teachers will benefit. Financially, we would be at a loss because transport in many cases will cost a lot more than what it would cost to build one- or two-teacher schools.</P>

      <P>The Deputy's Party said it was for economy it was being done.  It is not for financial economy. It may be for teaching economy.  We have got to face facts.  The Labour Party, in 1962, advocated the building of larger schools.  I must say they are fairly consistent in their views.</P>

I do not attend all the meetings I am invited to, but I attend many of them.  I believe every case will be considered on its merits.  We have got that assurance from the Minister. I cannot see much use in going to some of these meetings when the Fine Gael representatives already have their election hats on them and are more concerned with getting votes than with the closing of the schools.</P>

Those are Supplementary Estimates merely to tide the Minister and his Department over the intervening period between now and the end of the financial year. As such, of course, they do not present us with anything extremely controversial but it is to be noted that the bulk of the money required by the Minister is mainly for salaries and to help out in the implementation of arbitration and conciliation awards.

It is a pity in a country where, for so long, there has been such a successful harmony between the Church and the State and all the interested parties in the matter of education and so much has been done as a result of that harmony, that there should now enter on the scene a controversy which may, on closer examination, have very little basis in fact at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>Where people are at issue on certain matters, not alone in relation to one- or two-teacher schools, it is very often due to the fact that there are bad public relations, a bad projection of the image sought to be created and loose wording of the principles upon which it is proposed to base future changes.  Unless we are clear, as a bishop once said, to a Minister of State, upon what we disagree, there is very little chance of progress. The shortest road to agreement is, I think, to be clear upon what we disagree. I have no doubt in my mind that the Minister for Education is pursuing a particular course.  I will not say it is a policy because it cannot be a policy as yet because it has not been fully gone into by all the relevant and interested groups.  In my view, the most relevant and interested groups of all parties connected with education are the parents and to them must go the prime right of discussion and to them is due the best possible advice, at local level, that can be offered to them.  If that advice were available, things might proceed on a much easier plane but I am satisfied <Col N="1586" /> that the Minister is genuinely trying to find solutions for the problems confronting him as Minister for Education.</P>
      <P>I am not satisfied that he has sought the advice of all sources available to him.  It is true that there are publications like <i>Education in Europe</i> prepared by the Council for Cultural Cooperation. There is our own publication <i>Investment in Education</i> but, with all due respect to the members of the steering committee and the members of the survey team, I find there no name that would convince me of a knowledge, a real practical working knowledge of rural Ireland.  I do not care whether they come from the Department of Education, the Department of Agriculture or any other institution or academy; all of these are necessarily associated with the bureaucratic and by reason of their attainments in their particular spheres, long divorced from rural Ireland.</P>
      <P>I concede straight away that a case can be made&mdash;I am dealing with primary education now&mdash;for the abolition or dismantling or whatever word you like to use, of one-teacher schools but not without full inquiry.  Probably the first difficulty the Minister and his officials will find themselves up against in regard to one-teacher schools is the schools devoted exclusively to the education of what I shall call our separated brethren.  I think they must stay, particularly in rural Ireland where the numbers are not great and where transport difficulties would be insurmountable in order to take them to bigger schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where a one-teacher school is to be retained, it should be possible to have an adequate reservoir of trained teachers from which to draw so that pupils in one-teacher schools would have the benefit of trained teachers. I know the difficulty there is, probably, in getting teachers to stay in backward districts and I know the readiness with which Leaving Certificate or Matriculated young men and women can be found to go into these schools, but only for a very short time.  On those grounds, I can appreciate the difficulty of the Department in keeping these <Col N="1587" /> schools staffed and thereby preserving continuity of education for the small number of pupils attending, but however small the number or however difficult it is to keep such a school open, unless the advantage of transporting them a long distance, particularly very young children, easily outweighs whatever disadvantage there might be financially and, indeed, academically in equipping them suitably with staff, then that school should not be disturbed.</P>
    <P>In passing, it may be said that the proposal to abolish these schools&mdash; I am still talking of one-teacher schools &mdash;is in itself an admission or, to put it more realistically, a recognition by the Government in power and by the Department that the expectation of maintaining a population in those areas is very remote.  It is a confession that rural Ireland's depopulation is an accomplished fact.  That must be a very sad realisation for us all, one for which we must all accept responsibility and we must be constructive in our approach towards trying to remedy it.</P>
    <P>I come now to the two-teacher schools and here, I think, the need for a public inquiry on the spot is paramount.  This will not be achieved by directing the local inspector to visit the local manager and try to find out from him what his reactions would be if school A were to be amalgamated with schools B and C, and then, possibly through misconceptions of some kind, sending back a report to his superiors in the Department that could not be called strictly accurate.  I repeat that to be clear upon what is disagreed is the best way to agreement.</P>
    <P>I do not know what word to use to describe a past pupil of a primary school, whether it is a graduate or a primate or something like that, but I went to a two-teacher school and I confess that I did not suffer any disadvantage when I met pupils in secondary schools afterwards who had gone to three-teacher, four-teacher or multiple schools in other towns.  I do not accept the view, however statistically achieved and compiled, that the two-teacher school or small school is at a disadvantage in the matter of gaining scholarships as against the big <Col N="1588" /> schools.  There are too many factors to be taken into consideration and the number of scholarships available to primary school pupils is so small and categorised in the main, particularly county council scholarships, as among certain kinds of schools, two-teacher or three-teacher school and so on. There are so many things to be taken into account that we cannot come down heavily in favour of one against the other in the matter of obtaining scholarships.</P>
    <P>Surely this has something to do with the teachers in the schools and with the kind of pupils and the range of ability available to teachers who are willing to help them a little above and beyond the ordinary curriculum. Again, it must have been something to do with the homes from which they come and the amount of help available to them in those homes, or the amount of help that is offered to them in many cases.  Sometimes you will find it withheld through lack of thought, or sheer carelessness, by some parents who could give far more help with the homework than they do.</P>
    <P>It has been said here that the proposal to get rid of the smaller schools is a concept based on economy and that it is purely economic.  Well, if it is I would say that it is wrong straight away, because I believe that the social side and the psychological side of the country school are very important.  I am not to be taken as being guilty now of episcopal plagiarism when I say that because I said all this before ever it was said by any Minister or any bishop.  The curious thing about this is that on the Government benches opposite I find, in the course of this debate, tremendous enthusiasm for the abolition of these one-teacher and two-teacher schools, and at any of the meetings which I attended, called by parents in an area where they have been threatened by abolition or amalgamation, I find my colleague Deputy Calleary from North Mayo, has agreed with the parents and with us all along the line and has always wound up by saying: &ldquo;I will make the best representations possible <Col N="1589" /> and I will bring your views to the notice of the Minister.  He is a very nice fellow and I am sure he will do the best for you.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>Sooner or later, of course, we were bound to come to the rural scene.  I do think it is important that country children should have preserved for them the rural bias through which they would live during their primary education and in which we expect them to work for the rest of their lives.  We do not believe in a situation in which children are going to be lifted into a van, a car, or a lorry, or some sort of conveyance at some early hour of the morning and jogged along the roads&mdash; for which we are unable to get grants at the moment &mdash;and after a good breakfast shaking internally, to arrive eventually at this wonderful edifice in contemplation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Who is going to be collected first in the morning and at what time?  Who will be deposited at his or her home last in the afternoon?  How are we going to get over the release of infant children at a time earlier than the rest of the children and will there be separate transport for that purpose? Will the transport go to the head of the boreen and will the pupils be expected to wait for it there?  Who will pay for this transport?  Will the parents be asked to make subscriptions towards it through the manager, or will the manager be given a fund from some source or other to pay for it? Where there are difficulties about getting <Col N="1590" /> a van of adequate size, where two runs might be necessitated, who will ensure that the van will do the double run?  Who will look after the enormous insurance that is required for these vans for the purpose of carrying a limited and specified number of children?</P>
    <P>These are some of the problems that face one in a consideration of this kind and these are the problems which can, in my view, be dealt with at local level only.  That is why we in this Party say that not one school should be interfered with without inquiring locally, by public inquiry and not by the movement of inspector to manager and a report back, or anything like that.  A curious thing about it is that in the two or three schools in North Mayo where this has been threatened the parents in each place have gathered in force and have objected.  Can you take away the rights of the parents in this regard and who is to be ultimately the guardian of what the Constitution calls the imprescriptible rights of the children?  These are big considerations, although they might be matters of detail, and I do not think that any body of people, however well qualified academically, situate in or around the city of Dublin can write a report and have that report accepted and implemented for the people of far away districts in North Mayo, Galway, Donegal or even places in the midlands remote from a transport point of view.</P>
    <P>Local inquiry is the main thing and, in addition, one can think of all that a child misses.  I am not being nostalgically lyrical about this but I think it is important that a child should not alone live in certain surroundings, in truly rural surroundings, but should enjoy them in all their different changes and phases.  As they walk along to school they should be able, instead of being crammed in a van&mdash; and there are other objections to that as well, according to representations which have been made to me&mdash;to see the changes of spring, summer and autumn.  They should be able to watch bird-life, the crops growing and everything coming to fruition and, as well &mdash;I must not disappoint my friend and well-known correspondent in the Press <Col N="1591" /> Gallery&mdash;even be able to watch the frogs coming out on the roads after rain.</P>

      <P>I am very sorry that in my time, short as it was, I never had the privilege and the Minister the advantage of the two of us having a teacher-pupil relationship.  I hope I have made myself clear on this question of two-teacher schools.  I want to say&mdash;it is as well to say it in Parliament as outside&mdash;that anywhere there is an attempt to put a school out of action, not repair it or amalgamate it with another school, I shall use every ounce of energy I have, I shall use such influence as I have, to see that the parents get a full and public inquiry. I shall see to it that they will take every step available to them within the law to prevent something happening without their having full advice and having it fully explained to them. If they accept it as to their advantage, then let the change be made; but if they do not accept it, let the change <Col N="1592" /> be not made.  I want to say quite clearly that I reserve the right to be free here and elsewhere to use my energy and influence in that direction.</P>
      <P>I hope I will have the fullest support in this matter from my two colleagues in North Mayo in helping and assisting parents in this great difficulty in which they find themselves&mdash;a difficulty of not knowing what is best to do or thinking that they know what is best to do or otherwise being in some sort of dilemma.  It is up to us not to go to an area and say: &ldquo;I am with you to the last fence in keeping this school.&rdquo;  If we think, as a result of inquiries made, that a school should be amalgamated with some place else, it is our duty to say so; and I will say so when I consider it necessary.  But in the two places I have visited, Culleens and Ballymachola, I do not consider it proper that the school should not be replaced in the case of Culleens and I think it wrong that a school in such fine structural condition as Ballymachola&mdash;which in a few years' time, according to local statistics will again become a two-teacher school&mdash;should be abandoned.  It is high time the National Teachers Organisation tried by negotiation to have lowered further the number of pupils required for a two-teacher school so that the teaching staffs will be preserved and so that these schools will not become one-teacher schools merely because of a percentage technicality of population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This brings me to this question of civics.  Bouquets are being flung at the Minister about the start of the teaching of civics in schools.  I taught civics in a school in the Minister's constituency 25 years ago.  It was on the curriculum. I do not know that any great good resulted from it, but it was on the curriculum and we had our text book. It was a very good subject.  This business of civics is becoming attractive and fashionable.  When a thing becomes fashionable, you can bet your bottom dollar it is within an ass's roar of becoming decadent.  What is wrong with the catechism?  Is that not the greatest civics text book of all time? In that regard I have never failed any time I spoke here on educational matters to pay tribute to the primary <Col N="1593" /> teachers of this country for the great job they do in the spiritual training as well as the academic side of a child's upbringing.  One has only to have experience in city, town and country of First Communion and Confirmation days to see the great part played by the teachers in communion with the Church.</P>
    <P>If I may say a last word on this whole matter, I would advise caution. I would advise that all parties to this budding dispute stay their hands, both on the ministerial side and on the Episcopal side.  I would urge that both come together again, the whole of the Hierarchy, not parts of it, because I am led to believe it was through meeting only some that mistakes have occurred and misunderstandings have arisen.  That may be right or it may be wrong.  Whenever anything like this happens, the country is full of rumours, people start to write letters to the papers and editors are often foolish enough to write editorials about it at too early a stage.  What I say now is: stay your hands.  I would urge this on the Department of Education and, with all humility, on those outside.  Stay your hands and let somebody of the stature of, say, Most Reverend Dr. Rodgers, Bishop of Killaloe, who made a conciliatory speech in this regard, try to get everyone around the council table.</P>
    <P>I think if the Minister agrees that each of these matters be considered on its merits, he will find a formula for a principle upon which we all can agree.  From that we can go on working together, in Government and in Opposition, to advance constructive theories and implement them for the betterment of our children.  In that way we will provide an object lesson to the world of the proper union as between Church and State, as between teacher and pupil, of the proper appreciation of all the people's responsibilities, all being complementary, one to another, thereby ensuring that the most helpless section of all in this country, the children, will have their imprescriptible rights forever preserved.</P>

      <P>Is aisteach an rud é. Ní foláir dul abhaile chun an pointe a léiriú.  Do chuir an Teachta Lindsay ceist ar an Aire agus ba mhaith liom an cheist chéanna a chur air freisin. Do bhéinn an-bhuíoch de dá mb'fhéidir leis í d'fhreagairt mar is ceist í gur deachair freagra iomlán a fháil uirthi faoi láthair.  Conas a oibreoidh córas iompair saor i gceantar mór?  Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil scéim chóras iompair sa Ghaeltacht.  Deirtear liom go mbíonn na leanaí ag fanúint taobh amuigh de dhoras na scoile ar a 8 a chlog ar maidin in áiteacha.  Sílim go bhfuil rud éigin mí-cheart ansin.  Tá súil agam, nuair a bhéas an tAire ag tabhairt freagra ar an ndíospóireacht, go ndéanfaidh sé na pointí a shoiléiriú mar tá a fhios agam go maith nach bhfuil sé ar aigne aige go mbeadh sé ar pháiste ar bith seasamh taobh amuigh de dhoras scoile óna 8 go dtí a 9 a chlog ar maidin go n-osclófaí an scoil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá ceist eile agam le cur ar an Aire. Tá sé ag tosnú anois ar pholasaí nua a chur ag obair.  Ba mhaith liom a chloisint uaidh cén fhaid a cheapann sé a thógfaidh sé chun an polasaí iomlán a chur i bhfeidhm.  Tá an leabhar úd <i>Investment in Education</i> go h-íontach maidir le min-eolas agus figiúirí a thúirt ach ní raibh ar mo chumas figiúirí mar gheall ar an gceist sin d'fháil ann agus ba mhaith liom <Col N="1595" /> tuairim an Roinn Oideachais ar an gceist sin a chloisint.</P>
    <P>Nuair a chuirfear an polasaí seo i gcrích, cén costas iomlán a bhéas ann dar leis an Roinn?  Chítear domsa go mbeadh suas le £500,000 ag teastáil chun an córas iompair saor a chur ar fáil.  An bhfuil an tsuim sin ceart nó an bhfuil aon tuairim ag an Roinn cheana féin mar gheall ar na cúrsaí?</P>
    <P>Tógaimís, mar shompla, áit ar bith ina bhfuil trí scoileanna beaga agus beirt mhúinteoir i ngach ceann acu. Nuair a dhéanfar na scoileanna a dhúnadh beidh sé múinteoirí sa cheantar agus, abair, nach mó ná 40 daltaí i ngach scoil, 120 daltaí ar fad.  Cuir i gcás go dtógtar scoil mhór nua.  An mbeidh na sé múinteoirí seo ag freastal ar an scoil nua?  Muna mbíonn aon ghá leo, cad a tharlóidh dóibh?</P>
    <P>Tá ceist eile fós ann&mdash;ceist a bhaineas le mo Dháil-Cheantar féin. Tá scoil ann ina bhfuil trí múinteoirí agus suas le 75 daltaí sa bhun-scoil. Fuarthas leitir ón Roinn á rá go raibh sé beartaithe ag an Roinn an scoil sin a dhúnadh.  Sílim nach é sin an dóigh ceart chun deighleáil leis an gceist seo. Ba chóir na cúrsaí a chur in iúl do na tuismitheoirí.  Níor chóir, ach oiread, gurab é an chéad scéal a gheobhfaí an leitir a chuirfí chun an sagart paróiste nó chun bainisteoir na scoile á rá leis go bhfuil sé deimhnithe ag an Roinn an scoil a dhúnadh.  Ba chóir go mbeadh i bhfad níos mó cómhoibriú san obair seo.  Tá súil againn go mbeidh cúpla focal le rá ag an Aire mar gheall air sin agus go n-abróidh sé linn conas is féidir an scéal seo go léir a chur i gcrích.  Conas a bhreathnófar an ndúnfar nó nach ndúnfar an scoil?  An é an t-aon bhrainse amháin den Roinn a dhéanfas an deimhniú nó an gcuir-fear ceisteanna ar na tuismitheoirí agus ar na bainisteoirí nó an mbeidh aon fhocal le rá acu faoi?</P>
    <P>Bíodh nach bhfuil aon bhaint agam le cúrsaí oideachais&mdash;dar ndóigh sa mhéid gur chuamar go léir go dtí an bunscoil agus ansin go dtí an mheánscoil agus indiaidh sin go scoileanna eile tá baint againn le cúrsaí oideachais &mdash;níl duine in Éirinn nach bhfuil suim <Col N="1596" /> san oideachas aige.  Más Teachta Dála thú caithfidh suim speisialta a bheith agat sna cúrsaí sin.  Sílim nach bhfuil aon mhaitheas sa teastas bunscoile faoi láthair agus ceapaim go bhfuil a lán daoine eile den tuairim chéanna, fiú an tAire féin.  Ba mhaith liom a fhios a bheith agam an bhfuil sé ar aon intinn liom sa mhéid seo agus an bhfuil sé beartaithe aige feabhas a chur ar an dteastas mar níl aon mheas ag na múinteoirí nó ag na daltaí in iarthar na hÉireann ar an dteastas i láthair na h-uaire.</P>
    <P>Ní h-áil liom moill a chur ar ghnó an Tí.  Níor theastaigh uaim ach cúpla smaoineamh a nochtadh agus tá súil agam go mbeidh ar chumas an Aire freagra sásúil a thúirt ar mo chuid pointí ar deireadh thiar thall.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to detain the House but there are a few comments I should like to make on this Supplementary Estimate.  There are two Votes here relating to the financing of surveys one of which had been published and the other of which had not yet been published.  Coming from the constituency I represent, I must put first things first.  I have referred on other occasions to the Commission on Higher Education.  I must express my disappointment at the delays in publishing the report of that Commission.  The Minister states here that only a token provision of £10 was made in the original Estimate for 1965-66 and he said the Commission might be in a position to complete its work by the end of the financial year 1964-65.  We are now approaching the end of the financial year 1965-66 and there is no sign of this report being published yet.  In reply to a question I directed to the Minister last week, he informed me that it was hoped to publish this report as early as possible this year.  I should like, when he is replying to this debate, if the Minister would give us some reason for the delay.  I remember, a year ago, or perhaps longer, a Government spokesman in my constituency stating categorically that the Commission on Higher Education would issue its report&mdash;I think it was in May, 1965.  Then we were given <Col N="1597" /> to understand that it would be out in July, 1965.  As I say, we are now going into 1966 and there is yet no sign of this report.  Various rumours are circulating as to why it is not being published.  I never take any notice of rumours but I am serious in asking the Minister to throw some light on the situation, when he is replying to this debate.</P>
      <P>In raising this matter, I have a personal interest in this report by reason of the fact that the constituency I represent has been campaigning and agitating for a university.  Evidence was given to the Commission on Higher Education by the Limerick University Committee and they have established an unanswerable case.  I am confident &mdash;and some of my colleagues on the Government side of the House have said they are also&mdash;that when the Commission's report is issued, it must concede that we in Limerick will have to get a university.</P>
      <P>We do not like this idea of dillydallying and delay in issuing the report of the Commission on Higher Education. We want to know why this report has not been issued.  What is the reason for the delay and when in fact will it be issued?  We are not now satisfied with replies that it will be issued as soon as possible. There must be some reason for holding it up for more than 12 months.</P>
      <P>The report of the survey team appointed by the Minister is a very interesting and valuable document because, for the first time, it provides us with a comprehensive review of our educational system.  It is full of very valuable factual information and certainly the survey team, within their terms of reference, in my humble opinion, have done a very good job. The report gives us a pretty clear picture of the problems that have to be tackled if we are to gear our educational system to meet the challenge ahead.  By studying this report, we can get some idea of the tremendous problems that have to be tackled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report has not made any recommendations&mdash;that was not within the terms of reference of the survey team &mdash;but it has painted a picture of the situation as it is and has furnished us with very valuable statistical information. <Col N="1598" /> It has shown a situation wherein a considerable proportion of boys and girls receive no post-primary education.  We see from the figures that have been produced the inadequacy of our post-primary and higher educational facilities.  We get some idea of the physical, financial and geographical problems that have to be overcome before we can reach the stage in our educational development that we all desire, no matter on which side of the House we are, that is, the stage where every boy and girl leaving the primary school, who has the ability, talent or desire to proceed to secondary or technical school and even to university, will be enabled to do so, irrespective of the financial status of his or her parents.  This report, if it does nothing else but make us aware of the colossal problem that has to be tackled, will have done a very good job.</P>
    <P>Most of the debate tonight has been taken up in dealing with the pros and cons of the amalgamation of schools. This word &ldquo;amalgamation&rdquo; is becoming more and more topical as time goes on.  In my constituency the other day a document was issued in regard to the amalgamation of a considerable number of creameries.  This question of the one- and two-teacher schools is one on which I have a very open mind but I do regret that a controversy has raged about it and that the Minister has left himself open to a certain extent to this controversy.</P>
    <P>This is a question that no Deputy can answer categorically.  Deputy Jones has been most constructive and has faced up to the problem in the only way possible when he said that it is a matter that cannot be dealt with by blanket legislation covering the whole country.  In fact, the report of the survey team makes a similar reference when they say, at paragraph 16.18, page 392:</P>
    <P>We would finally like to emphasise the need for experimental testing of new educational strategies on a local and pilot basis before such strategies are introduced on a regional or national basis.</P>
    <P>That should be the approach.  The report, while it does not make recommendations <Col N="1599" /> as such, puts forward certain suggestions.  The main thesis put forward is the need for a special unit within the Department of Education, an advisory body, development unit&mdash; call it what you like.  There is definite need for such a body within the Department to advise the Minister and the Department on new approaches, reorganisation or whatever else it may be.  If such a body had existed within the Department of Education, this controversy now raging and all this hullabaloo as to the pros and cons of amalgamation, would have been avoided.</P>
    <P>I would reiterate what the survey team said on page 388, paragraph 16.3:</P>
    <P>Educational planning machinery must be an integral part of the administration of the Department of Education and should be in no sense a mere statistical adjunct to that Department or an advisory body. The aim here is to ensure that every decision concerning education can be informed by all relevant facts and by an understanding of the implications of these facts, not merely for the educational system but for the economy.</P>
    <P>I thoroughly agree with practically everything said in Chapter Sixteen of this report.  I urge the Minister to lose no time in setting up the unit suggested within his Department.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lindsay posed a number of questions in regard to the proposed amalgamation of one- and two-teacher schools and did not attempt to answer them.  When it comes to a one-teacher school having to be replaced, the situation should be thoroughly examined. All the facts and all the aspects should be thoroughly assessed and all concerned with the school&mdash;parents, teachers, managers, and so on&mdash;should be consulted before a decision is taken. That is the correct approach.  Perhaps physical and geographical problems may arise in an area.  There may be problems arising from the collection of children where a transport system is provided and, in isolated rural areas, where homes may be a distance from the main road and on narrow by-roads <Col N="1600" /> that cannot be reached by ordinary means of transport.  Both these problems should be examined on a scientific, methodical basis and the views of all concerned should be obtained and evaluated before any binding decision is taken.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Drumcondra Road (Dublin) Subpostoffice.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. P. Byrne Mr. P. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Last Thursday I asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs &ldquo;if a new subpostmaster has been appointed to Drumcondra Road subpostoffice and, if so, if he will state the name of the person appointed, his age and qualifications; whether suitable premises are available; if so, where; whether the present acting sub-postmistress applied for the position; and, if so, why she was not appointed.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister replied that Mr. Thomas F. Gray had been appointed; he had &ldquo;offered suitable premises in Lower Drumcondra Road near the present suboffice which he expected to be able to provide.  It now transpires that he is unable to provide these premises and he is endeavouring to secure alternative premises in the area.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I accuse the Minister of having engaged in political patronage in this appointment.  I accuse him of having perpetrated a grave act of injustice. He has appointed this gentleman, the chairman of the Fianna Fáil executive in the adjoining constituency of Dublin North Central, a man, who, two years ago, was co-opted as a Fianna Fáil member of the Dublin City Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would refer the Minister now to a form with which he ought to be familiar, Form M.P. 188 of his Department. That is the official form of application <Col N="1601" /> upon which applicants are required to furnish their personal particulars when applying for positions as subpostmasters or subpostmistresses. This form has emblazoned across the top the following admonishment: &ldquo;Political influence must not be sought in support of this application.  The appointment is made solely with a view to the efficiency of the service and on an impartial comparison of the qualifications of the candidates.&rdquo;  It is furthermore my information&mdash;the Minister will correct me if I am wrong; I invite him to do so&mdash;that there is in the rules of the post office service a specific prohibition on participation by subpostmasters in any political activity. Form M.P. 188 refers to an impartial comparison of the qualifications of the candidates.  Such a comparison has not been made in this case.  The facts are irrefutable and can be neither denied nor contradicted.</P>
    <P>Mr. Gray, the Minister informed me, is 64 years of age.  He is, in fact, a retired official of Dublin Corporation. He, I presume, like other retired corporation officials, enjoys a retirement pension.  The person who is at present acting as subpostmistress is a Miss K. Farrell.  She is in her early thirties.  She has worked in this office for the past eight years under two subpostmistresses; first, under Miss Haslam and subsequently under Mrs. Dooly, who was appointed five years ago.  In actual fact, for the past five years, Miss Farrell has done most of the work in this subpostoffice.  She is highly experienced, highly thought of in the area and well liked by the customers.  When Mrs. Dooly retired four or five months ago, Miss Farrell was appointed acting subpostmistress in her place.  She bought the goodwill of the little tobacconist's shop which is run in these premises.  She enjoys a tenancy of the premises.</P>
    <P>It is the invarible practice to require applicants for these posts to set out on Form M.P. 188 the premises in which they propose to operate the post office. They are required to go into considerable detail in regard to the terms of their tenancy and related technical matters.  Mr. Gray is now in the position <Col N="1602" /> that he has no premises available and my information is that he will find it extremely difficult to get a premises. Many of the shopkeepers in the area who were contemplating applying for the post did not do so in deference to Miss Farrell's application.  I am told, indeed, that at least one applicant withdrew his application when he learned what the position was.</P>
    <P>There is acute indignation in the area because of what has happened. The whole thing is extremely unfortunate. I have no wish to detain the House or the Minister in discussing this small but by no means unimportant matter.  When this State was set up 45 years ago, one of the first acts was to set up the Appointments Commission, of which, I think, you, Sir, are chairman.  This body was appointed for the purpose of ensuring that public positions are filled by those best qualified to discharge the duties of the particular office for the purpose of removing all taint of patronage from appointments to the Civil Service and the public services generally.</P>
    <P>To suggest that a 64 year old man &mdash;I should be interested to know if his birth certificate was, in fact, inspected by the Department&mdash;a man enjoying a retirement pension is suitably qualified to discharge the duties of a subpostoffice adequately is patently absurd.  To suggest he is better qualified than the young lady with eight years' experience of the work borders on the ludicrous.  It is clear now that an impartial comparison of the candidates was not, in fact, made. Again, I accuse the Minister of exercising political patronage for the benefit of this member of his political Party.  I invite the Minister to state whether or not there is in the rules of the Post Office a specific prohibition against participation in politics and, further, to tell us if Mr. Gray is, in fact, going to resign from the Fianna Fáil Party.  He has taken the bite out of the mouth of this decent little woman, this man who enjoys at least one public pension and maybe two. The Minister is perpetrating an act of injustice.</P>
    <P>I do not know that there is an awful <Col N="1603" /> lot more to say about it, except perhaps, that this sort of thing has happened before.  Several years ago there was the notorious so-called Battle of Baltinglass&mdash;and in fairness, let it be said that neither the Minister nor his Party was in office at the time &mdash;about the schemozzle of the subpostmistress in Baltinglass.  That was an act of injustice, as is this.</P>
    <P>It is time we rose above this form of political patronage, which is a festering sore in the political life of this country.  It is the sort of thing which makes people cynical about politics and politicians.  It is the sort of action which brings discredit to all of us and I implore the Minister to set a new tone in the affairs of his Department. If he does so, he will rid himself, and all his successors, of bally-ragging and string-pulling in these petty public appointments; string-pulling to which Ministers of State ought not be subject.</P>
    <P>I recall ten or 12 years ago the case of a very decent man who was a member of Dublin Corporation in the labour interest, Walter Breathnach. He was a postman and he was given the choice by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs of giving up his job as a postman or resigning from the corporation.  He gave up his job as a postman.</P>
    <P>It is a long standing tradition in the public service in this country, at Civil Service level, that participation in politics is taboo.  It is a good tradition and one which should be adhered to on every side of public administration. In this year of grace, 1966, when we are celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Rising, it ill becomes the Minister to suggest that because this man holds a military service medal&mdash; presumably for old IRA service&mdash;he is, therefore, entitled to preference over this decent little woman whose livelihood is being taken from her. It is not the sort of thing for which the IRA came out and fought 50 years ago.  They would be the first to disown the Minister's action.</P>
    <P>I want to know from the Minister <Col N="1604" /> has Mr. Gray yet furnished the address of a suitable premises.  It is a fact that persons appointed to these positions are required to make their premises available and I understand it is quite without precedent for a Department of State to lean over backwards and give a person extended time to furnish a premises.  I hope the Minister, in his reply, will succeed in doing something he did not succeed in doing last week, that is, avoid personalities.  I am sorry that none of my colleagues from North-East Dublin is here tonight.  I regard the absence of the Government Deputies for my constituency as their repudiation of the Minister's action.</P>
    <P>There is little more for me to say on the matter, except, once more, to renew my plea of a few moments ago, and quietly and dispassionately, to urge the Minister&mdash;whom we all respect&mdash;to bring a new look to bear on the affairs of his Department and, in this year of grace, to implement the noble theory of the Proclamation of 1916&mdash;&ldquo;To cherish all the children of the nation equally&rdquo;.  That is not being done in this case.  I could say that with much greater passion and more vehemently but I am deliberately restraining myself to say these things quietly to the Minister in the hope that some constructive good will come of this development, to appeal to him, even at this late stage, to rectify the injustice he has perpetrated, and to warn him that this is not the end of the affair.</P>
    <P>I should be grateful, Sir, if you would facilitate my colleague, Deputy Ryan, for the remaining time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister last week assured us that Councillor Gray had, as a condition of his appointment, to provide premises.  The Minister gave us also to understand that Councillor Gray had conveyed to the interview board information which gave them grounds for believing that the premises would be made available.  The Minister now knows that whatever information was given has not been justified by subsequent events and that Mr. <Col N="1605" /> Gray has no premises available.  This is utterly and completely deplorable and is an indication of the person's total unfitness for the job.</P>
      <P>Not having premises available for himself, he has since endeavoured to bring unpleasant pressure to bear upon the existing acting subpostmistress. Having sought from her a sub-tenancy which was refused, he again entered her premises with a second request for a sub-tenancy which she again refused and, not being satisfied with that refusal, he then resorted to the solicitors for the ground landlords of the premises in an endeavour to purchase the ground landlords' interests for the purpose of compulsorily buying out this tenant, or compulsorily evicting her from the premises.  I do not know if that is what the Minister and his advisers regard as being the kind of method which would be justified to make premises available for Mr. Gray but it is utterly and completely deplorable and there is no person in this city who would not repudiate that kind of conduct.  In no circumstances can this person acquire the premises of the present subpostmistress, who has some principle and who will not house in her premises the person appointed under these particular circumstances.</P>
      <P>It would also seem to be apt that the Department should, in all cases, consider the capital cost involved in changing post office premises from one place to another.  Again, we do not know the particular location of the would-be post office, but this we do know, that even if it had existed, it would have involved considerable expense in moving telephone and other equipment from a premises situate there for over 30 years&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am told these premises have been in use for over 50 years as a subpostoffice and yet it can all be changed overnight because of the appointment of a man who is a Fianna Fáil city councillor and chairman of the Fianna Fáil Party in Dublin North-Central. His association with that type of patronage is not new.  He was appointed to Dublin Corporation to replace another man&mdash;Councillor <Col N="1606" /> Macken&mdash;another Fianna Fáil Councillor who was appointed as film censor.  Is there to be no end to the series and succession of acts of patronage on the part of Fianna Fáil?  As Deputy P. Byrne for the area has people, it simply remains for us to speak of the indignation of all decent speak the indignation of all decent people who are appalled that the Government should be so brazen in this exercise of patronage.</P>

      <P>This dramatisation of an ordinary function of mine could occur here practically every day the Dáil sits, if some person on one side or the other wished to take the same action.

      <P>It is finally the Minister's prerogative to make the decision.  That is the decision I have made now.  That is what I am here to defend tonight.  Practically every week the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs makes these decisions in respect of one subpostoffice or another somewhere in the country.  The procedure followed the same lines all along.  Let me say that irrespective of whether it was Fine Gael, the inter-Party Government, or Fianna Fáil, who appointed them, by and large they got reasonably good all round subpostmasters and subpostmistresses, but some years ago, as the Deputy said, there was a glaring case of what the public thought was victimisation in some part of the country and there was a great to-do about it.  Following that the system was changed, and this made it infinitely easier for any Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to make these appointments since then.</P>

      <P>It was decided that an independent board would, in all cases, go into the applications of the different people interested, assess their <Col N="1607" /> merits, and ultimately place on a list the names of those whom they considered to be qualified.  Not more than three names would be on that list. Any person who has held the office of Minister for Posts and Telegraphs will confirm what I say.  This board very carefully vets the qualifications of all concerned from every aspect and finally submits not more than three names.  In this case, three names were submitted to me.  I have the particulars here but unlike the other speaker, I am not going to try to denigrate in any way the qualifications of any of the others in order to put one of them on a pedestal.  I will say this: the person I appointed was on that list and in my opinion, was not merely qualified but was best qualified for the post.</P>

      <P>Do not try to shout me down.  The one thing I deprecate more than anything else is that this was not discussed in a calm dispassionate way without trying to put someone on a pedestal at the expense <Col N="1612" /> of running down a decent applicant. That is exactly what Deputy Byrne tried to do.  The previous speaker could not do it but he took it on himself to do it.  I will not for one moment try to highlight the qualifications of Tom Gray by running down the girl who did not succeed.  I hope this will serve as an example, because every time a subpostoffice is filled, there are a number of people who are not appointed, and someone could come into this House and dramatise the situation on behalf of some of the unsuccessful candidates.  That could go on for all time.</P>
