      <P>I wish to support the motion:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann draws attention to the decline in the number of houses being built in recent years and to the serious consequences resulting from the current restriction on finance available for housing, and calls on the Government to take effective steps to ensure that the output of houses is immediately expanded and that the necessary finance is made available for this purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last night I mentioned the flourish of trumpets with which this Bill was introduced by the Minister.  The Bill had been promised for years.  There were great expectations about it and numerous promises were made; but now that it is here, we find very little incentive in it.  I also mentioned that at present throughout the length and breadth of the country there are restrictions <Col N="352" /> on house-building.  House-building is slowly grinding to a halt. In some cases contractors are unable to finish houses they have started. There are half-built houses to be seen along the main roads in my own county.  The contractors have had to leave them because the money was not forthcoming.</P>
    <P>The Minister is being questioned daily in regard to money for local authorities.  Instead of facing up to his responsibilities and telling the people the truth, he dodges the issue and refuses to give a proper answer.  Perhaps the Minister is to be admired for his political skill in devising methods of side-tracking the various questions he is asked in regard to housing loans. So far as he is concerned, politics is no longer the art of the possible but an exercise in the art of avoiding responsibility.  Parliament, so far as the Minister is concerned, has become a place not where problems are faced or questions answered but where they are circumvented.  That can be seen any day here at Question Time.  It might be better in the long run for all the people concerned, local authorities and those who are either building houses or intend to build them, to tell them the full truth and let them know exactly where they stand.  I believe they would appreciate it much better if they knew the exact position.</P>
    <P>The county councils are frustrated in their efforts to get loans and grants. House-building has been held up by the present Minister for a long number of years.  Every time plans were sent up to him from my county, they were sent back again to dot the i's and cross the t's; changes were recommended here and changes were recommended there.  It took two to three years to sanction those plans and to do the work which could properly be done in a few months if the Minister were prepared or wanted to give the green light to go ahead with the building of houses.  We should face facts and not try to fool ourselves or to fool the people of the country.  Let there be no doubt about it, no matter what political commentators on Telefís Éireann or broadcasters from <Col N="353" /> Radio Éireann or Telefís Éireann or anybody else may say about housing, the dead hand of Fianna Fáil has fallen on housing and house-building since 1956.</P>
    <P>If we look up the OEEC report as regards housing units completed per 1,000 inhabitants of this State, we find some interesting comparisons: Austria, 5.9; Belgium, 6.0; Canada, 7.8; Denmark, 8.2; France, 7.6; Germany, our new-found ally, 10.7; Greece, one of the poorest countries in Europe, 7.0; Iceland, 7.0; and, down at the bottom rung of the ladder, Ireland with 3.2. There is no use in my saying that the dead hand of Fianna Fáil has fallen on house-building in this country unless we can give the figures.  The people are entitled to be told the truth and the whole truth and to be given the full facts.</P>
    <P>In the <i>Statistical Abstract of Ireland</i> for 1964, we find at table 157 on page 214, some housing statistics&mdash;the number of houses built by local authorities under State-aided schemes over the years ending 31st March. Deputy Blaney, the present Minister for Local Government, was on the Opposition benches in 1956 and nobody was louder in denunciation of the then Government as regards their housing scheme.  We find that in that year&mdash;1956&mdash;4,011 houses were built.  In 1957, 4,784 houses were built. Then the dead hand of Fianna Fáil fell, despite all their planning, despite all the programmes they told us they had for the people of Ireland and for the good of the people of Ireland. However, as far as Fianna Fáil are concerned, it is always pie in the sky; it is always in the future.  It is always round the turn, always when we get over the hill.  It is never at the present time.  We are concerned with the present.</P>
    <P>In 1958, when Fianna Fáil were a year in office, the number of houses built dropped from 4,011 to 3,467, a reduction of 500.  Then came 1959 with 1,812 houses built which is a reduction of over 2,000 compared with 1956.  Let us come to 1960 when there was a slight increase in the number of houses built, to 2,414.  In 1961, the <Col N="354" /> dead hand is there and the number dropped to 1,463.  In 1962, it dropped to 1,238 and for 1963, the figure is 1,828.  Despite the fact that Fianna Fáil were six years in office at that time, they were still not building half as many houses as were being built in 1956.</P>
    <P>We said in our motion that there is a decline in the number of houses being built.  When the Minister stands up to reply, he will tell us the very opposite but figures are figures and facts are facts.  If the Government neglected to do their duty in those six years, then on their shoulders rests responsibility for the fact that our people are not being housed today and that we are at the bottom of the list, lower than Greece and Iceland.  It is a disgraceful situation for any Minister of a Government in office for over 30 years in this State.</P>
    <P>Let us take the number of houses built and reconstructed with State assistance for the years ending 31st March and, again, this information is to be found in the same official statistics, table 158, page 214.  If we again go back and, under the heading of new houses built by the local authorities, take the figures for the rural areas of Ireland in 1956, we get some interesting information.  We know that there are slums even in rural Ireland.  The small farmers are the worst housed section of our community. The Government of that day, despite the fact that there were financial stringencies and that they were finding it hard to get money, were at the same time, putting the money into the building of houses for our people. They were not putting it into the building of luxury hotels, for which the Minister's Deputy from Cork condemned him last night.  Today, when we cannot get money for housing, we can get £25,000 to build a new Embassy in Lagos.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government are able to spend £100,000 on two elections.  It would be much better if <Col N="355" /> they spent that money on providing houses for our unfortunate people who need them.  The country is being put to the uncertainty and expense of £100,000 for two elections at a time when it would be much better if the Minister provided unfortunate people with proper housing.  Let us take 1956, the disastrous year according to the present Minister for Local Government when he was in opposition.  In rural Ireland, the number of new houses built by local authorities in rural areas in 1956 was 1,648.  In 1957, the number was 1,617.  Then Fianna Fáil came into power.  It is extraordinary how propaganda can get across to people.  When Fianna Fáil Deputies get up here to speak and one after another, talk about the wonderful housing record of the Fianna Fáil Party, I wonder if they ever look up the figures or try to get the facts or is it just that they shout out what has been supplied to them from Mount Street?  The facts are there for anybody to see.</P>
      <P>After the return of the Fianna Fáil Government, the number of houses built by local authorities in rural Ireland declined from 1,648 in 1956 to 648 in 1959.  The figure for 1960 was 730 and for 1961 it was 627.  This reading out of figures might bore the House, and so I shall come down to 1963 when 485 houses were being built in rural Ireland by local authorities&mdash;one quarter of the number built in 1956, the disastrous year, when, according to Deputy P. J. Burke, the then Government had not the price of a bag of cement.  The whole picture has changed.  It now seems as if this Government have not the price of the bag, never mind the price of the cement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have given the House figures taken from the official statistics which cannot be denied by any Fianna Fáil Deputy, by &ldquo;Truth in the News&rdquo; or by anybody else.  There was a decline in the building of houses in rural areas by local authorities from 1,648 to 485 in 1964.  As a matter of fact, there were more houses built in what was, according to the people on the far side of the House, the disastrous year, <Col N="356" /> 1956, than there were in the four glorious Fianna Fáil years from 1961 to 1964.  I doubt that that is a record that any Party can be proud of.</P>
    <P>Let us take new houses built by local authorities in urban areas.  Again, in this disastrous year, 1956, there were 2,363 houses built.  In 1957&mdash;the plans were laid during the years before&mdash;there were 3,167 new houses built for the people.  Then the withering hand of the Fianna Fáil Party took over and the figure declined to as low as 836 in 1961 and 783 in 1962.</P>
    <P>Is it any wonder that there is a housing shortage when for six long years the Government neglected to do their duty?  In 1962, for example, which is supposed to be a glorious year for the Fianna Fáil Party, the number of houses built was less than one-third of the number of houses that were being built in 1956 and only one-fifth of the number of houses that were completed in 1957.  Fianna Fáil will have to admit that that is a record of which nobody could be proud and that on their shoulders alone lies the responsibility because for six long years they were asleep and failed to do their duty to the people.</P>
    <P>If we take the total under the heading houses built with State aid in the same table we find that, in 1956, the number of houses built with State aid was 9,837 and, in 1957, the number was 10,969.  Again, the withering hand took over.  Although the people on the far side of the House will say that no Party other than Fianna Fáil built houses and although one may hear that sort of statement at every crossroads, the figures cannot be denied. From a figure of 10,969 the decline started.  The figures were : 7,480 in 1958; 4,894 in 1959; 5,992 in 1960 and the decline continued.  The figure was 5,626 in 1962.  There was an increase in the next year and the total had gone up, in 1964, to 7,431.  Remember, the figure was 3,500 higher seven years before that, when Fianna Fáil were not in power.</P>
    <P>If Fianna Fáil are not prepared to believe those figures they may refer to these tables.  The figures are a clear <Col N="357" /> indictment of the Government's failure for six years to face up to their responsibility to build houses for the people.</P>
    <P>Let us go to page 216 and take table 161.  I see some Dublin Deputies here.  It might be no harm to state for their information that even as far back as 1951 there were 3,006 persons employed in building houses in Dublin County Borough.  In 1956, there were 1,943 persons employed in building houses in County Dublin.  The withering hand took over again.  One has only to read these statistics to see the trend.  In 1952, as I have already said, the figure was 3,006.  In 1959, the number employed in building houses dropped to 532 and in 1960, a glorious year for Fianna Fáil, there were only 383 persons employed in the building of houses in the whole of the County Borough of Dublin.</P>
    <P>Is it any wonder that there is a shortage of houses?  I know the Deputy is flabbergasted.  He can hardly believe the figures.  All he has to do is to look at page 216 of the official statistics and he will see that for Dublin County Borough, in that glorious year of 1960, there were 383 persons employed in building houses.  When there was another Government in power that they condemned so viciously in the past, there were as many as 3,006 persons employed in building houses in Dublin County Borough.</P>
    <P>I could spend too long a time quoting figures but those figures cannot be denied.  They are in the official statistics.  I will now take the figures for the average number of men employed in local authority housing schemes, classified by areas.  I will not quote the number employed in urban areas and rural areas.  I will take the total for the whole country.  I want to pay this tribute to the late Deputy Murphy who was Minister for Local Government at the time, that he came down to Mullingar in 1948, and said that he was prepared to cut all the red tape and get ahead with the building of houses.  The war had been over three years.  While cinemas and dancehalls were being built there had not been one single cottage started in Mullingar <Col N="358" /> and Athlone.  The plans were in the office for a long number of years and the dust was on them.  The late Deputy Murphy came to Mullingar and made that statement and thereafter there were glorious years with regard to house building with the result that, in 1951, there were 11,470 Irishmen employed at home in Ireland building houses for the Irish people.  In 1956 the figure had dropped.  It was 6,015.</P>

      <P>That old story is finished.  Deputy Burke stated that you had not the price of a bag of cement. Now you have not the price of the bag. There is no use in denying it.  You are rushing to the Germans who, battered and bleeding after the last war, had to build up their own country.  They even had to make the machinery to do the work.  We were not affected by the war.  You are running to borrow money from the Germans to build up our country.  The ESB could float a £6 million loan yesterday which was oversubscribed in ten minutes but the Government could not because they would not get it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyOConnor" hpid="Mr. O'Connor Mr. O'Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>The inter-party Government ran away from the job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>They ran away from nothing.  They went before the country in an election as they were entitled to do.  They accepted, as they always do, the verdict of the Irish people.  They governed wisely and justly.  If the Irish people were fooled and if they voted otherwise, that was their own fault.  Here is what happened to the labouring people employed in building houses in 195 and 1957, when they voted for the Fianna Fáil Party.  In 1957 there were 6,015 people employed in house building.  Then the withering hand of Fianna Fáil took over.  In 1957, the plans were there; the Government who preceded them had sanctioned the plans and given out the contracts.  The people had started building and Fianna Fáil could neither sack them nor dismiss <Col N="359" /> them because the work had to be finished.  After they had been a year in office, there were 6,015 houses.  What happened then?  After a year and a half, in 1958, the figure had dropped to 3,563, a drop of 3,000 within a year of Fianna Fáil returning to office.  But they were not satisfied with that.  They thought there were too many employed in building houses.  They thought the people might be a little bit too prosperous. In 1959 the figure is down by a further 1,000 to the grand total of 2,567.</P>
      <P>Are you proud of that?  If you had the money then, why had you 4,000 fewer people employed in building houses in 1959 as compared with 1956 and 1957?  Is that a record of which you can be proud?  If the money was there, why did you not build the houses?  Why did you not give employment to our own people in building houses?  Is it any wonder 300,000 left the country between 1956 and 1963 and went across to your new-found friend John Bull?  But you were not satisfied with these figures.  You still thought&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government still thought there were too many people employed in building houses and we find in 1960 Fianna Fáil, with their wonderful government, able to reduce the number of Irishmen employed in their own country building houses to 1,662.  At that stage they had succeeded in knocking almost 5,000 people out of employment in their own country, and that in a period of four years.  Is that a record of which any Party can be proud?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The figure in 1961 was 1,694.  Credit where credit is due, there is a slight increase in 1962; the figure goes up to 2,170.  In 1963, however, the figure stands at 2,189 Irishmen employed in building houses, exactly one-third the number employed in the disastrous year of 1956.  There is a fraud being perpetrated by the Fianna Fáil Party on the Irish people.  That is their record and these figures cannot be denied. They are not Fine Gael propaganda. <Col N="360" /> These are the figures published by the Central Statistics Office.  They are there for any Fianna Fáil Deputy, or anybody else, who wants to read and study them.  It might be no harm if Fianna Fáil Deputies did read and digest them.  If they did they might discontinue the fraud.</P>
    <P>It was only when houses started to fall down on the people in Dublin a few years ago that Fianna Fáil did anything about house building.  I heard a Cork Deputy quite recently speaking about the glorious record of Cork Corporation.  I thought it would be no harm to look up the figures.  I am sorry the Deputy is not here now, because the figures are rather interesting.  In the disastrous year of 1956 there was a house built for every day of the year by Cork Corporation, 365 houses. In 1957 there were 491 houses built. In 1961 the figure dropped to 240.  In 1962 the figure was 226 and, in 1963, it was 182, one-third of the number built in 1956 and 1957.</P>
    <P>The rural slums in Ireland today are a disgrace to each and every one of us. The small farmers are the worst housed section in the community.  There is very little in this Bill designed to help them.  Those of us who have enjoyed happy days in the west have seen the little thatched homes with the wet seeping in through the roofs, the windows broken and the general state of disrepair.  These people were not in a position to build houses for themselves and many of them unfortunately emigrated.</P>
    <P>One of the yardsticks by which any Government can be measured is by the number of houses they build for the people.  If one uses that yardstick to judge the present Government, one must admit immediately that they are a failure.  Instead of houses being closed down in rural Ireland, the doors locked and people emigrating, we should all like to see new houses built for them with the aid of Government grants and loans.  We would all like to hear the patter of little feet and see the smoke curling from the chimneypots. Unfortunately, that is not the picture in rural Ireland today.  Because of the desperate state of agriculture under Fianna Fáil these people were <Col N="361" /> not in a position to avail of the grants and loans alleged to be available.</P>
    <P>When our Government left office, we were criticised by Fianna Fáil; we were accused by them of having built too many houses and not having enough tenants to occupy them.  Far from regarding that as adverse criticism, we look on it as something of which to be proud.  I have heard Dublin representatives here speaking about house building in Dublin and the number of vacancies.  I have heard Deputy Moore and Deputy Dowling&mdash; it is a pity they are not here now&mdash; state there were as many as 1,500 or 1,600 vacancies in Dublin in 1956 and 1957.  The people are entitled to the truth.  They are entitled to know exactly what the position was in Dublin over the years.</P>
    <P>Last November the Minister for Local Government issued a White Paper on housing progress and housing prospects.  We find that in 1956 there were 639 vacancies in existing dwellings in the city of Dublin.  In 1957, that figure increased to 794, and in 1958, it was 986.  The moment Fianna Fáil came back to power, as regards house-building and the number of people employed in that activity, the withering hand of that Party caused the figures to drop, drop, drop in all those sections.  Of course, in this section the figures start to increase: in 1959, there were 1,294 vacancies; in 1960, it had risen to 1,393, and in 1961, it rose to 1,605, the figure which Fianna Fáil are always quoting as having applied when the inter-Party Government were in power; but it was in 1961 that the figure was 1,600 and not in 1956-57 as they tell us across the House from time to time.</P>
    <P>When the Minister was introducing this Bill he made certain accusations. He said there were certain county councils in Ireland with Fine Gael and Labour majorities who were trying to hamper the housing programme.  I have indicated the housing programme we hampered, where under Fianna Fáil the number dropped by twothirds. In any case they told us they would not give the supplementary loans and grants.  Deputy Jones put down a question a week ago and we <Col N="362" /> find the truth is&mdash;it might be better if we got it more often from the Minister when he is asked questions instead of his trying to dodge the issue&mdash;that in every county council in Ireland where Fine Gael or Labour had a majority, the supplementary grants were being paid, and the only county in Ireland where they were not being paid was one of the small number of counties where Fianna Fáil have a majority, Kerry.  It would be much better if the Minister directed his fire and his anger at members of his own Party instead of at people on this side of the House.</P>

      <P>I am not talking about what they did in 1951 when there was an inter-Party county council in Kerry.  I know they were given then.  In Westmeath, we had a county council controlled by Labour and Fine Gael and we paid them the moment they were announced.  Kerry did it then because the county council was controlled by Fine Gael, Labour and Clann na Poblachta.  However, to their shame and disgrace, now that there is a Fianna Fáil majority on Kerry county council they are not paying the grants.</P>

      <P>The question was asked last week and that is the answer we got.  No effort is being made even in this Bill to cut out the red tape and the cumbersome routine that can be used, and indeed has been used, by the Minister over the past seven years to slow up or prevent the building of houses.  I cannot understand why there must be two different sets of experts, two different sets of engineers, and why the one would not do.  If the Minister were in earnest&mdash;I think he is only shadowboxing&mdash;he could arrange for those plans to be drawn up either by the county council officials and engineers or by the Local Government officials and engineers, have them sent down to the county councils for execution and so get the work going.  Instead of that, the plans are sent up to the Department by qualified engineers from the different counties.  The Department engineers then have to vet them. It generally takes months to change the plans and to send them down again.  In many cases, as the Minister has done deliberately over the past six years in order to hold up the building of houses, the plans were sent up, sent down, up again and down again.  In the meantime, due also to Government action and to the fact that they allowed the cost of living to rise without any intervention on their part, the cost of building has increased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In County Westmeath, having advertised for tenders and got them, we were refused sanction for the building of houses.  The Minister said the price was too high.  I remember one time a price was quoted and the county manager was instructed to write back to the Department to say he believed the price <Col N="364" /> was a competitive price and that we should get ahead with the building.  The Minister refused to sanction it.  In three or four months' time he gave us permission to readvertise and when we did so, we had to accept a tender which was £50 to £65 more than the Minister had originally turned down. This leads to the slowing up of house-building.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, when this Bill was introduced, there was a lot of publicity in regard to this Bill.  The Minister held a press conference in Dublin and I want to quote one thing he said: &ldquo;In general the Bill is directed towards giving new aid and assistance.&rdquo;  With the depreciation in the value of money, there is no new aid being given or no encouragement being given to people to build houses. Away back in 1948 the supplementary grant given was £275.  In 1949-50, the inter-Party Government gave permission for the local authorities to give an additional supplementary grant.  At that time the people were entitled to £550 in grants for house building.  A person could get an average-size house built at that time for £1,200 to £1,500.  In other words, at that time he was getting from 45 to 50 per cent in grants for building a house.  Money has lost value and compared with 1948, the pound is worth only about 8/6 or 9/-.</P>
    <P>What increase has the Minister given to people to build their houses today?  The grants remain the same as they were in 1948, despite the fact that it costs from two to three times as much to build a house today as it did then.  The house that could be built for £1,200 then costs over £2,000 now; and the house that could be built for £1,500 then costs about £3,000 now. Instead of getting 45 or 50 per cent in grants, as the people did when the inter-Party Government were in power over 14 years ago, today they are getting only from 20 per cent to 33? per cent.  They are still getting only £550 on a house costing £3,000, whereas away back in 1951 they were getting £550 grants on a house costing £1,200 to £1,500.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry said last night that there was a period when the inter-Party <Col N="365" /> Government were in power when there was no need to build houses because the people were not here to live in them.  It is hard to listen to that sort of trash because we find that in 1951 there were 1,217,100 people employed who could live in the houses that were being built by the Government and that in 1964 there were 1,059,000 employed in Ireland.  The Parliamentary Secretary or anybody can see from those figures that there were 158,100 fewer people employed in 1964 compared with 1951.  The position now is that the houses are not being built and we have 158,100 fewer in employment.</P>
    <P>According to the White Paper on Housing, 50,000 houses would be needed to replace unfit dwellings and an additional 8,000 afterwards to replace houses deteriorating each year. It is all very well to have this Bill and for the Government to get publicity from it but that will not build houses. Given the figures and the record which is a disgrace to Fianna Fáil from 1956 to 1964, there is no use in promising people pie in the sky.  It is a political stunt by the Government to keep the people's minds off the problems affecting them now.</P>
    <P>It might be no harm to quote what Deputy Meaney said as reported in Volume 217, column 971:</P>
    <P>We should also refresh our memories by recalling that his Party&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>he was referring to some of our people</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;tried to float a loan and the loan did not fill.  When they came out of office they had not enough money to build a second-class duckhouse.</P>
    <P>I have pointed out that 7,000 houses were built then.  What is happening now is that the money is not there.  If the Government could have got the money, why did they not float a loan to finance housing?  If the ESB, which was condemned by the Government as a white elephant, can float a loan of £6 million and have it oversubscribed within ten minutes, why have the Government to go to Germany to borrow money to build our houses?  It shows the people of Ireland have confidence in the ESB, even though it was condemned as a white elephant, but <Col N="366" /> they have not the same confidence in the Fianna Fáil Government.  The less Deputy Meaney or any other Deputy says about borrowing or loans not filling at present the better, because this Government are living on borrowed money and borrowed time.  The unfortunate thing is that they may bring all of us down along with them.</P>
    <P>We know that lack of proper housing leads to emigration and many of the 300,000 people who have had to leave Ireland since 1956 had to leave because of bad housing.  They also had to leave because they lost employment in the building of houses.  I pointed out earlier that where there were 11,470 people employed in building houses at one time, under the dead and withering hand of Fianna Fáil, the number was reduced to 1,160 in the glorious year of 1960.</P>
    <P>I shall finish by stating that I still believe that the £100,000 about to be spent on two elections in one year would be much better spent if the Government gave it in loans or grants to the different county councils throughout Ireland to build houses.  It would be much better to have 60,000 or 70,000 people housed in the next year or two than to have a Fianna Fáil Government trying, as they may think they can, to win the two elections by holding them on different dates.  The Parliamentary Secretary may shake his head but I think he will get a severe fright in the very near future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcAuliffe" hpid="Mr. McAuliffe Mr. McAuliffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McAuliffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I was glad to hear Deputy L'Estrange paying a compliment to my colleague, the late Deputy Tim Murphy, when he was Minister for Local Government.  We can remember that in 1948 we faced a problem somewhat similar to that now confronting us.  We had a considerable number of people in that year who had been for a long time on the waiting list for houses with many local authorities.  When the late Deputy Murphy became Minister, he immediately went to every county council and asked them about their housing problems.  I expected when the present Minister for Local Government took office that as a man with experience of <Col N="367" /> local authorities&mdash;and the same applies to his Parliamentary Secretary&mdash;he would have consulted with local authorities to ascertain their problems in the past seven, eight or ten years.</P>
      <P>The Minister cannot get away from the fact that we are now in a very serious position in regard to housing. We have at present a considerable number of waiting lists for a long time. Nobody is more conversant with the housing situation in Cork county than I am with roughly 25 years' experience of that local authority and I know what a problem it is.  I know what it is to go into many towns and villages and meet people who have been waiting for improved housing for a long period. Arguments across the House will never solve the housing problem which must be faced.  I would ask the Minister to give serious thought to the financial situation, to be honest about it and to tell the local authorities that he is not in a position to give money for the erection of houses or the improvement of loans.  If that is the position, we would be satisfied if we were told that, but it is sad to think that applications are submitted for the erection of houses, the improvement of loans and the purchase of plots on which to erect houses and the only thing the local authority can do is communicate with the nearest Deputy and ask him to negotiate with the Department of Local Government for approval.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yesterday morning I received a letter from Youghal Urban District Council saying that they were prepared to purchase a plot of land convenient to the town on which to erect houses but they were still awaiting the approval of the loan to purchase that site. I think that is wrong.  Surely the Minister should give approval for the purchase of sites now so as to be in a position, if money becomes available in the near future, to tell local authorities to go ahead with their proposals to solve the housing problem.  The Minister must remember that many of these towns at present, particularly Youghal, Midleton and Cobh, three highly industrialised towns, have a greatly increasing population trend and as a <Col N="368" /> result the housing problem is becoming more difficult for local authorities and the demands are becoming greater day by day.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry mentioned last night that for one period at any rate there was no demand for housing here because the people did not exist.</P>
    <P>As a member of a local authority, I have never seen the day, as far as Cork County Council is concerned, when there was not a demand for houses from every locality in the county.  That position continues, and until such time as we get immediate sanction for the programmes put to the Department, we will never reach the stage when we can safely say that we have solved the housing problem.  Last October we asked the Minister to receive a deputation from the Northern Committee of Cork County Council and similarly the West Cork Housing and Sanitary Committee asked for a deputation to be received.  After two months, it was decided that one deputation would be sufficient and not alone once, but twice or three times, the Minister was asked to receive that deputation.  It is sad to think that the Minister turns a deaf ear to our request and has refused to receive the deputation.</P>
    <P>Last Monday it was decided to communicate with the Minister by telephone and after the call had been made to the Department the County Secretary informed the members of the council that a reply would be given as soon as the Minister was available and whenever he could be located to find out what day would be suitable for both sides.  A further telephone call was made at 3.30 on Monday and when the council adjourned at 5 p.m. there was no reply.  It is a scandalous thing that the Department should treat a body like Cork County Council, representing roughly one-eighth of the entire Twenty-six Counties, in this fashion, more or less with contempt.</P>
    <P>I would request the Minister to meet the representatives of Cork County Council because in our ambitions in regard to housing we are second to none, and whenever the Department made suggestions for improving the <Col N="369" /> housing situation, we were always in a position to meet the Minister.  We do not want to meet him for any ulterior motive, but merely to discuss our problems as far as loans and approval for plans are concerned.  If he is in a position to tell us that we shall get approval for loans and the money to erect houses, I can assure him that we shall give him the credit he deserves.  Even if he tells us that he will not be in a position to do anything for the next 12 months, we want to know the position so that we can tell the people when they will get houses.  It is always better for a Minister to be honest with the people.</P>
    <P>We cannot agree with members of the Minister's Party coming in here and saying that there is no scarcity of money as far as house building is concerned.  I listened to some speakers in this debate and they have a very different face when they go back to their local authorities.  It is roughly two years since Deputy Corry called a special meeting of Cork County Council, which was publicised in all the leading newspapers, to ensure that some steps would be taken to provide houses for people in Cork county. Deputy Corry is coming in now with a different outlook.  The only thing he could say last night was that there had been a certain period when people had left the country and there was nobody seeking houses and that was why there had been slowing down in building.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by repeating my request to the Minister, for his own sake and the sake of local authorities, and to ensure better agreement in general, to give immediate consent to the request put forward by Cork County Council that he receive a deputation, in order that we may know what is to be the outcome of the applications in the Department not alone from Cork County Council but from the various other local authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>About that.  A lot has been said in this debate and it is <Col N="370" /> rather difficult to know whether one should try to answer as nearly as possible all the matters raised, or whether one should take the shorter way out and conclude in a very much shorter time.  I am inclined to try to answer the Deputies even though it may be somewhat wearying for the House, and for me, but, nevertheless, it would probably be the better thing to do.  Deputy Donegan set out to talk on the motion which specifically refers to a decline in houses in recent years.  He immediately went back ten or 11 years and if he wants to go back so far, there is nothing I can do but go back to the years 1956, 1957 and 1958 which are now being referred to as recent years and which were being used to show a decline in order to substantiate the terms of the motion.</P>
      <P>We find that in 1958 we had a situation in which housing had deteriorated.  For instance, the Dublin Corporation vacancies rate had risen from 358 vacancies in 1953-54 to 986 in 1956-57.  That trend, set in motion in the years of the Coalition Government, continued because of their ineptitude and in 1959-60 the number reached 1,605.  Against that background is it any wonder that it was difficult to convince Dublin Corporation or any other county council that they should be building houses or that there was any prospect that they would need more houses in the future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These were the circumstances that brought about the decline in housing and there is nobody in this House today who does not remember, over those years when building was on the ground, grovelling in the dust, as it were, the efforts which I made to revitalise housing and to instil into all councils the idea that housing was not finished and, as I have said previously, that it will never be finished.  Obsolescence will ensure, even with a static population, never mind a growing population, that the housing problem will never be finished. As far as recent years are concerned, I would direct the attention of the House to the position over the past four or five years&mdash;which I would regard as recent years&mdash;when we find that the number of houses built in <Col N="371" /> each year since 1961-62 has been higher by a substantial margin than in each previous year.  In 1961-62, we built 5,780 houses and the figure for the following year was 21 per cent higher at 7,000.  In 1963-64, it went up to 7,600, an increase of eight per cent, and in 1964-65 over 9,400 were built, or an increase of 24 per cent.</P>
    <P>During the current year, despite all our difficulties and despite a shortage of money to do all that we would wish to do, the figure of 9,400 is estimated to reach, by the end of March, at least 11,000.</P>
    <P>This again shows an increase of 17 per cent over last year.  The indications for the coming year are that, even with our difficulties, and looking at them fairly in the face, we can estimate and forecast that we will again exceed 11,000 next year and probably about 11,200 houses will come to be built during 1966-67.  Those are recent years to me, right back to 1961 to 1962. They certainly do not bear out the criticism, or the intention of the motion in criticising, a decline which, in fact, has not taken place in recent years.  The reverse in fact is so.</P>
    <P>Housing has gone up by leaps and bounds in recent years.  Indeed, it is true to say at this juncture that, if it were not for the difficulties we have encountered in that the demand for money for housing is so great, and for many other developments as well, that we have not got enough to meet all demands, and if housing had been capable of being allowed to run free, as it has been over the past four to five years, the price of houses would have gone out through the roof.  This was obvious in 1964.  It was obvious in the first half of 1965 and, indeed, it is only in the past six months that pricing in house-building has appeared to reach any sort of stability whatever. To criticise a decline that does not exist, when the figures there show that it has not existed, is surely a waste of time, in so far as the people who put down the motion are concerned.</P>
    <P>Deputy Donegan also tried to impress on the House the need for a planned programme in house-building. I welcome his interest in this matter <Col N="372" /> and I welcome the interest of all other Deputies in the House who feel that way about it.  I do not welcome those who would, by their talk in this House appear to criticise myself, the Government or my Department for giving no heed to a planned housing programme. I would say again that planned programming in house-building, in recent years, has been brought to the front by this Government and by my Department in trying to bring about, first of all, an assessment of the needs of houses and the numbers required, not only those that are needed here immediately but projecting into the future the additional needs that will be required through obsolescence, through normal growth, earlier marriages and the increasing population which, mark you, began in 1961-62 and happily is still continuing for the first time in such a long time, that none of us can remember when that situation obtained before.</P>
    <P>We have been doing this.  We have been, for three or four years now, trying to impress on our local authorities the need for a re-assessment of our needs in each area so that they in turn, can face up to the total problem they see immediately before them and some distance before them, so that they may make provision for a building programme that will match their needs and so that they may also be enabled to provide the finance from the various sources to match the programme that they will have to devise related to the needs they will have established.</P>
    <P>Those are things which we have been working on for quite a considerable time and to criticise the lack of programming at this juncture in our history comes ill from Deputy Donegan, whose Party did not at any time when they were participating in Government, even in those more recent years, make any assessment, not alone make programming, of their building output for years ahead.</P>

As he got further away from the disaster of 1956, this former Leader could, on second thoughts, begin to boast about the fact that they had built more houses during the Coalition's time in office than there were people to fill them.  I would put it somewhat differently and that is that houses were built in prospect for the needs that then existed, but those needs evaporated through emigration due to the collapse of the Government and the economy at that time through the ineptitude of the Government of those preceding years.</P>

      <P>Deputy Donegan again talked to the House about the absence of any upsurge in the amount of reconstruction work.  I wonder does Deputy Donegan really expect us to believe this or does he know what he is talking about?  In 1955-56, which he was so delighted to talk about, the number of reconstruction grants was about 6,500 and a further 460 water and sewerage grants were paid, making a total just short of 7,000 grants for all those various types of repairs and improvements. In the year 1964-65, of which he was complaining so bitterly, more than 9,500 reconstruction grants were paid and more than 5,600 water and sewerage grants were paid, making a total of 15,000 approximately, in all.  In <Col N="375" /> short, the number of grants that were paid during the 1955-56 period, of which he was boasting at the time he was talking&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Another matter which the Deputy raised, which was rather a local one, was the matter of the Louth County Council refusing an excellent site offered by him in the Drogheda area on the ground that it was not convenient to churches and schools, although it was an excellent one to provide for housing purposes in the Drogheda-Baltray area.  We have no information about this whatever. There is no reason why we should, for the simple reason that this is a matter for the local authority.  They are free to acquire those housing sites by agreement and if for their own good reasons, they see fit not to take a particular site, because it is not convenient to schools and churches, even though the need may be there and local people like Deputy Donegan are anxious that they should build on it, the council in any case can decide the site is not suitable and can go and look elsewhere. It is not a matter of criticism of the Department or of the Minister.  I merely put it on record for Deputy Donegan's information. He had better get back to his county council and use his influence there&mdash;if he has some influence which I am beginning to doubt&mdash;if, in fact, he has found this difficulty in regard to selecting a site for a few houses.</P>
      <P>Deputy Donegan referred also to the National Building Agency building houses only for executives.  This is, of course, only half the story. We build, through the Agency, for all sorts of workers, any workers, depending on the demand, the need and the wish of the local industrialists.  For instance, we have built for the miners at Killenaule and Nenagh, and workers in Arklow.  These are only a few of those we have built for large numbers of workers in addition to the executives Deputy Donegan spoke about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy James Tully talked of subsidisation of interest rates for housing. <Col N="376" /> I spoke about this earlier on the Housing Bill.  It is the one thing on which there are still different views, and will continue to be, as to whether any subsidisation of interest rates on loans to people for building houses or outright capital grants is the better.  As I said on the Housing Bill, we do not have much choice at this stage.  We might have had a choice when grants were first being talked about and we might then have been able to embark on the subsidisation of interest rates.  In the past apparently the grant was regarded as the neater way of doing the work.  If we look at it today the £300 grant is equivalent to an interest subsidy, at current interest rates, of about £24 a year, more or less.  This is the way we have to look at these grants.</P>
    <P>When we talk of the desirability of subsidising interest rates for the ordinary people building their own houses, we can relate the actual amount of grant available to them today and calculate it as to the interest rate, if we so wish.  I feel the grant is still the better way, even had we an open choice.  Judging by the continued rise in demand for these grants for private building, it would appear, at any rate, that while people might wish to get further assistance, there is no doubt at all about the popularity of the present grants.  The numbers in which they are being used is proof positive that they are filling a great need.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also referred to profits made by builders and said the grants should be so designed as to assist the purchaser.  Quite candidly, it is difficult to answer that sort of suggestion.  In the first place, builders will not build, or continue to build without profit. The second point is: if we did not pay the grant at all&mdash;if we had no grant&mdash;would the purchaser of a house today get the house at the same price as it is offered today, or would that person have to pay the price, plus the £300 grant? I feel the latter is exactly what would happen.  In a boom building period such as we have experienced over recent years, due to the demand pushing up the prices, the value for money being obtained by the purchaser is not always the best one might expect.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="377" /> On the other hand, it is not a fact at all in all cases that the builder is really making a packet out of these circumstances but rather is everybody engaged in the building industry having a cut, either by additional profit or taking things easy, knowing they will be paid for the work at the finish, regardless of their output.  I think it could, and should be, admitted by a great number of people who have been concerned with the building industry on all sides in recent years that there was no great emphasis, nor was there any need to get productivity up to a high level in so far as speculative housing was concerned because of the fact that the demand was there.  The money was apparently there in abundance and, even if the price had to go a few hundred pounds beyond what was regarded as value for money, there was always a customer ready to take such a house.  In these circumstances, it is desperately difficult to try to secure a situation where value for money, in the true sense, can be given or obtained.</P>
    <P>To regulate it by the withholding of our grants is something I am endeavouring to do in the future, by virtue of that new amendment which the House was good enough to allow to be added to the Bill recently, whereby we have brought in a general power that grants may be withheld by the Minister where value for money is obviously not being given. How far we can utilise that, or how successfully we can employ it, is something which can only be shown when we try to put it into practice.  At least we have the power now to attempt to do something in this way, and it is the only thing we can attempt to do.  I do not think it is fair to blame any one single entity in the building industry for the situation which obtained where value for money was not always given.</P>

      <P>I am not reflecting on the Deputy's integrity in this matter <Col N="378" /> but one of the things I have been criticised for today, as well as over the past five or seven years, has been my reluctance in many cases to sanction tenders for local authority houses where I believed that the prices quoted by the local authority were too high.  It has been shown in some of these cases&mdash;against a background of rising costs of materials, labour and so forth&mdash;that by my reluctance to sanction a tender which, we will say, in 1962 was too high by the time 1963 came around, I was faced with accepting one somewhat higher.  However, had I not attempted that repression of the upward spiral in prices, prices would have gone even higher.  I should say also that if in 1963 a house price tender is accepted by my Department and myself at £50 or £60 more than the amount we refused to sanction in 1962, that does not prove that the price in 1963 was not competitive in 1963, whereas the price in 1962 need not have been competitive.</P>
      <P>It is a very awkward and difficult situation to find oneself in.  I have been quite conscious of this difficulty many a time. I have always been faced with the prospect in those days that if we looked for another tender we might not get as good, but, despite that, I had to take a stand in many cases, even if we may have made a loss.  Even recently we have had the experience of this same problem. I think the Parliamentary Secretary referred to it here when he spoke a few evenings ago; that we have recently had the experience of refusing to sanction a tender because it was too high.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At this time, it was alleged, we refused sanction because we did not have the money, and the upshot was that we received a deputation from the local authority concerned. As a result, a round table conference of officials of the local authority, officials of my Department, the architect employed by the local authority and the contractor got together.  The net result of this&mdash;in this year of 1966 when we are said to have no money for anything, when builders are said to have no work to do and <Col N="379" /> when unemployment is said to be rising in the building industry&mdash;is that at the round table conference we were able to get on a tender of approximately £500,000 a reduction of £57,000.  Even today, despite our alleged difficulties, we have had this exercise which can benefit not only the local authority concerned but every local authority in the country and every tenant who will occupy this scheme of houses for many years to come.</P>
    <P>Deputy James Tully would like to have all grants under this Bill paid back to 1st July last and he asked for reconsideration of the provisions in section 106.  As to his first suggestion, let me be quite blunt in saying that there is not a hope of having retrospection in the case of these grants.  We just cannot do it and there is not any reason why we should do it.  Even if we were to do it, it would not give us one additional house but it might create a bonanza for those waiting to have the work done.  It would not, however, improve the position or increase the output.</P>

      <P>And I shall finish it, the Deputy can be sure.  The usual tactics of trying to score with one point if you cannot score with another will not succeed here, though I appreciate Deputy Lyons's efforts in this respect.  The difference between Deputy Tully's outlook and mine seems to be rather small. I am concerned to ensure that every house sold by a local authority will be in good structural condition at the time of the sale.  I want to ensure that the roofs, the walls and the floors will be in safe and sound condition.  I know the Deputy wishes to see the same situation. Suggestion have been made that the local authorities would execute minor repairs, including repairs to fences, weather boards, the maintenance of catches on doors and windows. That is all highly desirable but it is not essential.  Very often at the present <Col N="381" /> moment this work is interrupted not by any shortage of money but by the lack of skilled gangs on local authority staffs.  They have not been able to get around to repairing as many of these houses as possible and as required by law before vesting.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may now have but it is only of late.  If local authorities in the past have been short of money for this very necessary work it was not because money was not made available by the Government but because they engaged in the very dangerous practice of not providing money for maintenance and repairs at their estimates meetings.  When the members of the local authorities looked for sixpence to be taken off the rates, this was one item which looked good. This practice was indulged in to the detriment of the housing stocks of local authorities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not quibble on the point of whether Meath has done the job in this respect.  I say in a general way that lack of provision for maintenance and repair of houses has been in evidence for many years and we are now paying the piper.  Consequently, the cost to the ratepayers in recent years has been running at the rate of £300,000 to £400,000 a year. Against that background, we can realise what a national problem this is.  In future years we must strive carefully to maintain our existing houses in view of the rising cost of building. We must not neglect this part of our work as we did in the past, while, at the same time, screaming to build new houses at prohibitive cost.</P>
      <P>Deputy James Tully claimed the amount of money spent under this heading this year was less than the amount spent last year.  That is not so.</P>

      <P>I may be attributing to the Deputy something somebody else said.  If I said somebody on the Fine Gael benches claimed that, I think I would have many takers.  However, it is not so.  In fact, up to January 31st last, that is, the ten months for which I have figures, issues from the Local Loans Fund were £12.4 million as against £8 million for the equivalent ten months of the previous year when nobody complained of any shortage. In other words, a fifty per cent increase has taken place.  I would ask those who say there is less money to digest that particular figure.  When they have done so, they may be wiser.</P>

      <P>Deputy S. Dunne and Deputy Cluskey complained that there had not been any hand-over of houses to Dublin Corporation in the recent past.  That is not correct.  In the month of January, a total of 64 houses were handed over&mdash;six at Infirmary Road and 58 at Coolock-Kilmore. Deputy Cluskey also talked about the Ballymun scheme, but I think he had his tongue in his cheek. Briefly, I want to give the situation there.  The hand-over of houses we were given to understand would take place last summer was delayed.  The corporation were informed that the hand-over of a small number of houses available at that time would not have been a practical proposition because they would have been isolated and without any services. I agreed, and the corporation accepted reluctantly the commonsense of not handing over these houses and allowing the contractors to get on with the overall job of preparing the site for the big work to go ahead there in the next three years.  This was not unknown to Deputy Cluskey and other Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="383" /> We were to get a hand-over of houses on 21st December last.  But when the rains came&mdash;and everybody will agree they really came this year as never before&mdash;we were informed that there had been a complete holdup of work for a period, due to flooding on the site, and the hand-over on 21st December would not be possible. Again, this information was known in advance.</P>
    <P>Deputies should remember that houses are already built up there.  The workshop producing the components is, in fact, so crammed with components already made that they are finding it difficult to continue production because of the pile up of components already made which cannot be used because of the deplorable condition of the site.  These components are in addition to those used in the houses already erected.  About 50 or 60 houses can be handed over at the end of March; but unless the weather improves and the site can be cleared of much of the water on it, I do not think they should be taken over at that time. Whether we take over those houses or not, the fact remains the contractors indicated that £850,000 worth of work would be done during the financial year ending next month.  In fact, £830,000 worth of work has already been done and the total amount of work expected to be completed by 31st March will be worth almost exactly £1 million, that is, £150,000 more than we anticipated this time last year.  While we have in fact done more work than was contracted for, I admit I am disappointed we have had fewer dwellings handed over.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Will that mean there will be an additional 60 or 70 houses available?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>That will depend entirely on whether construction operations on the houses can get under way. Foundations have been excavated. There is a sea of mud up there, which Deputies are free to visit and see for themselves.  As I said, nobody was more disappointed than I was that we could not hand over houses in anything like the numbers we had anticipated. <Col N="384" /> Nevertheless, it is not suggested that the hand-over date for the entire 3,000 houses contracted for is to be put back.  While we may have lost output immediately as far as completed houses are concerned, there has not been any request to extend the date on which the total 3,000 houses have been promised to be completed. The progress made would indicate that the overall target will be reached and that in general the time schedule will be kept.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dunne mentioned high rents. It is only fair to say that a house costing about £2,500 means, at current prices, that the rent must be at least £3.10.0 a week plus rates. To ensure that the rent actually charged is one the tenant can afford to pay, the Government pay a subsidy for about 90 per cent of local authority houses, which is equivalent to a rent of 30/-a week.  In many case the local authorities pay an equivalent subsidy to try to eliminate £3 out of that £3 10s. in order that the house may be available at a rent of 10/- a week plus rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">

      <P>There is no mistake in the figures I have given.  Another suggestion by Deputy Dunne concerns loan repayments.  He said that people are paying up to £6 or £7 a week as a result of heavy interest charges and that large deposits have to be put down.  The repayments on a loan of £2,700 over 35 years at 7 ½ per cent amounts to £18.5.3d. per month or £4.4.3d. per week.  This is somewhat different from the £6 or £7 indicated by Deputy Dunne.  It is not to say that I feel that £4.4.3d. per week is any light burden for anybody to undertake but let us not exaggerate the difficulty of this matter and so frighten people from attempting to buy their own houses.</P>

    <P>The problem of building or paying for one's house is formidable enough without exaggerating the repayment costs.  The deposits usually range between £400 and £600.  I am not disputing that a sum of £450 may have <Col N="387" /> to be put down but do not forget that this is not due in all cases to the inadequacy of the maximum amount of loan but to the fact that valuations put on the houses by the local authorities for loan purposes are, in very many cases, up to £500 lower than the actual selling price of the house with the result that the top loan cannot in many cases be qualified for.  This is something in relation to which I cannot direct anybody.</P>
    <P>We have a sort of working arrangement whereby, if a valuation is not regarded as satisfactory, the applicant may send the particulars of his case, on appeal, to the Commissioners of Valuation.  This is a sort of working arrangement to try to surmount the deadlock in regard to this question of alleged under-valuation and in regard to under-valuation in some cases.  It is the farthest I am entitled to go because although the money which comes from the local loans fund is lent by the local authorities concerned, it is their responsibility as to how they lend that money and how they expect to get it back.  Generally, however, valuations of houses by local authority valuers have tended to show a value being placed on those houses which is £500 below the actual selling price.  I am not saying that the value placed on them is not the value but the selling value of the house is generally £500 more than is placed as its value by the valuer.</P>
    <P>Sub-tenants and their re-housing were also mentioned by Deputy Dunne. The regulations are being revised to enable sub-tenants to qualify for local authority houses on the same basis as other persons seeking these houses.</P>

      <P>Houses for newly-weds were mentioned by Deputy Dunne and others.  The Management and Letting Regulations, 1950, provided that the <Col N="388" /> tenant of reserved house shall not ordinarily be allowed to continue in that house for more than five years. This is the newly-weds scheme which they have been operating in Dublin for some years, and probably elsewhere. Normally, the rehousing of a family from a reserved house is designed to relieve over-crowding and the rehousing is in the family's own interests.  Deputy Dunne's point is that we should leave them in the houses into which we originally put them under this reserved houses scheme.  The local authorities can think about this matter.  The making of a scheme of priorities in respect of the allocation of tenants will be a matter for the local authorities who, if they wish, may reserve a portion of them for the newly-weds.  When the five-year period to which the Deputy refers is up, these same persons may be given other houses which may qualify for the two-thirds subsidy.  In other words, no change is being brought about in the Bill that will worsen what is capable of being done at the moment.  If local authorities wish to continue the practice that has been established here for some time, the Bill does not preclude them from doing so.  In fact it enables them more readily to do so than might have been the case in the past.</P>

    <P>Deputy Costello made a case about reconstruction grants that should be available for certain storm and flood damage.  I think the cases he had in mind are located in the Anglesea Road, Dublin, area where garden walls were knocked down.  My Department and myself have refused to pay grants for their re-erection.  I still refuse to pay grants for the rebuilding of garden walls because, under that particular enactment, these grants are meant for houses.  While we may extend the meaning of the term &ldquo;house&rdquo; a bit, I do not think I can readily bring in the garden wall, no matter how long the wall might be.  We cannot say we are prepared to give these reconstruction grants for storm damage to houses and that, in fact, the walls of the gardens and their surroundings should be covered.  We have refused to do it, and I think rightly so, because this is not a vital matter in so far as the housing <Col N="389" /> of the people is concerned provided the houses are still in good shape, which, in the Anglesea Road area, I should be inclined to think they are.</P>
    <P>Other Deputies have been talking about various matters, some of them not of general concern.  One that my colleague in Donegal, a Fine Gael Deputy, talked about here is worth mentioning, for the reason that not so terribly long ago the last of a certain Sunday newspaper writer's articles appeared and the appearance was accompanied by a photograph of the Fine Gael Deputy for Donegal and the house of a particular applicant for housing, a Mrs. Grace Carr, of Raphoe, referred to by the Deputy the other night.  Mrs. Carr applied for a specific instance cottage and her dire circumstances in regard to housing were written up at the time was that there graph to boot, not to the wishes of the unfortunate applicant herself, as we found out later.  Nonetheless they were written up.  The reason they were written up at the time was that there were some elections on and the Minister for Local Government was branded as the man who refused this woman a house.  I have now been asked what has happened about that.  The reason why I was alleged to have refused the house was the fact that my technical advisers absolutely and completely ruled out the site which was offered for the SI house built for this woman because of its waterlogged condition and because it could not be amply or properly drained, ever.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, this Mrs. Carr and her family have been offered a new council house in the town of Raphoe which she accepted and then at some later stage rejected.  She changed her mind, as she was entitled to do.  The result of this change is that a man who occupies a council cottage near where Mrs. Carr now lives has been offered and is prepared to accept a new house in Raphoe and Mrs. Carr has accepted the tenancy that will become vacant when that man leaves.  I am surprised that Deputy Harte did not know this.  I know it because I have been interested in getting this woman rehoused. I am surprised that Deputy Harte, <Col N="390" /> living on the doorstep, did not know.</P>

    <P>Deputy Crotty alleges that he was misled in regard to the Newpark housing scheme. In reply to a parliamentary question on that scheme on 15th December, 1965, I informed Deputy Crotty that the Department was in communication with the housing authority in regard to their application for sanction to a loan of £55,000 to finance the scheme and a further scheme at O'Loughlin Road.  The Deputy now states that on subsequent inquiry from Kilkenny County Council, he was informed that this was not the case and that, of course, the Minister must be wrong. In such circumstances, always, the Minister must be wrong. There could not be any question whatever that anybody else could be wrong. <Col N="393" /> The Deputy also stated that when he further inquired from the Department about the scheme, he was told that there was no point in sanctioning the housing authority's revised proposal to carry out the scheme by direct labour because, to quote the Deputy, there was no money.</P>

      <P>Dublin city housing as a whole was referred to by a number of Deputies. The story about the plight of those seeking houses was told very effectively by some. During the course of this narrative it emerged that I, in fact, was again misleading the House in relation to the information given in answer to various questions tabled over the last couple of weeks in regard to the size of the families per room and the standard being used in Dublin. I do not want to go further into that now except to say that the information given in reply to the questions asked in the past few weeks was true. I have checked it again and the Corporation confirm that my information shows the true facts as against the figures and the alleged facts quoted by Deputies here last night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The short-term needs of Dublin are reckoned to be of the order of 10,000. There has been criticism here that there is no planning, no programming, no future, and no hope for the future as far as those needing houses are concerned. The corporation have on hands at the moment 10,314, The number of cases recommended by the medical officer on statutory grounds is 4,389. Cases in compulsory purchase order areas and unfit houses number 442.  There are 137 dangerous building cases. The number of cases not recommended by the medical officer, as they do not come within the statutory priorities, is 5,546. In regard to that latter figure some 30 per cent are estimated to come within the major subsidy cases and will do so in due course. In addition, the Corporation estimate that it will be necessary to <Col N="395" /> rehouse 1,000 families from dangerous buildings during the coming year.</P>
    <P>The main thing we should look at now is, I think, this criticism about planning. So far as the corporation is concerned, the position can be summarised as follows: the number of houses in progress and in tender is 1,590; sites on hands number 4,585; sites being acquired 2,220, the Ballymun project 3,021, giving a grand total of 11,516 as compared with the figure I gave of 10,314, of which half have not yet been passed by the medical officer. Though the housing position is difficult and though many people are suffering hardship it is not true to say that, so far as Dublin is concerned, there is no plan for the correction of this serious shortage. These two figures can be compared and, when they are, it must be admitted, I think, that they show a fair effort on the part of Dublin Corporation to meet the big demand at present being made on them for houses.</P>
    <P>Deputy Clinton, on the Bill for a change, said the Bill was merely an enabling Bill to empoyer local authorities to spend more without any increase from the Government. Here are a few headings of what, in fact, the Bill does as compared with any other housing legislation in the past. Farmers' grants up to £450; into that will come a great many people in the rural areas who would normally be the responsibility of the local authority where housing is concerned.  They also are entitled to these higher grants.  It may surprise city representatives to learn that these people in a great many cases build their own houses; we are now trying to encourage them to continue to do so by giving them the same high grants as the farming community. We are also providing grants for multi-storey flats. That will be a development of the future.  We are giving increased aid for the housing of the elderly.  The housing of these is an urgent matter.</P>
    <P>We are providing grants for caretaker staffs for looking after the elderly who will be housed in either these new buildings or in some existing buildings.  Dower house grants are <Col N="396" /> coming in for the first time. Grants for the repair of local authority houses are also coming in for the first time. Higher grants are being provided for accommodation for those suffering from tuberculosis.  I have dealt with the site subsidy at some length already. There is also the subsidy for the small farmers under £5 valuation whereby there will be a capital charge on the local authority which provides the houses of only £100 per house.  If anybody says that is not enough then I give up.  It will cost the local authority only £100 to provide the house. The Government are committed to providing the rest.</P>
    <P>No Government has ever put the same money into housing as this Government is putting into it right now. During the last few days I have listened to Deputies talking about the grand days in earlier years and accusing us of having done nothing to improve the grants since 1948.  Does anyone know how much was spent in 1948-49?  The Opposition can have a which we have heard so much? £342,000. Does the House appreciate that in the present year, in which we are told there is a serious housing shortage, we are spending £3.6 million Government money on housing grants as against £342,000 in 1948-49.  The Opposition can have a present of their assertion that we have not increased the actual amount of the grant from the £285 in the year 1948-49.  These figures are absolutely comparable. Compare them and you will find that they fit into each other as to ten times, or thereabouts. On top of that there is £1.5 million by way of supplementary grants. Adding that to the £3.6 million gives us a grand total for this year of £5.1 million as against a total of £342,000 in the glorious 1948-49 period.</P>

      <P>The target of 14,000 houses a year was mentioned by Deputy Clinton as having been referred to by me, and he said the money is not being made available. This is not in accordance with the facts.  The figures I have mentioned already are a clear indication of how the money is being made available. Not only is this target of 14,000 houses by 1970 capable of being reached but we have made substantial progress towards reaching it in the short few years since that figure was calculated as being a target at which we must aim. At the time we announced that figure our output was somewhere over 7,000 houses. It is now 11,000 as forecast <Col N="398" /> for the end of next month, and it will exceed 11,000, even in these bad times, during 1966-67.  This, you will agree, is fair progress from the time we announced that figure a couple of years ago. If we make anything like the same headway in the next few years as we have made up to now that target of 14,000 is not beyond our reach.</P>
      <P>It must not be forgotten that when we announced this figure it was not a question of money that was mostly in the minds of Deputies on either side of the House. It was the question as to whether or not we would have the contractual capacity to meet the house building demands then existing and which have not abated since then. We should keep these things in mind and not let our wishes and desires blind us to the facts that are there staring anyone in the face who wishes to look at them.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Connell made a statement here last night which is not directly my concern but I decided to check on it. He said that it takes six weeks to get a reply from the Housing Section of Dublin Corporation. On checking, I am informed that generally replies to queries to the Housing Section take three weeks at the outside.</P>

I would hope it would not be unearthed, not to prove Deputy O'Connell wrong but to ensure that six weeks is not regarded as a normal time to get a reply from any of these public institutions, whether it be Dublin Corporation or the least of our councils in the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should be glad if he would. Deputy O'Connell was very hot here last night on the suggestion that we should reappraise the method of establishing priorities in relation to the letting of houses. I would refer the Deputy to the terms of the Bill in this <Col N="399" /> regard and he will find his answer there, Local authorities are being given power to draw up their own scheme of priorities, and then this difficulty should disappear.</P>
      <P>Dublin Corporation rents were referred to here again by Deputy O'Connell and what I have said in regard to the national picture applies here, that is, that Dublin Corporation already subsidise their housing from the rates to the extent of about £900,000 per year plus a figure of between £700,000 and £800,000 from State subsidy. It has been tried to pin on the Minister for Local Government responsibility for directing an increase in rents to all local authority housing occupants. This is not a fact, and those who make the assertion most loudly are those who know best it is not so.</P>
      <P>What I have been saying is that in these times when we realise the magnitude of the task that lies before us of providing houses for our people in the future, we must have regard to the financing of the wherewithal required to do the job. In the light of that and in the light of the general talk that one can hear anywhere in the city that there are people in corporation houses who are well able to provide their own houses, I have directed the attention of the corporation and all other local authorities to the need to make a reappraisal of their renting system, where they feel it is necessary, and that this should be done urgently in order that we may be able to go on building houses so that the poorest and those most in need of those houses will be able to rent them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>If I find that houses are being neglected or that rents are unrealistic to the degree that people are refused houses because they cannot pay as a result of others, who are well able to pay more, not being asked for it, then the question of subsidy will definitely arise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not really serious. It is a logical follow-up to the huge expenditure of money that is going into housing and will have to continue to go into it in the years that lie ahead. Talking about that expenditure, about £125 million from public funds has gone into housing in the past four or five years and one can take it that at least another £125 million will go into housing over the next five years. Therefore we must not only be careful to maintain our houses but ensure that our renting policy is a rational renting policy.  If it is true that there are people in houses who can afford to pay a lot more than they are paying and that by so doing they can enable the local authority, without increasing the rates, to reduce rents to those who are very badly off, it is a good thing that those rents should be increased. It is something we should do and that we must do.</P>

      <P>Deputy Reynolds mentioned vested cottages which are vacant. There is power to deal with this matter in the Bill, providing for recovery by the local authority after 18 months. There is also power to control sales. We have that pretty well hammered out here and we have reached a fair compromise on what can be done.  He also suggested the speeding up of payment of section 5 grants by accepting a certificate of the local engineer without departmental inspection. This is a case where I shall certainly take a further look at the section and in passing, I congratulate counties Leitrim and Sligo for their efforts in this respect. They are doing a greater number more quickly than other counties as far as I am aware, as regards this limited repair grant. The section is one I can commend to any local authority. If the suggestion of Deputy Reynolds&mdash;and he has had some experience in this matter, more than most counties have had&mdash;can in my estimation lead to a further speeding-up or improvement in the administration of this section, the fact that the suggestion came from Deputy Reynolds will in no way militate against putting it into operation.</P>

      <P>That can happen. In <Col N="402" /> the case of Deputy Jones, his writing is a little better. He raised the question of arbitration for land acquisition where the sale was agreed and there was nothing at issue but the question of price between the parties. I dealt with this matter in a fairly lengthy letter to Deputy Clinton, of which Deputy Jones may be aware.  Briefly, the letter would answer Deputy Jones's question. There is no objection to arbitration if the parties concerned want it. If they agree to take the land but cannot agree on the price, they can put it straight away to arbitration by agreement, without any enquiry or any such delaying tactics. If I were to put this into the Bill, I think it would only be complicating the issue because there is no question of our ability to do it at present.</P>

      <P>Now that I have reiterated what I said in the letter to Deputy Clinton, Deputy Jones may be satisfied that there is no difficulty about this arbitration. Putting it specifically into the Bill is not called for and would add nothing to the Bill nor would it facilitate the process which can be employed at present.</P>
      <P>Deputy Treacy referred to rents. He was very upset about the way they were, as he said, going up and up. He spoke of rents having increased 300 per cent. I looked at some of the rents in Clonmel and according to the figures I have in the Department, the rents in a recent year varied from 1/8 to 48/7 per week. It is quite possible to have had an increase of 300 per cent within the 1/8. I wonder from what figure it might have started. I wonder whether the Deputy really has a worthwhile point or is he relying on percentages to exaggerate the case he is attempting to make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>He was very distressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the word; he was very distressed about this. If it were a question of multiplying £1 or <Col N="403" /> 10/- by three and the persons concerned were shown to be not as well off as when they were allocated the houses, I should be as distressed as the Deputy and I should endeavour to rectify the situation but the Deputy not having elaborated on the matter and against the background of rents ranging from 1/8 to 48/7 per week, one does not have that reaction. It is quite conceivable that a 300 per cent increase could have taken place by raising a rent of 6d to 1/8. That could have happened just as readily as it would have happened on a rent of 10/-or £1.</P>
      <P>If on the other hand in a review of rents, it is found there is somebody who could pay the rent he is paying three times over, I do not think it would be unreasonable to multiply it by three in such circumstances and if the person who enjoyed this good value for years is aggrieved to the extent that he is fed up with all of us, it should be possible for such a person to go out and get his own house. That would be a good thing for him and for the local authority who would then be able to let the house to somebody who needed it. We have not sufficient information from Deputy Treacy to show what sort of rent was increased 300 per cent and until we do I am inclined to leave the figures ranging from 1/8 to 48/7 stand as the two ends of the rent scale in Clonmel. We cannot decide that what has happened is just or unjust in the cases he had in mind and about which he was so disturbed.</P>
      <P>Deputy McAuliffe was very concerned that I should as Minister meet a deputation from Cork County Council. He explained that the purpose of the deputation would be to discuss what moneys would be available for housing in future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not decrying what the Deputy's colleague said.  I  am merely recalling what he said in order that I can explain the situation. He has been asking for this deputation; the local authority have asked for it <Col N="404" /> and he has pleaded here for it. Deputy Corry may also have pleaded for it when I was out of the House. The purpose of it is to discuss provision of money for housing, sanitary services and such other works as any local authority would wish to do during the coming year. On 26th January we asked the same local authority to give us details of what they wanted to talk about. This, I would add, is quite normal practice and is very useful because often a deputation will arrive and I will not be in a position to talk to them because I will not know what their problem is. We received a reply from them on 28th January, two days later&mdash;local authorities can move fast, despite what Deputy O'Connell said&mdash; and that reply was being examined by various sections of the Department when on the telephone last Monday, they demanded an answer. The man on the telephone said: &ldquo;I am instructed not to leave here until I get the Minister to say he will meet us.&rdquo; I must say I do not like that, but that is not being taken into consideration at the moment. I do not like ultimatums in matters such at this or anything else which can be done in a more acceptable way.</P>
      <P>At any rate the situation was that we were not in a position to give a reply on that occasion and there was a reply given by telephone on Tuesday. In fact what happened on Monday was that the coaxial cable was broken on that circuit and calls were delayed for a minimum of two hours, so that it was impossible to telephone the council before they adjourned&mdash; apparently a meeting was in progress when the ultimatum was announced. It was not because we took umbrage that they did not get a reply but because the coaxial cable was broken. I should say that I should be in a position to give a decision on the proposals outstanding in Cork and other counties when the present consultations with various councils have been concluded. I have made it known that these have been going on for the past month. Cork County Council are surely aware of this and I am amazed that they should be so &ldquo;het up&rdquo; about coming up to see me.</P>

While we have not been able to see them, it is true to say that there is every reason why every other local authority should come up to me on the same day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a general problem and not related solely to a particular problem or to Cork county, as indeed the deputation which I received a couple of weeks ago was related to a particular problem and I received them immediately and we met with success. I could not usefully meet this deputation without holding out to every other local authority that I am prepared to do the same thing for them. If I were to do that, it would take another month and we would be no nearer a solution to the fair allocations of moneys for all than we are today. <Col N="406" /> I would ask Cork County Council to bear with me in this matter and not press me to receive a deputation. I want to say also that members of this House who are members of Cork County Council are quite welcome to see me in this House at any time on matters concerning their constituents or anything else. All I am holding out against is a particular deputation from a particular local authority in relation to matters which are common to all local authorities. I have received deputations from other counties in recent weeks on various problems and I would be quite happy to see the Cork Deputies but not as a deputation on monetary matters for the year to come, which we are considering for the country as a whole at the moment.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick <i>(Cavan)</i> made a very good case last night, and in fact he made several good cases, and then proceeded to demolish them. He talked about reconstruction and said that the reconstruction grants were far too low and that the new home grants&mdash;which he then made into £900, although he was complaining that they were never changed from away back&mdash;were inducing farmers to build new houses and demolish houses fit for repair and reconstruction. The Deputy does not seem to realise that one of the fundamentals for qualifying for the higher rate of new house grant is that a person has not a habitable dwelling or a dwelling capable of being put into a proper condition at a reasonable cost. If he has, then he repairs it with the aid of the grants but he certainly may not demolish it or get £900 to build a new house. The Deputy complained about how low the reconstruction grant was&mdash;I think he mentioned £140 &mdash;and having made the case that money values had changed, he turned to the £450 new house grant and used the combination of the supplementary grant and the grant from the Government, amounting to £900 to show that we were paying too much in relation to the new house. He indicated that Cavan County Council have taken a stand, believe it or not, on these reconstruction grants and had proved themselves right.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>We have many references to town planning but not necessarily one that would lead us to the conclusion that this is necessary. In fact, this is one of the places where we are not so convinced that a change is necessary in this regard as it would appear to Dublin County Council and Dublin Corporation.  They have the view that a change is far more necessary than we believe it is. However, they may be right. We will see, and if changes are necessary, undoubtedly, we will come to this House looking for the changes. <Col N="408" /> On the general debate, we have been charged with a declining housing output in recent years. We have been charged with deliberately setting out to have a declining output in housing. We have been charged with not providing the money. We have been charged on all those things and none of them is, in fact, supported by the facts.  The decline in housing is best answered by the following figures in recent years: in 1961-62, there were 5,780 houses built, in 1962-63, there were 7,020 houses built&mdash;21 per cent over the previous year&mdash;in 1963-64, there were 7,580, an eight per cent rise; in 1964-65, there were 9,430, a 24 per cent rise; in 1965-66&mdash;this can only still remain an estimate because there are five weeks of the year to go&mdash;there were 11,000 completions, an increase of 16 per cent. Our forecast for the coming year is that we will build, and complete, approximately 11,200 houses.</P>
      <P>The current activity in this whole field of both private and local authorities could be looked at in this way. While I have quoted the past six years, to give an idea that we have not been declining but rather rising substantially every year in our output, let us look at the nine months up to 31st December last. It will be found, on the private side, that grant allocations, which are not absolute, but which are a guide by which we have been enabled to estimate our pattern over the years&mdash;with long experience those estimates have worked fairly dead on the button&mdash;for the nine months ended 31st December of the year 1963 were 5,271.  For the year ended 31st December, 1964, they were 5,931.  For 1965, up to the end of last December, this figure has now reached 6,308.  I should say, lest there may be anybody under any misapprehension about it, that the figures for the last quarter, that is, the last three months of 1965, are up on the figures for the last quarter of 1964. Currently, and up to those dates, you can see a progressive rise in the number of grant allocations made from my Department which, generally over the years, are shown to indicate fairly accurately what, in fact, the activity in the building of private houses is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="409" /> On the local authority side, on the other hand, we had in progress on 31st December, 1963&mdash;I will give the same three years&mdash;3,008 houses.  In 1964, we had 4,272, and in 1965, including Ballymun, this figure is away up to 6,900.  You can take a couple of thousand off that for Ballymun, and give us credit only for part of it since it is such a huge contract, but nevertheless, no matter how you look at it, the 1965 figure for houses in progress, allowing some part of Ballymun to rank in the same way as other local authorities in previous years, our comparision must again show what the figures I have given show, that on the private and local authority side, currently, our indicators are all pointing upwards and not downwards as has been so many times reiterated in this House in this debate.</P>
    <P>I should say, as well, that the Second Programme projection for housing of 12,000 to 14,000 houses per year is, I think, being fairly lived up to.  Our 1964/65 projection was intended to be 8,700 completions. Our output actually for that year was 9,430.  Our 1965-66 projection was 10,300 and our estimate for completion by the end of next month is 11,000.  Those are things that were indicated a few years ago, not just yesterday or the day before and it is interesting to note in those two years, since that target was set up and those interim targets were named and numbered, including this year, we would appear to have exceeded the target set and published at that time by the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion.</i></P>
    <P>Another thing which, I think, is even more important and is well worth looking at here, to try and get things in their proper perspective, so far as the state of building and house building in this country is concerned, is the amount of money provided from public capital over the past six years. We provided in 1960-61. £9.3 million; in 1961-62, £9.67 million; in 1962-63. £11.9 million; in 1963-64, £12.12 million; and in 1965, up to £15.33 million.  The year 1965-66 jumps almost £5 million, from £15 million to <Col N="410" /> £20.12 million. That is our estimate, including the remaining five weeks. Our projection and forecast for 1966-67 is £21.5 million.</P>
    <P>There are other figures which must be added into this for any sort of a serious appraisal of house building, as a whole, and that is the moneys that were available, and are expected to be available, not only from public capital but from the building societies and insurance companies as well. I have I not got those figures for the earlier years but I have three figures here, which I can give the House, the country and the building fraternity in particular.  The amount of money actually provided, for the year 1964-65, by the building societies and insurance companies combined was £12.5 million for house purchase buildings or what you will.  This figure, during 1965-66, dropped to £11.3 million which can, I suppose, be regarded as the estimate to the end of next month, nevertheless dropped from £12.5 million in 1964-65 to £11.3 million in 1965-66. Here again is the significant figure. Against all the forebodings and forecasts of gloom, the forecast of available money, from those same sources will show a rise this year, again not much but still a rise, from £11.3 million to £11.5 million.  It went down from £12.5 million to £11.3 million and now, according to the forecasts which I have been given from all those various bodies, it is now coming up again for the current year, to £11.5 million.</P>
    <P>Now, to give a proper picture, I think what we need to do is to get the last two years, the actual amount spent a year ago, the amount we will have spent by the end of March and the projected available money for the coming 12 months and we will find that in 1964-65 the combined moneys spent from public capital, building societies and insurance companies was £27.83 million. In 1965-66, this disastrously bad year, that £27 million has gone up to £31.43 million, which has been spent during the 12 months ending on 31st March of this year. This is really a forecast for both public capital and the other moneys I have mentioned which will show a further <Col N="411" /> rise of money available in the coming 12 months from £31.43 million this year to £33 million in the year 1966-67. When we look at those figures and, at the same time, recall what has been said here in this House by those who have criticised the present situation, we begin to wonder just what would satisfy the critics at this particular time.  The figures do not bear them out, either as to the money being spent this year or of both public and other moneys available for housing. The forecast for next year is somewhat bigger than that for the past year, though not as much as we would wish, but bigger than any paid by any Government in the history of this country.</P>
    <P>The number of houses continued to rise, from 1961-62 onwards, at a progressively increasing tempo and we have, in fact, reached the point that in the period from 1961-62 to 1965-66, we have almost doubled our output on houses between local authority and private enterprise.  This, too, must be viewed against the over-all criticism and intent of the motion put down and being discussed here&mdash;of a decline in housing output in recent years.  If we did not have a shortage of finance, in spite of all that additional money being provided, we are still short of money that we could usefully use for housing and public construction, if we had it made available to us from all the various sources from which we draw.  The fact is that our demand for money in this respect is exceeding that anticipated to be available from all sources.  Therefore, we will not be able to go ahead as fast in the coming 12 months as we could physically have done if the money were available.</P>
    <P>That is why we have got to bring about this whole review in order to enable us to utilise the capital made available for housing to the best possible advantage and in the fairest possible way, as between local authority and local authority throughout the country.  We could spend many more millions in the coming year than we have got.  I do reiterate that we will have more millions in the coming year than we <Col N="412" /> had in the present year, which was very much higher than the year before that and in any event much higher than the amount spent by any Government in any year in the history of the country up to date.  This review of our finances is necessary not only to give us the best spread of this money but also to ensure that there is some correlation between the amounts of money available and the plans and programming which our local authorities have embarked upon in recent years at our behest.  This is necessary in order that we can make the best use of available finance, the widest spread of it, and give a fair and just distribution, within all of those limits, to all of our people in all parts of the country.</P>
    <P>This review, of course, will, necessarily I think on the local authority side, require them to review what I have already mentioned in discussing some particular item raised here, that is, it will require a review by local authorities of their methods of financing their part of the input into housing. This is not only a question of the ability of ratepayers to carry more but also a question of whether or not the renting over the entire renting range in each local authority area is, in fact, giving a return to some people who have tenancies there, a proper return in regard to the ability of some of those people to pay.</P>
    <P>To repeat, it is my aim not just to bring about, by a reappraisal of rents, an increase of rents&mdash;this is not the purpose&mdash;but to bring about a rationalisation of rents which will clearly leave the county councils in the position that if their rates can carry additional money for this purpose&mdash;and I think everybody is agreed that they cannot&mdash;then, that they may seek from those who are better off, and well able to pay, decent rents and so be enabled to reduce rents for people who, up to now, have had to refuse houses because they could not pay or those who are paying at great hardship to themselves at the moment.  To some of the tenants in our local authority houses, the smallest of our rents may be too high.  To try to help <Col N="413" /> those people and those who may be worse off and who have not got a house because they cannot get one on any score, we have to look out and see if there is any fat in this that could help to bear the burden for those who are less well off and less able to pay. This is the whole essence of my effort to try to get reappraisal of rents.</P>
    <P>I must deplore the effort of many of the Opposition who tried to make it appear that I have demanded and directed that rents must go up.  This is a complete clouding of the issue, a complete dodging of the issue, and one which I will combat in every way open to me in order that the public including the tenants of our local authority houses, are fully alive to what is really my intention, rather than the alleged intention being perpetrated and being put around by our opponents who do not want to do anything unless, in fact, it is something of a nature that will carry popular favour for them for a short time.  That is very shortsighted and it is a disastrous outlook for any member of a local authority who, perhaps may also happen to be a member of this House and who carries the story in here as well as throughout the length and breadth of the country, that I am directing an increase in rents for the sake of increasing rents.  That is not so.  I would hope that many of the Opposition do understand the sentiments behind my endeavours in this regard and that the local authorities are working in this direction to try to bring about an improvement in their housing account which will enable them to do more for those of our community who are least able to do anything for themselves, in regard to either paying a rent of any substance or providing a house for themselves.</P>
    <P>This, I believe, many of our local authority people are doing and I am not, in a wide general way, condemning those who do not belong to my particular Party.  But I do condemn those who are trying to mislead the tenants, and the public, into the belief that the rents must go up&mdash;&ldquo;the Minister for Local Government is responsible; he told us we must do it and we have to do it, and nothing more <Col N="414" /> about it.&rdquo;  There will be more about that if I hear any more of that type of talk from those who do not want the responsibility and who are prepared to allow those who could pay a good rent or build their own houses to buy houses at meagre small rents and, at the same time, deprive other poor people of those houses and of the assistance which the public could give to the poorer, if, in fact, they were not being kept out of those houses by people who are well enough off to provide for themselves.</P>
    <P>The conserving of our existing stock of houses I have already mentioned but I think it important enough to mention it again.  For too long we have neglected&mdash;I am speaking generally; some county councils and urban authorities have not&mdash;our national housing stocks by providing insufficient money each year at the striking of local rates.  This has been catching up on us in recent years.  Indeed, some of the more recent purchase schemes that have come to me in the Department have arisen on the basis that councillors and Deputies have taken the attitude: &ldquo;Let us sell them even at those bad terms because to keep them would cost us more&rdquo;.  They were their own houses but they neglected them to such an extent that it would be better to give them away than repair them.</P>
    <P>With the continuously rising costs of house building, which do not show any signs of abating, and the huge numbers of new houses we must continue to provide, we cannot afford to neglect this matter in the future.  In so far as I can utilise my powers as Minister, whether by withholding subsidy or any other device necessary, I intend to see that in future sufficient money is provided by housing authorities at their annual estimates meetings to ensure that houses are preserved in the future. This is for the good of the local authorities. It is not something I just wish to have them do.  It is something they must do in their own best interests and I feel I must make a stand if they do not pull up their socks in the immediate future.</P>
    <P>Another matter I should mention is that the capital we propose to spend <Col N="415" /> on housing in future years must be spent as efficiently as humanly possible. This means we must rationalise the traditional building system.  I am not finding fault with traditional building but we must rationalise it by introducing new methods. This is not to say that we shall introduce throughout the country the system on which we have embarked at Ballymun.  That is not what I mean by new system.  I regard Ballymun as a very good venture in industrial flat building mainly.  A new system of rationalising building will mean not a new factory to produce houses as we produce flats at Ballymun. It means various new ways of doing things.  It means getting our components from central workshops rather than having every man on every site catering for himself&mdash;a system which does not give the best value for money. The sort of development I have mentioned is growing.  It is not something we can just mention here and hope to bring about.  It will grow apace as the years go on.</P>
    <P>In so far as house-building is concerned, we must devise for local authorities the most efficient methods of handling the moneys provided by taxpayers and ratepayers so that the best value will be secured.  In the Department, we are concerned with a huge volume of capital spending and we must strive at all times to get the most efficient methods of dealing with this money so that at all times we will get the greatest value in the end product.</P>
    <P>A reorganisation of contract procedures is overdue.  This includes programming, which I spoke about earlier. The whole concept of the ritual through which local authorities had to go in the past&mdash;the publication of their intention to acquire, to seek tenders&mdash; has not been conducive to getting the best value for money in so far as the contracts ultimately laid were concerned. We may have to depart from that time-honoured procedure. If we do, it will be for the sole purpose of endeavouring to get better value for money and not, as it may be said, to put work in certain directions.  This is <Col N="416" /> a charge local authorities will face if they depart from time-honoured traditions such as the acceptance of the lowest tenders and the publication in advance of their intentions.  This ritual has not helped to add to the value received for money.  In cases where we depart from it, both local authorities and the Minister may be charged not with good motives but with ulterior ones.  On the other hand, if we do not depart from these procedures, we will be criticised.  In other words, we will be criticised one way or another no matter what we do.</P>
    <P>I shall conclude by referring to the Housing Bill itself.  Apart from the nine or ten new provisions in it, the Bill is highly complex.  That it has gone through the House with only three division bells ringing is not just a tribute to the Bill and its contents but to the Members of the House, to the Opposition who do not agree with me in many things very often.  It is a tribute to all who participated in the long discussions that only three divisions took place.  It is a very good indication that no matter what may be said now of the Bill, it is as good a measure as we could devise.  It contains 121 sections, four Schedules and repeals more than 50 Acts.  Its all-embracing nature is probably its biggest single advantage which, I think, in the future will be looked on with good feelings by those who need to know what the Housing law is.  We have tried in this Bill to give the country an upto-date code of housing laws and the fact that though we have not been unanimaous, there has been no major disagreement is a tribute not only to the sponsors of the Bill, to the officials who originally conceived it but to the Members who participated in the debate.  In particular, I pay tribute to Deputies Clinton and James Tully who stayed here with me not only during the long Committee Stage but throughout the subsequent Stages which were perplexing and arduous.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no amendments. I did have a look at a couple <Col N="418" /> of the points raised on the last occasion. The first point was the necessity for the statutory provision for the transfer of accounts.  Deputy Dillon raised a point concerning the transfer of property which was on bailment with the National Bank; Deputy Tully raised a point about pension rights, and another point raised was why a separate Irish company was necessary.</P>
      <P>On the first point&mdash;the necessity for statutory provision for the transfer of accounts, which is provided for in section 2&mdash;in the absence of the section the transfer of customers' accounts would not be effective to enable customers to operate these accounts after the transfer date without individual customers in each case arranging with the National Bank of Ireland, the new company, for the opening of a new account.  I think it is established and accepted that the National Bank are entitled in law to transfer accounts owing to it by its customers and the securities for these accounts, but the National Bank of Ireland would not be entitled to rely on these securities to cover future advances by this new bank.  Therefore it would be necessary in such an event, without the enactment of this section, that all customers' accounts be ruled off on the transfer date.  It would be further necessary for each customer to make individual arrangements as regards overdraft accommodation as from that date.  The section is designed to prevent such a situation arising on the transfer date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that in the case of transfer of property on bailment it is accepted that it is possible to transfer the bailment from one to the other.  In any event, the section dealing with this, section 5, is designed to avoid disturbing the existing arrangement in relation to documents, goods and property deposited in the Irish branches of the National Bank for safe custody only. The National Bank of Ireland will in fact obtain custody of these documents and goods when it takes possession of the bank premises on the transfer date. The alternative to this would be that all these goods and documents would be returned to their owners on the <Col N="419" /> transfer date and, if the owners desire&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>On the goods being returned to the owners, the owners then would have to arrange to deposit them individually, if they so wished, with the new bank, the National Bank of Ireland.  As Deputies will appreciate, this would cause considerable inconvenience and great difficulties not only for the bank but, more particularly, for the persons whose property these goods and documents are.  The section does not in any way take away from or interfere with the rights of these persons in relation to their documents and goods.</P>
      <P>On the question of pension rights, there is a pension scheme operating between the National Bank and its employees.  I think I need mention only one or two points of that scheme in order to illustrate the necessity for the proviso in this section which was raised in particular by Deputy Tully. A male official of the National Bank is entitled to retire on pension at the age of 65 or on completion of 45 years service or in the case of ill health. A male official who, after 15 years service, is called upon to retire for any cause except dishonesty or disobedience or some such action would be entitled to a pension.  Otherwise, except in those instances, a male official is not entitled to a pension at the present time.  The rights of female officials of the bank are similar in all respects except in the case of retirement on marriage when a female official is entitled to a gratuity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The necessity for the section may be seen from this example : a person might claim that, on the cessor of existence of the National Bank, he was being dismissed for causes other than disobedience or misconduct and might therefore claim a pension.  It is <Col N="420" /> reasonable to assume that the same person will continue in service with the new company, the National Bank of Ireland, and would be in a position to claim a pension for service with the National Bank and to begin, with his new service, to earn pension rights with the National Bank of Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the point.  Suppose he is transferred to some out-of-the-way place and has to leave his house, or for any other reason.  Suppose he does not want to continue service?  Can he avail of pension rights then or does he forfeit the whole lot?</P>

      <P>It is a fund that is paid in regularly on behalf of each official, although they do not personally contribute to it.  I take it that this fund is accumulated as an entity of the bank which now exists. This Bill is to divide this bank into two sections.  I think Deputy Sweetman's query is very sound&mdash;what is the measure of the division; how much money is retained in this fund in the continuing National Bank and the Bank of Scotland; how much will come to the Irish half?</P>

      <P>With a view to implementing the foregoing the Vendor Bank and the Purchaser Bank shall so far as is within their power procure the establishment of a Pension Scheme or Pension Trust Funds in relation to the officers clerks and servants referred to in paragraph (b) hereof and also in relation to the pensions referred to in paragraph (a) hereof and the transfer to the Purchaser Bank hereof of the appropriate part or parts of the several pension or superannuation funds now existing in relation to the officers, clerks and servants of the Vendor Bank.</P>

      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister have I completely misunderstood this Bill or have I not?  It seems to me that the Bill does nothing except make it cheaper and easier for a decision of the shareholders in the company to be carried through if the shareholders so decide.  I think the meeting is today.  Supposing the shareholders decide today that they want to carry this division into effect, then it seems to me that everything that this Bill does could be done by the two different companies, the old and the new, but at enormous expense both to the company and, much more so, to the customers.  The Bill itself, as I understand it, does not take away the rights of anybody, rights that could be cumbersomely taken away under the <Col N="428" /> existing law, but I think a great deal of the misunderstanding in relation to the Bill&mdash;I am talking now of outside this House&mdash;arises from the fact that there is this belief that the Bill is taking away rights that could not otherwise be taken away.  As I understand it, the Bill provides solely a ready and easy method of doing something which the two companies concerned could otherwise do at enormous inconvenience to every person concerned in any way and at the very greatest cost.  The cost, for example, to mention one small matter, of ensuring transfer in the Land Registry of every single charge from the National Bank to the National Bank of Ireland, would be fantastic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>And the time. Nobody would ever live to see the end of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The cost would be fantastic and it would be chargeable to the customers and not to the banks. Apart from that, the Land Registry are in such a mess already, because of the Government's failure to give them the proper facilities, we would never get anything of any sort again out of the Land Registry.  The works are badly gummed up there and this would put the kibosh on them altogether.  However, it is quite legal to do it the other way and all the Minister is doing in this Bill in that respect is to provide a cheaper and speedier way of doing it, arriving at the same result at the end.</P>
      <P>By accepting this Bill the House is not passing any judgment on whether the price paid for the shares is a just, an adequate or a fair price.  It is not passing any judgment as to whether the directors concerned were wise in the manner of presentation&mdash;wise, for example, in the National Bank not providing quite the same technical advice guarantees as were provided otherwise.  The House is not passing judgment on whether the price is too low or too high.  All that will happen is, if the parties themselves decide, this Bill will cut down the cost of doing the job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am a little concerned about the pension fund which we discussed on an <Col N="429" /> earlier stage and I should like the Minister to clarify the position beyond question between now and the time at which the Bill will come before the Seanad, making it publicly clear, so to speak, in the Seanad why there are references to these funds, if there are no funds, and exactly where the difference lies between a fund and a scheme, and exactly what will happen. It is undoubted that all the pensions of the employees in England and here have been and are being at present paid apparently out of the same kitty, whether that is a specially earmarked fund or the general funds of the bank. I want to ensure that these people will be paid in a similar way in future and that all the rights that are there will be duly and adequately preserved when this Bill goes through, if it does go through.</P>
    <P>I do not think we need comment here on whether or not there are good or adequate reasons for the Bill, but there is one thing we should bear in mind.  I do not think it would be to the national advantage to have too much rationalisation of the banking system. People often say, when there are two branch banks in a small country town, that there is not enough business for both.  Quite apart from the element of competition, the personal element is tremendously important and, if rationalisation is to mean fewer branch banks in country towns than at present, that will put the managers of the banks who are left in a position in which I do not think anybody would like to see them.  The personal relationship between the customer and the manager can, through no fault of either, often go wrong and an aspect will be introduced into banking that should not be in it.  Perhaps that is not strictly relevant, but I mention it from the point of view of throwing out a very strong <i>caveat</i> against further mergers.</P>
    <P>It would not be desirable, I think quite honestly, that this particular group should extend further.  The slice now held by the four associates, the parent itself and the three subsidiaries, is a large enough slice for any one organisation to have.  Though the subsidiary bodies will to some extent be <Col N="430" /> competing against one another, it is nevertheless the one organisation and if it went further than is visualised under the present scheme it would, in my opinion, go much too far on the road to monopoly.  While it may be that others may join together to compete with this large group, that is a different story.  That could have sound results but, so far as this group is concerned, I think it would be dangerous for it to extend any further.</P>
    <P>I trust those concerned will see the dangers that would arise from the creation of such a monopoly. When they are engaged, as they must be engaged, and as they should be engaged, in the consideration of what rationalisation of services can be provided, I hope they will remember in particular the personal element in the country as between the customer and the bank manager, which may become a very difficult relationship if it so happens there is only one bank in an area.  If the customer falls foul of the bank manager, he will have to do his banking business in another town.  That will be neither satisfactory nor desirable from the point of view of the national interest, apart altogether from the personal, individual interest.</P>

      <P>The Minister clarified the position about the superannuation fund and I am satisfied that that matter has been dealt with. Secondly, on the question of the valuation account, the Minister explained the other night that he was not quite clear and, when he had finished, I was not quite clear what the situation was. It does appear that the stamp duty paid on transfer has to be paid on a very much smaller sum than the actual value of the bank buildings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy J.A. Costello and Deputy Esmonde made the point that I was suggesting that the shareholders of the National Bank were being asked to pay on a much greater amount than was actually the case.  Of course, the direct opposite is the case because it would be the shareholders of the new bank that would be paying not the shareholders of the bank who are selling. The final point is this: is the Minister satisfied that the shareholders <Col N="431" /> of the existing National Bank are being treated fairly on the valuation of the buildings in view of the fact that property which should be worth anything up to £10 million is being transferred at a value, according to their own balance sheet of £2,980,000? Does that not mean that the shareholders of the new bank are being given possession of a property for one-fourth or one-fifth of its actual value? Is the Minister satisfied that that is not the position?</P>

An application was made on behalf of Departmental Funds for £5 million leaving £20 million available for public subscription.  Firm applications from life assurance offices amounted to £3.9 million and applications from other subscribers amounted to £16,437,000, making a total public subscription of over £20.3 million.  To enable these applications to be met in full, the application on behalf of Departmental Funds was reduced.  Instead, therefore, of the loan being a &ldquo;near failure&rdquo;, it was oversubscribed to the extent of £337.</P>

      <P>I take it that the central memorial mentioned by the Deputy is the sunken garden.  It is not intended that the public should have access to the grassed areas on the upper level and protective railings will be erected near the steps at each end of the sunken garden to cut off access to those areas.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="439" /> I need hardly point out that the Garden of Remembrance was designed as a memorial to all those who gave their lives in the cause of Irish freedom and is not intended to be used as a playground for children.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Since other memorials that were intended as monuments to the dead are, in fact, playgrounds for children and as this is in my constituency and as there is a considerable drop in the central cruciform part of the garden, I do not want to be attending to any casualties other than those of 1916 when this garden opens.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer is &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  The position is that, in May 1964, the Commissioners of Public Works gave final approval to the Laois County Council for the erection of a public toilet on a site which formed part of the former military barracks at Portlaoise.  In July 1964 the council informed the Commissioners that they had decided to abandon the proposal to erect a toilet on the site in question.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries if it is a fact that a CIE lorry left Galway on Wednesday morning 16th February, 1966, with a fourteen ton load of fish fingers from the Bord Iascaigh Mhara factory and returned to Galway the same night with the load still on the lorry, as it was not accepted in Dublin as fit for human consumption; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>No. I am informed that part of a consignment of 10 tons of fish fingers delivered on 16th February was, by agreement with the consignee, returned to Galway for repacking because the consignee was not satisfied that it was sufficiently uniform in size, and that it was re-delivered on 18th February, 1966.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland (for the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs)</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 33 to 36 together.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to say at this stage where the sub-postoffice at Drumcondra will be located.</P>
      <P>The rule regarding politics which applies in the case of subpostmasters is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The nature and conditions of Post Office employment render it essential that servants of the Department should maintain a reserve in political <Col N="451" /> matters, that they should not put themselves forward on the side of any political Party and that they should be careful to do nothing that would give colour to any suggestion that their official actions are in any way influenced, or capable of being influenced, by Party motives. The action of any servant of the Department who identifies himself actively or publicly with political matters is indefensible, and such conduct is detrimental to the interests of the Service as a whole.</P>
    <P>The following directions are laid down for general guidance:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  Dáil Éireann Election Committees. A servant of the Department shall not be a member of an Association or serve on a Committee having for its object the promotion of the interests of a political Party or the promotion or prevention of the return of a particular candidate to the Dáil.</P>
    <P>(ii)  Neutrality.  A Servant of the Department shall not support or oppose any particular candidate or Party either by public speaking or writing.</P>
    <P>(iii)  Public Political Comment. A Servant of the Department shall not make any verbal statements in public (or which are liable to be published), and shall not contribute to newspapers or other publications any letters or articles conveying information, comment or criticism on any matter of current political interest, or which concerns the political action or position of the Government or of any member or group of members of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The foregoing directions apply to the action of an official whether taken by himself alone or in association with others.  Should any departure from official impartiality occur it will be followed by disciplinary action.</P>
    <P>Official rules for subpostmasters are contained in various books of rules and in departmental circulars issued from time to time.  I do not consider that it would be either appropriate or desirable <Col N="452" /> to place copies of all of these before the House but I am prepared to furnish on request a copy of any rule in which a Deputy may be interested provided that it would not be contrary to the public interest to do so.</P>
    <P>The candidate selected for appointment as subpostmaster, Drumcondra, will be required to sever his political Party affiliation in Dublin Corporation before taking up the appointment.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatHogan" hpid="Mr. P. Hogan (South Tipperary) Mr. P. Hogan (South Tipperary)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> I am still not satisfied, despite what the Minister has told us, that it was essential to bring this matter to the House for legislation and that this matter could not be dealt with under ordinary common law.  There has been, from the beginning, a great scarcity of information.  Indeed, it was obvious that the Minister had been rather incompletely briefed on the subject and his main purpose was to get this enabling Act through the House.  Naturally, when one finds a situation like that, and when one hears rumblings outside about dissatisfied shareholders, one is inclined to make full inquiries into the matter.  For instance, the Minister has given us figures as regards the Bank of Ireland and their offer to the National Bank section here in this country but we have had no information as to what has been offered by the National Commercial Bank for the part of the National Bank in England and Wales. Apparently the bank is being divided into two and one half is being tied up in England and Wales.  We have no information about what offer has been made there by the National Bank of Scotland.</P>
      <P>Deputy Sweetman stated that this Bill had been introduced to save money to the bank and to the customers, to facilitate a cheap merger, that, if this Bill had not been introduced, it would be a very expensive merger.  It is the first time I have ever heard of a Minister for Finance throwing away money and when one finds a Minister for Finance doing that, one begins to wonder.  Deputy Sweetman has also said that the House is not passing judgement on the merits or demerits of the transaction as far as the shareholders are concerned. I cannot but feel that the bringing in of this measure for the approval of the House prior to consideration of the transfer by the respective shareholders, and particularly by the shareholders of the National Bank, may be calculated to influence the minds of some shareholders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Tully had adverted to a point which, apparently, has disturbed <Col N="497" /> the shareholders from the beginning, that is, the feeling that they are not getting full value for their shares.  He has mentioned the real value of the bank premises as against the value quoted in the balance sheets published to the shareholders.  The Minister is getting a half interest in this venture. He is, of course, expected to get £100,000 in stamp duty on the transaction. It is also stated&mdash;the Minister can correct my figure if he likes&mdash;that he will get an extra £100,000 in income tax when the merger is brought about.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to tell me if there will be any capital inflow.  The Minister is desperately in need of capital at the moment.  I would not blame him for looking over his shoulder to get money.  If 75 per cent of the shares are in the hands of Irish citizens, and if the interest in that professional ownership is in the hands of citizens here in the Twenty-Six Counties, may we not expect a net capital inflow here?  I am putting this question to the Minister.  If public capital inflow is expected as a result of this transaction, how much does the Minister expect on that basis?</P>
    <P>The Minister has not told us what the directorship position is.  I would certainly expect that he was approached by the Bank of Ireland and by the National Bank to introduce this measure here to facilitate the merger.  I presume he was approached by the directors of the Bank of Ireland and by the directors of the National Bank.  Will this merger create new directorships?  Will any improved financial circumstances arise to any of those directors?  I am putting the old Roman question, <i>cui bono</i>?  When we are asked to take the rather unprecedented step of giving the Minister an enabling Bill to secure a commercial merger, we are entitled to know those facts.</P>
    <P>I asked the Minister last Tuesday if he was aware of any situation where a commercial merger had taken place at any time in any country where it was deemed expedient or necessary to go, before the measure took place, to the national parliament to ask them <Col N="498" /> to introduce and pass an enabling Bill.  He said he was not.  Surely some situation like this must have occurred some time, somewhere in the history of the world.  I presume, if it did, or wherever it occurred, it was dealt with under the ordinary company laws obtaining in those countries.  I am not a lawyer and I am, naturally, not conversant with the niceties of legislation but I am still unconvinced that this matter could not and should not have been dealt with under the ordinary company Acts.  Certainly, it would have looked much better had we allowed the shareholders of the National Bank and the shareholders of the Bank of Ireland to make their own horse-deal&mdash;call it what you will&mdash;in their own way and then, having made their decision one way or the other, let the Minister come forward with his enabling Bill, if it was deemed necessary and expedient to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to intervene for very long in this debate, except to say that I think the situation falls as between Deputy Sweetman's assertion that if there were further take-overs banking would become a monopoly in the hands of a few, while, at the same time, there is the argument that the bigger the bank the better the balance.  What I mean by balance is that, for instance, a certain section of a bank's customers needs a greater amount of accommodation, but as long as it is a big bank covering a wide spectrum of the economy, then the likelihood is that there will be another sector of customers of that bank who will not require this extra accommodation during that same period.  In other words, the scales would be balanced, as they would not be balanced in a small bank which, of necessity, must have a smaller involvement in the entire economy within the country.  I think, therefore, that perhaps what Deputy Sweetman has said, or even to go as far as Deputy Hogan's field, is clinically accurate, in as much as this take-over is probably a good thing for the customers of banks in this country, but that further take-overs would be a bad thing.  From that point of view, <Col N="499" /> then, I think we can go forward in the realisation that today, or some other day, the shareholders&mdash;who are really the proprietors of the National Bank&mdash;should make their decision. This is really a matter which should be decided by them in the light of their opinion of what the deal is.  I do not think this House has to be concerned with the Bill; it merely has to be concerned with the general effect on banking policy and banking itself.</P>
      <P>Deputy Sweetman's line is probably correct in as much as mergers can be good, and this one could be a good thing, but we do not want a lot more mergers which would create a monopoly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I am still of the same opinion as Deputy Hogan that we have not really had any real explanation as to why this deal has taken place.  The only thing one can read from the documents is that the National Bank, finding itself with a considerable call on its finances for development of the economy here, was unable to meet its requirements, or that it was a source of embarrassment to meet them.  For that reason they wanted to get rid of the Irish section of the bank so that they would not have to continue to supply the credit which the Government were unable to get elsewhere.  If one reads into Mr. Acton's statement, Mr. Acton being the President, sitting in London, of the National Bank, that is the only thing one can extract from that&mdash;that that is the sole reason why this merger is brought about.</P>
      <P>It seems to me, then, that the Bank of Ireland are getting quite a good deal.  The statement of the Governor of the Bank of Ireland in Dublin today&mdash;which was reported on the 1.30 p.m. news, which the Minister may or may not have heard&mdash;that, domestic savings were insufficient to meet the requirements of the expansion of the economy in this country supplies the answer.  He said, as a result of that, the drain was so heavy on the banks that they were unable to lend the requisite amount for private enterprise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, we have not had from the <Col N="500" /> Minister any real reason as to why this transfer has taken place.  He has told us, in effect, that this merger has taken place, or this Bill has been introduced here, because he has been asked by the Bank of Ireland to introduce it.  I am not quite sure if he said the National Bank asked him as well, but that is the only explanation given for these two documents.  The only other thing we have is the Chairman's statement which I read into as being the reason for the English branches advising this bank to get out because they do not want to continue lending to the economy here, the drain being too great on their resources.  I do not think there is any other reason.</P>
    <P>The National Bank has a record, going back over hundreds of years, as being one of the most solvent banks and one of the biggest employers in this country.  In this Bill, we are virtually winding up that bank because it will become a subsidiary, with no policy of its own, of the Bank of Ireland.  We notice that the directorships are being ladled out so that one of the sitting directors of the present National Bank will be a director of the remaining National Bank in London, the National Bank of Ireland to be, and a director of the Bank of Ireland as well.  So it is, to my mind, the closing down of the National Bank.  I think the Minister owes it to this House and to the people to tell them why this is happening. There must be a certain amount of public concern.  I do not know what is happening in London today.  I do not know if the directors have succeeded in getting the vote they hoped to get.  I have seen several of these documents sent out to the shareholders and, in them, it was suggested that they appoint one or two of the directors to act as proxy for them.  Very likely there are a lot of small investors who have replied putting themselves in the position that the directors will act as proxy for them and this will be carried.</P>
    <P>I tried to raise this on the Report Stage in an endeavour to get some information from the Minister but I understood he would tell us, on the Report Stage, the real reason for this <Col N="501" /> merger.  I think it is up to him to tell the House and the country.  I think that anybody who reads into the statement of the Governor of the Bank of Ireland this morning will get the answer there, and it is that the banks are being drained for public expansion, for the sake of the economy, and there is not a shilling left in the kitty to carry on with private enterprise. It is for that reason that this old bank with its historic background is bound practically to close down and hand over its cross-Channel assets to the old company to retain.  We have no idea what the dealings are with the Bank of Scotland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Bill was introduced, I said I was not satisfied that the shareholders were being treated fairly.  I must be definite also in saying that I have no shares in the National Bank and no personal interest beyond the desire to see that justice is done to the shareholders.  People who own shares in the National Bank are not capitalists with silk hats who smoke cigars.  They are middle income people who own 200 or 300 shares each and they are not able to defend themselves against the type of manoeuvres the directors of both banks seem to have got up to.  I agree with Deputy Hogan that it would have been far wiser for the Minister to have left this to sort itself out and bring in the Bill later, if necessary.  If today's measure in London is unsuccessful, it may transpire that this House has been wasting considerable time in dealing with this matter.  It seems to me that the presentation of this Bill is part of the psychological warfare being waged on the shareholders and despite the Minister's Pontius Pilate attitude&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is not becoming bitter.  I like to approach matters by being fair to all sides.  The Minister in this case has lent himself to the people on whom he is depending for money, the Bank of Ireland.  He is not entirely a free agent.  When one is in the hands of a moneylender&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not expect the Minister to give us a lead in imagination because, as far as I can see, it is fairly limited as far as the Department of Finance are concerned.  I say this without reflecting on the officials.  The Minister should not resent criticism.  I am offering only fair criticism.  I do not think the Minister should lend himself to his moneylenders in this matter.  I was not here last night so I did not hear the Minister's answer to the question about the valuation of premises and whether the stamp duty would be paid on the old or new valuation of the buildings.  The Official Report is not yet printed and I do not know what answer the Minister gave. I hope the stamp duty will be paid on the new valuation and that the Bank of Ireland, who have been able to cod the shareholders as to the value of their property, will not be able to cod the taxpayer by getting away with the reduced stamp duty.  I suggest that they should pay the full economic stamp duty.  One other point I should like to mention is that a considerable number of National Bank shares are held by the National Bank and Bank of Ireland nominee companies.  Some of these are security for loans, some are not.  I understand that the bank concerned will not ask the real owner of these shares how they would like to vote, that they will automatically vote for the take-over.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>If they are not allowed freedom in this matter it is wrong.  I do not think the Minister has shown that he is sufficiently interested in this <Col N="503" /> matter to find out everything that is going on, all the implications.  I should like to make one last point on the value of the shares.  In previous days there was a tendency for banks to get into difficulties, and if shareholders panicked they rushed in and asked for their money back.  In order to relieve the banks of such a situation occurring, banks were allowed not to declare the real profits.  This might be justifiable from a certain viewpoint, but when the bank is being taken over, the real owners of the bank, the shareholders, should be told the truth. The shareholders should be told clearly: &ldquo;This is what the bank is worth; this is what you will get.&rdquo; The directors are merely the servants of the people who own the bank.</P>
      <P>In the case of the National Bank, out of six million shares in circulation, a mere 35,000 are held by directors. Therefore, the directors are servants of the shareholders in the most definite meaning of the word.  They have practically no stake in the bank, but they will be influenced by the fact that, not only will they retain their directorships, but the bulk of them will end up with two directorships.  This is wrong.  I think the Minister has lent himself to his moneylenders.</P>

      <P>If there is any reason for legislation to deal with a problem of this kind it is that, in theory at any rate, the people are apparently regarded as having a right to be consulted before there is a change in the Irish banking system.  While we have been consulted in theory, we have not been given adequate information on which to make a decision.  The process of having the Bill passed through the House is no more than an empty formula. It makes a farce of the principle supposed to be at stake&mdash;the principle of consulting the people who, after all, are the banks of this country.  It is the people's sweat, labour, money and other property that constitute the Irish banking system which, after all, is but the repository of our wealth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even at this Fifth Stage we have not been given the information which even educated people need to make an <Col N="504" /> accurate assessment of the position involved here.  If we decide to allow this Bill to go through we are accepting the proposals in good faith.  However, we must query certain matters.  We must query accounts which show that the value of the premises is a mere £1,800,000 when we know that the property includes headquarters in Trafalgar Square in London and in College Green in Dublin, with branches throughout Britain and this country. It is quite clear on the face of it, without any detail, that the premises are grossly under-valued, that the figure represents no more than one-fifth of the actual value of the property.  This is not an attack on the bank.  It is a criticism of all banking accounts.  If the situation can be improved by criticism, then I suggest we should offer criticism.  The present situation is un-satisfactory and as long as we allow it to continue we are putting our banks in jeopardy in their reputation and in their standing.</P>
    <P>The Minister said of Deputy Esmonde and Deputy Norton that they were drawing on their imagination.  I do not think they are.  They simply posed problems to the Minister and to the House and they are to be complimented on doing so.  There is a paucity of information.  There is no adequate justification for this move, and in the absence of such, Deputies have an obligation to try to seek out the true reasons.  The reasons advanced by Deputy Esmonde are cogent and compelling and it will take a great deal of factual argument to prove that he was not justified in his assertions.  If a proposal of this kind came at a time of plenitude in money and credit, one would have less worry than at present, when we know the whole banking system has been subjected for the past year or 18 months to the greatest pressure ever brought to bear on it by an Irish Government.  The effect has been to dry up the supply of credit and finance to the private sector.  It is having untold harmful effects.</P>
    <P>It seems extraordinary, and must cause a certain amount of uneasiness in the public mind, to see other international banking concerns, such as the <Col N="505" /> Bank of Nova Scotia, the First National City Bank of New York, the Lombard Bank and several other international concerns, moving in here and at the same time seeing a traditional Irish bank, founded by no less a person than Daniel O'Connell, moving out.  I know the Minister's argument will be that in fact the National Bank has in the process of time become a British bank and not an Irish bank.  Fundamentally, however, its origins and connections are Irish.  It creates a certain amount of public uneasiness to see long-established institutions, for inadequate reasons apparently, being brought to an end and other agencies of which we know very little coming into our economic and financial set-up.</P>
    <P>Having said all these things, I reiterate that if after all this we got more explanatory information, even at this stage, about this transaction, and in the long-term about all banking transactions, we would be better off. But unless we get it now, and get it in future in relation to all bank transactions, we should put an end to this farcical procedure of pretending to consult the people through their representatives in Oireachtas Éireann, when in fact we are doing no more than asking public representatives to put a rubber stamp on a document they do not understand.  That is not a satisfactory situation.  It is something we want to put an end to once and for all.</P>

      <P>From the last few speeches I have heard, one would think it is by the enactment of this legislation that we are making possible the sale of the shares of the National Bank to the Bank of Ireland and to the National Commercial Bank of Scotland.  As Deputy Sweetman pointed out, this could be done without any legislation.  The purpose of this legislation is to facilitate the transfer of accounts, securities and bailments and to obviate the payment of stamp duty that should not arise on the transfer of these shares.  We still have the right of ownership and free disposal of property in this country. Companies are set up with certain rights and certain properties, and they <Col N="506" /> have the right to hold or dispose of those properties as they wish.  The ordinary company elects a board of directors.  These directors act for and on behalf of the shareholders.  These directors have rights under the Companies' Acts, under common law and the natural law, and under the Constitution, to acquire or dispose of property as they wish, subject to the rights of their shareholders by a certain majority vote to acquiesce to the sale or acquisition of property as they see fit.  The company could have decided to sell the shares, and could have gone through all the rigmarole of transferring accounts, returning securities, returning bailments and re-registering deeds in the Land Registry.  All that could have been done without let or hindrance by this House.  All I am asking the House is to pass enabling legislation to avoid the complexities of operations that would have to be gone through otherwise, and to avoid the payment of stamp duty that ought not in fairness arise.</P>
      <P>As far as the suggestion that we are now abolishing a traditional old Irish bank is concerned, we are purchasing from Britain what used to be an old Irish bank.  As I said in my opening statement, the bank was founded by Daniel O'Connell in 1835, but within 25 years it had ceased to be an Irish bank, was registered in London and has operated since through the London owners.  In later years a subsidiary was set up here with nominal share capital, the National Bank (Ireland) Limited. It had Irish directors with the association of some English directors, but as far as overall policy was concerned, they were subject to the British board. It is nonsense to suggest we are abolishing something traditional.  On the contrary, we are converting something not Irish into Irish ownership.</P>

While there appears in the balance sheet a sum of £1.9 million as the value of the premises, in fact an up-to-date valuation has been made of the premises both here and in the United Kingdom. The full value of the premises in Ireland at current prices is about £3½ million.  This is included in the purchase price and is being assessed for the purpose of stamp duty on the transfer of the real property.</P>

      <P>Deputy Esmonde asked why all this was being done.  Why must we legislate in advance?  Why was the National Bank being bought out?  That goes back to my original assertion that people are entitled to dispose of their property as they wish.  People are entitled to sell their property if they so wish, and Deputy Esmonde's contention that the National Bank were selling out because they were being pressed by the Government is not right in any sense at all.  On the contrary, what has been happening here is, as every Deputy knows, that there is an increasing interest being taken in the Irish economy by financiers, property developers and <i>entrepreneurs</i> of every kind, and there has been an influx, in particular, of some finance houses from London, from the United States and Canada.  As Deputies know, there has been an interest in the purchase of banking interests in Ireland by some of those outside interests.  Is it not far better that we should, as far as we can, facilitate the acquisition of such banking interests by an Irish bank?</P>
      <P>As far as the necessity for the legislation is concerned, it is not necessary at all if the banks were prepared to go through the rigmarole of the arrangements that would have to be made otherwise, to which I have already referred and to which Deputy Sweetman has referred in much detail. Since the Finance Act of 1965 in Britain, there is a change in the type of tax that can be charged, and the purpose of getting this Bill through now is that it is desirable that the transaction should be completed before the end of March.  The Scottish Bank, as part of their agreement in carrying out this transfer, wanted this legislation enacted in this country.  The purpose of the enactment of the legislation is to avoid paying higher tax ultimately in the United Kingdom, to avoid the multiplicity of transactions that would have to be gone through and to avoid paying stamp duty on a transaction which in its entirety would prove to be an inequitable burden.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="509" /> This, as has been pointed out, is being voted on today by the shareholders in London, of whom 75 per cent will have to vote in favour.  It will then come before the High Court in London and the transaction will have been completed, provided by that time the enactment has been put through here.  By providing for greater facility in the transfer and obviating undue taxation, we are in this Parliament doing no more than providing some oil for the wheels of the vehicle that will carry the transfer.</P>

      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £1,620,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1966, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Industry and Commerce including certain Services administered by that Office, and for payment of sundry Grants-in-Aid.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this Supplementary Estimate is to provide for the payment of market development grants to alleviate the burden being borne by exporters as a result <Col N="510" /> of the imposition in October, 1964, of the British temporary charge on imports. A token provision of £10 for this purpose was made in the 1965-66 Estimates as it was not possible when the Estimates were being framed to anticipate the amount that would be required in the year.</P>
      <P>The intention of the Government was to pay grants up to 50 per cent of the burden borne by exporters subject to consideration of the steps being taken by each exporter to meet the situation.  When the matter was discussed with manufacturers and exporters it became apparent that, for the scheme to be effective, it would be necessary for exporters to know as soon as possible the level of grants which would be available to them. Examination of individual cases would cause uncertainty and serious delay in making grants available.  It was agreed, therefore, to pay grants generally at the rate of 40 per cent of the amount of the import charge paid with the provision that, in cases of exceptional difficulty, consideration would be given to paying 50 per cent of the amount of import charge actually borne by the exporter.</P>
      <P>Approximately 600 firms have received grants under the scheme and of these 25 qualified for 50 per cent grants.  The additional cost of paying 50 per cent instead of 40 per cent to these firms to date is £120,000.  In July, 1965, the Government announced that, as a special incentive to firms to increase their exports, higher rates of grant would be paid to exporters who achieved a higher level of exports in the second half of 1965 than in the corresponding period in 1964.  A similar scheme will operate in respect of exports for the first half of 1966 but the cost of this will not arise in the current year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The British temporary charge on imports presented a very serious obstacle to our exports of manufactured goods and it was vitally necessary to enable exporters to maintain their trade so as to be in a position to continue the expansion of exports as soon as the situation eased.  Thanks to these grants and to their own efforts, <Col N="511" /> our exporters have been able to hold their position in the British market.  It is estimated that in the current financial year a sum of £2,226,000 will be required under this subhead and accordingly the Supplementary Estimate now being placed before the Dáil is for £2,225,990.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this Supplementary Estimate for £36,000 is to provide additional funds for Córas Tráchtála to help them to meet the greatly increased demand for their services and facilities and to enable the Board to provide some new services and facilities.</P>
    <P>Following the introduction at the end of 1964 of the British import levy, Córas Tráchtála increased the scope and contribution rate on most of their grant schemes.  The demand for all their schemes has been greater than was anticipated when the original Estimate for the current financial year was framed.  As an extension of the aids and services to exporters, Córas Tráchtála have introduced a scheme of advertising incentive grants designed to encourage new campaigns of advertising and sales promotion abroad by exporters of branded consumer products. They have also launched a loan scheme to encourage the recruitment and training of export sales representatives.</P>
    <P>The supplementary provision proposed for Córas Tráchtála will bring the total provision for the Board for the current financial year to £486,000 and the total amount provided since Córas Tráchtála was set up as a statutory Board in 1959 to £2,081,000. Under the existing legislation, the ceiling on grants to Córas Tráchtála is fixed at £2,500,000.  I hope shortly to introduce legislation to raise the ceiling to £4,500,000.</P>
    <P>An additional sum of £70,000 is also required to meet increases in salaries, wages and allowances in the Department. The amount is in the main due to status increases granted to the staff of the Department after the Estimates for 1965-66 had been prepared.  Increases in the number of staff arising from the increased work of the Department <Col N="512" /> in connection with prices inquiries, and market development grants must be provided for also.  The amount required, £70,000, brings the total expenditure on salaries, wages and allowances to £680,000 for the year.</P>
    <P>The additional £9,000 under subhead 1 for the Industrial Development Authority is in respect of payments under section 28 of the Superannuation and Pensions Act, 1963, which were not provided for in the original estimate.</P>
    <P>The carrying out of a pilot manpower survey was suggested to the National Industrial Economic Council by the Adaptation Council for the Woollen and Worsted Industry which drew attention to the problem posed for industry by localised labour shortages in certain areas throughout the country and expressed the view that the true picture of the manpower situation was being masked by the published employment figures which showed &ldquo;a spurious level of availability in all areas.&rdquo;  The Adaptation Council stated that there was an urgent need for a study of all true availability of labour, as distinct from the Live Register figures, in all parts of the country and accordingly proposed &ldquo;that steps should be taken immediately to undertake the necessary social research, possibly starting with a pilot area, with a view to delineating the problem and establishing how best it could be tackled.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The pilot survey in Drogheda is being carried out for my Department by the Department of Social Science of University College, Dublin, who have agreed to undertake the project on the basis of being reimbursed in respect of their actual outlay on the salaries and the travelling and other incidental expenses of the research staffs employed on the work.  No professional fees are being charged and the senior staff of the Department of Social Science, who are responsible for the project are giving their services free of charge.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that the total cost of the survey will amount to £6,500 and that approximately £6,000 will have <Col N="513" /> been paid to University College by 31st March, 1966.  As no provision had been made under Subhead O in the Vote for the Department of Industry and Commerce for expenditure on this survey work when the Estimates for the financial year 1965-66 were being prepared, it is now necessary to bring this Supplementary Estimate before the House for approval.</P>
    <P>The gross amount required is £2,345,990.  There are, however, offsetting savings of £700,990 on other subheads of the Vote together with an estimated increase in Appropriations in Aid of £25,000, which brings the net requirements to £1,620,000.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Supplementary Estimate to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the circulated version of the Supplementary Estimate, the first item is salaries, wages and allowances.  We awaited information from the Minister as to the exact nature of these increases.  The Minister had told us that these are increases that came about after the Estimates for 1965-66 had been prepared.  He now tells us that they are status increases.  I am entirely in favour of paying the civil servants as well as is humanly possible and of giving them a status that is absolutely in line with similar employment outside, but I must say that in the year 1965-66 and in the stringent conditions in which the Government now find themselves, it does not appear correct procedure to have created by status increases a situation whereby an extra £70,000 is required for one Department of State. It seems to me to be wrong but I would wish to add to that statement that I would be the first to desire that these people would have every repayment for the excellent work which they do for us.  I just do not think it is &ldquo;with it&rdquo; in 1965-66.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Córas Tráchtála are to cost £486,000 in this year.  Córas Tráchtála are an excellent body.  I have gone to them in my business capacity.  Individually, they give to businessmen and industrialists a wonderful service.  They have <Col N="514" /> done an extremely good job in promoting export trade with overseas countries.  While that is true, the Minister might look at the general policy of Córas Tráchtála in relation to trade promotion in the more general way.  It may be as a result of not spending enough money in this sector and it may be because of a deflection of effort but the fact is that while the individual businessman here who goes to Córas Tráchtála seeking to have his product exported profitably will get a service second to none, our general impact on world trade circles where knowledge of Irish goods could mean many inquiries from persons who hardly know Ireland exists, seems to be somewhat lacking.</P>
    <P>One finds in business circles abroad that very little is known about Irish products which are so good and so available.  The problem is divided into two sectors: the individual effort for the exporter here and the general effort in sales promotion abroad.  I want to say that I mean no discredit to the officers of Córas Tráchtála when I mention the fact that I believe that we are falling down in the sector of general trade promotion abroad.</P>
    <P>This may well be due to the fact that £486,000 in this sort of promotion is not a large sum, because out of that sum must be taken salaries and expenses, grants and all the other things that eat up money.  It may well be that when it comes to advertising and the promotional side, they are not being given enough funds to do the job.  I believe that to be true and, therefore, I think it well to mention it.</P>
    <P>The Industrial Development Authority need more money.  They need £9,000 for salaries and, for temporary assistance for industry, the large sum that is the main part of this Supplementary Estimate.  The work of the Industrial Development Authority is of the greatest importance.  It is very necessary that it should be given every incentive to expand.  It prepares for the Board of An Foras Tionscal proposals for new industries here.  On these proposals the Board of An Foras Tionscal decide to give a grant or not.</P>
    <P>Let us face the fact that we have <Col N="515" /> had spectacular failures and let us also appreciate that what the Minister said in reply to supplementary questions yesterday is also true, that one way not to guarantee having spectacular failures is to give no grants at all.  I completely agree with the Minister in that line of thought but I would direct his attention to the fact that since 1956, when the Finance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill and the Industrial Grants Bill were enacted, there has been no fundamental change in the nature of the encouragement given to industry here.  I am convinced that there is more meat for us in giving greater freedom from income tax in respect of goods sold at home to industrialists who would set up here than there is in giving large capital sums which may go to people who come here for one reason only, that they need, in the worst possible way, these large capital sums in order to set up an industry.</P>
    <P>That is not to say that I would be violently critical of the Government because of certain failures, but it is true to say that the Minister is responsible for his Department and the Minister is responsible for the decisions of what I call the offshoots of his Department and, within this House, the Government must be responsible for money that has been spent, money which has not given the return the people would wish.</P>
    <P>There has been an emphatic denial by the Minister, and by his predecessor, and by every Minister for Industry and Commerce who sat over there, that it is easier to get a grant if you come from abroad than it is if you are an Irishman.  I agree with the Minister and his predecessors that, on paper, this emphatic denial is correct, but, at the same time, when one takes into account that at the present moment adaptation grants are fixed at a maximum level of 25 per cent whereas grants for new industry can be in the order of 50 per cent, or, outside the developed areas, 60 per cent, one realises that existing industry, largely home industry, is not getting the same opportunity for expansion as a new <Col N="516" /> industry gets to set up here.  That is a mathematical fact and nobody can deny it.</P>
    <P>To go from the sublime to the ridiculous, let us face the fact that one of the reasons why a landless man cannot get land is that it immediately gets rid of nine-tenths of the applicants. The fact that an existing industry can get only 25 per cent of the cost of an adaptation programme means that it must get 75 per cent itself.  Secondly, having had an adaptation grant, there are no tax incentives such as a new industry will have because the trade has followed a certain pattern and the products may not be defined as a new industry.  For that reason tax incentives do not fall to them.</P>
    <P>I believe we have now reached a stage at which a complete re-alignment and re-appraisal of our grants system is not only necessary but overdue.  I believe we should go over on the side of incentives rather than on the side of pushing capital in.  Very often people come here and avail of capital, people who could very easily get the capital themselves.  It is unwise to talk of failure in one's own constituency, but take the case of GEC.  They took a grant of £300,000 and then closed down the factory in Dundalk.  Their trade may have taken a nose-dive but surely the board of directors in Britain, faced with the decision as to whether or not to close the factory, would have thought far more seriously about closing it if the incentive that brought them here had not been £300,000 capital grant but rather tax reductions over a longer period of years and even, perhaps, tax reductions in respect of goods sold to our own people at home.</P>
    <P>That is an example to show that the frigid line, frozen since 1956, needs to be thawed out.  It shows how we are now falling behind Northern Ireland and those areas in Britain where, because of the failure of the ship-building and other industries, large grants are being given by the British Government.  I have had it proved to me by a very successful industrialist that it was just as good for him to go to Lancashire and there avail of factory space at a certain rent per <Col N="517" /> square foot, factory space provided by the British Government, as it was to avail of a grant here and build a factory for himself.  I have had negotiations with a gentleman from Israel over the last month in relation to the establishment of an industry here, which I hope will come, and he has shown me that in most countries in Europe and in his own country there are as great incentives available in a different way for the establishment of industry as there are here.  I believe that in most cases these incentives have been applied in a wiser way, in a way that has been good for the State and the people concerned.</P>
    <P>What does it matter, after all, whether it is an income tax concession over 10 years or a capital sum?  It is better to pay it by instalments because one gets a better type when one gives what is really a premium on production and a premium on production guarantees employment.  That is the reason why this Government are now faced with a situation in which there are spectacular failures.  Time and again the Board of Foras Tionscal, for which I have the greatest regard, have had to decide on the plans before them, plans which in a minority of cases, I emphatically suggest, have been produced on the basis that paper will not refuse anything.  There is a serious responsibility on the Minister to give the data and figures to this House in relation to any difficulties there are in regard to these grants and loans.</P>
    <P>It is not good enough to give the sort of answer the Minister gave me yesterday.  I want to emphasise that the question I asked was asked on the basis of name and address supplied. The matter was between myself and the Minister and, on that basis, the House was entitled to know where the taxpayers' money had gone and if, in fact, money had also gone into that particular company by way of industrial loan.  It is not good enough for the Minister to say that he has no function &mdash;that was his reply to Question No. 34 yesterday&mdash;in the matter of industrial loans.  If the Industrial Credit Company give a loan, from where does <Col N="518" /> the money come?  If Taiscí Stáit give a loan, from where does the money come?  To give the Minister his due, he gave me some information in the latter case because only two loans have been given, but, if it were a matter of 30 or 40 loans, the Minister might clamp down on the information altogether.</P>
    <P>It is good for the Government, the House and the country to know where we are going in this regard.  When I am told that there is a factory in a certain town that never opened, and I ask a question and find that £110,000, according to the last returns of Foras Tionscal, was poured by way of grant into that factory, and no employment had been created, then the House is entitled to know everything about it on the basis of the Deputy who asked the question not communicating the name of the company in case he might in any way interfere with future prospects or with future opportunities for employment.</P>
    <P>We have a very peculiar situation in relation to industry.  We are, I suppose, the most under-industrialised country in Western Europe.  We have, therefore, a very great opportunity for expansion. That was accepted in the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> which gave the targets at which the Government were setting their sights. We were told that industry would have to assimilate those who would leave the land and it was accepted by the Government that people would leave the land.  Many of us violently disagreed with that view and believed more could be done to keep the people on the land.  However, the Government set their sights and it is on those sights they must be judged.</P>
    <P>They indicated in the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> that in the year 1965 industry would expand in volume by 7.4 per cent.  Again, in reply to me yesterday, the Minister informed me that the actual increase in volume was 3.8 per cent.  The increase in Britain, an over-industrialised country, losing her colonies and in grave trouble at the moment, was 2½ per cent.  We have here a potentially large labour force leaving school every <Col N="519" /> year and people who have come here have stated that the best goldmine we have is the splendid potential labour force.</P>
    <P>The failure of the Government, by almost four per cent, to attain its target is another way of saying that we shall see a reduction in our population.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>The target was an average over ten years.  The year before it was 9. something.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well.  Then I will immediately observe that last year they fell below their average by almost four per cent.  As a result, a lot of people will emigrate next year.  There will not be the expansion of industry to assimilate the boys and girls coming forward from the land.  As far as I am concerned, I feel there is need for a new look.</P>
      <P>I have the greatest friendship and respect for the present holder of the portfolio of Minister for Industry and Commerce.  He is a new Minister.  I think he is probably a man who could have a new look at it.  However, in relation to our grants, in relation to our loans, in relation to encouragement to people to come here, we have got to have more than the decision made by a Government in 1956 which I, as a young Deputy, supported and which surely, if we are to move forward with the times, must by now be out of date. I suggest that the Minister would profit by making the changes and considering them and devoting his attention to that problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The temporary assistance to industry in the payment of 40 per cent of the cost of the British levy is considerable. I think the decision to pay that was a good one.  I think, too, that the decision and the mechanics of it whereby, rather than assessing in each case the degree of interference with the trade and giving, instead, a global 40 per cent, or 50 per cent in bad cases, is a good one.  My information is that a fortune is owed and that the industrialists have got very little of the money yet.  If this is so, I hope that this Vote we are passing today <Col N="520" /> will help in the payment of the money. However, there is a peculiar situation in relation to this in my constituency to which I wish to refer, and that is the fact that there was gross interference with the export business of the Dundalk Engineering Works.  Over the past year, the Dundalk Engineering Works have had quite a good export business in Agrotillers, caravans, and so on.  They were very heavily affected because, in these high-priced commodities, ten per cent&mdash;it was originally 15 per cent&mdash;is a very large sum. Even 40 per cent of it, if repaid, would affect the profits situation to a very considerable degree.</P>
    <P>We had a press notice from the Government a couple of days ago affecting 700 workers in my constituency. The press notice is of an extremely scanty nature.  It does not give the information to the people who work there and to which the people who worry so much about them are entitled.  It is not good enough to say the accumulated losses were something over one million pounds.  Those of us who have studied this particular situation a little closer than most will know that the pattern of these losses does not give the average situation about which the Minister was talking a little while ago and that, in fact, the losses were largely the result of the first years of the operation of the Dundalk Engineering Works after the closing of the GNR Rail Service depot in 1957.</P>
    <P>The scanty information would indicate to a taxpayer that this was a series of companies that had gone wrong, that this was another of these failures about which I have been talking, that this was something that should be written off, that a receiver should be put in and asked to sell as best he could.  At this point of sale, let me say that the Government press notice is extremely contradictory in itself inasmuch as it says that when the companies were first formed they thought of a public issue of shares.  In the event, however, a public issue was never practicable since the companies as a group have consistently incurred losses.  In the last paragraph, the receiver <Col N="521" /> is instructed to prepare the companies for sale as going concerns.</P>
    <P>I would remind the Minister and the Government that a public flotation is merely the selling of a company to the people and that if you cannot float it you cannot sell it.  Therefore, the suggestion that this receiver would sell as a going concern companies that the Minister and the Government say are not making money is, in fact, a statement which should be examined.  However, my complaint is not on those lines because if it were true that these companies were grossly inefficient and were losing a large sum of money up to the present then all wisdom to the decree that there is nothing that can be done except to take the course that has been taken.  But that is not so.</P>
    <P>I want to say to the House that, as near as I can see from the accounts I have been studying in relation to these companies, the losses in 1959 were £300,000.  The losses in 1960, as a result of the winding up of Heinkel, Limited, were £700,000 and the losses in 1961, still as a result of the windingup of Heinkel, Limited, were £500,000. In 1962, in all fairness to everybody, there was a large improvement because of credits coming forward from the winding-up of Heinkel, Limited.  However, the losses in these companies last year were down to £150,000 on a turnover that had been trebled in the past three years.</P>
    <P>I want to direct the attention of the House to the fact that, with all our eyes open and in agreement, we voted £1,800,000 less than a year ago to Verholme for a subsidy on the erection of six ships.  If these companies have now come from a catastrophic situation which in my opinion&mdash;and I can only read the accounts&mdash;was largely brought about by the failure of Heinkel Limited&mdash;to which one could probably attribute £1 million of the loss&mdash;and if they have now reached the stage of trebling their turnover in three years, of having one company&mdash;Commercial Road Vehicles&mdash;assimilated into a group of three, and if the losses last year were £150,000, why should we <Col N="522" /> then take a company and instruct a receiver that no further funds are available to the Exchequer for losses except small funds to prepare for sale&mdash; putting 700 jobs in jeopardy&mdash;when, not a year ago, we were prepared to walk up these stairs, if necessary, in order to vote £1,800,000 to provide a temporary guarantee in respect of the same number of jobs in Cork city?</P>
    <P>I do not want to be parochial about this but one must use examples.  I want to suggest that the time has not been propitious, that the manner of dealing with this has not been propitious and, in fact, that we had seen our troubles dissipating.  We had seen the new management that was there partially succeeding and we had seen the situation whereby, in a year or so, these funds could have been viable.</P>
    <P>Let us remember, also, that, over the past five or six years, there was the founding of the first steel foundry in Ireland; that extreme difficulties were experienced in the quality of production in this foundry; that these difficulties have now been overcome; that the period of their overcoming was extremely expensive but was, of course, entirely temporary and has passed and that we would now look forward in Dealgan Steel Founders to seeing a situation whereby there could be profits in the next year or so.  With relation to the relatively minute sum I have mentioned, when such large sums can be voted for other ventures and when such large sums can be given by way of grant and loan to new industries, I believe an umbrella should have been provided by the Exchequer on the basis that the losses would have removed themselves in a matter of another year or so.</P>
    <P>If the railway works had been running since, does one wonder that the figure that has been given of £1,800,000 accumulated losses would have been paid as a subsidy to CIE?  I suggest also&mdash;and I shall be extremely helpful and at the same time charge the Government, but being as anonymous as I can&mdash;that the first manager sent down there was a friend of the present Taoiseach: that before he left, the resignation of every executive except <Col N="523" /> one was on his desk, and the only alternative he had was to resign himself; that 300 men lay down in the street and refused to let his car come up the road to the works, and that was when he had gone ahead and contracted with Heinkel in Germany for such a vast sum in purchases of kits for the construction of Heinkel cars; and that representatives of the Dundalk Engineering Company and the Industrial Credit Company had to go to Heinkel in Germany and say: &ldquo;If you insist on this contract being carried out, we will put Heinkel into complete liquidation and you will get 6d. in the £.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It was after these huge losses had been made that the present management had to take over, and inside 18 months one company was making money.  When replying, I suggest the Minister should indicate whether or not my figures, in broad principle, are correct.  I believe from reading the accounts they are, and I believe this is one of the cases in which there should have been continued Exchequer subvention on a small scale so that, in fact, over the next few years these losses could have been dissipated.  I am not unhopeful that when the receiver sees how the show is running now and perhaps makes some changes &mdash;because a new broom sweeps clean and a new mind is always clear&mdash;that these companies will become viable of their own volition without Exchequer subsidy and that, in fact, we may see these companies operating satisfactorily before another half decade has passed.  I am not unhopeful that this will occur, but I say that at this stage, when we had rounded the corner, and when over the years every Opposition Deputy from County Louth had given the Government all the backing they needed, the decision to bring in a receiver was, in my view, a wrong decision, and I want to protest about it in the strongest possible manner.</P>
    <P>The position in regard to the survey at Drogheda is something in which I am particularly interested seeing that I come from a place five minutes away <Col N="524" /> from that town.  I agree with the policy of the Government in instituting a manpower policy and putting a Parliamentary Secretary in charge to see exactly how our manpower can best be employed, how best we can ensure that as they come forward they will find jobs ready for them.  The drop in the average increase in industrial production will not help but, nevertheless, I think study of the situation is extremely important.  Deputy Tully disagreed with me the other day when I was pointing out that there was a situation sometimes in Drogheda when employers could not get certain types of labour&mdash;which I still hold; in fact, girls are often quite scarce in Drogheda&mdash;but there is in this town, which I regard as one of the most quickly expanding towns in Ireland, a situation in which you have the wrong sort of labour available.  You find big, strong workmen queuing up at the employment exchange ready and willing to do an honest day's work but they are not the type of person you could imagine in a new factory like Becton Dickinson assembling disposable syringes.</P>
    <P>The flexibility of labour is one answer to it but I think you will always have labour that ought to be flexible but if you can find for the potential industrialist here the information as to whether he will find for his heavy goods industry a supply of manpower in a certain area or for his light goods industry a sufficient supply of boys and girls for the various jobs therein, you will have gone another step forward and have got information which may be more attractive to the industrialists than some things we are already giving them.  I understand that this report will be exhaustive in the extreme, that a book thicker than the book <i>Investment in Education</i> will result.  I hope it does not become so befogged with facts that we cannot get the argument out of it.  I know the work has been done with great energy in Drogheda and I only hope that Drogheda will benefit from the results of this pilot survey before any other place, except possibly another part of my own constituency.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="525" /> I find the item &ldquo;Savings on other Subheads, £7,900&rdquo; a little vague. There is no explanatory section telling us where savings were made.  Savings are just as important as expenditure and if perchance we disagreed with savings and thought more money should be spent on certain things, that is a contribution which should be made in the House.  The fact that we do not know where savings were made does not help at all.  When replying, I wonder if the Minister could tell us where the savings were made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to advert to various matters arising from the Supplementary Estimate.  We are all conscious of the good which the Government did in providing assistance for our industrialists when the British surcharge was introduced in 1964.  It is difficult to understand what the situation here would be like today if the Government had not come to the aid of these, the most important section of our industrialists, our exporters, and provided them with this particular subvention.</P>
      <P>When the surcharge was first put on, it was 15 per cent.  It has since been lowered somewhat and in all the circumstances grants of 40 per cent and 50 per cent must be regarded as generous.  I hope the Minister is satisfied with the response from our exporters.  Certainly, the amount of money provided here today is an indication that these grants are being availed of and I hope widely by our exporting industrialists.  It would be interesting if when the Minister replies he would give some greater detail as to the extent to which exporters of various types of goods have declined to continue their export endeavours, or have rather panicked at the prospect of overcoming this levy and have, in fact, withdrawn altogether from exporting adventures which they carried out successfully in recent times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This surcharge will cost the taxpayers some £2,226,000.  That will be money well spent if it maintains for these exporters the markets they enjoy in Great Britain and in particular, if it assists them to extend these <Col N="526" /> markets, increase the productivity of their factories, and maintain security of employment and, indeed, expand employment.  However, we have an ingrained fear that despite the admonitions about free trade being in the offing and about the need for readaptation to meet the sterner competition of the future, many of our industrialists were so shocked by this surcharge that they were inclined to throw in the towel and abandon these valuable markets, with consequent redundancy in many industries.</P>
    <P>That is why I hope the Minister can indicate to the House the extent to which we have lost trade with Britain as a result of this imposition and despite the generous State aid, which will amount to almost £2,500,000 in this financial year, to industrialists to maintain their export markets.  Like Deputy Donegan, I would like to pay what I would regard as a well deserved tribute to Córas Tráchtála for the herculean work they are doing on behalf of the promotion of exports and trade abroad.  I am very much aware of the great work being done in this respect and that the assistance, advice, guidance and encouragement given to so many of our industrialists are fully appreciated.  Anything that can be done to expand and improve the good record of Córas Tráchtála is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to see in the Minister's statement that Córas Tráchtála have launched a loan scheme to encourage the recruitment and training of export sales representatives.  This is something that was long overdue.  It is well known that the civil servants dealing with this matter are to a large extent unaware of the difficulties associated with industry and import-export problems. It is high time that some experts were trained in this field who would specialise in each facet of our industrial potential and assist and encourage our industrialists and direct them into proper fields of expansion.  It has often been wondered why our Embassies do not play a more active and responsible role in the expansion of our trade.</P>
    <P>It has been alleged that our Embassies have little regard for trading as <Col N="527" /> such, that they are places of entertainment for dignitaries of various countries, and that our officials there do nothing in a practical, national way to assist in the expansion of our trade in those countries in which we are represented.  I would ask the Minister to indicate what he is doing to make our Ambassadors abroad conscious that their primary role is to secure new markets for our industrialists and to assist them to find new fields of endeavour in this regard.  I feel that our Diplomatic Corps have been trained in the thoughts and ideas of a different era, and that it is high time the Minister, through the Taoiseach, brought it home to them that they have a responsibility in regard to trade and a duty to assist every industrialist to expand trade.</P>
    <P>The additional sum for salaries and wages at £70,000 is not a formidable figure, but it is a surprising figure to find in an Estimate two years after the implementation of a national agreement on wages and salaries.  It is not a figure that one will find in respect of the ordinary working classes.  I understand that this arises as a result of status increases for certain officials in the Department of Industry and Commerce.  Status increases may be all right in this respect, but it is difficult to reconcile status increases amounting to £800 with the admonitions at present given to workers that they cannot hope to expect more than three per cent increases in wages without disrupting the economy.  I submit that a very bad headline was set for all concerned, workers, employers and the State, when status increases of such a sizeable amount were conceded to any categories of persons in this country.</P>
    <P>By any yardstick, I could not see justification for conceding to the vast majority of workers a 12 per cent increase and a floor of £1, and then to talk in terms of three per cent at present, while conceding to another class of citizens not merely the 12 per cent but a status increase which, in many instances, amounted to some £800.  Certainly, they must be unique personalities to claim a status of this kind.  I have yet to find anyone who <Col N="528" /> in strict justice could maintain that he was of such value to society that he commanded this disparity in income between the top and the bottom.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Industrial Development Authority, I was pleased to hear the Minister say that industrialists who go to the Authority for encouragement and financial aid are helped, but like Deputy Donegan, I am doubtful about that inference.  My experience has been that where the small industrialist, especially in the rural areas, comes forward with a proposal, however beneficial&mdash;indeed in many instances it is a practical demonstration of industry in operation&mdash;where there is an employment content perhaps only of a small nature, but which could grow with proper State aid, there has been a disinclination on the part of the IDA to give any assistance or encouragement whatsoever.  This is greatly to be deplored.  There is something in the suggestion that there is more regard for the foreigner, the man who speaks with a foreign accent and who possesses a cheque book, even though his integrity and enthusiasm might not be the best, as was demonstrated, to our regret, in so many instances by the rapid downfall of those industrial enterprises established by some of those gentlemen.</P>
    <P>This matter was brought home to me graphically within recent weeks when I raised in the House a question in regard to the lack of interest in or encouragement for the local inventor of a machine, which has a tremendous potential admitted by the Dutch and the British, renowned in this particular industrial field.  It was a matter of great surprise to me, to the House and to the country at large that the Government agencies were completely unwilling to assist in this tremendous venture even though the potentialities of this particular automatic beet harvesting machine, designed, perfected and in operation in the beet fields of Tipperary for a number of years, demonstrated the genius of an Irish inventor. The arduous task of beet-harvesting, the amount of labour involved could be changed, and beet could be uprooted and handled <Col N="529" /> mechanically even to the washing stage.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, this magnificent achievement passed seemingly unnoticed as far as the Minister's agencies were concerned.  It took the Dutch to realise the importance of the achievement and to make arrangements, in so far as they could, with the inventor to have it developed, manufactured and made available on the Continent.  This indicates a complete lack of regard for the intrinsic worth of the mere Irishman in his own country.  While that situation continues there is justification for the inference that there is more regard for the foreigner who comes to the Industrial Development Authority or An Foras Tionscal for assistance.</P>
    <P>With regard to the manpower service in Drogheda I am pleased that something practical is being done in this important field.  I feel sure that Drogheda was an ideal choice in respect of a survey of this kind.</P>

      <P>It is a thriving industrial town.  There is obviously great scope for the university authorities who are carrying out this survey in that particular town.  I look forward to its findings, which I trust will be available soon.  In the same paragraph of the Minister's speech, or rather the speech read by his Parliamentary Secretary to us today, there is a statement:</P>
      <P>The carrying out of a pilot manpower survey was suggested to the National Industrial Economic Council by the Adaptation Council for the woollen and worsted industry which drew attention to the problem posed for industry by localised labour shortages in certain areas throughout the country and expressed the view that the true picture of the manpower situation was being masked by the published employment figures which showed &ldquo;a spurious level of availability in all areas.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my humble opinion this is a fantastic statement.  The person who coined the latter phrase could hardly <Col N="530" /> be aware that we have an unemployment problem at the present time running into some 60,000 persons.  Is it seriously suggested that the vast majority of that formidable labour force are so unskilled and so little qualified for work that they must be regarded as &ldquo;spurious&rdquo;&mdash;I will use the word of the Minister&mdash;in the context of a manpower policy programme? I repudiate the insinuation that the situation, as revealed by the published employment figures, is spurious.</P>
    <P>There is an acute shortage of certain skills in this country and the majority of our unemployed might be categorised as unskilled but that is the fault of the Government's lack of proper training, lack of forecasting of employment opportunities and failure to create more skills.  Its purport that the figures at large are spurious is ridiculous in the extreme.  It may well be that that is so in Drogheda, that there is a shortage of certain skills in Drogheda, perhaps female labour, as Deputy Donegan adverted to.  That may be so, but then Drogheda is a very fortunate town.  By and large, there is available, to any prospective industrialist, a vast pool of labour in this country, educated, alert of mind and fully capable of being trained quickly and placed in employment in fair conditions and capable of proving themselves the best workers in the world, as has been demonstrated, not here, but in the many cities and towns throughout the world where the Irish are employed.  It is rather a pity that, in making a case for Drogheda, the Minister sought to reflect on the vast labour force in the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>It was said in the context of one industry, the woollen and worsted industry.  How it can be applied to the country at large is something I cannot understand.  You have a pool of labour to call on, and, as I said earlier, they are capable of being trained quickly and can prove to be as good workers as any under the sun.  I sincerely hope and feel sure that the work in this field which has to be carried out by the Social Science Group of University College, Dublin will be beneficial to the industry concerned, the woollen and worsted industry, of Drogheda and, indeed, the country as a whole.</P>
      <P>In regard to the reference Deputy Donegan made here to the statement of this week, which not merely shocked people from County Louth but throughout the whole country, that the semi-State enterprise of which we had reason to be proud in this House, the Dundalk Industrial Engineering Company, was in a state of extreme difficulty, to the extent that a liquidator had been called in.  That has come as a deep shock to us all.  It is particularly so to the 700 people employed in that industry, I appeal to the Minister to do all he can to save the situation, even at this late hour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This important town has suffered a number of setbacks in recent times. We will recollect the closing of the important GEC factory in Dundalk which employed a considerable number of people and which, overnight, decided to pull out of Dundalk and transfer its activities to Dunleer. Following fast on that industrial disaster comes the tragic news that Dundalk Industrial Engineering Company is in jeopardy and that 700 men <Col N="532" /> are likely to be thrown out on the unemployment scrapheap.  Were this private enterprise, perhaps the shock and dismay would not be too great but that it is a State company is alarming in the extreme.  One would imagine that this House would have been told of any difficulties this company was experiencing and that we would not be subjected to this shock announcement by the Government of their intention to introduce a liquidator there.</P>
    <P>That prompts me to raise the question as to what is being done by the Government and by the Minister in respect of adequately catering for these unemployed workers, these workers who we now know will be redundant.  When I heard the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister introduce this statement, I had hoped that, as he is the person responsible in this important field, he would have something to say on this very important matter.  Despite the reports of the Committee on Industrial Organisation indicating the unemployment and redundancy which will arise in freer trading circumstances&mdash;and when we have now positively embarked upon free trade with Britain&mdash;is it not high time that this House was told precisely what the Government have in mind in respect of the redundancy payments, the retraining schemes and the method for the re-absorption of all these people in alternative employment?  I hope that the Minister will avail of the opportunity to end the anxiety which prevails and give to us the long-awaited legislation on this matter.</P>

      <P>I am afraid the Deputy will have to confine his remarks to the various subheads, and there is no subhead I can see which would make his remarks relevant. Perhaps he could raise it on the main Estimate.</P>

      <P>I shall await a further opportunity on the main Estimate.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will elaborate on much of the subject matter contained in this short brief here today and explain to us, first of all, how the amount of money arose on this Estimate for the salary scales to which I have already referred.  We are anxious to relate this particular figure to the situation which exists in the country at present in respect of the new, we hope, national agreement on wages and salaries.  Like Deputy Donegan, I am not opposed to people being paid in accordance with their particular status, their responsibility, their aptitude and particular gifts, but I am concerned about the disparity which exists in the wages and salaries structure. These disparities are wide in the extreme, and it is difficult for the Government to admonish us to show restraint, caution and responsibility if they themselves concede status increases of a size of £800.</P>

      <P>I want to advert briefly again to my desire to see an expansion of industrial effort.  I should be grateful to the Minister if he would spell out clearly the function of our Embassies abroad in respect of this important matter.  What kind of liaison exists between his Department, Córas Tráchtála, the other exporting agencies, and our Embassies abroad because it is widely felt that the money we expend on these Embassies is not well spent and that they could be performing a much more beneficial work for the nation if they took an active part in the expansion of industry?</P>
