    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power the cause of the total shut-down of power by the ESB on 9th May 1966 in view of the fact that the turbines and generators were operating normally; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power if he is aware of the considerable public disquiet at the extensive shedding of electricity loads in the Dublin area on Monday 9th May, 1966, having regard to the considerable potential in the grid at the time; if he will hold a public inquiry into the matter to determine whether the discontinuance of electricity supplies in several areas was in fact technically necessary; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers) Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 2 and 3 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cause of the shedding of electricity loads in many areas on the morning of 9th May was due to the placing of pickets simultaneously on all generating stations that morning.  The Board's other manual employees refused to pass the pickets and the manual staff who were already on duty demanded as a condition of making the plant safe that it be completely shut down by midday.  The position was <Col N="2031" /> made worse by the poor response to the Board's prior appeal for load reduction. It was, therefore, not possible for the ESB to maintain supplies to all areas.</P>
    <P>The ESB is a responsible public body appointed under statute of the Oireachtas and I deprecate the unwarranted and scandalous reflection on the Board which the Deputies' questions imply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that several competent electrical engineers have disagreed with the statement which the Minister has made now, in repetition of what the ESB said last week, and that the opinion of the competent electrical engineers was that there was ample power available and no question of any lack of safety in the generating stations?  Is he further aware that it all points to a deliberate and unnecessary shedding of load to cause the maximum inconvenience in order to embarrass the workers who were on strike?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is speaking without knowledge of the facts. The ESB were naturally instructed by me&mdash;indeed, I did not even need to instruct them&mdash;to maintain the maximum power possible.  They had planned for all possible eventualities and the main difficulty was that the widespread notices published by the Board asking industries to close down were not observed and therefore far too much power was being used at the time the pickets were placed.  That was the main cause of the non-availability of electricity for the essential or more essential industries or services throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the tremendous public importance of this matter, will the Minister consider having a public inquiry into it, because it is again apparent that while in 1961, when there were more people out on strike, it was not necessary to discontinue supplies, on this occasion when fewer people were involved, it was found necessary within 20 minutes to shed the load?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The 1961 strike was <Col N="2032" /> totally different and lasted for 19 days during a period of the lowest consumtion in the year.  In addition, the Trade Union Congress requested the men to pass the pickets when there was a strike of electricians and&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There were 900 electricians out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash; and it was possible to maintain power in those circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that May was a month of low consumption?  Would he not agree that the number of generators we have are capable of producing what is required at present?  Is he not aware of the fact that the electricity was not available from 9 o'clock in the morning?  Obviously, the answer he has given is not satisfactory.  There was no great load on it when it was disconnected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already answered that question.  I made it clear that industrial consumption remained far too high in the circumstances. The ESB had made plans for any eventuality, which involved amongst other things the re-deployment of engineers and technical staff among the various stations in order to maintain the minimum possible supply.  But it was necessary to start shutting down stations immediately. I have already indicated that the manual staff demanded as a condition of making the plant safe that it be completely shut down by mid-day.  In the interval the industries were consuming too much power and ESB engineers actually had to go around among some of the industries and remind them of the instructions given by the ESB in connection with every radio announcement and on the previous day which they had not obeyed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power whether any <Col N="2033" /> discussions have been held with British shipping interests employed in the cross-Channel trade on the effects of the shipping dispute; whether any special measures are contemplated by the Government; and whether agricultural and industrial interests have been consulted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I am keeping the position under close review but it is not clear that there is any action which the Government could usefully take in the matter at present.  The Deputy will appreciate that action to divert consignments could well worsen the situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the Stormont Government have a special section of their Cabinet meeting on emergency level to deal with the situation and can he tell us if he and his colleagues hold a similar serious view of the situation and are they doing any more than holding a watching brief?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in touch with the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the whole question will be kept under close review.  The position will be that the matter will have to be further examined if it should be necessary to make use of such Irish shipping as is available for essential supplies.  I am in touch with the Minister for Industry and Commerce in regard to this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power if it is correct that the B &amp; I motor vessel <i>Dundalk</i> and the B &amp; I motor vessel <i>Kilkenny</i> are being sold by the company with the consequent loss of employment to nearly 30 Irishmen; and if they are being replaced by two German boats with German crews.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The acquisition and disposal of vessels to suit the requirements of the company's trade are the responsibility of the Board of the B &amp; I company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed by the company that they propose to dispose of the my <i>Dundalk.</i>  This vessel is 27 years old and cannot be put into a seaworthy <Col N="2034" /> condition at an economic cost.  It is also surplus to the company's conventional traffic requirements and is unsuitable for unit load operations. The company have no plans for the disposal of the my <i>Kilkenny.</i>  Most of the crew employed on the my <i>Dundalk</i> will be absorbed in other vessels of the company's fleet.</P>
    <P>The company proposes to charter two German unit load vessels to cater for their growing trade in this category.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say if he and the Government consider this a method of making Irish Shipping self-reliant?  Does the Minister consider that the proper way to do this is to dispose of a vessel they already have?  Is the Minister aware that members of the crew of the <i>Dundalk</i> have already been paid off and have not been re-employed as is implied in his reply?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a question of planning.  It will take some time to decide what the long-term policy of the B &amp; I company will be.  In the meantime, the number of unit loads is growing so rapidly that it would be quite impossible for the B &amp; I to formulate plans to build any new vessels until they had a complete conspectus of the whole position.  The new board were appointed only in March, 1965, to carry on this work.  There has been a considerable amount of reorganisation within the company, the appointment of new staff, an examination of the company's operations and through market research, the development of sales procedures on a more modern basis.  In the meantime, the company is bound to take account of its financial position and bound to provide for the ever-growing number of unit loads available for import and export operations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that this line has only recently been acquired by the State, surely this seems to follow a familiar pattern?  Like the railways and everything else they are beginning to close down already. Does the Minister consider that after buying this vessel, which was supposed <Col N="2035" /> to be doing its job properly, and paying a substantial sum for it, the proper thing now is to scrap it and replace it with German vessels and German crews?  If the Minister thinks that is the way to deal with this matter, he had better have another look at it.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power if, in view of the fact that a body appointed by the Government has arrived at the conclusion that CIE supplies only six per cent of the road freight transport, that for the past 18 months the Irish Livestock Traders' Association, a body responsible for the export of over £50 millions worth of livestock per annum, have continually made representations to his Department complaining of the lack of adequate road transport from fairs and marts, and that owing to this they have had to provide their own transport with their own lorries, or to hire private transport, sometimes incurring prosecution for illegal haulage, he will now decide that the liberalisation of livestock road haulage is essential for the proper transportation and marketing of livestock.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Concessions have already been granted under the provisions of the Transport Act, 1958, to facilitate the carriage for reward of livestock to fairs and marts by farmers using their own tractors and trailers. In addition, arrangements have been made by CIE in consultation with the licensed road hauliers to place supplementary lorries for this traffic where the need for this has been established.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the longer distance haulage from fairs and marts, a complaint by the Irish Livestock Traders' Association of inadequacy of transport is at present under examination by my Department in consultation with the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and CIE.  The case being made by the Association is not simply a case for more transport but a case to allow them to use their own vehicles to engage in carriage for reward.  I am not satisfied that this <Col N="2036" /> case can be sustained on the grounds of an inadequacy of transport because the vehicles of licensed hauliers and CIE which attended fairs and marts for this haulage have been left unused while the traffic was carried in other vehicles.  On completion of the present examination I will consider whether there is a genuine need and if so how it could best be met.</P>

      <P>The information sought by the Deputy is not shown separately in the accounts of CIE furnished to me in accordance with section 34 of the Transport Act, 1950, but the Pacemaker study showed that the carriage of livestock is less profitable to CIE than certain other categories of traffic.  The Deputy will, however, appreciate that the profitability of any particular category of traffic must very with attendant circumstances.</P>

      <P>I propose, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 17 and 18 together.</P>
      <P>The Dublin County Council submitted to the Commissioners of Public Works a proposal under the Coast Protection Act, 1963 for a scheme at the North Strand, Skerries.  The statutory preliminary examination was made and a report furnished to the county council.  The council indicated that they wished a scheme to proceed but in the present financial circumstances consideration of the proposal has had to be deferred.  The case will be considered as soon as circumstances permit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he is aware that an old age pensioner (name and address supplied) is required to pay increased rent to Dublin Corporation because of an increase in her contributory pension; and whether he approves of this action by the local authority in effectively reducing the woman's income which totals 52/6 per week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney) Neil T. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand from Dublin Corporation that the person referred to by the Deputy receives a contributory widow's pension, that increases in such pensions are taken into account in the corporation's present differential rent scheme, and that an increase of 6d per week is payable in this particular case as a result of the 10/- increase in the weekly pension rate.</P>
      <P>I have already recommended Dublin Corporation, as well as all other housing authorities, to review their rent policies comprehensively with the object of ensuring that rents are related to ability to pay, and to the standard of accommodation provided, and that no one in need of rehousing should suffer hardship on account of inability to pay rent.  By securing reasonable rents from those who are able to pay, it should be possible for housing authorities to make concessions in regard to the reckoning, for rent purposes, of such items as increases in social welfare payments. Any such proposal which the corporation may make as part of their comprehensive rent review will be sympathetically considered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>That is no use to the widow in Ballyfermot, is it?  I am very well aware of the Minister's desire to see the rents raised and his recommendation to the corporation to have the rents raised, but that is another day's battle.  This is the case of a woman living on 52/6 a week and the corporation, because of the increase in <Col N="2047" /> her contributory pension, propose to increase her rent.  The Minister refers to 6d a week&mdash;an awful lot of money to a woman trying to live on that miserable sum.  I ask him to tell the corporation that this is not good enough and that they should not do it.</P>

      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to the arrangements for the recording of votes by members of the Permanent Defence Force whose names are on the Postal Voters' Lists for their respective constituencies. Such a member receives the following documents from the Returning Officer for his constituency shortly before the date of an election:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  a ballot paper;</P>
      <P>(b)  a Receipt for Ballot Paper;</P>
      <P>(c)  an envelope addressed to the Returning Officer (referred to as a &ldquo;Covering Envelope&rdquo;); and</P>
      <P>(d)  a smaller envelope marked &ldquo;Ballot Paper Envelope&rdquo; bearing the number of the ballot paper.</P>
      <P>Immediately on his receiving these papers, the intending voter is required to:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  sign the Receipt for Ballot Paper;</P>
      <P>(2)  record his vote by marking the ballot paper secretly in accordance with the instructions contained on the back of the Receipt for Ballot Paper; and</P>
      <P>(3)  place the marked ballot paper (without showing any person how he has marked it) in the &ldquo;Ballot Paper Envelope&rdquo;, fasten the envelope and place it, properly fastened, together with the signed Receipt for Ballot Paper, in the larger &ldquo;Covering Envelope&rdquo; addressed to the Returning Officer, fasten the latter and post it without delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All Officers Commanding are instructed to ensure that all personnel of their units are paraded and that the arrangements and facilities provided for the recording and posting of votes are clearly explained to them.  In this connection such officers are required to make suitable and adequate arrangements to provide the voter with facilities to record his vote in privacy.  Officers and non-commissioned officers are made available to interpret the relevant military instructions <Col N="2054" /> for individuals who seek assistance in regard to the method of recording a Postal Vote but strict injunctions are issued that no advice or supervision which might be regarded as tending to influence a voter or deprive him of his right of secret voting may be offered or exercised by an officer or non-commissioned officer and that no effort may be made by an officer or non-commissioned officer to ascertain how a voter has marked his paper.</P>
    <P>Where an individual expresses a desire to post his ballot paper in person at a convenient Post Office instead of at his military station, he is afforded a local leave pass to do so.</P>
    <P>If a member of the Permanent Defence Force has any complaint in regard to the secrecy of his vote he may submit this complaint to his superior officer.  If this officer does not deal with the complaint to the member's satisfaction and if the member thinks himself wronged there is provision in the Defence Act, 1954, under which the complaint may be submitted to the Minister for Defence.</P>

      <P>The normal method employed in wage negotiations in Ireland is that of free collective bargaining.  Before taking a decision on the possibility of ratifying Convention No. 100, the Government should have regard to the trend in free collective bargaining in the direction of equal pay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health whether any decision has yet been taken following the recent discussions between his Department and the Dublin Health Authority on the provision of home help for aged people in the Dublin area; and if he will state the districts for which such help will be provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>No discussions have taken place between my Department and the Dublin Health Authority regarding the provision of a home help service for the aged.</P>
      <P>I understand, however, that the Interdepartmental Committee which is examining the services for the aged and which will recommend measures to achieve the optimum co-ordination between the public and voluntary services available, recently met representatives of the Dublin Council for the Aged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware from the White Paper on the Health Services and their Further Development that I <Col N="2062" /> fully appreciate the need for a home help service, as an ancillary to the district nursing service, particularly for old people and the chronically sick. There is, however, no provision for such a service in existing health legislation but it is proposed to make provision for it.</P>
    <P>I have already approved of the making of grants by several health authorities, including Dublin Health Authority, to voluntary organisations providing services for the aged which include, in addition to recognised health services, other services which are not at present so recognised, including home helps.</P>

      <P>Under the new arrangements the Intermediate Certificate is being opened to students of vocational schools who will have followed an approved course of three years duration.</P>
      <P>Revisions of the syllabuses for the Group Certificate, for which the course is a two years one, have been drafted so as to bring them into harmony with the changes recently made in the Intermediate Certificate course.</P>
      <P>These draft revisions will very shortly be the subject of consultations between the Department and the other organisations concerned.</P>
      <P>The result will be that a student who, as heretofore, may complete the Group Certificate course and take the Group Certificate Examination in two years, may now, on completion of a further year, be eligible to sit for the Intermediate Certificate Examination.</P>
      <P>In addition, students who fail at the Intermediate Certificate Examination but qualify in the subjects required for the Group Certificate, will, if they so desire, be awarded the Group Certificate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The group certificate will not make any real difference.  There will be some changes in the course but those at present dealing with this matter will be able to deal with it in the light of changes to be made.  As regards the common intermediate certificate, it is probable that in a few years time more teachers will certainly be needed because there will be more students following that course, but at present it is impossible for me to state in this specific case whether more teachers will be needed.  The Deputy will be aware that I have asked the authorities of the vocational schools to consult with the secondary schools to see to what extent <Col N="2064" /> they can cater for this.  In the past where consultations have taken place the results have been satisfactory.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>

Will the pupils commencing this year be at a disadvantage as well if they sit for the intermediate examination?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of what the Deputy says being the case.  The position is that the course in regard to the common intermediate certificate is starting in September of this year.  It may be that the Deputy has in mind that those who have already started on the course for the group certificate may find that that course is not quite adequate in relation to the course for the intermediate certificate.  This could happen whenever a change is made and is something which cannot be avoided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The position had been reached when by far the biggest building scheme ever undertaken in the case of national schools was being operated. In order to ensure that an undue proportion of the available capital would not be devoted to this single aspect of the overall building programme it was found necessary to draw up a priority list.  The urgency associated with the building of the Eoin Bosco School at Navan Road to which the Deputy refers was not such as to warrant it being placed on this year's list.  The matter of priorities in school building is being kept under constant review and the building of this school will be allowed to proceed at the earliest possible moment.</P>

      <P>I have seen the newspaper reports referred to and should perhaps mention that the phrase there reported to have been used by the Reverend Manager was &ldquo;below normal intelligence,&rdquo; not &ldquo;mentally retarded.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Some time ago I had a discussion with the authorities concerned, in the course of which they agreed, at my request, to submit to me a comprehensive list of the improvements they would suggest for the school.</P>
      <P>Since then they have submitted the list.  The improvements they have suggested are at present under active consideration in my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>They do.  They are concerned with a number of aspects but primarily with what seems to me to be the most important&mdash;adequate remedial teaching.  Many of the boys are illiterate and it seems to me this is the most urgent requirement.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I remarked on the last occasion that if the Government were sincere in their attempts to implement <Col N="2076" /> or bring towards implementation the idea of an incomes policy, the present legal formation of companies would need to be revised and their taxability simplified.  I said it was important to be able to set out in a clear fashion in advance what will be the tax situation in the context of any company.  I spoke about the necessity for clearing up the problem between dividends retained and those ploughed back by individual companies in reinvestment policies.</P>
      <P>Other Deputies have taken advantage of this occasion to refer to the number of industrial disputes throughout the country, and the Finance Bill brings us back more and more to the debate which has more or less been taking up the time of the House in recent months on the economic position of the country.  Other Deputies referred to the number of industrial disputes and brought forward different proposals to end this unhappy situation. The attitude of my Party is that these disputes owe their origin to one basic cause, the soaring cost of living and the discontent felt by the majority of workers at the low standard of living.</P>
      <P>People may become interested during the current election campaign and conjectures may be made about the votes to be cast for either candidate in the election.  Throughout the course of the year, men and women throughout the country have been voting on their feet for an improved standard of living and I suggest the Government had better take notice of this realistic election that has been going on throughout the country throughout the year, even among their own supporters who have voted on their feet in different disputes.  They have indicated their discontent in no uncertain fashion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are no frivolous reasons for their doing this.  They do not get extra income during a strike.  Strikes only bring hardship to those on strike and to their families.  One of the most significant speeches on this situation was made last Sunday by the President of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions when he directed attention to the revolution that is proceeding which, he <Col N="2077" /> said, was inspired by the outlook of James Connolly which, apparently, sought a higher standard of living, an outlook that will brook no delay in the achievement of that standard of living.  Different proposals have been brought forward and we shall probably hear more during this session about ending this spate of strikes and disputes.</P>
    <P>People have spoken in favour of a stronger legalised framework that would bring the law into present industrial relations.  My Party have warned against this development and have indicated that we see no easy solution to the situation by bringing a judicial concept into employer-employee relationships.  Last year the record in the United States and Canada, especially Canada where the law has been brought in, was far more serious than in this country.  Instead of looking for global solutions to this problem, it would be far more constructive to look for improvement in day-to-day negotiations at the level of individual firms.</P>
    <P>We have asked for the introduction of a recognised grievance procedure in all firms.  It is still a difficult matter in many firms to bring a complaint before the foreman.  Either he is not available or there is no machinery for doing it.  Last year a great and continuing proportion of our disputes were concerned with conditions of work &mdash; conditions in the sphere of personal relations with managements.  A proper grievance procedure would remedy this.  We in the Labour Party consider that possibly the greatest contribution the Government can make to more peaceful industrial relations would be through their own economic planning &mdash; to generate more economic activity.  We consider that work in this direction is far more valuable in the long run than bringing in short-time panic measures to this House to coerce the trade union movement in its wage negotiations.</P>
    <P>We are extremely disappointed to see that at this point there has been no forward move, or declared policy or aim, by the Government in its declared favouring of an incomes <Col N="2078" /> policy.  I mentioned in the debate here recently that at last year's Irish Congress of Trade Unions conference a resolution was passed calling on the Government to bring in an incomes policy.  They had, if you recall, based their main argument on the need to improve the position of the lower-paid worker, and called upon the Government to bring in realistic policies and suggestions in the area of incomes.  I am afraid that at its conference in July a situation of no progress will have to be reported on the previous intention in regard to an incomes policy.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable because throughout this year, more so than at any other period in the life of this Government, people are talking about the different income groups.  There is far more information available now of the actual incomes position of different groups in our community.  Since this position obtains, practically every man and woman in the State, and wage earners in general, are interested in this idea at the moment, and it would have helped the debate and certainly would have helped the Government in giving serious advice on our economic situation, had they advanced a little on the road to the implementation of an incomes policy.</P>
    <P>This Government labour under the extreme disadvantage of presiding over an economic position that has become increasingly serious in that its messages seem to be one-sided.  They seem to be becoming more and more an employers' Government, a big business Government.  Since they labour under this disadvantage, it would have helped them had they spelled out what exactly it would mean for the company director just as much as the wage-earner, the manual worker.</P>
    <P>The Government bear the major responsibility. The <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> never shirked its major responsibility in saying the Government had that responsibility.  It shares major responsibility in the actual achievement of the targets under the Second Programme.  None of the reports that have come out at intervals have denied this obligation. <Col N="2079" /> A modern Government does not seek to evade their responsibility.  Yet, on the acid test of employment figures, there is a really serious case now for an investigation of the entire Programme. From the employment figures of last February, we are 34,000 down. This, therefore, means that one of the main objectives of the Second Programme is now in ruins and it will take more than economic genius and more than the economic miracles this Government are capable of to make up for these lost targets before 1970.</P>
    <P>Productivity has dropped but I think the more serious thing is that employment has dropped and there does not seem to be any possibility of making up this drop.  One can choose between selective periods and between one year and another and say that when that Government were in office more people were in employment but now that this Government are in office there are fewer people in employment.</P>
    <P>Leaving all political charges aside, we can see that over the past few years there has been a drop.  This cannot but help to make the present industrial impasse worse.  We cannot expect the agreement of all trade union workers to increased productivity plans if in fact they see that such increased productivity puts them out of a job.  No European country that I know has in fact sought or been able to get the comprehensive agreement of the trade union sectors in their country against a pattern of falling employment, and, indeed, any kind of bubble prosperity that occurs against the background of falling employment is not a secure basis for looking for trade union cooperation in the future.  At the Trade Union Conference this year, I have no doubt this will be one of the charges and accusations against the present Government.  One particular aspect in our country is that employment has been dropping during recent years and we are told that our economy has to go forward at a predetermined rate.</P>
    <P>One considers it a strange mistake of emphasis to find some Deputies concentrating all their fire on the days lost through strikes.  They should consider <Col N="2080" /> the number of man hours lost to the country in extra employment by those who are out of work through no fault of their own.  They should consider, again, that the number of man hours lost through industrial illness, or industrial injuries, is far in excess of any loss incurred through industrial disputes.</P>
    <P>In this year of industrial relations, I would direct the Government's attention to improving factory legislation which is in great need of revision and modernisation.  The present factory law is completely out of touch with the present factory situation.  We have many complaints from the trade union movement about factory inspectors who work in collusion.</P>

The British Labour Government are undertaking the task in Britain of bringing company law up to the 1960s and 1970s.  We will need to do it here also.  I know the Government are getting their best legislation from Britain and I think that admittedly they may take the less labour sections of the Labour Government's legislation.</P>

I do feel that some Deputies here have tended to waste the valuable time of the House by going over the Budget debate again.</P>
      <P>Deputy Sweetman did make some effort to discuss the Bill itself.  I should like to refer in particular to one part of his speech on Wednesday last as set out at column 1893 of the Dáil debates.  He was referring to section 17 of the Bill and he made certain comments on the fact that this section was entirely inspired by Deputy de Valera &ldquo;aided and abetted, as well as I can remember, by Deputy Booth.&rdquo; I think Deputy Sweetman will probably remember, if he cares to make an effort, the discussion we had on the Finance Bill.  The point which Deputy de Valera and I were trying to make was that while we did not at all like the taxation which was being introduced in respect of benefits passing to widows and children which had been provided by a very provident father, we felt that if this taxation were introduced at all, then all death benefits should be treated in a uniform fashion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2082" /> It was clear at that time that there were certain exceptions.  Certain gratuities and death benefits were being excluded, not specifically and not openly, but nevertheless excluded. That was something neither Deputy de Valera nor I was happy about.  We felt there must be justice done and that justice must be seen to be done. The fact that certain senior civil servants would not be affected seemed to us to leave a rather unpleasant smell.  This was no reflection on the civil servants but it certainly put them in a very embarrassing position.  It was for that reason we pleaded so strongly that, if the Minister was going to introduce this provision, it should be complete and uniform in all cases. Deputy Sweetman has done some further research and has drawn the attention of the House and the Minister to various other gratuities which will now be included under this provision. I have not been able to confirm that his facts are correct but I do not imagine he would have spoken as he did unless he had done very careful research.  If his allegations are correct, that strengthens the case Deputy de Valera and I made originally on the 1965 Bill for a reconsideration of this whole matter.</P>
    <P>This taxation was introduced in order to catch in the tax net the few who were practising tax evasion, possibly on a large scale.  I do not believe that the number was large and, in that case, I am afraid the method used was somewhat akin to taking a sledgehammer to kill a fly.  I believe a great many people who the Minister never intended should be affected are being affected.  I trust the matter will be kept very carefully under review.  I know that there has been retrospective provision made whereby increased tax-free allowances will be made in the case of widows and orphans.  That is a big improvement and absolutely in line with the undertaking the Minister gave last year.  I am very grateful to the Minister for this.  I knew that, having given an explicit undertaking, he would carry out that undertaking strictly.  I can well imagine that it must have needed considerable effort on his part to bulldoze this provision <Col N="2083" /> past the watchdogs of Revenue.  I do not know whether there is any precedent for such retrospective allowances. Perhaps there are.  This is a shining example, however, of a Minister who was himself doubtful about the wisdom of a provision, wished upon him to a certain extent in the peculiar circumstances of last year, doing the big thing by honouring his undertaking and giving retrospective relief.  I am not sure that this is the answer and I hope that solicitors will keep this whole matter under very careful review and report either directly to the Minister or to some members of this House any cases of hardship that arise.  I know that certain cases have arisen.  I referred one case to the Minister.  I believe that, if we can substantiate our suspicion that considerable injustice is being done and grave hardship is being caused by this provision, the Minister will act further in the matter.</P>
    <P>In principle generally, I am still opposed to this taxation provision.  It affects in particular the family of a young man who makes provident insurances to safeguard his widow and children in the event of his premature death.  It is not in the public interest that such providence should be discouraged. The family of a young man who takes out really adequate insurance to provide for his dependants will still be severely penalised.  I hope the Minister will keep that aspect under consideration and I hope that anyone who knows of such cases and can substantiate them will report them without delay.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed at the lack of any provision for the purpose of amending Part VII of the 1965 Finance Act.  That is the Part dealing with the taxation of capital profits arising from the development of land.  This, I regard, as ill-considered taxation.  I know perfectly well &mdash; we all do &mdash; the people the Revenue were trying to catch.  They were trying to catch the speculative builder and developer, buying land and selling land purely as a speculation and, in this rather inflationary situation, making considerable profits in the <Col N="2084" /> process.  There is something to be said for taxing the speculator but, once provision is made to tax genuine developers, there is grave danger, as we stressed last year, that we will make it more difficult to provide land for desirable development.</P>
    <P>Cases have arisen in which wellmanaged estates have had to dispose of certain lands in order to pay death duties.  The profits from the sales were remitted <i>in toto</i> to the Revenue. Claims are now being put in by Revenue for taxes arising from the increase in the value of the lands from the notional value a few years ago to the actual value in 1966.  I have referred a particular case to the Minister. There is another case in relation to a very old charity in County Dublin which owned considerable property. Finding itself in straitened financial circumstances, the charity sold a considerable acreage to a builder purely for the purpose of keeping the charity going.  Now a claim is being put forward by the inspector of taxes for tax arising from the sale of the lands for development.  That is not what the Minister or the House wanted at all.</P>
    <P>I believe that in one of the Scandinavian countries they have a somewhat similar provision for taxation but that, in that case, the provision specifies that tax will become payable only where land has been sold within ten years of the date of purchase.  That, quite clearly, is a confirmation of what I said earlier, namely, that the person to be taxed is the speculator who is trying to get in and to get out quickly. Anyone who has land for ten years or more and subsequently disposes of it for development purposes should not in fact be taxed at all.  The increased value of his land may be quite illusory and may be due entirely to the decreased value of money.  The actual purchasing power which he will have by disposing of the lands this year may be almost exactly the same as a very much lesser sum ten years ago so that, in that case, no actual real profit arises.</P>
    <P>I do know that it has been announced in the press that the Revenue Commissioners have now set up a separate office to deal with queries arising under Part VII of the 1965 <Col N="2085" /> Finance Act.  I think this is very wise and I hope people will make use of that, in view of the Minister's renewed assurance that he will keep the operation of Part VII of the 1965 Act under review and that if it calls for reform then that reform will be retrospective. I think the attitude of the Minister here is a very wise one.  I should have liked him to act more quickly but I think, on reconsideration, he is probably relying on his legal training and decided he will not make reform until he knows precisely what the problem is.  I may have a fairly clear idea in my own mind as to certain cases which should be excluded but other cases may arise also.  I think, therefore, it is probably wiser to defer the amendment of Part VII of the 1965 Act until we have, if not all, at least most of the facts before us.  But, here again, this is something which deserves the greatest publicity.  I hope that solicitors, in particular, will take their cases to the officers of the Revenue Commissioners, who have been set apart specially for this job, to work out their particular problems with them.</P>
    <P>I still feel, however, that, unless Part VII is very radically reformed and revised, we may have a situation here similar to the situation which has arisen in the United Kingdom with the capital gains tax.  Everyone is always anxious to see tax raised from people who are getting easy quick money and that is what is behind the capital gains tax in England.  But the situation has now arisen there where it has been announced in the press and on the radio that the officials of the Inland Revenue in Great Britain have decided that this tax is &ldquo;black&rdquo; and that they will not handle it.  The junior officials, who would normally examine these cases in the first place, have had to admit that they do not know what the provision really means: they do not know how to enforce this particular tax.  They do know that it will have to go to their superiors for final elucidation and, so, they have said perfectly clearly: &ldquo;We do not understand what this is all about and so we shall not touch it in the first place.  Let the senior men deal with it&rdquo;.  This can create a crisis in the whole taxation <Col N="2086" /> code.  I feel exactly the same will happen in regard to this tax on land development. It was crudely drafted in the first place.  It has caught a number of people whom it was never intended to catch.  I think it is very doubtful whether it has really penalised any of the wicked speculators whom the Revenue had in mind because people who are indulging in that sort of activity have probably, by now, found some way around it.  It is only the innocent who still flounder and get caught.</P>
    <P>I appreciate very much that the Minister has already, this year, repeated his undertaking to keep Part VII of the 1965 Act under review and that, when reform is found to be necessary, he will make the reform retrospective.  Generally speaking, I think this Bill is a tidy Bill.  It is understandable and it is a great improvement on its predecessor.  I believe that it reflects a new attitude, due to the fact that the Minister for Finance has now definitely taken charge.  I must say that previous Ministers appeared to me to be the mouthpieces of the Revenue.  Now, I feel that when the Minister makes his statement he is speaking for himself.  He is making his own decisions and I think they are all the better for that.</P>
    <P>I am grateful for the Bill in its present form.  I am particularly grateful for the retrospective relief which has already been granted.  I hope that Part VII of the 1965 Act will be reviewed and amended very drastically at an early date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>The Finance Bill we are discussing here today seeks to extract from the Irish taxpayer an alltime record sum of over £262 million, despite the fact that the Taoiseach, when Leader of the Opposition in 1956, and also Deputy MacEntee, stated at that time and made the promise that if they were returned to power, they would not increase taxation.  They have kept that promise to the Irish people by increasing taxation from £106 million, as it then stood, to £262 million today, an increase of £156 million.  They have also borrowed <Col N="2087" /> over £400 million in the same period. At that time, when they were in opposition, they pointed out that, so far as taxation on certain items was concerned, they believed we had reached the point of diminishing returns.  As far as loans and borrowing are concerned, this country now seems to have reached the end of the road and certainly to have reached the point of diminishing return.</P>
      <P>I think it can be agreed by all that things are very bad in this country today.  Things are definitely bad in Ireland because the Fianna Fáil Government have used taxation as a bribe and they have used it to buy the people's votes over the past six or seven years.  Indeed, things are so bad in Ireland today that two eminent churchmen have had to speak out their minds in the past few days and to warn the people of Ireland of the frustration that exists today and of the national crisis, and indeed the anarchy, that lie ahead, unless the Government are prepared to govern or at least to give a lead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It is completely untrue to say that two eminent churchmen have said that.  I do not know where the Deputy gets that kind of jargon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>One of them said, as reported in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of Monday, 23rd May, 1966:</P>
      <P>The country is in a rather bad way at the moment.  Industrial unrest is widespread and there is a stirring among small farmers who find themselves being liquidated at the rate of 10,000 a year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Why not go on and see what they said about this Government, the good things?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>He went on to speak about the public debt of more than £700 million and the fact that we had come to the end of living by loan and that all in all there was a feeling of national frustration and national crisis such as there had not been since the 'thirties.  He said that it was a dangerous period and that there <Col N="2088" /> would have to be an end to this situation right away.  Another eminent churchman spoke a few days ago, and indeed after all the warnings issued, I think everybody knows that frustration stalks the land.  There is no denying that Irish people are ground down with taxation, national and local, and as one of the eminent churchmen said, not since the 'thirties or, indeed one might say, since the days of the Economic War has there been &mdash; I want to say this to the Minister because I have been travelling through the country recently &mdash; such poverty as exists today among the small business people and small farmers.</P>
      <P>The business people and farmers on whom the Government could, or should, depend to increase production in this difficult period are being crushed between increasing rates and taxation and soaring costs and, especially in the case of the small farmers, reduced prices.  Perhaps people have become so accustomed to mounting taxation under Fianna Fáil that they have become like punch-drunk boxers and can absorb punishment without seeming to be affected by it.  The Minister and the Government should realise they are very seriously affected, and like the boxers, the small farmers especially are losing ambition and initiative and, what is also very important, the competitive instinct.  They have become mere animated punchbags for the twofisted attacks of rates and taxation.  It can be truly said that the taxpayers are more battle scarred and are pumping out more blood than the British heavyweight, Cooper.  The only difference is that Cooper was allowed to retire but the taxpayers must remain in the ring and endure the buffeting of our Cassius Clay, the present Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The time has come when we should appeal to the Minister and the Government even if there is a Presidential election in the offing, to tell the people the truth and the whole truth.  They are not being told it and have not been told it for the past 12 months.  If they were they could overcome their difficulties.  There have <Col N="2089" /> been difficulties in the past but the Governments took the people into their confidence and when important statements were made, they were made, as they should be, in this House.  Even at this late hour, if the Government took the people into their confidence there would be hope for the nation.  Even if the people had to be promised blood and sweat and tears and if the Government told them that is what faces them for the next couple of years, the people could gear themselves to meet their difficulties in the hard times ahead.</P>
    <P>It is opportune to ask ourselves what has produced this situation.  Even the Minister in his Budget asked that question to which there is only one answer: it was due to the deliberate inflationary policy of the Government since they took office.  The Government seemed determined to pursue an openly inflationary policy.  The evils that would flow from that policy were pointed out on this side of the House by Deputies Dillon, Sweetman, Cosgrave and O'Higgins and other speakers on numerous occasions but the Government disregarded their warnings. Deputy Dillon in the years 1964 and 1965 issued such warnings and told the Government about the dangers that lay ahead if they pursued the policy they were pursuing.  These warnings went unheeded and the Government carried on, with the result that we are in our present plight.</P>
    <P>On 30th October, 1964, Deputy Dillon according to the <i>Irish Independent</i> said that the present economic situation of the country was highly critical.  As he pointed out to the Government on the debate on the adjournment in Dáil Éireann on July 1st, the inflationary trend in Great Britain could not long continue after the general election and that the post-election period in Great Britain would create new and formidable problems for this country.  He said that our Government, apparently, had been taken by surprise by this development and they were entitled to a reasonable time to demonstrate what steps they proposed to take to meet the new situation but if, as he suspected, they had no plans to meet what could only <Col N="2090" /> be described as a crisis, it was high time for them to get out.</P>
    <P>Not until July, 1965, did the Government take any action to deal with the situation.  On 16 other occasions, Deputy Dillon warned the Government and we now have had an admission from no less a person than the Minister for Transport and Power, who on March 23rd said in this House that we had inflation in the country since 1962 and that inflation was a dirty word and it was time people came to realise that fact.  If we had inflation since 1962, why did it take the Government three years to act?  Surely they should have made up their minds earlier?  Was it&mdash; I think it was&mdash;because they had two by-elections facing them and also a general election?  And, of course, they were prepared to put the Party first and to hell with the country.  That is what has brought our nation to the present state.  The Government are prepared to use the people's money to buy votes to keep themselves in office.</P>
    <P>If we want further proof of that, we can quote from the <i>Irish Times</i> of 12th March, 1966, when no less a person than Deputy MacEntee, who is also very vocal at present, in a letter in the <i>Irish Times</i> answered the question the Minister for Finance had asked: What had gone wrong with his Budget of the previous year?  Deputy MacEntee pointed out that he had been Minister for Finance from 1932 to 1939 and again from 1951 to 1954 and said:</P>
    <P>Outstanding among the chief culprits I place the economic astrologers and soothsayers who deluded our people with fantasies of the affluence which awaited them when they got to the end of the rainbow some years hence.</P>
    <P>We are all aware that those who were responsible for that more than anybody else are the present members of the Fianna Fáil Party.  They were the people who gave the impression of prosperity to the people at that time. Deputy MacEntee continued:</P>
    <P>Next in order of malign influences I rate those who were responsible for what has been euphemistically styled a National Wage Agreement. It is true that this instrument did not <Col N="2091" /> initiate the inflationary trend&mdash;that was done by a long series of deficit Budgets&mdash;but it accelerated it enormously.</P>
    <P>When Deputy MacEntee had all this knowledge, I wonder why he did not whisper into the ear of the Minister for Finance or of the Taoiseach and not allow the country to drift into the state in which it is today?</P>
    <P>The same gentleman, Deputy Seán MacEntee, who was Minister for Finance for six or seven years, continued:</P>
    <P>No less detrimental to the national interest than the foregoing have been those irresponsible politicians who demanded increased expenditure on virtually every public service while refusing to accept any share of the responsibility for paying for it.</P>
    <P>That also includes many members of his own Party, as those of us who are on local authorities know quite well.</P>
    <P>The accusation has been made against the Government that the country is heading towards anarchy. It is the Government's duty to govern. It is the Government's duty to control the economy, to balance all factors, one against another.  It is the Government's duty to lead.  That is what they have been elected for. There is no denying that they are not fulfilling their duty today.  The Government are the only people who, at least, should know the facts and they should be able to provide against successions of boom and slump.  The Government have failed to do their duty.  They took a gambler's chance on our gaining admission to the Common Market to cover up all their faults and failures. They have failed in that.  Then, of course, they made a Free Trade Agreement with Britain, under which the majority of the advantages are with Britain.</P>
    <P>The more one looks at the sad history of the past few years, the more one realises the Government's responsibility, and their responsibility alone, for our present trouble, and the more one realises that it is the duty of the Government to take the Dáil and the <Col N="2092" /> people into their confidence.  When the Government have statements to make about the financial situation, they should be made in this House. If that were done, there would be a chance of gaining the confidence and co-operation of the people, which are so vitally essential if the Government are to get out of the present crisis.</P>
    <P>It is difficult for the Taoiseach and Ministers of the Government to explain to the people the reason for their somersault and for the Government's utter disregard for the sacredness of truth.  We have been told in the House, as indeed we all know, that the dead hand of Fianna Fáil is falling on health, education, housing, the Garda Síochána Band.  Yet, when we ask questions, particularly in regard to housing, we are told that there is money for this, that and the other, that there is ample money, that there was never more money.  At the same time, those of us who are members of public bodies know that we have not one-half&mdash;in some cases we have only a little more than one-third&mdash;of the money to meet our present commitments.</P>
    <P>There is an obligation on every political Party who seek office to tell the people the truth and not to mislead or to fool the people.  They should tell the people how they would use power if it is entrusted to them.  Things are bad here today and the Government are keeping the full truth from the people.  There is one thing certain: their election deceit has been exposed for all and sundry to see.</P>
    <P>We all know that a financial crisis exists in Ireland today, with all its evil results.  The Taoiseach, Dr. Ryan and other members of the Government falsely denied the existence of a financial crisis before the general election. It is now revealed and officially acknowledged and is felt by all.  Deputy Dillon could warn the Government over two years ago, one and a half years before that general election, that we were heading for a financial crisis.</P>
    <P>We all know that Britain has her difficulties today but they are due, perhaps, to her huge commitments abroad.  It cannot be denied that our <Col N="2093" /> difficulties are of our own Government's making.  We all remember what the people on the far side of the House had to say about the financial crisis that existed in 1956, how they badgered the Government of that day.  Unlike the position in 1956, when cattle were selling at £4 a cwt., our present difficulties are being experienced at a time when our exports are selling at a nearly all-time high, when cattle are fetching double the price obtainable in 1956 and 1957.  In 1956 and 1957, cattle were selling at £4 and £4.10.0 a cwt.  Today they are selling at £9, £9.10.0 and in some cases £10 a cwt.  We remember all the questions the present Minister for Transport and Power asked at that time about cattle prices and the gloomy headlines in the <i>Irish Press</i> and the reports that the bottom had fallen out of cattle prices.  They were prepared at that time to do anything and everything they could to harm the Government of that day and cared very little about the national interests.</P>
    <P>It is only right that we should trace the reasons for the present mess.  The Minister asked in his Budget Statement: What has gone wrong?  The roots of the current economic stresses and industrial unrest go back to February, 1963.  In 1963, the Fianna Fáil Government issued a White Paper, <i>Closing the Gap</i>, the purpose of which, we were told, was to underline the dangers of living beyond our means. Our people were told that they were spending too much money.  The White Paper pointed out that it was clear that we could not maintain the then existing level unless we earned more abroad.  Accordingly, the White Paper urged Departments, local authorities, State-sponsored organisations, trade unions, and so on, to make no more demands for higher wages until we had increased production and exports.</P>
    <P>That exhortation invoked a reasonable response until the autumn of 1963. It cannot be denied that we had stability, that wage demands were few and strikes were fewer.  Then the Government introduced its iniquitous turnover tax, a new tax imposed for the first time in the history of our country, a tax on bread, butter, tea, sugar, fuel, meat, medicines, clothes, <Col N="2094" /> and all the necessaries of life.  The Fine Gael Leaders pointed out at that time the bad effects that would flow from this ill-conceived policy, how such a tax on the necessaries of life was bound to increase the cost of living, how it would again enkindle the flames of inflation, with all its harmful effects.  Fine Gael speakers pointed out in this House that it could do, and would do, irreparable harm to the economy.</P>
    <P>All our forecasts have proved right. Everything that Deputy Dillon, Deputy Cosgrave and Deputy Sweetman said at that time has now, unfortunately for this country, turned out to be correct. There was a sudden jump in prices and the cost of living immediately started to rise. While the Government were calling for restraint, the workers' pay packet was not going as far as before. Fianna Fáil speakers in this House and throughout the country argued that the turnover tax would have only a minimal effect on prices.  I should like to ask: were Fianna Fáil so innocent as to believe that a policy of restraint could be maintained in the new conditions of higher prices which they had created?  I believe it was a major and tactical error and the starting point of the present chaos.</P>
    <P>The next move was a very clever political move by the Government.  As far as politics and political moves are concerned, they are very clever. Indeed, if they were as clever in regard to governing the country as they are in regard to political moves, things would be much better for the nation.  As I said, their next move was a very clever political one. The death of two TDs suddenly closed the gap.  The Taoiseach changed horses in mid-stream.  He took up his pen and wrote a letter and the gap between spending and income had suddenly and mysteriously closed.  He quoted no figures, nor have any of his Ministers quoted figures since, to show how the gap had been closed so quickly.  He simply wiped out the picture he had been painting during the year and painted a brilliant new picture in bright Fianna Fáil optimistic colours and so we had the famous 12 per cent increase <Col N="2095" /> as a bribe to the electorate of Cork and Kildare to win two by-elections. They won the two by-elections but at what a cost to the country.</P>
    <P>Having won those two by-elections, the Taoiseach switched horses again and proceeded to sound dire warnings through the spring and summer of 1964.  The 12 per cent, he stated, was more than we should have given.  He was now back with the employer's point of view.  We had taken a mortgage out on the future, he stated, and productivity and exports would have to go up to cover it and, he said, there must be no more wage demands.  The argument may have been valid from the point of view of statistics but it did not seem logical in view of what the Taoiseach and his Government had been saying before the Cork and Kildare by-elections. Once again he was contradicting himself but of course as far as the Government were concerned they did not give two hoots about the country.  They had won the two by-elections and that is all that was worrying them at the time. They were determined to stay in power and to use the people's money to purchase votes.  They did that and the circus continued.  The people saw through them and their promises and they returned Deputy John Donnellan in Galway East, Deputy Joan Burke in Roscommon and Deputy Mrs. Desmond in Mid-Cork.</P>
    <P>The economic crisis was then getting worse.  The Fianna Fáil Party knew the full facts about the economy and about the economic recession that was about to come upon us and they knew it would get worse.  If they had been statesmen, they would have tackled it and they would have told the people the truth but they did not do that.  The Taoiseach called a general election.  Instead of telling the people the truth about the situation that existed, they were more concerned with getting back into power.  They knew that we were going to have this economic crisis and recession which would last for two or three years.  They knew that they had been successful in keeping the truth from the people and <Col N="2096" /> the Taoiseach said: &ldquo;Now is the time; we will call a general election and if we get back into power, we may be able to weather the storm for another five years.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Party again changed horses and they showed they were prepared to stoop to anything in order to remain in power.  Overnight, in the spring of 1965, the country became more prosperous.  The message was preached at every crossroads, on the radio and on the television and in innumerable speeches by the Taoiseach and his Government.  Even the present Minister for Finance promised 75,000 or 80,000 new jobs in industry before 1970.  He made that promise in Dundalk but there has been no sign of that promise materialising.  However, it was good propaganda in an industrial town and would certainly get the industrial votes.</P>
    <P>It might be no harm to recall the Taoiseach's statement on the eve of the election in April when he said that the main task of the next five years would be to maintain the momentum of the country's economic progress which had now been built up and the nation's progress was now moving forward as never before in history.  We are entitled to ask what has happened since Fianna Fáil returned to power? In a full page advertisement in the <i>Sunday Press</i> on 14th April, 1965, one found in huge type the words, &ldquo;This is no time for a change.&rdquo;  What a change took place as soon as Fianna Fáil came back to office!  We also heard this statement: &ldquo;Our recent prosperity is not yet strong enough to withstand the shock of a change of Government.&rdquo;  Now we know it was not even strong enough to withstand even a further four months of Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    <P>They were just four months back in July of 1965 when the Taoiseach admitted that we were getting into financial difficulties and we were told that we must ensure that Fianna Fáil were enabled to carry on with a working majority and that the economy should be given a chance &ldquo;to continue expanding without confusion, delay or indecision&rdquo;.  How nice is that <Col N="2097" /> phrase&mdash;&ldquo;to continue expanding without confusion, delay or indecision&rdquo;&mdash; today for the extra 5,000 or 6,000 who are unemployed, for the unfortunate people who cannot get loans to build or reconstruct houses, or for the people who have done reconstruction work or are building houses and cannot get money, for the unfortunate builders who, according to last week's papers, have their machinery rusting in their yards, and for the unfortunate eight or ten builders in my own county who this week are emigrating to Canada or Britain.  How well those lines read for them and for the small businessmen and farmers and those others who are the victims of this Government's induced crisis.</P>
    <P>I use those words deliberately because they did nothing to head it off or to tackle it in time.  With his 12 per cent in his pocket at that time and with prices still to catch up, the Fianna Fáil message sounded reasonable enough to the man in the street and they were returned to power.  Safely back in the saddle, the Taoiseach last July changes horses again and wipes out the picture he had been painting for the previous five months during the general election and draws a brand new picture in pessimistic colours. Once more the Taoiseach and members of the Government are contradicting themselves.  Of course, what of it? They are back in power again and Fianna Fáil and their friends are still enjoying the fruits of office.</P>
    <P>The Finance Bill we are discussing here today is the result of this year's Budget which, it is admitted by every section of the people, was a cruel, harsh Budget.  It was also deceptive. Because of Government pronouncements prior to the Budget many people were expecting it to be tough, but the Budget surpassed their worst expectations. It is a grab-all Budget.  It is designed to take the money out of the people's pockets.  It can be truly said that never in the history of this country was so much taken in one fell swoop and so little given in return.  The Budget imposes £12 million in extra taxation.  The only concession in it is that the destitute poor, and they only, will get a 5/- increase on 1st November if they are lucky enough to live <Col N="2098" /> that long.  That is all they were promised in that Budget.  We do not know what shocks the Minister may have even for those unfortunate people in the next Budget.</P>
    <P>This is the 50th anniversary of 1916 and the men who gave their lives for Irish freedom.  Many people are inclined to ask: was it worth it all?  Did they die in vain?  Have they been let down?  Have the dreams of those who sacrificed their all come true?  Unfortunately for the Irish people, Fianna Fáil have been in office for 28 of the past 34 years.  Far from cherishing all our people equally, Fianna Fáil policy is to make the rich richer and the poor poorer.  We know they gave an increase of £15 a week to people who already had over £120 a week.  We know the Minister's colleagues in Cork County Council spoke out strongly yesterday against the attitude of the Government in giving more to the rich than they are entitled to and much less to the poor. That is reported in today's <i>Independent.</i> The men of 1916 gave their lifeblood for Ireland, but Fianna Fáil are today sucking the lifeblood of the Irish people.</P>
    <P>This nation of ours is bled to death. We are living on borrowed money and on borrowed time.  In the past nine years, the cost of running this country has risen from £106 million in 1956 to £262 million this year, an increase of £156 million.  During that period we have also borrowed over £400 million. Last week I asked for the amount of the National Debt and was told it is £714 million.  A day or two afterwards I asked for the amount of money borrowed by local authorities and was told it was a further £195 million.  The total comes to £909 million.  It costs almost £70 million per annum to service those debts.  This year it is well known that the Minister will have to borrow money to pay the interest on the money this country already owes.  As the eminent churchman stated in yesterday's paper, I think we are coming to the end of living by loans.</P>
    <P>Many of us can remember the unfair and unjust propaganda engaged in by Fianna Fáil in 1951 when the Government of the day borrowed money to build houses.  Houses were built at that <Col N="2099" /> time.  In my own county as many as 252 were built in one year, whereas in the past nine years under Fianna Fáil not even 80 were built.  At that time we built hospitals and the then Government cured the scourge of TB.  Fianna Fáil Deputies and their henchmen had their men outside every polling booth as the people went to vote, and the words whispered into their ears were: &ldquo;Put them out.  They have the country in pawn.  The country is up to its eyes in debt.&rdquo;  The National Debt then was only one-sixth of what it is today.  That shows the unfair and unjust propaganda Fianna Fáil were prepared to indulge in to put out the Government at that time.  But when they get back into power they change horses completely in order to stay there.</P>
    <P>We have today record rates of over £30 million collected from the people as well as record taxation of over £102 for every man, woman and child in the country.  The cost of living is at a record 181 points, due to the Fianna Fáil high taxation policy, the abolition of the food subsidies and the introduction of the turnover tax.  It may be no harm when talking about the cost of living to state what Deputy Lemass, now the Taoiseach, stated at Waterford on 28th February, 1957:</P>
    <P>Coalition leaders are threatening the country with high food prices and a lot more besides if Fianna Fáil becomes the Government.  A Fianna Fáil Government did not intend to do any of these things.  How definite can we make our denials of these stupid allegations?</P>
    <P>The present President of Ireland, then Taoiseach, speaking at Belmullet on 28th February, 1957 said:</P>
    <P>We did not want the price of bread, so important an article in the diet of the poor, to be increased.</P>
    <P>It is a little over twice now what it was at that time.  That is how Fianna Fáil kept those promises to the Irish people, just as they kept the promises they made in the past about reduced taxation.</P>
    <P>Last year we also had an adverse trade balance of £147 million and a deficit in our balance of payments of <Col N="2100" /> £45 million.  This is the Government's fourth consecutive year to have a deficit in the balance of payments. Surely the Government knew where they were going for the past four years?  Surely they would have taken action were it not for the fact that there were by-elections and a general election pending?  Surely they would take action now and tell the truth were it not for the fact that there is a Presidential election on 1st June? They still do not want to tell the people the truth.  They do not mind what happens the country if they can contrive to keep the full facts from the people and fool them until after that day.</P>
    <P>Let us talk about the deficiency in the balance of payments.  In 1962 it was £13 million; in 1963, £23 million and in 1964, £31 million.  Therefore, the danger signs have been on the horizon for the past four years.  The Minister for Transport and Power told us during his speech on the Budget debate in March that we had had inflation since 1962, that it was a dirty word and that it was time the people realised that.  If he knew that and if Deputy MacEntee, who has written to the <i>Irish Times</i>, knew what was going on, did the other members of the Government not know it?  If they did know it, as they should have known it, why did they not take action and why did they wait so long?</P>
    <P>When the Minister for Finance was innocently asking himself what went wrong, anyone could see that Fianna Fáil were living on borrowed money and borrowed time.  Any man knows you can get out of your depth by borrowing too much money.  The Government should have known that because the signs were there to be seen since 1962.  Fianna Fáil mismanagement is responsible for the position the country is in today and they, and they alone, must take the blame.  I believe that as a constructive Opposition with the national interest at heart, we have not only the right but the duty to ask ourselves what lasting value we have got or will get from this huge expenditure, or where this little country of ours is heading today.</P>
    <P>If with the vast outlay of public money, the growing burden of taxation, <Col N="2101" /> £162 million, and a National Debt of £714 million, we were in a position today to say that emigration had been stopped, that unemployment had been substantially reduced and that the number of people working in Ireland had greatly increased, we would all have some cause for satisfaction and for pride.  Far from these things being true, we have exported in the past nine years over 400,000 of our boys and girls.  The flower of our youth have had to emigrate and to earn their living abroad.  They are still going at the rate of 40,000 a year, and this despite the fact that the same Party said in 1956: &ldquo;Wives, put your husbands to work.&rdquo;  The wives did not think at the time they were going to put them to work in Coventry, Birmingham, London and other places abroad, but that is what has happened. This Government came to power by false pretences.  You remember all those Fianna Fáil slogans, such as &ldquo;Let us get cracking.&rdquo;  You also remember a Fianna Fáil advertisement of 16th February, 1957: &ldquo;No Government policy is good enough which does not give a fair chance of working in Ireland for all who need it for their livelihood.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>How was that promise to the people kept?  It has been kept by exporting 400,000 of our boys and girls to England since then.  The then Mr. Lemass, now the Taoiseach, put on the biggest bluff when he said on February 2nd, 1959: &ldquo;Unemployment and emigration are the acid test of policy, and the Fianna Fáil Government will measure the effectiveness of its working by those standards.&rdquo;  He went on to say: &ldquo;Fianna Fáil's immediate task would be to get work for the unemployed.  The unemployed would not be expected to wait until long-term production plans brought benefits.&rdquo;  I do not blame anyone for voting for Fianna Fáil on those promises, but the Government have not kept their promises.  They are entitled to tell the people why they have not kept the promises they made.  Apart from the huge taxation bill we have before us today, there are over 55,000 people unemployed and there are 167,000 people fewer at work than there were in 1951.  I asked the <Col N="2102" /> Taoiseach a question in this regard and his Parliamentary Secretary gave me the answer.  The figures are: in 1951, there were 1,217,000 people at work; in 1965, after the Fianna Fáil Party got cracking, after they told the wives to put their husbands to work, after all those promises that were made to the people, there were 1,050,000 people at work in Ireland, a reduction of 167,000 people compared with 1951. Those figures are there in the Dáil Debates and in the official statistics and cannot be denied by anybody from the far side of the House.</P>
    <P>The Government should remember that the safety valve of emigration may not always be there.  What would happen if England closed her doors to Irish emigrants?  Only for the safety valve of emigration, there would be almost 460,000 people unemployed in Ireland today.  It must be remembered that we also have the record low population of 2.8 million people. Surely Pearse, Connolly, Plunkett, and all those other great men who sacrificed their all in 1916 never envisaged this black picture we have in Ireland today?  We must all admit that this Government have not lived up to the ideas or the ideals of those great men.</P>
    <P>Those of us who are travelling through the country at the present time, whether electioneering or whatever else we may be doing, will have to admit that never have there been such complaints from people as we are getting today.  The people are ground down with taxation, both national and local.  Never do I remember meeting such frustration amongst small farmers.  I met small farmers last night and I met them last week, some in the west of Ireland, others in County Longford, and they told me they cannot live at the present time with the high taxation and the low prices they are getting for their produce.  They told me they will have to sell their little farms and emigrate. I met an unfortunate farmer with six children who told me he had even put up his farm for sale a month ago and could not get a £1 bid for it.</P>
    <P>As I stated earlier, Fianna Fáil, when in opposition, have always promised to reduce taxation.  Even <Col N="2103" /> when they came to power away back in 1932, they promised to reduce taxation by £2 million and to grant complete derating to the farmers.  At that time general taxation was something like 18 per cent of the national income; today it is around 27 per cent, which represents £102 to £103 per head for every man, woman and child in the country, or roughly £410 for the average family.</P>
    <P>With such a burden of taxation and with chronic emigration and unemployment, is it any wonder that incentive is lacking and that money for investment is scarce?  How could it be otherwise?  Carrying the dead weight of taxation is heavy enough, but when there is added to it a lack of encouragement by the State to enable industry to expand and a lack of generosity on the part of the Government in their depreciation allowances on plant, fittings and on vehicles the penal aspect is all the greater.  It is extraordinary that more inducements are offered to outside industrialists to come in and establish themselves here than are given to native industrialists to purchase machinery, to increase their output and work their way up to the top.</P>
    <P>This country has at its disposal a highly effective weapon which, if properly used, can create and expand wealth internally and also attract wealth from foreign sources.  I refer to the use of taxation.  So far, taxation has been used by Fianna Fáil as an instrument for dissipating, destroying and discouraging wealth instead of attracting it into this country and building it up.  That can be said very truly of the Fianna Fáil budgets of 1963 and 1965.  I welcome the Government's conversion to proposals in which taxation is being used to encourage industrial enterprise.  We proposed that &mdash;the late Deputy Norton and Deputy Gerard Sweetman when he was Minister for Finance&mdash;in 1956 and, of course, at that time the Fianna Fáil Government vigorously opposed it.  Indeed, the present Taoiseach said at that time that, even at some time in the future, he might be in a position to do away with the proposals made in the <Col N="2104" /> Dáil then but when he got back into power we were all glad to see that he did not and that he learned the wisdom of the measures introduced.  The Government should continue to pursue and expand those measures so as to build up the wealth of our citizens and attract more outside capital for investment here.</P>
    <P>Unless that is done in a dramatic way there is no hope of building up an economy which will produce the goods we require for internal consumption, for export, employing our own people and giving them a high standard of living in their own land.  That should be the aim of every government but it is my opinion that too much of our taxation at present relentlessly sucks and dissipates the energies of our people, which makes saving almost impossible. As a final blow, death duties destroy and scatter life savings of many thrifty citizens in this country.</P>
    <P>In this capital-starved State by an enlightened use of taxation we could build up the economy, enable citizens to save money, attract capital, private capital and capital for investment in industry, in trade and in agriculture. There is a great need for it at the present time, especially in agriculture which is crying out for capital.  According to the rumours afloat&mdash;I am not certain whether or not they are true but it has been stated&mdash;the money which the Agricultural Credit Corporation got and were about to loan out to farmers has been taken by the Government; they stretched out their hands and have taken much of this money from them.  I believe that is the case; I believe it is true.  That is a wrong policy.  Agriculture is starving for capital and the more capital that this or any Government put into agriculture the greater the return we will have and the quicker we can increase our exports.</P>
    <P>Our present taxation policy, especially the present rating system, is a cancer in our economy but it is a kind of cancer for which there is a cure.  Some Government, sooner or later, will have to perform a major operation in thinking, planning and in action.  The sooner this is done the better.  There is nothing in this Finance <Col N="2105" /> Bill and, indeed, in the Budget for the farmers of Ireland.  They have been betrayed, let down, disillusioned by the &ldquo;Golden Boy&rdquo; if you like to call him such.  The farmers of Ireland cannot afford the kind of progress Fianna Fáil proposes for them.  There is no denying that Fianna Fáil policy, especially their high taxation policy for the farmers of this country, has been a failure; a pie in the sky or promises of some crumbs in the future are no use.  People cannot live on promises alone.  Unfortunately, in this country, due to the high taxation policy of Fianna Fáil, over 300,000 farmers have been driven from the land.  Those figures should frighten any Government but not the present Goverment; they do not seem to have any effect.  We all know that the farmers, representing around 33? per cent of our population, are responsible for 75 per cent of our exports and yet get only about 20.3 per cent of the national income.  That is unfair and unjust.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>For many years we had warnings, from official Government spokesmen and others, that the burden of taxation was too high. Fianna Fáil in 1932 promised to reduce taxation by £2 million.  The Taoiseach promised to do so in 1956.  In 1956 also Deputy MacEntee, saying he spoke on behalf of the whole Party, stated that they had taken a firm decision not to increase taxation.  But, of course, we know that the moment Fianna Fáil got back into power public and local expenditure started careering upwards. Of course, Fianna Fáil are living only true to form.  I believe&mdash;and I think many people in this country believe&mdash; that the usual arguments produced in this House each year at Budget time against the upward swing in Government taxation failed to reflect the real <Col N="2106" /> gravity of the crisis.  The crisis is with us now, it is a grave crisis and it is the Government's duty to give a lead and to tell the people of Ireland how to get out of the morass they are in today.</P>
      <P>Never in the history of the country was it more desirable and necessary to have a period of stability than at the present time.  Let the people sit back, ponder and think of where we are going or what will happen us if we continue in the mad escapade which both the Government and the people seem to be indulging in today. We need a period of stability so that the producers, whether they be farmers or industrialists, can prepare and equip themselves for the more competitive period which, undoubtedly, lies ahead in the free trade area.  The only way in which tax revenue can be increased without causing inflation, without increasing the cost of living and without leading to bad industrial relations, is by a growth in the national production which would provide a larger taxable income.  The time has come when the Government will have to lead, govern and say to all sections of the community: &ldquo;We want to bake a larger national cake and we want to distribut that cake as equitably as we possibly can, but no longer will we stand for certain sections, whether well organised or not, stretching out their hands to get a slice of the cake before it is baked.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The time has come when the Government must govern, must rule or get out.  If they do not, the country is doomed, and no one on either side of the House wants to see this little country of ours go down.  At the same time, we all believe it is the duty of the Government to lead, not from behind but from in front.  It is an inescapable fact&mdash;and the Government must know it&mdash;that if public spending maintains its upward course, as of recent years, it will outstrip the real growth of the economy, and I think that is happening at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I spoke earlier about the turnover tax and its effect on taxation.  Indeed, it is interesting to remember that before the turnover tax was introduced, we had Deputy Lenihan, then Parliamentary Secretary, now Minister <Col N="2107" /> for Justice, assuring his listeners at a meeting that if that tax were introduced, it would be on &ldquo;furs jewellery and expensive motor cars&rdquo;, and that food and clothing would not be interfered with in any way.  We all know how that promise to the Irish people was kept.</P>
    <P>We further know that in this Finance Bill the price of beer has been increased by 2d, the price of spirits by 4d a glass and the price of tobacco by the equivalent of 2d per packet of 20 cigarettes.  Road tax has also been increased.  We remember that when Fianna Fáil were introducing the turnover tax, they told us&mdash;and I quote from column 82, volume 202 of the Official Report of 23rd April, 1963:</P>
    <P>It is not safe to rely for substantially increased revenue on the duties on only four commodities&mdash; tobacco, beer, spirits and oils&mdash;the yield from which is liable to be seriously affected by changes in demand.</P>
    <P>The Minister introduced the turnover tax, because we were told, those four commodities had been taxed to saturation point, but by a strange coincidence, having got the turnover tax geared and working smoothly, the Minister now comes along in 1965 and 1966 and taxes the very things he told us in 1963 had reached the point of diminishing returns.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>There is increased tax on petrol and diesel oil and this is <Col N="2108" /> unfair and unjust because, as the Minister knows, there are many workers who have to have cars to go to work with Bord na Móna, and other workers who have to travel long distances, and this tax has a crippling effect on them.</P>
      <P>The Minister has also robbed the Road Fund, and every county council has got word to the effect that the county road grants are being cut.  This is sheer lunacy in the financial crisis which is confronting the country.  If the Government want to cut any grant, they should cut the arterial road grants, the bulk of which is being spent on huge machinery.  Anyone who knows anything about rural Ireland knows that in every county there are boreens and bad roads.  Children and their parents have to walk in a foot of water to get to school, to Mass, or to their place of business.</P>
      <P>It is outrageous for the Minister to cut the grants for county roads this year.  The grant has been cut in my county, and I daresay the same applies in all the other counties.  We have appealed to the Minister, and I appeal to him even at this late stage, in view of the financial crisis existing today not to cut the grants for county roads but to cut the grants for arterial roads. These roads are tarred, and they are wide enough, unless we want to have roads on which the road hogs can travel at 70 or 80 miles an hour and kill one another, as seems to be happening at present.  It would be much better if the Minister allowed the different county councils to transfer the money from the arterial to the county roads.  It would be money much better spent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In any case, with the increased taxation we have had over the past eight or nine years&mdash;an increase of £156 million in nine years&mdash;the bald truth is that we are pricing ourselves out of the markets today.  If this policy continues, our industries will not be able to hold the Irish markets when the tariffs are reduced or abolished in another seven or eight years.  There is very grave danger that this could lead to economic disaster.  It is time that a national campaign to bring this warning home to everyone was <Col N="2109" /> launched, because otherwise we will slowly but surely commit hara-kiri.</P>
    <P>As I have said, it is the Government's duty to lead in the crisis confronting us today.  The Government more than anyone else are responsible for the industrial unrest in Ireland today because last year they gave status increases of £14, £15 and £20 a week to people who already had over £100 per week.  Having regard to that, can the Minister or anyone else blame another section of the community if, having been told last year before the election that everything in the garden was rosy, and that all they had to do was to stretch out their hands to get what they wanted, they are now looking for £1 or £2 a week or whatever increase they may be looking for?  Something will have to be done about the chaos that exists today in industrial relations.  Industry must be saved from unrest if our economy is to be viable under the Trade Agreement which was signed by the Government a few months ago.</P>
    <P>The Government must lead and, if necessary, coax employers and unions to accept changes, in their own interest and in the national interest.  We can no longer afford to allow irresponsible masquerading as an exercise of democratic liberty by either side.  In this century, people should be prepared in the national interest to devise some agreement to save themselves and to save the country.  If they do not, we will all go down.  The economic conditions today, the ever-rising cost of living, severe credit restrictions, delay and uncertainty in every business, industry and construction project, all emphasise the need for a properly planned economic and social programme.</P>
    <P>During the past year, the country changed from a position in which there was unlimited credit for every type of undertaking.  Before the general election last year, it was pointed out that people could get money from the Agricultural Credit Corporation to buy Mercedes cars and in some cases for what can only be described as highly speculative operations. That has changed to a position <Col N="2110" /> in which capital and credit are short, especially for agriculture.  Credit is short for agriculture, for industry, for housing and for schools.  The delays and the uncertainties caused by this confusion show that the economic approach of the Government is haphazard and ill-considered.  There seems to be no proper planning on capital schemes and no order of priority.</P>
    <P>Indeed, there is a great need for economic planning in order to promote economic expansion, not for the purpose of controlling, directing or dictating to any section whether in agriculture, industry, or any other interest, but in order to guide in the right direction the available financial resources.  Such planning will achieve more than all the pious exhortations we have heard from Ministers and from the Government in the last few years.  Indeed, the chickens of Fianna Fáil are coming home to roost.  It might be no harm to quote Macbeth, Act I, Scene 7, when he said:</P>
    <P>In these cases we still have judgment here; that we but teach bloody instructions, which being taught, return to plague the inventor; this even-handed justice commends the ingredients of our poison'd chalice to our own lips.</P>
    <P>Those words are very true today.  The chickens are coming home.  Indeed, the Government have a large gap to bridge.  It will take more than a Cadbury's snack to bridge the gap the Government have to bridge.</P>
    <P>As I have already pointed out, the National Debt is £714 million.  Service of the debt in 1960 was £16,800,000. In 1963 it went up to £25 million and according to the figure which the Minister gave me&mdash;I am open to correction as I have not got the exact figure with me&mdash;it is reckoned that in 1966-67 service of the debt will cost £55 million.</P>
    <P>Last year we were exhorted to: &ldquo;Let Lemass lead on.&rdquo;  Where did he lead us or where is he leading us now? The people are entitled to know. Fianna Fáil hawked the credit of this country around England and America. They were refused it in those countries and it was only when they went <Col N="2111" /> to Germany, a country which was battered and beaten after two world wars, that they got the credit they needed.  Certain people said they were keeping us out of the war for the good of the country.  Where did it get us? If we were kept out of the war where is the prosperity which should be in the country today?</P>
    <P>We are ground down with taxation. We had to go to Germany which was battered and beaten after two world wars to get the credit we needed.  That country had to make the machinery in 1945 to get the wheels of industry turning. Her people worked hard and they set an example to the rest of the world. If we got that lead in the past perhaps we would have got somewhere.  The difference between Germany and our country is that they had a Government which were prepared to lead.  They had a Government which were prepared to work themselves and the people had confidence in them.  We have a Government which are not leading us.  They are leading us from behind.  They have made so many promises to the Irish people in the past, which they have broken, that the people have no faith in the Government.</P>
    <P>It will be hard for the Government to try to convince the people that they were consciously telling the people the truth when they said a few years ago that everything in the garden was rosy.  It will be hard to tell those people now that they will have to do without certain things.  It is time the people realised fully that this Government have been going along with their heads in the sand.  They have been travelling with their heads down for the past two or three years or, as the Minister for Transport and Power stated, for the past four years, since 1962, with their heads in the sand.  All the indications were that some steps should be taken two or three years ago. Instead of doing that they said that this side of the House were creating a scare.</P>
    <P>That is what they told us two years ago.  That is what they told Deputy Dillon.  We on this side of the House were trying to be as constructive as we <Col N="2112" /> possibly could.  We were doing so for the benefit of the country, irrespective of whatever Government were in office. We warned the people and the Government but they did not heed us.  On 15th July last year the Taoiseach, at column 1548, vol. 217 of the Official Report, said:</P>
    <P>For my part, I am confident that we have not moved to check these adverse developments too soon or too late.  I think the time is about right.</P>
    <P>I wonder is he as confident now as he was then?  That was 15th July, 1965, ten months ago.  Further on, he stated:</P>
    <P>The policy of the Government in the situation now existing, the situation which may be developing, is to do the minimum we think will suffice, and in this way to avoid repetition of the mistakes which we think the Coalition Government made in the circumstances of ten years or so ago.</P>
    <P>I agree entirely with him when he said &ldquo;to do the minimum&rdquo;.  The Government are doing the minimum.  They are not leading.  They are not guiding the people or getting us out of the mess into which they have got us.  The Taoiseach said he was afraid of making the mistakes the previous Government made ten years ago.  The present Government have made many more mistakes and the country is in a much worse position now.  In fact, as an eminent churchman stated in the paper yesterday, &ldquo;Not since the 1930s was the country in such a state.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>It is not any harm to get the record right.  It is good to see independent people in the country who are prepared to speak their minds before the ship of state goes down. The disaster of Fianna Fáil lies in the seeds they have sown in the past.  The people of this country are burdened by the heavy taxation imposed on <Col N="2113" /> them.  The prosperity of a country depends on industrial and agricultural development.  The greatest evil in the country is the high taxation imposed by Fianna Fáil, despite all the promises they made when they were in opposition.</P>
      <P>The overriding, and the most urgent problem, that has to be dealt with is the disastrous height to which taxation has been raised.  All classes of the community are being crippled by it. It has had a far-flung effect on industry. I have already mentioned its impact on the farmers of this country.</P>

      <P>It might be no harm if I quoted from what the Taoiseach said in the past about taxation but perhaps I had better not.  In any case, as I said already, the greatest danger facing this country today is the high taxation rate imposed on it. Leaders of this Party have stated many times that we believe in a proper incomes policy.  Fianna Fáil, led by the Taoiseach, vigorously opposed such a policy up to one or two years ago.  We believe in an incomes policy which would give everyone a fair share of the national cake.  Under the Government's financial policy, the weaker sections of the community are going to the wall.  It is only the well off who are getting anything worth talking about from the Government.</P>
      <P>As I stated earlier, the policy of the Government is deplorable, particularly in the matter of cutting back on health and education.  They are the things that should be on top of our priority list.  Money spent on education is investment in the future.  If we are to hold our own in the internationally competitive period before us, if we are to build up our country, making full use of our natural resources, our youth must be provided with the best possible education the country can afford.</P>

      <P>I do not think I have ever heard such <Col N="2114" /> repetitious clichés as I have listened to during the past hour and a half.  It was not just simple repetition.  It was repetition three or four times out of Deputy L'Estrange's hat, as quickly as he could pull our quotations.  One would think from the speeches of Deputy L'Estrange and others that the economy was breaking down.  To create an impression of this kind is to do harm to the country not only in the eyes of our people at home but in the eyes of people abroad who may have some interest in expanding the economy of the country.</P>
      <P>It is entirely and deliberately misleading to suggest, as has been done here, that the country is going downhill fast, that there is no hope for the country.  For the reason that these assertions are blatantly dishonest, the main part of my reply will be devoted to indicating briefly how dishonest, inaccurate and exaggerated these impressions are.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>As everybody in the House and throughout the country knows, in the ten years prior to 1958, the rate of progress of the country, the average annual rate of increase in our gross national product, was in the region of one per cent.  In 1958, the <i>First Programme for Economic Expansion</i> was brought into effect.  It envisaged an annual rate of growth of about twice that one per cent during the ensuing five years.  In fact we achieved a growth rate of not less than four per cent per annum&mdash;it was 4.23 per cent.  That continued right up to 1965 when, due to many adverse circumstances arising from home and foreign conditions, the four per cent fell back to 2½ per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to emphasise that that decline was shared by other member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The rate in the current year is expected to be 3½ per cent.  Even in 1965 when the growth rate fell, it was still two and a half times the rate that obtained in the ten years up to 1958. I have every confidence, and the <Col N="2115" /> Government have every confidence, in the belief that this rate will increase again to 3½ per cent in the current year.</P>
    <P>When I presented my Budget in 1965, I made no secret of the fact that certain discouraging trends were emerging.  There was evidence that the balance of payments was not going well and that our balance of trade was also moving against us.  This was, of course, the result of a combination of adverse factors to which I have referred. As far as the balance of trade is concerned, the outstanding factor was the imposition of the British surcharge and, notwithstanding that the Government came to the assistance of exporters to the extent of 40 per cent of the surcharge on consignments for export, it did not prove sufficient to maintain the expansion in our industrial exports to the British market.  In many cases many exporters felt that the fat had gone our of the market and even with the 40 per cent assistance&mdash;it was 50 per cent in some cases &mdash;most of them only sought to hold their own.</P>
    <P>The immediate steps taken by the Government, in the form of market development grants, to which I have referred, did not prove enough to reverse that trend.  One of the main factors in that trend was the decline in cattle exports in the early part of 1965.  In the months immediately preceding, cattle prices were very bouyant, with the result that farmers and cattle-dealers generally were selling whatever cattle they had available to take advantage of these buoyant prices.  The result was that the numbers of saleable cattle on the land declined very significantly. There were young cattle not immediately saleable and that again affected our balance of trade problems.</P>
    <P>There was another factor against us at about that time.  Our industrial production rate began to decline <i>vis-à-vis</i> that of Britain.  As a result of these factors, inflationary tendencies set in in our economy.  In the 1965 Budget, I tried to take cognisance of these adverse tendencies and endeavoured to correct them.  The measures I took did not provide an early remedy and shortly afterwards further measures had to be taken, as announced <Col N="2116" /> by the Taoiseach during the debate on his Estimate.  In July 1965, steps were taken which were designed to bring our trade and our payments into better balance and to reduce the inflationary pressures that threatened us.  The remedies then were not easy or popular.  Neither the Government nor I anticipated that these measures would be successful overnight but they were necessary in the long-term interests of the country and the economy and it was necessary to employ them at that stage.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that the successful results of these steps are now beginning to be felt.  We have achieved a remarkable degree of price stability.  The Consumer Price Index has risen by only one point since May of last year. There has been a marked improvement in the balance of payments recently and the balance of trade in the past few months has been going well.  There are grounds for believing that this welcome trend will continue during the coming year despite the gloomy predictions we have heard from Deputies in the opposite benches.</P>
    <P>I referred to the inflationary tendencies that set in last year and I realise that the level of Government expenditure and public expenditure generally was a contributory factor. For that reason, in the Estimates for the current year, both current and capital, very serious efforts were made to reduce these Estimates so as to minimise the additional taxation that would be necessary, so as to avoid, if at all possible, a deficit in our current payments this year.  There is an increase of only three per cent in total Government expenditure above last year and that is below the expected rise in the volume of production during this year.  I was particularly conscious of the impact of the capital public programme on this inflationary trend also.  There has been a rapid growth in recent years in public expenditure and that, unfortunately, contrasted with the less buoyant state of the resources available to finance the public capital programme.  This underlined the need for urgent vigilance and control of expenditure and the maximum possible degree of forward planning.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2117" /> Experience last year showed that existing procedures were not adequate to highlight in time the remedies that ought to be taken, and for that reason I have set up a new system in the Department of Finance which is designed to ensure that public expenditures and the resources to meet these will be kept under constant review in the future.  The system that has been set up will cover all the capital expenditures and resources of Government Departments, local authorities and State bodies.  It will cover too the current expenditure out of the Exchequer. The aim is to ensure that this expenditure, both capital and current, will be kept within the resources and the allocations made out of the Budget from year to year.  This is necessary in order to ensure that expeditious and effective action can be taken to adjust the expenditures and programmes where necessary.</P>
    <P>The normal resources that we have available to finance our capital expenditure, including funds in the hands of State bodies and local authorities, national loans, Departmental funds and small savings, yield about three-quarters of our total capital requirements. This year the total capital requirements amount to something in excess of £106 million.  Therefore, the three-quarters we need to finance out of our resources will be about £78 million.  The balance, about £30 million, will have to be found from the banking system and from foreign borrowing. There was, as the House is aware, a White Paper published last October on capital expenditure.  It indicated that it was necessary to contain the growth of capital expenditure in order to allow the resources we had at our disposal to overtake the expenditure.</P>
    <P>This document and the capital Budget paper published in February stressed the importance of restraining the demands of the public sector on the banks' resources.  It was necessary to ease the demands of the public sector in order to ensure that sufficient moneys were available to the private sector.  When Deputies complain about insufficient moneys being available for one or another of their <Col N="2118" /> pet capital programmes, they must realise that the private sector also generates a degree of employment and I do not deny that the Government took up an undue share of the credit available in the banks last year.  For that reason, I hope that this year the steps I propose to take will be sufficient to ensure that sufficient money will be available for the private sector.</P>
    <P>On the question of foreign borrowing, again we must get our sights clear.  Winding up the debate on the Budget, I referred to the fact that far from putting our country in pawn, far from damaging the credit of our country, the successful flotation of bond issues on the foreign market was a mark of the credit-worthiness of our country.  I said that in this respect we were in the good company of such countries as Australia, Denmark, Austria, Japan and others, all of whom have had recourse to the bond market from time to time.  New Zealand was in the same market.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>At a fraction of a point less than the terms we were getting but New Zealand was a long-established customer in the international market.  I should like to stress that we were not refused a loan in the United States of America or in the Euro-Dollar market.  We did not go to the USA for a loan.  The funds we sought and the loan we intended to float were a surplus of American dollars in Europe that were not being repatriated to the USA. Unfortunately, at the time we went for the Euro-Dollar loan United States firms with international reputations were encouraged by the USA to get after this money and many of them did.  They did it all on the type of terms that would be available to us but they were given the right of transfer to the equities of their companies at the end of a set period. That was a difficult competition for us to try to meet in that market. However, we were advised by the managers of the loan both in Britain and in the United States, that, by reason of the pressure, and there was pressure on that market at the time, <Col N="2119" /> that was not the time to go and that it ought to be postponed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I referred to the necessity there is in the Capital Budget to help the financing of our capital programmes, where our home resources are not sufficient, by having recourse to foreign borrowing.  I do not think there can be any reasonable objection to foreign borrowing provided it is done on a moderate scale for the purpose of financing our domestic programme, and provided this programme includes an adequate and suitable amount of productive expenditure.  The amount we can prudently borrow from abroad should be determined by our existing balance of payments deficit and should have reference also to the likelihood of getting money on acceptable terms.</P>
      <P>We enjoy a reasonable inflow of foreign investment capital and our short-term objective in this respect is to bring the deficit in our external payments down to the level of that inflow. Our foreign borrowing in the next few years will have to be kept within a moderate annual limit because of the scarcity of money in the foreign market and also because of the consequent cost of borrowing in conditions of a world capital shortage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I referred to the attempts made to reduce current expenditure and the capital programme expenditure and my purpose in this year's Budget was to ensure that there would not be a deficit on current account because, and I readily admit this, that would have inflationary effects and would reduce the amount of capital available for investment. I stated quite explicitly that the additional taxation was necessary to meet our estimates as known, and no more, and I want to repeat now <Col N="2121" /> that I was not budgeting for a surplus, as has been alleged from the opposite side of the House.  I stated also that if further expenditure, for which provision had not been made, should arise during the year it would be necessary for me to come before the House with proposals for the taxation required to pay for that.  Deputy L'Estrange talked about being honest with the people.  Surely nothing could be more honest than to indicate that the taxation proposed was sufficient to meet only known expenditure and that any new expenditure would have to be met by additional taxation.</P>
    <P>Opposition speakers have suggested that it was known at Budget time that extra expenditure would have to be provided for the farmers because of the bad winter and the worse spring. When the Budget was introduced on 9th March it was still early days in spring and there was still time, if the weather improved, as we were reasonably entitled to expect it would, to make the normal preparations necessary to maintain the level of income envisaged for the farmers this year. Immediately after 9th March we had some very good weather, notably on Saint Patrick's Day, but the weather very quickly deteriorated again.  Even had we been able to anticipate the weather it would still have been impossible to anticipate what the reduction in farmers' income might be compared with what had been expected. It would have been imprudent and wrong for me in those circumstances to budget against current expenditure of which I was not aware and could not possibly have been aware.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave said that it was bad budgetary policy not to deal with the full year's expenditure in the annual Budget.  In my Budget speech I said that, in a time of unsettled conditions, which I readily admit we have, it is scarcely reasonable to expect that budgetary arrangements made in March or April will continue to meet requirements throughout the year.  In Britain, the Chancellor of the Exchequer has regulatory powers to change certain taxation within a tolerance of 10 per cent in order to meet changes.  I had no way of making a firm estimate of possible <Col N="2122" /> extra taxation to cover possible extra expenditure when I introduced my Budget and I could not, therefore, propose further taxation with any confidence that it would not have been either too much or too little. I decided that the proper course was to tax only to the extent which could be firmly estimated and to tell the House, as I did, that if further money were required I would have to come back to the House for it.  In our present circumstances I am convinced this is the proper course to follow.</P>
    <P>Just before the Budget it had been estimated that the farmers' income for the current year would increase by about 6 million or roughly the same increase per head as was estimated for the non-agricultural sector.  This estimate was, of course, agreed in consultation with the National Farmers Association.  Since then it has been thrown out because of the bad weather conditions but I do not think it is valid now to suggest that the bad winter and spring should have indicated at Budget time that the projected increase in farmers' incomes would not be realised. An increase of three per cent was projected for incomes in the industrial sector.  That was indicated in the NIEC report.  If the projected increase of 3½ per cent in our economic growth is valid, and I believe it is, then, provided we can avoid a series of strikes, or prolonged strikes, the three per cent rate of incomes increase in the non-agricultural sector would also be a valid projection.  In the event, however, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions advised their constituent organisations to seek increases of up to £1.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite rightly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>That was endorsed by the Labour Court but that endorsement did not in any way invalidate the projection of 3½ per cent increase in our growth rate.  Neither did it invalidate the advice given by the NIEC that income increases ought to be within a 3½ per cent growth.  Nevertheless, the Labour Court in its advice specifically said that lower increases might be given in industries that could not afford the increase of £1 and, where the £1 increase was given, that efforts ought <Col N="2123" /> to be made by the workers to increase productivity in order to offset the increases that the £1 would represent over and above the 3½ per cent expected growth rate.  They also advised, as Deputy Larkin is aware, that the £1 increase might be taken in certain sectors in two instalments, one of 13/-now and one of 7/- later in the year.</P>
      <P>The court recognises in its statement that not every firm can afford the £1 per week increase.  However, the advice was given with these reservations but also in the knowledge that a series of strikes, a series of withdrawals of labour, a series of prolonged periods of decline in industrial and other production would have serious effects upon the economy as well.  It was in order to avoid these strikes that the court made that recommendation but imported into the recommendation the admonitions and qualifications to which I have referred.  These are not mine: these are the Labour Court's. These reservations by the Labour Court underline the necessity for a sense of responsibility and realism in our industrial relations.</P>
      <P>It is one thing to claim compensation for loss in the real value of money: nobody will blame any trade unionist for doing that.  However, too many claims nowadays are coming forward for the preservation of so-called status differentials.  I do not think anybody can deny that if claims like this are conceded for no reason other than that somebody else in another class has moved ahead, we shall find ourselves involved in another round of leapfrogging which only perpetuates the dissatisfaction which workers in different employments must logically feel and, therefore, nobody will want that experience again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said, in this leapfrogging, the only effect is to push up prices.  If the purpose is only to match somebody else who has succeeded in getting an increase or to maintain the differential as against somebody else, then we are only creating more inflationary trends and therefore putting up prices and achieving a situation that will solve nothing for us.  It was thinking like that that led me to ask the Dáil and the Seanad to set up a tribunal on <Col N="2124" /> clerical wage rates last November.  I realised that there was a certain amount of this status race going on between the different employments in the private and public clerical sectors and that it was setting a bad example and doing nobody any good, not even the clerical workers themselves, in the long run.  I was hoping that this tribunal would have reported by 1st March but I realised that I had given them a fairly substantial task in covering employments that involve 6,000 to 8,000 workers, employments in semi-State bodies and the Civil Service and outside it.  This included job evaluation.</P>
    <P>The tribunal has now completed its task and I was presented with the report last Friday.  I hope to lay it before the House to-morrow and it should be available for publication in the press of the country on Thursday.  I shall not comment on the report.  It is an objective report.  I shall not issue any statement with it.  The country, the workers involved and other workers whom the report will affect will have the opportunity of studying its contents.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is only in the sphere of industrial relations that we need to have this sense of responsibility at the present time.  It seems to be lacking in public life also.  Opposition Deputies complain on the one hand about the limitation of expenditure and on the other hand they advocate greater economies.  They ask for public capital investment to be increased and at the same time they object to borrowing from abroad even though they know that our home resources are not sufficient to meet the public capital programme as projected in the White Paper, much less the level of capital expenditure that the Deputies themselves would seem to desire.</P>
    <P>Deputy L'Estrange referred to a reduction in the amount of money being spent on the roads.  I am not denying nor could I deny that the increase in motor taxation this year is being used for Exchequer purposes. Nevertheless, the Road Fund, compared with last year and, with the same resources for income, is higher this year.  Last year, £9.4 million was paid into the Road Fund.  The amount paid for 1966/67, at pre-Budget rates <Col N="2125" /> of tax, is estimated at £9.75 million. Therefore, there will be available for expenditure on the roads an increase of some £350,000 this year.</P>

      <P>Similarly, complaints have been made about the expenditure on housing.  As I have said and as the Minister for Local Government has said on a number of occasions, the expenditure on housing this year is greater than it ever was.  It is no harm for Deputies to be referred to the figures as they are.</P>
      <P>In 1961-62, the figure for local authority housing, including the SDA loans, was £11.96 million.  That rose gradually through 1962-63, £13.45 million; 1963-64, £16.25 million; 1964-65, £19.39 million; 1965-66, £23.77 million and, this year, the provisional estimate is £24.38 million.  By and large, this has been the same story as far as our total capital programme is concerned.  The figure has been increasing very steadily over the past ten years or so.</P>

      <P>Deputy Sweetman, like many other Deputies, bemoaned the estate duty provisions of the Finance Act last year but he seems to cavil at the fact that whatever reliefs are being given are being made retrospective under the 1966 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>No, let us look at that again.  Even Deputy Booth did not seem to understand that benefits arising on death as a result of superannuation schemes have always been liable to estate duty.  There was a doubt as to the liability of benefits arising on death from non-contributory superannuation schemes, that is, liability to estate duty, but these were always liable&mdash;and so held&mdash;to succession duty which was more onerous than estate duty.  The Revenue Commissioners permitted people who had liabilities for such payments under non-contributory schemes to be taxed on the estate duty rather than the succession duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>To break the law?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  There was contention. The Revenue Commissioners believed they were liable to estate duty and even to succession duty but they were certainly liable to estate duty, but because the Revenue Commissioners believed they were liable to succession duty and estate duty, they gave the tax-payers <Col N="2128" /> the benefit of the more favourable rate of taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>But if they believed they were liable to both, they should have paid both.  That does not hang.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a question of being charged both; it was one or the other and I think that, quite rightly, they gave the person liable the benefit of the more favourable rate from that person's point of view.  What happened last year was that it was highlighted, possibly for the first time in this House, that persons who were in receipt of benefits arising on death in respect of which they had no enforceable right were considered to be free from payment of death duty in respect of these amounts, the theory being, of course, that they may not have got them, that the deceased might have changed his mind or something else might have happened but the most notable class was the civil servants whose pension scheme or superannuation benefits are at the will and pleasure of the Government and in respect of which civil servants have no right of enforcement.</P>
      <P>There was general agreement on all sides of the House that this obligation should extend to everybody and it was to meet the general wish of the House, and not subject to the whim of Deputy de Valera, that I introduced a section in the Bill this year in order to do this.  What I want understood first is that death benefits were always liable to duty.  There was a doubt as to which death duty, whether estate duty or succession duty, benefits arising from contributory schemes were liable, but benefits arising out of non-contributory circumstances were not considered to be liable and now they are.</P>

      <P>I want to get back to Deputy Sweetman who alleged that we were avoiding debates on public issues in this House and certainly on economic issues.  He said that the object of the Government was to avoid discussion on the economy of the country. I suggest that never in the history of Dáil Éireann has there been more discussion in open forum on the economic position of the country.  The fact is, of course, that the Government have no desire to avoid such discussion.  I should like to remind the Deputy that the House has had five major debates up to this on the general economic situation over the last ten months.  If I exclude the Budget debate last year, <Col N="2131" /> we had the debate in July, 1965, on the economic situation through the medium of the Taoiseach's Estimate and the Prices Bill.  In November, 1965, we had a general debate on the economic situation.  In January, 1966, we had a debate on the Free Trade Area Agreement which introduced to a large extent a general economic debate.  In January/February, we had the debate on the Report of the NIEC on the economic position and the debate to which I am now replying is the sixth such debate since last July.  I cannot understand how any Deputy from the other side of the House can say, as Deputy Sweetman said, that the object of the Government is to avoid discussion on the economic position of the country.</P>

In any event, Deputy Sweetman knows well that Ministers are invited all over the country and from his experience in his own time, he will accept that they have to refuse about three out of every four invitations they get and it is not easy to think up something new to say at all these dinners, chambers of commerce meetings and other functions.</P>

Let me not criticise Deputy Dillon for what he did ten years ago while he is criticising us for doing the same thing during the intervening ten years but I would say, to Deputy Dillon's credit, that he showed to some extent a sense of realism in the course of this debate by making a helpful suggestion in regard to this whole question of non-relief of income tax for medical expenses.  While Deputy Dillon did not absolve me for not creating such relief, even though no other Minister for Finance has done it since the State came into being, he did recognise that people have not taken sufficient advantage of the Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme and he encouraged me to give it whatever publicity I could.  I certainly would like to endorse what he said and to publicise the very excellent facilities offered by the Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme.</P>

      <P>In particular, I should like to direct the attention of the tax-payers to the fact that they are entitled to have payments made under this <Col N="2133" /> scheme taken into account in connection with income tax relief.  Deputy Sweetman himself possibly did that and I acknowledge it as something worth while doing.  I am only acknowledging what Deputy Dillon says, that the attention of the public ought to be directed to this relief.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, I cannot relieve Deputy Dillon of something of which I accuse Deputies generally &mdash; these extravagant statements about the condition of the economy.  Statements such as Deputy Dillon has been making, that the country is going downhill fast, that the country is &ldquo;bust&rdquo;&mdash;are not destined to help the economy. They do the country grave damage, even though I believe it is not the intention of the Deputies who make such statements to do the country damage in the long term but they make them for the purpose of narrow political advantage.  They make these statements in the House when they know quite well that the contrary is the case. The making of extravagant criticisms like these, unsupported by facts, which members of the Opposition indulge in rather freely, inside the House and elsewhere, can do nothing but damage.  I have indicated at the start of my speech that the recovery has commenced: our balance of payments has improved; our balance of trade has improved&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Before progress was reported last week, I had been discussing the purchase of land by land bonds and commenting on the unfairness of such a system.  I instanced a particular case in my constituency to indicate clearly to the Minister and the House that the system is one that calls for review.  In putting forward this case, I was not in any way indicting the Minister for any neglect of duty or, indeed, for any infringement so far as his office is concerned.  I was merely citing a case that called for rectification, among any others of a similar nature there may be.  that is the spirit in which I brought forward this particular case.  As I mentioned on the previous day I have no doubt the Minister will take steps to rectify the position without delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of the purchase of land is a very important one because if the schemes envisaged by the Land Commission are to be implemented land must be obtained and it is desirable and essential that the Land Commission should project the best image possible so far as the purchase of land is concerned. The land bonds system is not one that appeals to people who have land for sale.  The best way to <Col N="2135" /> meet this situation is to pay for land in cash.  The 1965 Land Act gives power to buy land for cash other than land sold at public sales.  I understand that prior to the 1965 Act only land purchased at public sales could be paid for with cash.  Land bonds would be in order if there were not this big element of gambling about them and the people were sure that £100 in land bonds would be equivalent to £100. Mark you, as I mentioned previously in the case I mentioned to the House, this woman was told: &ldquo;You will be paid in land bonds to the equivalent value of £11,000&rdquo; which is very different from being told that she was being paid for the holding in £11,000 land bonds.</P>
    <P>When this issue of land bonds about which I am talking was created in 1964 there were comments in the House from the Minister and from a number of Deputies about them. These comments are contained in the Official Reports for June 10, 1964, in Volume 210, at columns 1019 to 1029. Everybody was anxious to ensure that land bonds would hold their value and that the people who sold land for land bonds would get as near par as possible.  This is what Deputy Sweetman had to say:</P>
    <P>It would be desirable if in future issues of land bonds two things were borne in mind in so far as possible.  First, it would be utterly impossible to have any goodwill for the Land Commission unless the rate of interest were so fixed that the value of the bonds was slightly over rather than slightly under par.</P>
    <P>Here is the Minister's comment in regard to the six per cent series:</P>
    <P>This current series, at all events, is satisfactory so far as our experience goes and the prospects for the future of this series appear to me to be good.  I am not quite sure&mdash; I would not commit myself now&mdash; but I do not believe, offhand, that there is power at law to do what Deputy Sweetman has suggested, that is, to have the issue of bonds at a premium or at a discount.</P>
    <P>I am taking these quotations at random.  In regard to the question <Col N="2136" /> of turning bonds into money, we had a further statement from Deputy Sweetman arising from his experience in his profession which is the same as the Minister's:</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister has ever had the experience, as I have had, professionally, of getting some of this small issue of land bonds transferred to us in payment for costs in a Land Commission sale.  In these small issues, it is very often a matter of waiting for a very long time to get a purchaser if one wants to sell...</P>
    <P>That was Deputy Sweetman's experience in regard to land bonds, that it is very difficult to get a purchaser if you want to sell them.  This is what we are trying to pay the people with who are selling land.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister brought in the question of the element of luck attached to bonds.  He referred to the fixed interest security of bonds and then said:</P>
      <P>I know this is not the real answer but it is partly the answer at all events, and there is, as the Deputy knows, a draw for land bonds and whoever has these bonds and they come out of the hat and he is lucky enough to get them, gets the full value.</P>
      <P>That is a peculiar line-up, that if you are lucky enough and they come out of the hat, you get paid.  This is a gambling system and you cannot win. Land bonds are never more than £100, they are never above par, but at the present this particular issue is very much below par.  The Minister continued:</P>
      <P>I do not know whether the Deputy was lucky in that transaction or not at any time but it is only, of course, a percentage of these people who are lucky enough to get full value for these depreciated bonds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is only right and just, so far as this House is concerned, and much as we like to help and co-operate in the purchase of land to relieve congestion, that we should realise our obligation to make this known to the people <Col N="2137" /> whose lands are being acquired, either by compulsion or through free sale, because rural people are not conversant with market fluctuations.  Land bonds are entirely different from Government stock.  When a person buys Government stock, he does so on his own account and he is not forced to do so.  It is his duty to acquaint himself beforehand with any risks that are likely to confront him.  He knows that there is a likelihood that the stock will drop in value and he takes that risk, having regard to the interest available and so on.  He does that with his eyes open but farmers and landowners are not conversant with market fluctuations of bonds.  The usual way of approaching the question, so far as my knowledge goes, is that people are told: &ldquo;We will give you land bonds to the equivalent value of £1,000.&rdquo; If you say to the average landowner that you will pay him in land bonds equivalent in value to £1,000, he will say to you: &ldquo;What are these land bonds?  Can I turn them into cash straightaway?&rdquo; Invariably he is told: &ldquo;You will get land bonds to the equivalent value of £1,000.&rdquo;  The only interpretations a person can put on that is that the land bonds are worth £1,000.</P>
    <P>When the 1964 Land Bond Bill was before the House, the Minister rightly expressed concern that the bonds should be kept at par, or as near to it as possible.  The Minister's anticipations in that regard were fulfilled until the summer of 1965 when there was a sharp decline in the value of land bonds.  Everybody knows that this restriction of credit commenced during the summer of 1965.  As a result there was a limited market for land bonds and they dropped in value by as much as ten per cent.  That is a much bigger reduction than the Minister anticipated when these bonds were created in 1964. I am claiming in view of that sharp reduction, coming about without notice, so to speak, there is an obligation on the Minister to step in and compensate the owners of these bonds for the big losses they have suffered.</P>

      <P>Would that require legislation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I am not <Col N="2138" /> anticipating any legislation.  In the 1965 Act the Minister is empowered to pay for land with cash.  There is no longer any need to buy land with land bonds.  I am sure the Minister can avail of the existing legislation to rectify this position.</P>
      <P>The particular case I referred to here the last day is different from the cases that would come under the heading I have just mentioned.  I made the claim that as far as this particular west-Cork case is concerned the lands should not have been vested at all in February, 1965, if the title was not in order or if there were some outstanding matters to be cleared up.  Then, if they were not vested, the Minister in the meantime had created a new seven per cent land bond issue and this case would come within the scope of that issue.  I asked the Minister questions in the House in December, 1965, about the fall in the value of land bonds.  He told me he was issuing a new series of land bonds to cover outstanding cases where vesting had not taken place. These land bonds were subsequently issued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to take up some more time of the House in specifically referring to the case I mentioned here the last day.  I feel it incumbent on me as a Deputy for the constituency to press for compensation for Mrs. McCarthy or any other person within the State who finds himself in a similar position.  The facts are clear-cut and without contradiction.  In view of land requirements for Land Commission work and afforestation in the future, we must project a fair and reasonable image of the Department of Lands.  In the course of a letter from the Minister, which I mentioned the last day and which I do not wish to refer to at length again, he gave the reasons for the delay in making the bonds available&mdash;the possibility that rates were due to the county council, evidence as to whether lay tithes were payable on the land, letter from the estate duty office for the amount, if any, claimed for death duties and copies of folios to be written up.  If there was any difficulty in the title, the Minister or his agents were completely wrong in vesting that land in themselves in February, 1965.  They had no legal right <Col N="2139" /> to do so.  If, on the other hand, all these items had been cleared up or were of little concern and had nothing to do with the vesting of the land, the bonds should have been available to this woman on the date indicated in the letter of 20th February, 1964, which informed her that land bonds representing the purchase money would be put to her credit when possession was taken.  It now appears the Department of Lands are making the case that the title was not proved in February, 1965, when the vesting took place.  If this matter was not closed in February, 1965, then it would have been delayed and the new issue of seven per cent bonds would have covered the case, which would never have come to this House.</P>
    <P>I want to repeat what is actually involved in this.  The Land Commission went along to this woman to buy one of the best farms of land in west Cork.  On it were innumerable building sites that could have been sold at very high prices.  In 1964 or early 1965, there was no mention whatever of the credit squeeze.  We never heard anything about it until June, 1965.  They went along and more or less indicated to this woman that, whether she liked it or not, they were going to take this land from her and her four children because for two years she had let the land. Then, thinking there was no use going against a Government Department and that whether she liked it or not, she would have to part with the lands, she agreed to take from the Land Commission land bonds to the equivalent value of £11,000.  She has herself indicated quite clearly to the Minister that that was the bargain that was struck, land bonds to the value of £11,000.</P>
    <P>Now this farm has been taken away from her possession since 1st February, 1965, and that woman and her family have not received one brown penny from the Minister, from the Commission or from anyone else. If the Minister feels she has got too much for it or if he is in any doubt about its value, this woman is quite prepared to call off the deal and keep <Col N="2140" /> her farm and let the Minister keep his bonds and his money, as anyone would be who has been waiting for money for more than 16 months.</P>
    <P>I do not want to delay in covering ground I covered here last week, but I feel very strongly about this.  I want to summarise the matter briefly: first, the bonds have lost in value £1,265; secondly, if this farm had been sold privately, the accrued interest would possibly be another £1,000 on the amount of money, taking the current lending rate of seven per cent into account.  Therefore, it is quite true to say that this woman has been out approximately £2,250.  Surely the Minister is not going to defend that action here in the House?  When he is replying, I hope and expect that he will acknowledge the justification of this woman's claim and compensate her accordingly.</P>

      <P>What special rights have the Land Commission over and above private individuals?  It is no harm for many people up and down the country who may be selling land to the Land Commission to know all the facts and to know the difficulty they may encounter in being paid for it.  Let us assume for one moment that the Minister is correct, that he got no title to this land, how did the Land Commission take possession of the land, vest it in themselves and retain it since without paying a penny for it? To my mind, that is not a businesslike way of approaching a question such as this.  It is an unfair way, and at the outset I mentioned the grievances of people caught in this credit squeeze of 1965 or caught in the reduction of bonds.  I am not making any charge against the Minister.  I am stating facts here with a view to getting the position rectified.  I feel the Minister is bound morally and I would say&mdash;and I am not a legal man&mdash;legally to compensate this person.  However, I cannot understand how it is that if the title is not in order a body, such as the Land Commission can take over land and vest it in themselves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I know, but it is a striking point, and here is something that follows it: if the title is not in order or if proper title is not forthcoming, then this person cannot go through with the sale to the Land Commission and the sale should fall through.  Is that not the obvious outcome if that is the position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have gone into this case in detail in order to bring to the notice of the House and the country the position <Col N="2142" /> that obtains in regard to these bonds. I have indicated that the position which obtained last year never obtained before, that is, that in the course of a few months, the value of land bonds reduced by more than ten per cent. That is the main cause of the trouble, and that position never obtained since the land bonds were first created in 1925, that there was such a sharp reduction in so short a time.</P>
    <P>I am hopeful that the Minister will give fair and just consideration to the facts of this case as I have set them out here.  I have no doubt that if he does so, he will come to only one conclusion, that this is a justifiable case.  Once he comes to that conclusion, he is bound to take action on it and, similarly, if there are any other such cases existing, as I am sure there are in other parts of the country, the Minister is obliged to take the same action in regard to them.  I believe that no member here could stand up and say it was wrong for the Minister or for the Land Commission to take that action.</P>
    <P>If the Land Commission are to succeed in their work&mdash;and I do not think they can succeed in reaching the target that has been set for them of providing our uneconomic holders with economic holdings of from 40 to 45 acres&mdash;we must consider how the land is to be provided.  How could land be secured to provide the big number of uneconomic holders with the requisite amount of land, when possibly more than 60 per cent or almost two out of every three holdings can be deemed to be uneconomic?  To do so you would have to take at least one-third of the holdings and divide them among the neighbouring landowners in order to bring them up to the target mark set by the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>There are great demands on the Land Commission at the present time. For a variety of reasons, sentimental and otherwise, people were reluctant to avail of the exchange of holdings schemes some years ago.  That position no longer obtains.  Ther are in many parts of this country&mdash;in West Cork we have a substantial number of uneconomic holdings &mdash; people clamouring to the Land Commission <Col N="2143" /> to provide them with an exchange of holding.  They are anxious to leave because their present holdings are not economic.  I know well that of the number of applications which will be approved, at least twenty times that number will be rejected.  In my estimation, at the present time, and taking my own locality into account the Land Commission are not catering for one in 20 of the applications they get &mdash;applications from people who fully comply with all the qualifications for exchange of holdings.  It is only natural that the number of applications should grow and grow sharply, because undoubtedly the number of holders who have been transferred from West Cork did very well indeed.  There is no doubt about that.  I visited some of the holdings to which they were transferred and, indeed, they have every reason to be grateful to the Land Commission.  They got holdings in every way far superior to those they left and, in my opinion, some of these holdings are, in value, at least ten times as great as the holdings they gave to the Land Commission.  It is of course a great advantage to those people to be removed from an uneconomic holding and put into a sound economic one with a dwellinghouse and a suitable range of outhouses.</P>
    <P>It would, indeed, be a great blessing if we could do that for the thousands of applicants we have but, unfortunately we cannot do so.  We cannot do it, no matter how much we would like to because we have not the resources. Therefore, I entirely agree with the efforts the Land Commission are making, in so far as they can, to transfer people from uneconomic to economic districts.  The farms they leave behind them help, to some extent, in making the neighbouring holdings economic.</P>
    <P>I know there is a big outcry in so far as some people are concerned&mdash; both in Church and State&mdash;against the flight from the land, and against this transfer of people from the uneconomic districts.  Some people feel it is inadvisable to reduce still further the population of these districts but, having regard to all the circumstances, I certainly could not blame any farmer, <Col N="2144" /> who was lucky enough to have his application for a Land Commission holding approved, for leaving the particular uneconomic district and transferring to another where an economic holding will be available to him.</P>
    <P>On this question I should like the Minister to indicate clearly to the House what essential qualifications are taken into account in approving applications for exchange of holdings. The number of applications must be very big in proportion to the number allowed.  What are the qualifications? Is everything fair and above board or, as some of his Party would give people to understand, are applications based on political qualifications?  I am not sure that is the case.  I am not saying it is the case but I am saying that some of his own people give applicants to understand that unless their applications come under favourable notice to the Land Commission they have no hope of being approved.  I am sure the Minister will kill that assertion because it is unfair to the Land Commission inspectors who have a big and difficult job to do.  They have to work under political patronage whether they like it or not.  I am mentioning it as a matter of public interest and as a matter with which I hope the Minister will deal when replying because I am not satisfied, despite all that has been said, that there are any grounds for this assertion.  I attribute it more to a small party down in the country trying to get kudos for something without justification.  I am not taking it too seriously but I should like the Minister to refer to it in his reply.</P>
    <P>I should like to comment for a few minutes under Subhead 1.  The reason I do so arises from an interjection of Deputy Kitt on the last day That I was against creating additional employment. The only additional employment I mentioned at the time, in the Minister's two Votes, was that the inspectorate staff had been increased.  But what do we find?  We find that the pattern which prevails in other Departments so far as redundancy is concerned, redundancy of the ordinary manual worker, is also to be found in this Estimate on Lands.  The Minister indicates the importance of works <Col N="2145" /> covered by Subhead I which he says include:</P>
    <P>... the erection of dwellinghouses and out-offices; the provision of access roads; fencing and drainage; provision of water supply for domestic and stock requirements; turbary development; repair and maintenance of embankments.</P>
    <P>He goes on to say:</P>
    <P>Subhead I is invariably a popular debating sector in the Lands Vote. Last year, the amount provided under Subhead I was £900,000 ...</P>
    <P>This has come down this year by, I understand, approximately £295,000. As far as employment is concerned, it is a very important sector of that particular Vote because we are told in the Minister's statement that employment was given to some 630 men.  Therefore, I am assuming, when there is a reduction of more than 30 per cent in this particular Subhead, that more than 250 men will lose their employment as a result.  It is something which should concern all Members of this House very deeply that under one Subhead alone, the probability is that at least 250 men will lose employment. If Deputy Kitt were here, I would say to him that so far as employment is concerned under this Estimate, the picture is not a very rosy one.</P>
    <P>Looking through the Estimate, I see a sum of £45,000 to buy land in 1966 on a national basis.  What in the name of heaven does the Minister think he would get for £45,000?  About 14 or 15 small holdings at £3,000 each.  To say in the national Parliament that we are allocating a sum of £45,000 to buy holdings is a good one.</P>

      <P>There is another matter to which I should like to refer while I am dealing with lands. When the Land Commission acquire land it should be divided without undue delay.  On 2nd February, 1966, the Minister gave me particulars of holdings in the hands of the Land Commission in County Cork.  We find that the Land Commission have had one place with 63 acres since 1st February, 1961.  In the second place they have had 155 acres since 20th March, 1962. In the third case they have had 324 acres since 5th December, 1962.  In the fourth case they have had 87 acres since 13th May, 1963, and so on.</P>
      <P>What is the need for holding on to that land and letting it out in grazing for a number of years after it has been acquired by the Land Commission? Why not divide it there and then?  It is bought for subdivision among local congested holders, and why keep them in suspense for up to three years on average, before dividing the land?  I said during previous debates on the Minister's Estimate that land could be divided inside four or five months, or half a year at the longest.  I have advocated that the best way to divide land is for the inspector, when his recommendations are available, to call together all the landowners who are interested in the division and explain to them publicly what his recommendations are.</P>
      <P>I also feel that more power should be vested in the local inspector&mdash;the man going around and meeting these people and with a knowledge of the position&mdash;than is vested in him at present. His answer now is: &ldquo;I did all I could.  The only power I have is to make recommendations to Dublin. Unless the Dublin people approve what I have recommended I have no power.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I think better division would result if the type of scheme I have advocated were implemented. The inspector could possibly get the co-operation of four or five farmers who would benefit, to hand over some of their own lands for resettlement. If there were four farmers who would benefit by a particular holding being acquired, and if there was a system whereby five holdings could be handed over to the Land Commission, all the land could be divided into five different allotments. That would lead to an adjustment of boundaries.</P>
      <P>We all know how mixed land can create difficulties amongst neighbours. There have been law cases about trespass. These are factors the Land Commission should take into account, and do away with rights of user, and boreens, and so on, which lead to friction, and have lead to friction in rural Ireland down through the years. It is pleasing to note that the present generation are more sensible and that we do not have as many law cases as we have had in the past over this difficulty of mixed land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a primary function of the Land Commission to try to make holdings as compact as possible.  They should co-operate with the local people who are anxious to draw new boundary <Col N="2148" /> lines.  The Minister seems to think that this is ridiculous but I am a firm believer in my assertion that the best way to divide land is to bring together all the local people and have the inspector speak to them in his official capacity as an agent of the Land Commission, a body set up to be independent and impartial and to act fairly and impartially towards all applicants. I do not see any danger so far as the inspector is concerned if that could be brought about.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is any need for me to delay any longer on the Lands side of the Estimate.  As I mentioned, the Minister had his own difficulties. He has had to be content with a reduction of £259,000.  I am sure he made the best effort possible to impress on the Government and the Minister for Finance that the Estimate should be held at the same figure as last year, but due to the shortage of capital and the times in which we live, he had to be satisfied with this reduction.  I do not want to go back on the land bonds again but I am sure the Minister will tell us in his closing statement that land bonds will be in plentiful supply to offset the reduction so far as land purchase is concerned.</P>
    <P>When we come to deal with the Second Estimate, unfortunately we find the position is very black and the outcome is anything but rosy.  The Minister said:</P>
    <P>Turning to the Forestry Vote there is a nett decrease of £204,200 in the amount being provided as compared with the Vote for 1965-66.</P>
    <P>That sum of £204,200 is a significant percentage decrease in the Estimate because you must take side by side with this reduction of £204,200, the position that obtains at the present, that is, that costs of all kinds are increasing and naturally forestry workers will be getting an increase.  I am sure the increase will be dated from 1st April, that is, covering the current year, so taking into account the decline of £204,200 in the Estimate, together with the increased cost in all Departments, and an increase in the wages bill, there is bound to be a big reduction in the turnover of that seccreasin <Col N="2149" /> tion of the Minister's Department in the current year.</P>
    <P>I must give credit to the Minister for making no secret of this.  He tells us the reduction will be big.  Later on in his statement, he states that he must reduce the acreage for planting this year by more than 5,000.  The plantable target for this year is the lowest for a number of years.  It stands at 20,000 acres.  The last available figures we had from the Forestry Department show that the output stood at 25,935 so here is a reduction of almost 6,000 acres against the year ending 31st March, 1964, in the area to be planted.</P>
    <P>I believe the Minister should not have allowed that position to arise.  I know very well the money problems which the Government have at present but taking into account the fact that this reduction will have its effect, and possibly to a greater extent than indicated by the Minister, on employment in the Department, I believe the Minister had a justifiable case to put before the Minister for Finance and the Government as to why there should not be a reduction in the Forestry Estimate. Forestry in many parts of this country is giving good employment, even though the wage rates are not high. Unfortunately, forestry workers, in comparison with what people in other much softer jobs are earning, are getting very poor wages.  Forestry workers have to be out in wind and weather.  They have a hard and difficult job to do and in most cases they are working on a piecework basis. Their average earnings are not more than £9 a week.</P>
    <P>We all agree that a wage of £9 at present is scarcely sufficient for a single man, not to mind a man with a wife and family to support.  I am sure the statistics available to the Minister indicate that on an average forestry workers do not earn more than £9 weekly.  The Minister must agree that with increased costs that is a very small wage indeed.  I would say at this stage that there is undoubtedly an obligation on the Minister to address himself to this question of the wages of forestry workers.  I am sure that if he does so, he will be satisfied that they are entitled to an increase.  I am sure <Col N="2150" /> they will not be looking for an increase retrospective to 1963 or 1964.  They would be satisfied if they got the increase possibly from 1st January, 1966.</P>
    <P>Many people in rural Ireland, despite the smallness of forestry workers' wages, are very happy to have that work, because they do not have to emigrate.  It is a regrettable feature of the Minister's statement that he had to indicate that there will and must be a reduction in the number of workers employed.  I had a letter two weeks ago from three workers who had been employed for nine or ten years on the West Cork afforestation scheme who got notice that their services were no longer required.  I want to make a special appeal here to the Minister that if, as a result of the reduction in money and the squeeze that is being put on the Minister by the Government and the Minister for Finance the number of workers must be reduced, cognisance should be taken of the service of those old-established employees of the Forestry Department.  It is completely out of place to say to such old-established workers that we now have no further use for their services and they must go.  That is wrong.  If there is to be some cutting down, it should be done under some other head and if at all possible those long-standing employees of the Department should be continued in employment.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that there must be unemployment because we have not enough money to employ the 5,000 workers we had last year and some workers must of necessity be let go. If that position obtains, the best way, in fairness, to meet that situation is to say that the last man in is the first man out.  If he does that, those old-established employees will still remain in their jobs.</P>
    <P>On the question of the acquisition of land for afforestation, the Minister told us he purchased 21,645 acres last year.  That was more than enough to meet his requirements, having regard to the marked reduction in planting. He told us that expenditure during the year totalled £115,822 and covered the purchase of 486 individual lots.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2151" /> He went on:</P>
    <P>The productive area acquired was only slightly over 18,000 acres and was, I regret to say, the lowest annual intake of productive lands since 1956-57.  Experience during the past year shows increasing difficulty in maintaining an adequate intake of plantable land and the prospects of improvement in the current year are not so bright.</P>
    <P>Since the days when Deputy Blowick was Minister for Lands, I have been warning the Department in this respect and the position obtains more so today than ever before.  The Department do not pay a reasonable price for land for afforestation purposes.  The payment made last year was at the rate of £5 7 per acre.  In present day money values there is no justification for paying such a low price.  It is no wonder there is such difficulty in obtaining land.</P>
    <P>It may be asserted that some of the land is located in remote districts, but taking into account that the land could be utilised for sheep grazing and for the grazing of certain types of cattle, there is no justification for an average price of £5 7 per acre, no matter to what use the farmers would put the land.  Surely the land would be worth more to them utilised in any other way than selling it to the Department at the average price paid last year?  Neither is there justification for imposing a limit of £10 per acre on the price that may be paid for land for afforestation.  The Department's agents, I understand, may not pay more than £10 per acre.  Am I correct? Would the Minister mind answering me?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I should prefer to answer the Deputy generally when I am replying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister may not be sure.  This limit of £10 per acre should be removed.  It may be said that the Minister's agents are doing a good job in this respect and that they deserve commendation.  I suppose their job is to buy up land for afforestation as cheaply as they can <Col N="2152" /> get it but unfortunately what is happening is that much of the land the Department have purchased came from farmers in difficult financial circumstances.  They were forced, through lack of funds, to sell portion of their land to the Department in order to acquire some capital to develop the remainder of their holdings.  That has happened in numerous cases.</P>
      <P>The number of people who will do that is decreasing and consequently in the future the Minister will find it more difficult to acquire land for afforestation.  From my knowledge of a number of transactions between the Minister and landowners throughout the country, the Minister has come out well.  He has got the land in most cases for what, in my opinion, was less than the market value.  I am not finding fault with this in any respect.  It is the job of his officials to get the land as cheaply as possible, but, as I have said, they have got the land in many cases from people forced by circumstances to sell.</P>
      <P>Now, Sir, there should be a reasonable income from a sale of timber by the Department.  A number of earlier plantations are maturing and one would think that there should be a sizeable income from them.  I do not think the Minister mentioned last year's income in his statement.  I understood that the income to the Department from sales from plantations reached the £¾ million mark two years ago and possibly it should be in or around the £1 million mark now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The desirability of processing that timber, if at all possible, in the area where it is grown was mentioned by Deputy Flanagan.  That would be an added advantage in so far as employment is concerned and possibly it would be processed as cheaply there as, if not more cheaply than in the city or large urban districts.  That is a matter the Minister should keep in mind.  At the present time I think the Department sell the growing timber to buyers on the spot and as a result there is little or no local employment in the felling or haulage of that timber because these buyers bring in their own <Col N="2153" /> men from cities and towns.  Therefore, the employment for local workers is negligible.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude on the forestry question, there is a question which has not been resolved so far.  It relates to extending the five day week to the winter months.  Seeing that other workers have it all the year round, I think that, if at all possible, it should be extended to the forestry workers to cover the full year.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to impress on the Minister again that my remarks here on land bonds and all they entail were a factual appraisal of the position and I am reminding the Minister, before I resume my seat, to treat the particular case I cited, and any other similar cases, fairly and sympathetically.  I am in no way indicting the Minister or holding him responsible for the position obtaining.  But seeing that it has obtained and seeing that something that never happened before happened in 1965, so far as the depreciation of land bonds is concerned, I leave it to the Minister's bounden duty to see to the position and rectify it, when he has satisfied himself, as no doubt he will, of the justice of the claim I have made here.  I do not think there is any point in labouring the matter further and I do hope the Minister will accept my criticism of the system of buying land by land bonds in the spirit in which I put it forward: that it is something which I considered essential to bring to the notice of the House and the Minister with a view to improving the general picture so far as land bonds are concerned and with a view to projecting a more favourable image of land bonds and the purchase of land through land bonds to the general public and particularly to the many people who may be selling land to the Land Commission in the immediate future.</P>
    <P>Land bonds have not projected a favourable image.  There is too much of a gamble attached to them and we should not ask our people, when they are buying land bonds, to take a gamble so far as the fluctuation of prices of land bonds are concerned.  If we have no liquid cash to meet the purchase of our land requirements and if <Col N="2154" /> we are to continue buying land through the medium of land bonds, there is an obligation on us to ensure that the price of the bonds does not fluctuate. I should like to put that forcibly and strongly to the Minister and I have no doubt that when the Minister is replying, I shall be fully satisfied that he is taking proper steps to meet the situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I put down three questions on Wednesday, 4th May, 1966, to the Minister for Lands about the division of an estate in my locality.  I gave notice to the Ceann Comhairle that I would raise the matter on the Adjournment because I was not satisfied with the reply I received to my questions. The Ceann Comhairle said he would communicate with me later and he did so.  Members of his staff came to me and I found that I would have been limited to certain aspects by raising the matter on the Adjournment either on that night or the following week.</P>
      <P>In view of the fact that the Land Commission Estimate was coming up, I said I would leave it for discussion on the Estimate because the Ceann Comhairle advised me that I would have more scope in raising the matter then.  It is in deference to the wishes of the Ceann Comhairle and his office that I have left the matter until now.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to go over the whole matter again but the questions I put down are as follows.  The first one is that I</P>
      <P>asked the Minister for Lands if the policy of the Land Commission of late, as operated by the Land Commission Office, Galway, is to grant the tenants with the highest valuation adjoining an estate the greatest additions of land and those with small valuations and small holdings very small additions or none at all, as happened in the division of the former holding of Mr. Eddie Loughnane, Ballyara, Menlough, Ballinasloe, County Galway, and other similar holdings which were recently divided in East Galway.</P>
      <P>Question No. 15 in column 1213 of the Official Report of the 4th May, 1966, was to ask</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>the Minister for Lands if he will <Col N="2155" /> state, as regards the division of the former holding of Mr. Eddie Loughnane, Ballyara, Menlough, Ballinasloe, County Galway, by the Land Commission, the names of the allottees granted additions, the land valuations of each allottee prior to the division, and the Land Commission estimate of the value of the allotment granted to each of the allottees.</P>
    <P>I put great value on the third part of my question;</P>
    <P>the Land Commission estimate of the value of the allotment granted to each of the allottees</P>
    <P>as well as the land valuations of each tenant and the number of acres they got.  I can appreciate that 1,000 acres of a mountain can be given to a tenant and that it will be only worth, say, 1/-or 6d per acre, whereas five or six acres of good land would be much better value.  That is why I wanted that particular part of my question answered.</P>
    <P>The third question was:</P>
    <P>to ask the Minister for Lands if he will state, as regards the division of the former holding of Mr. Eddie Loughnane, Ballyara, Menlough, Ballinasloe, County Galway by the Land Commission, why two of the tenants adjoining the estate, namely Mrs. Mary Fahey and Tom Bellew, did not get additions even though their valuations were much smaller than those of other tenants who got substantial divisions on this holding.</P>
    <P>The Minister replied at length giving the valuations, which I knew myself, and which showed that my question was correct.  The tenant with the highest valuation of £27 3s got 21 acres and the tenant with the lowest valuation, a married man with five or six children, of £17 16s only got six acres.  In other words, the man with the highest valuation as you come down the ladder got the largest amount of land and the man with the lowest valuation got the smallest amount of land and so on until you came down to nothing.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2156" /> It was the most stupid division ever made, to my mind.  In this locality all the tenants were on the perimeter of this estate.  They were taking conacre on it from the former owners and some of them from the Land Commission since they acquired it a few years ago.  The division was just across the road from them and one man who got nothing at all was actually on the estate.  A schoolboy would have divided it by giving a division to each one across the road.  Mrs. Fahey's son who had land taken for six cattle got nothing at all; he is in the NFA and in the dairy business but is not married yet.  Mrs. Fahey has another son married with three children.  Mrs. Fahey's unmarried son was, in fact, about to buy the land but for the common good, he decided he would let the Land Commission take it because he was sure he would get some of it.</P>
    <P>There is another widow living half a mile away with her son and they gave her an allotment and Mrs. Fahey and her son were knocked out of it. It was divided on 20th January, 1966. I went in to the Galway office of the Land Commission the following Monday or Tuesday and brought Mrs. Fahey's son with me&mdash;that was before there was ever a stake or fence put down&mdash;to protest against what everybody said was an unjust division.</P>
    <P>The Dáil had adjourned, but the week after we met, towards the end of January, I went to the Minister's office with my colleagues, Deputies Carty and Millar, and we pointed this out again. We were supposed to hear something about it but, so far as I am concerned, I have heard nothing.  I decided on 3rd March, 1966, to write, and I wrote five letters of which I kept copies. When the Minister answered my questions, I quoted my letters and during the exchanges which followed the Minister's reply in column 1215, I said that I wrote to the two Land Commissioners, to the Secretary of the Land Commission, to the Chief Inspector and to the Deputy Chief Inspector.  One letter was addressed to the Secretary of the Land Commission, who is also a Commissioner, one to the Commissioner, who is a Roscommon man and, <Col N="2157" /> being from the west, I thought he might look into it, one to the chief inspector and one to the deputy chief inspector, whom the Minister appointed over the west.  The letter was written on 3rd March.  It reads as follows:</P>
    <P>I wish to protest in the strongest possible manner against the unjust division of the former holding of Eddie Loughnane, Ballyara, Menlough, Ballinasloe, County Galway, by the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>It has shocked the public conscience in the locality and all faith in the Land Commission has been lost in the area as a result.</P>
    <P>I enclose list of land valuations of the tenants surrounding it who got allotments and you will see that the tenant, John Collins, with the highest land valuation, £27. 3. 0., got the highest addition and the tenant with the lowest land valuation, Patrick Ryan, a married man with a young family, got the smallest addition, 5¾ acres.</P>
    <P>The Minister said six.  He did not get a full six because he signed for five acres, three roods and 20 perches.  That is what he told me.</P>
    <P>To make matters worse, the two tenants with the second lowest valuation got nothing at all, one Tom Bellew, whose lands are actually nearing it, land valuation £19 13. 0., and the other, Mrs. Mary Fahy and her son, Thomas, land valuation £18 2. 0., and who had land taken on it from the original owner, E. Loughnane, and who were in fact going to buy a portion of it from him prior to the Land Commission acquiring it but didn't do so for the common good.  Furthermore, Mrs. Fahy and her son, Thomas, had it taken in grazing from the Land Commission since it was acquired and now they have been evicted by the Land Commission and got no addition whatsoever and although he is a member of the NFA and has six cows grazing on it some of which he must now sell. The portion across the road from their house has been allotted to another widow and her son, Mrs. Mary Lally, who has been brought <Col N="2158" /> in from over ½ mile away and who already had a good holding with the land valuation of £21 10.0.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand what has happened and I am awaiting an explanation in the matter and, failing to get same, I'll have to raise it in Leinster House, which I intend to do if I have to have a Question down every week from now until the summer recess.</P>

    <P>Five copies of that letter were sent to the five people I have mentioned.  There must be a hierarchy of orders in the Land Commission.  From the Deputy Chief Inspector, I got the following reply on 14th March, a fortnight afterwards.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know what colonies we have abroad.  I do not know if the Chief <Col N="2159" /> Inspector was out dividing land, or what he was doing.  Perhaps he was looking after our migrants abroad.  I would be much better pleased if he or the Deputy Chief Inspector would come down to my constituency and investigate this unjust division of land. I tabled a question about this.  I have written letters.  I received replies from the Deputy Chief Inspector and from the Chief Inspector.  From the rest the silence of the tomb.  I did not even get an acknowledgment.  Perhaps they, too, were abroad looking after our migrants.  Perhaps the Minister has not given them enough staff to enable them to reply to Deputies from the west of Ireland who are looking after the interests of their constituents.  I have not been abroad very often but on the few occasions on which I have I have ensured that my constituents' letters are answered and that my work is looked after and I am neither half nor a quarter as well paid as these officials.  If they have not got enough staff, the Minister should provide it for them.</P>
    <P>I protest in the strongest possible manner, and I am speaking now on behalf of every Deputy, against the way in which I was treated.  I got two replies; one took a fortnight and the other six weeks.  From the rest the silence of the tomb.  I have a suspicion that it is not a question of shortage of staff.  I have a suspicion&mdash;it is more than a suspicion&mdash;that they have no answer to give me.  The only answer they could give is the one I have requested&mdash;a sworn inquiry or a thorough investigation into the division of this estate.  It is the talk of the place.  Everyone is asking why does someone not come down and look into it.</P>
    <P>I mentioned that one man got 21 acres and another got six.  I said the six might be as good as the 21.  But I asked here what value the Land Commission put on each allotment and the Minister got over his difficulty very nicelv indeed.  He did not give me the exact figures, but I happen to know them.  I will put them on the records. The people who got the allotments know them.  It is a simple sum to work <Col N="2160" /> out from the Minister's reply.  The average value per acre of these two allotments is estimated to be about 40 per cent of the average value of the other allotments.  Let us take the six acres, the lowest allotment, at £100 per acre; the person who got that got £600 worth of land.  If the 21 acres is worth 40 per cent, as the Minister stated here, on an average, he has got 21 times 40, which is £840.  Therefore the man with the highest valuation and with the biggest farm already gets 21 acres worth £840 and the man with the lowest valuation gets six acres worth £600, assuming that it is, as the Minister stated in his reply, sub-standard land.  But it is all the one field.  There are only 89 acres in it. Anybody could make eight or nine equal divisions of it and there would not be a question about it.</P>
    <P>I do not want to deny anyone anything but I cannot understand why the man with the highest valuation should have got £840 worth instead of only £200 or £300 worth and I demand that there will be a thorough investigation into this and the land be redivided justly and fairly.  The Minister may say that, once the division has taken place, it is finished and done with.  I raised the matter here before in relation to a holding of land which was divided in Bohill, Ballyforan, Ballinasloe, County Galway, and I was nearly ruled out of order.  Maybe I did go a bit outside the rules of order.  I did not know them as well then as I do now.  But we had the same Minister for Lands and I kept raising this matter week after week and I proved satisfactorily that the land had been unfairly divided.</P>
    <P>That land was redivided.  People who had not got additions the first time were given them on the subsequent redivision. What was done before can be done again.  It took me nearly 12 months, but it was done.  There was a controversy in the newspapers and I nearly lost my health.  But I fought it and I shall fight this until justice is done.  This is not an isolated case.  The same thing has happened in Newbridge, Ballinasloe, with the same inspector.  It has happened in the Gilmore Estate, Moylough.  It has happened in Clonbrock.  Deputy Millar had a question about a man who got 80 <Col N="2161" /> acres of land, a man who also had a shop.  But Deputy Millar did not pursue it.  It has happened in Tiaquin. They gave on old IRA man and his son two or three acres.  He had the lowest valuation in the place.  That seems to be the pattern.</P>
    <P>I think it is laid down in our Constitution that we should try to put as many families as possible on the land. That is what the people of the Land League fought for.  Our Constitution, too, which was enacted by the Irish people, specifies that we should put as many families on the land as possible. However, that will not happen if the Land Commission continue to act as they have been acting in my constituency of East Galway.  They are making the rich richer and some of the poor a little better off and leaving some of them as they are.</P>
    <P>I want to protest, and I think I have done it now, in the strongest possible manner about the division of this estate&mdash;and that was my principal reason in intervening in this debate.  I shall leave other matters to other Deputies.  When I asked permission to raise this matter on the Adjournment I said I would avail of the opportunity provided by this Estimate to make my protest.  I hope that the investigation and the inquiry I have sought will be undertaken and I think I am entitled to it in view of the replies I have read out here from the Land Commission and all the trouble I have gone to since 20th January last in an endeavour to ensure some semblance of fair play for these people.  I think I have now proved my case to the satisfaction of this House.</P>
    <P>I raised some political matter in this connection the last day but I am leaving that out now completely for the simple reason that, on justice and on the figures alone which I have quoted here, I think it will be obvious to everybody that a grave injustice has been done in the division of this estate and the same pattern is followed in the other instances I mentioned.  I asked if that was the policy of the Land Commission and the Minister has not given me a satisfactory reply about it.  I believe that, according to our Constitution, we should put as many families as possible on the land.  We should <Col N="2162" /> bring up the smaller people to the proper standards first.  People with higher valuations should get the lesser increases.  The matter should be evened out in a fair and equitable way.</P>
    <P>I want to compliment the Minister on the acquisition of a good amount of land and particularly on the arrangement he made with the Auctioneers' Association.  I believe that that was one of the reasons he got a good amount of land into the land pool for division in my constituency. We had a few big estates like the Smith estate which was recently divided and the big estate in Ballyglunin and they contributed to a large extent to the land pool and helped to relieve congestion in East Galway.</P>
    <P>The Minister had this to say, in the course of his speech:</P>
    <P>Special emphasis will be given to the direct allotment of additional land to bring smallholders up to the current family farm standard.  The provision of buildings does not generally arise in these cases and the usual range of estate improvements works&mdash;roads, fences and drains&mdash;will be carried through as far as practicable.</P>
    <P>An estate was divided in Fohenagh, the Clonbrock estate, linking the parish of Fohenagh and the parish of Caltra.  Some new houses are being erected.  I should like, in passing, to congratulate the Land Commission on the improved new buildings they are now putting up.  As usual, however, the job was not completed so far as the road going through that estate is concerned.  In the former division of this estate, they built a road from the Caltra side in through Pallas.  From the Fohenagh side, they have made it to connect with the other.  They have made the fences all right to make the road but the road is not there: nothing is there but a green field.  They compensated the person who gave the field to make that road.</P>
    <P>The Galway County Council, of which I am a member, have always taken over these roads that are constructed under the Rural Improvements <Col N="2163" /> Scheme or the Land Commission, and so on, when they are put into reasonable repair.  In this case, the road would serve houses on both sides of the estate.  It would be a short cut for going to fairs, Mass, and so on. However, there is one spot in the middle which is left unfinished and now it is nobody's baby.  When they started the job at all, the Land Commission should have finished it.  It would have given employment and resulted in useful work but the Land Commission spoiled it all by not completing the job.  I appeal to them to finish this road on that estate so that we in the Galway County Council will be able to take it over and maintain it.</P>
    <P>With these remarks, I shall conclude. Having proved successfully the injustice in relation to the estate I mentioned, I trust we shall have the inquiry which I have sought and that this estate will be redivided fairly and justly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephMcLoughlin" hpid="Mr. McLaughlin Mr. McLaughlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McLaughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I heard another Deputy speak about land bonds.  I think it only right for me to mention here that there are many people worried about this question of land bonds when it comes to disposing of a plot of land or even a big farm.  I might say that most people today ask: &ldquo;How do these land bonds work out? Do we get money for our farm or have we to wait?  What is the interest, and so forth?&rdquo;  It is easy to believe that people will sell their land to anybody before they will go bargaining with the Land Commission, not knowing how they will finish up and not knowing when they will get their money.  That is one aspect, I think, in relation to which the Land Commission should follow the same pattern as the Forestry Section as far as paying for land taken over is concerned.  Every Deputy has had that experience.  People come to me for advice and, as I have said before, they will do anything before they will go to the Land Commission. They will get rid of their land and try to sneak away quietly without anybody knowing anything about it.  Perhaps they will pay off a debt and go to England and have no delays attached to the disposal of the holding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2164" /> There is another problem also with which I am quite familiar in my own area.  As a matter of fact, I have gone to the Land Commission and corresponded with them, I suppose, five or six times within the past 18 months in relation to it.  I have in mind an aged farmer who lived on his own and then sold his farm, after long and careful consideration, to the Land Commission.  The Land Commission took over the farm and have set it. He dare not put a beast in on it but still he has not got any money.  I was at a meeting of a pensions committee and that poor man was more than glad to find out that he qualified for a pension. He asked me to contact the Department of Social Welfare so that they would let him have his pension book as soon as possible, as he needed it.  It is very hard that a person up to 70 years of age whose farm has been taken over must look for an old age pension book to keep him because he dare not put a beast in on the farm or let it but must wait until the Land Commission have everything straightened out.  I would sincerely ask the Minister to try to cut down on such delay and to give such people the attention they deserve.</P>
    <P>I remember that, when I first came into Dáil Éireann, I had before me the case of a man who had cycled 20 miles to see me because, although he had sold his farm to the Land Commission, he had not got his money for it.  This type of thing should not happen in 1966.  As public men, it is a fact that if we did not get our cheques for two months we should be inquiring about the delay.  Surely people who lived and worked all their lives on their farms, and then sold them to the Land Commission, are more than anxious to get their money?  It should happen in the same way as in the case of the Forestry Section&mdash;pay the money when the job is done.  A sum of £45,000 allotted, along with the price received sometimes for land taken over by the Land Commission, in the light of the present price of land, is a very limited sum for the purpose of enabling the Land Commission to buy land to enable people to be moved to better areas.  When administration costs and so on are <Col N="2165" /> deducted, it is insignificant and until we get away from that figure, we shall make no progress.</P>
    <P>Much has been said and written, and there have been long debates here, on the subject of land.  I suppose one of the longest debates in the House was the debate on the Land Bill.  I meet many people in the course of my work who ask what has the Land Bill meant.  I may be wrong but I tell them that I cannot see any change as a result of it.  I have come across hundreds of people who have seen a plot of land with the people who own it in England or America or in the occupation of people aged 70, 75 or 80.  These are the plots of land we were convinced would be taken over under the Land Act and given to deserving persons that want land and have homes nearby.</P>
    <P>I know of these because I put hundreds of these cases through my hands all along the sea coast in the west where we have very small uneconomic holdings.  In many cases, half the people are gone and the holdings are rented for many years.  In order to give land to people who are anxious to get additional land and who are continually approaching TDs and other public men, the Minister and the Land Commission should move more quickly and let the people see something being done to relieve congestion. I have no hesitation in saying that if such people do not get this land, they will move out as they cannot live in their present holdings with costs soaring each year.  These matters should be considered, and if action is possible under the Land Act, the Commission should make a beginning there, where there are nice plots of land and these are pointed out and it is recommended to the Land Commission by local representatives that something should be done.</P>
    <P>Instead, we are writing to Dublin and getting back stereotyped replies saying the man has applied or has not applied, that his case will be investigated in conjunction with those of other applicants.  That is all we hear unless we make further representations on behalf of these people.  That is the <Col N="2166" /> position in my constituency where many farms are small and uneconomic and there is a crying need for a rapid change if people are to be encouraged to stay.  If action is not taken soon, many homes will close owing to the present position which weather conditions are not improving.  I sincerely ask the Minister and the Land Commission to check on this situation themselves.</P>
    <P>Many holdings we bring to the notice of the Land Commission have been let for ten, 20 or 30 years, or are lying idle.  In fairness to the Land Commission, it must be said that they have realised that holdings previously provided in some cases were too small and now they are giving holdings of 40, 45 or 50 acres.  As my colleague, Deputy Kitt, said, we come across cases of the Land Commission dividing a substantial holding and giving a man with 45 acres another 12 or 14, while side by side with him is a hardworking, industrious farmer who perhaps has built a new house and good byres and who has only 22 or 23 acres.  That is very unfair because the man who has built up a good holding and held out so long on 22 acres should get another 12 or 14 acres, if he is to have any hope, leaving the man with 40 acres as he is.  The Land Commission should be very cautious in such cases of putting the man with 40 acres against the man with 22 acres.</P>
    <P>The Forestry Division find it hard to get land at present but they can blame themselves for that.  They can go five or six times to strike a deal with a farmer or widow and young family.  I think that is unfair in the case of people anxious to dispose of their small holdings.  If the forestry business is as profitable and productive as we are told it will be, there should be no question of going to a house to see what the owner will do and then having to go back to Merrion Street to see if you can bridge the gap between what John Brown wants and what the Department are prepared to give for the farm.  Some of the land is poor but generally it is good land, and where it will give good forestry, there should be no quibbling over £50 or £80.  Its acquisition will mean more employment and the land will be <Col N="2167" /> drained and so on.  The people leaving it must seek perhaps another farm and at £7 or £8 an acre, what can they get?  We should be fair to them as in most cases people who sell to the Forestry Division are the people who are unable to hold out on an uneconomic farm.  I hope the Minister will take note of that and of the other points I have mentioned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>In this debate we have had a most extraordinary divergence of views from all sides of the House.  I compliment Deputy Kitt on having the courage to say some of the things he said here tonight, even if I did not entirely agree with him as to the people against whom he directed his barbs.</P>
      <P>One of the mistakes we make in discussing this Estimate is that we tend to pick individuals and blame them for something that goes wrong.  After many years, I have been converted to the idea that it is the system that is wrong. If Deputy Kitt considers it extraordinary that somebody in his constituency got land to which he was not entitled, while people who were entitled to land did not get it, he should come with me to Meath where down through the years the same thing has happened again and again and again.  For a considerable period, I was under the impression that individuals in the Department, for some reason of their own, had decided that that should be done.  I am now perfectly convinced that there is something wrong with the system under which the officials work. If there were not something wrong and if there were not some direction, Land Commission officials would not carry on in the same unfair way for generation after generation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is quite a common story in Meath: A farm is being divided.  There may be a number of small farmers in the vicinity who have been taking grassland or tillage on that farm over a number of years.  There may be a number of workers who had worked on the farm and were dismissed when the farmer decided to sell the farm and who, therefore, do not come under the blanket of being employees of the farmer, entitled to consideration for <Col N="2168" /> either a holding or compensation. There may be a number of local people who, though having no land, have been attemping to build up a dairy herd or take tillage land.  One would think that when the farm was being divided first consideration would be given to these people.  Some of them, apparently by accident, do get a portion of land but most of them get neither an addition to a holding not a portion of the estate if they have no land.</P>
    <P>There is one case where a man had taken grass for a herd which he had built up over a number of years, although he had no land of his own. One farm on which he had been taking grass was taken over and divided.  He got none of it.  He moved to a second farm.  The same thing happened.  This year, he moved to a third farm and the Land Commission again put his stock out on the road and gave land to other people but gave none to him. The man was, to all intents and purposes, a dairy farmer, living by his industry.  Yet, the Land Commission decided that he was not entitled to land.  I put down a number of questions to the Minister for Lands on this occasion and on other occasions where something similar happened near Navan.  I can cite dozens of such cases.</P>
    <P>I do not know how the Minister reached the conclusion but he said that a man who made his living through taking grassland and building up a dairy herd was not a farmer.  He should tell some of the boys who were outside the gate last week and who were in that position that they were not farmers.  I do not think the Minister for Agriculture would agree with him. Whether he would agree with them or not, is another matter.  However, I do not think he would agree with the Minister for Lands that they were not farmers.  In my opinion, they are not only farmers but are industrious farmers.  The man I have in mind was able to rear a large family.  Yet, when land was being divided, not only in the case of one farm but in the case of three farms, he was told he was not entitled to land as he was not a farmer. This is the sort of thing which does not do any good for the name of the Land Commission.  It is obviously the system that is wrong because the same <Col N="2169" /> pattern has been followed down through the years.</P>
    <P>There is another question which I have mentioned so often in the House that I am sure it is a waste of time to mention it again, that is, the question of the local <i>versus</i> the migrant.  The Minister for Lands has told me again and again in this House that he considers that I am anti-migrant.  I want to assure him, as I did before, that when migrants come into my constituency we always make them welcome but we do not want to see any more coming, nor do the migrants who have come there over the years.  They are the first people to say that there is not enough land to go around, that they do not want any more people to come in. The people who come in after a couple of years say exactly the same thing. They are right.  A person who is living on an uneconomic holding or a person who has no land and wants a portion of land does not like to see more people coming and taking land which he had hoped to get, leaving him in the same position as he was in before the farm was divided.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect which should not be forgotten.  It is a matter affecting the whole area if ten or 12 families come to an area where there is not sufficient work available for young persons, where the only employment available is taken up by those already living in the area.  The new arrivals must emigrate.  Somebody must emigrate, because there are not sufficient jobs to go around.  I do not intend to dwell too long on this matter tonight because I have spoken on it many times over the past 12 or 14 years.</P>
    <P>I will admit that over the past 12 months more cottiers seem to be getting portions of land&mdash;very small portions&mdash;than was the practice for a number of years.  I welcome this.  A man who has a job and is able to get some land so that he can keep at least one cow and grow vegetables for himself and his family is usually fairly selfreliant and does pretty well.  Everybody does not seem to be able to get a portion of land that is being divided.  Unfortunately, there are too many exceptions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2170" /> Deputy McLaughlin referred to the Land Act not being operative.  The only portion of the Land Act that I find is operative is that part which allows the Land Commission to reverse the decision taken by the Fianna Fáil Government in the early 1930s when they swept the country on the basis that they would halve the land annuities.  They halved the land annuities for migrants and people who work on the land only.  If the local people are lucky enough to get a portion of land they must pay the full annuity.  What effect has this on land division?  It means that in some cases a local man who got a farm had to pay up to £8 15.0. per acre annuity in addition to rates while migrants who come into the area would have to pay £4 7.6.  The Minister may not believe this&mdash;I pointed it out when the Land Bill was going through the House&mdash; it tends to create bitterness between neighbours.  Nobody can see the justice in the case of two farmers living side by side, that one has to pay twice as much as the other by way of annuity. There is no sense or reason in it.  It is the one thing in particular which should have been left out of the Land Bill.</P>
    <P>I was interested to hear Deputy McLaughlin talking about the old age pensioner who could not get paid for land he had given to the Land Commission. I wonder at that.  I always understood that the Land Commission paid reasonably punctually even if they did pay in land bonds which are not exactly as good as cash but nearly as good if you get enough of them.</P>
    <P>The Minister made a slight reference in his opening speech to old age pensioners.  Perhaps he would comment when concluding as to the number of old age pensioners the Land Commission have found prepared to avail of the arrangement provided in the Land Act whereby they can give their farm to the Land Commission and draw a kind of pension or annuity. I would be very interested to know how successful that scheme has been because it is one of the things which I thought would not work and I am wondering whether or not it has worked.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2171" /> At present the Land Commission hold a lot of land in Meath.  I do not know why they have held it for so many years.  The Minister said that he proposed to increase the number of inspectors so that land can be disposed of more quickly.  I hope he will be successful because if there is local agitation about a farm, the people who have carried on that agitation for a number of years, because the farm was not being used properly, and in most cases was being let on the 11 month system, can see no difference in the original owner letting it and the Land Commission letting it.  It does not make sense that the Land Commission should acquire a farm and let it over a number of years.  I suggested to the Minister that the reason was that they were making some money and collecting back some of the money they had paid for the farm but he assured me that that was not so.  As a matter of fact, he said that in many cases they were losing money on it. If they are, then the Land Commission must be bigger fools than I take them to be.  There does not seem to be any reason why they should continue losing money, if that is the case.</P>
    <P>From time to time many of us bring to the notice of the Land Commission farms which in the opinion of local people are not being used properly, namely, by non-resident owners, and very often by people who advertised those farms for sale or who have indicated that they propose to sell the farms.  When we write to the Land Commission about these, we get a prompt reply and that is all.  Usually the acknowledgement takes the form, not of &ldquo;Dear Mr. Kitt&rdquo;, as the Fianna Fáil Deputy got, but of &ldquo;Dear Deputy&rdquo; or &ldquo;Dear Sir, the Land Commission have no arrangements made to acquire this farm but following your letter inquiries are being made.&rdquo; It is something to that effect. I have a number of such cases and in all of them the farms were subsequently sold.</P>
    <P>There was one glaring case where a farm of 37 acres, which had been let to a number of local smallholders over a number of years, was sold to <Col N="2172" /> two old brothers who owned 200 acres of land.  One of them was 78 and the other was 84 years of age. Months later when I made a second inquiry as to why the Land Commission had not done something about this farm, despite the fact that I had brought it to their notice, I received a reply that the Land Commission did not propose to do anything about this farm and it had been sold.  In my second letter I had informed them that it had been sold.  If the Land Act contains a provision, then the Minister is aware that it does contain that provision.  The Land Commission have authority to acquire farms that are going on the market and which are not being used properly and for which there is a local demand.  Surely there is no excuse whatever, except one, for the Land Commission not acquiring such farms.  I should like the Minister to tell us if that is the one reason, that is, that the Land Commission have not got the money to buy the farms.  If it is, then I should be glad if the Minister would say so so that we would know where we stand.  It appears that we wasted our time when the Land Bill was passing through the House if that section is not to be applied.</P>
    <P>This is not an isolated case: I know of dozens of them.  There were at least half a dozen which I brought to the notice of the Land Commission. It may be that the Land Commission inspectorate are not sufficiently numerous to look at those farms in time, but surely if adequate notice is given, it should be possible for somebody to go to the auctioneer&mdash;and I usually give the name of the auctioneer&mdash;in charge of the sale and find out what is happening.  I do not think it is good enough to send an acknowledgement and to leave it at that.  I wonder if a file is being kept on these things?  I wonder if a file is also being kept in regard to recommendations about people who apply for land?  Indeed, one of the complaints that I get from people who apply for portions of land is in regard to what they call a little bit of Irish.  They get a small, very thin piece of paper which is not even in an envelope and which is pasted together and which does not convey very much to them.</P>

      <P>That may be so. It looks like it, but it does not mean much to them.  If a Deputy writes in, he gets the stereotyped form to which Deputy Kitt referred.  I believe the Land Commission should be above politics.  I believe that neither the Minister nor any Deputy or Senator should have any right to tell the Land Commission to whom land should be given.  I believe also that Deputies and Senators have a right to make recommendations that a person is of good character and would, in their opinion, be suitable for a holding of land. When that is done such people should be interviewed by one of the inspectors when a farm is being divided.</P>
      <P>That is not always done.  I think that the person who sends out the letter engages in two movements, one when he put the letter into the envelope and the other, when he puts the Deputy's letter into the wastepaper basket.  These are the only actions that take place.  I have never been able to find out that the matter goes any further.  Perhaps I am wronging the officials.  Perhaps it would be impossible to find a building large enough to take all the recommendations sent into the Land Commission.  That could be the reason.  The present system is not perfect but perhaps there is nothing perfect in this world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the whole question of land division, I believe that the Land Commission will have to consider again the whole question of providing cow plots, particularly in County Meath.  If small holders and landless men are not able to get portions of land, they should be given cow plots in the area.  It is no answer to say that many years ago cow plots were provided in that county and that they just did not work out.  Some of them did and many of them did not.  The main reason why some of them did not work was that the worst portions of land in the district were given as cow plots.  If the Minister wants to challenge that, I will produce the evidence <Col N="2174" /> any time he likes.  I would not like to see my cow being put on that land and I do not think the Minister would either.  For that reason, if the system is changed and the Minister decides that it should be policy that a plot of good land with water and shelter, which can be obtained on most estates, is given where there is a demand for it, it might solve the problem for those who have no land and who are anxious to find somewhere other than the long acre for the cow or two which they may own.</P>
    <P>I am glad to know that the Minister has found that the bonus system in Land Commission work and in forestry has been working out well.  It is another proof that if workers are given some encouragement, they will be prepared to give a fair return.  The wages paid are pretty low and the basic wage is lower in most areas than the county council wage.  The basic wage in most parts of the country of £7 15s is too low.  I know that with effect from 1st April, it goes up to £8 15s and that is still very much below the local county council rate.  Some effort should be made to bring them up. The bonus is something they earn over and above the basic rate and for which they have to work extra hard. If the bonus system is giving the results the Minister says, the people earning it deserve more consideration.  It is no answer to say they are earning extra on bonus and should be satisfied with what is the lowest basic rate for a labourer in this country.  The same thing applies to the Forestry Division. I believe the workers there are also earning their money.</P>
    <P>I am anxious to know whether we are ever going to have some type of appeals tribunal to which the claims of these workers can be referred.  The Minister may say we have no complaint on that score because the workers got the ninth round and will be getting the tenth round.  But that is simply wages.  I am sorry to have to repeat again that in February, 1965 at least one of the trade unions representing the workers interviewed officials both of the Forestry Division and the Land Commission to discuss the question of a pension scheme and <Col N="2175" /> of a sick pay scheme.  Almost every month since that we have got the reply that the matter is still under consideration. Last June in this House the Minister told me it was under consideration. He gave me the same reply in December and in February and April of this year.  There is only one answer to this and that is the establishment of some board or committee to which matters of this kind can be referred.</P>
    <P>If these workers had the right to take their case to the Labour Court the matter would have been settled over 12 months ago.  The State are doing something very mean.  They are taking advantage of the fact that these workers have no redress.  All they can do is go back to the officials and get the same reply: that the matter will be considered.  They are thereby depriving them of something which almost every other worker in the country is now getting.  Somebody suggested&mdash;I think it was the Minister or one of his colleagues&mdash;that an Interdepartmental Committee are dealing with this matter and that the Land Commission, the Department of Agriculture and the Board of Works could not deal with these matters in isolation.  The same claims are before each of the Departments. Surely if such a committee exists it should not be too much of a strain on their time to discuss this matter and say either yes or no?</P>
    <P>I know it will be trotted out now that because of the financial situation they are unable to find the extra money to deal with this matter.  But the case for this was made before the financial situation got bad.  As a matter of fact, it was made before the last general election, and everybody knows how good conditions in the country were just before the last general election! The matter should be dealt with on that basis rather than on the basis that we are now in a bad financial position and, therefore, unable to meet our moral obligations.</P>
    <P>I am rather disturbed that the Forestry Vote has been reduced by £204,200.  This is reflected, of course, in the employment position.  A few weeks ago I had a question down to <Col N="2176" /> the Minister asking him for the number of forestry workers employed on each Saturday in April for the last five years.  The Minister, fairly enough, said employment statistics were not kept on a daily basis but he would circulate the information I required from 6th April, 1962, to 15th April, 1966.  He left out the 22nd and 29th April.  Obviously, the figures were not available.  What strikes me as peculiar is that the number employed on the 15th April, 1966, in the forests is almost 500 fewer than the number on 16th April, 1965, and almost 1,000 fewer than on 12th April, 1963.  I would hazard a guess that we could add another 500 at least to that figure as having been laid off in the last month because any of us who have anything to do with forestry workers are aware that there has been a lay-off practically all over the country and in some cases in forests where men had not been laid off for many years.</P>
    <P>I am not blaming the officials&mdash;in particular, I am not blaming the local foresters&mdash;because they can do nothing about it.  It is true that the Department have not got as much money this year as they require to keep their labouring staff in employment.  It is just too bad that when there is a shortage of cash the first fellow who must feel the pinch is the man earning a bare pittance at the very bottom of the ladder.  This is the sort of thinking we find all over the country.  This is the sort of thinking which has resulted in so many people being out on the streets on strikes in this country at present.  The man at the bottom realises that, unless he can get something on which to live while there is work for him, as soon as there is a scarcity of money he will be the first to have his head roll.</P>
    <P>We have this situation that the Forestry Division are laying off men because they want to save the £7 15s. per week these men were earning, and earning hard.  I do not blame the Minister. I suppose the Minister fought as hard as he could to get as much money as possible for his Department.  That is the business of Ministers.  But that is very little use to the man who finds that after years of good service he is simply told&mdash;not that there is a job <Col N="2177" /> waiting round the corner for which he will be trained, as we were led to believe by the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Flanagan, some time ago or not that he will be laid off for a week or even a few months and that he can draw unemployment benefit before he gets a job at the end of the year&mdash; he is simply told he is gone and that is it.  It is just too bad that this system should still operate.  It is hard to encourage people to give of their best output if they know there is somebody waiting around the corner with a pencil to tick off their names and hand them their cards if money looks like becoming scarce anywhere in the country.</P>
    <P>The whole system of employment in both the Land Commission and the Forestry Division and in any other Government Department at that level needs revision.  The Minister must know from his own constituency, apart from what he has heard in this House, that the time is long overdue for the introduction of some type of commission or committee on which the men and his Department could be represented in order to iron out these matters rather than merely a statement from the Minister and his officials that the matter is under consideration and that is as far as they can go.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that this Government have now taken the decision to reduce the planting to 20,000 acres per year.  We had great blowing of trumpets when it went up to 25,000 acres.  We were told it was proposed to keep the figure at that level.  Now that we are beginning to get some return from the forests on the sale of trees I felt the Government would be far seeing enough to ensure that there would be a continual expansion of planting.  Apparently the Government have taken a shortsighted view of this and have decided to reduce the number of acres planted.  This must ultimately result in a substantial reduction in the number of people employed in the forest.</P>
    <P>I am quite sure the question of acquiring land for afforestation is a problem.  I am also aware that the Forestry Division have had numerous offers of land and that for one reason <Col N="2178" /> or another, the acquiring of that land is being held up.  Again, might I ask the Minister if he would say if finance has anything to do with it?  Is his programme as far as the purchase of land in reserve is concerned being impeded because he has not got the necessary money to buy it?  If that is so, it is not this generation that will suffer but generations to come.  The only hope is to keep expanding the planting.  If we cannot do that, then we shall soon see the end of the afforestation programme of which this country and this House were so proud.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGeoghegan" hpid="Mr. Geoghegan Mr. Geoghegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Geoghegan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have heard on both sides of the House a lot of criticism of our Land Commission officials but one must look at the good points as well.  I come from an area where there has been a great deal of distribution of small holdings.  I must say the officials in my city have done an excellent job of work in resettling and redistributing quite a number of holdings in the West, making them more compact, and dividing up properly the amount of land available amongst the tenants.  I feel they are entitled to whatever few words of praise I might say here for doing so.  Much progress has been made down through the years in the resettlement and redistribution of these lands, and it has been a step in the right direction.  You will come across cases from time to time where delays have taken place but the officials cannot be blamed for it, as some people seem to think.  There may be just one person or two who would hold up a whole townland in the distribution of land.</P>
      <P>In regard to the rearrangement of holdings, and especially where people have to be rehoused, there may be standard houses constructed to a standard plan, very nice houses with every facility.  There will be the odd case where the father or mother, perhaps the son and his wife with maybe eight to ten children are living in that house, and it is too small to accommodate all those people.  I understand that there is a lot of delay in altering the plan so as to suit that family or preparing a new house plan for them. I would sincerely ask the Minister to look at cases of that sort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2179" /> There will also be cases where people will give up their little old house in order to facilitate their neighbours and are awaiting sanction for a new house with perhaps two rooms and a kitchen in which they hope to live for the rest of their lives.  Strange as it may seem&mdash;I do not know if it is a coincidence&mdash;I had a case on my hands for quite a long time and just before the Minister came in here tonight, I had a phone call to say that the case has not been solved so far and that no preparations have been made.  This person, who is without a house at the moment, living in with neighbours, perhaps changing about from place to place, was good enough to facilitate the Land Commission officials by giving up his home which went in with another holding so as to straighten out the holding.  It is wrong that that person should be left waiting.  I do not want to mention any names in this House.  I have taken the matter up with the Department, and with the office in Galway.  So far, no information has come from the Land Commission here in Dublin.  I shall give the name to the Minister and his Department and I ask him to hurry up this case.</P>
    <P>On this occasion we are dealing with the Estimate for Lands and the Estimate for Forestry together.  It would be no harm for the Minister's Department to consider the case where the Forestry Division takes over tracts of mountains for the planting of trees.  This is a very good thing and very essential, but, at the same time, if there are good turbary rights there, the Minister would want to take a very careful look at it to ensure that in taking over the land there is turbary left aside for the people of that area.  In certain parts of the West, turbary is a very scarce commodity and, as the Minister knows well, there are places in my constituency where people have to travel as much as 18 miles each way to get turbary.  Where the Minister is taking over these places for forestry, he should fence off the deepest part so as to keep people in full supply of turbary while they are there.</P>
    <P>There is another point which I raised last year and which I shall <Col N="2180" /> keep raising as long as I am here, that is, where tracts of land for plantation are taken over, the first thing the Department should do before planting a tree is to burn out any dens or coverts for foxes that may be there.  The way foxes are carrying on at the moment, especially in the West, the housewife will not have a hen and the farmer will not have a sheep. They seem to be dragging the young lambs and killing them.  I feel that any such dens should be burned out.</P>
    <P>A fire is dangerous in areas where you have plantations.  We are told by the Minister's Department to be careful about kindling fires near a plantation. I know his Department cut and clear away a path right round to, say, six, eight or, maybe ten feet but knowing the heather and the way it lies, on a breezy day, eight to ten feet is nothing.  I have seen the heather when it goes on fire; it just rolls up into a little ball&mdash;a hare would not keep up with it&mdash;and travels even across wide rivers of maybe ten to 15 feet, depending on the breeze.  If a survey has not been made of lakes, especially those near young forests, it would be a good thing to make one and find out the possibilities of a brigade being able to put out a fire or being able to deal with it.  Certainly putting a trench around it may have a little effect.  What happens is this: in springtime, the heather grows and then in winter, it withers away, turns white, and is as light as a piece of paper but before the young heather grows up it can do a terrible lot of destruction if it goes on fire.</P>
    <P>I did not intend to intervene in this debate except to put those few points. I feel the Land Commission officials have a very trying job and taking it as a whole&mdash;mind you, I have as many dealings with them as anybody coming from an area like mine &mdash; we should give them credit.  It is up to us to pay them a tribute for what they have tried to do.  When they are called upon to help, they certainly do it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>I have, on more than one occasion, spoken on this Estimate in this House and on all occasions I have paid tribute to the Land Commission inspectors and officials for the work they have done.  We do not always hear tributes paid to them. Everybody should appreciate that they have a very difficult task.  Like the Minister, who is a Mayoman, I who come from a congested area appreciate the very difficult task they have because the work they are trying to do is certainly difficult in every way.  We are dealing with a generation of people who have been told about the harm done by the landlords of old, lands which were grabbed from them, given to neighbours and so forth.  That, in itself, has created a bitterness and strong feeling about those holdings, particularly in the west of Ireland, and in other parts of the country as well.</P>
      <P>Deputy Murphy spoke here this evening and we all know they have that problem in West Cork and in other counties.  For that reason, living in a congested area myself, I appreciate the difficulties.  Generally speaking, I appreciate that down through the years the Land Commission have done a lot of useful work.  They have cleared up a lot of rural slums in different areas and improved the lot of many smallholders, migrated people from the mountainous regions to the midlands, nearer to the eastern counties or wherever good land was available.  In that way they have done a lot of useful work all down through the years. There is a lot more to be done, however, and, there again, we will have to rely on these Land Commission officials to carry on the good work.  I know many of those inspectors personally and from conversations I had with them from time to time, I discovered that the majority of them are sons of farmers themselves.  They have a good knowledge and experience of the work and, by and large, they are doing the best they can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is, therefore, a cause for regret on this occasion that we find a Mayoborn <Col N="2182" /> Minister in the difficult position, as are other Ministers due to the difficulties of the time, of having to cut down on his Estimate.  I know at least one other Minister for Lands came from Mayo; in fact, two former Ministers came from Mayo, and I am sure they were faced with the same problem.  When a Minister for Lands goes to a Minister for Finance looking for money, he is told, quite naturally: &ldquo;You will not get all that&rdquo;, and the argument has to go on backstage, I suppose.  But the truth is that no Minister for Lands, in my opinion, down through the years ever got the money he really needed to do the work he would like to do even reasonably efficiently.  I have known some other Ministers.  I know the present Minister and I think he is as enthusiastic as anybody else to improve the lot of the people amongst whom he lives. But there is a problem: money is hard to come by; the bulk of Land Commission salaries had to be increased; the cost of land has gone up; the cost of house building has gone up very considerably and so, too, has the cost of cow byres and other farm buildings which the Land Commission are trying to provide for migrants.  The amount of money being made available is not being brought into line with those increases.</P>
    <P>I can foresee a situation in which there will be less land re-arrangement, less migration of smallholders from the west and other counties because of that money scarcity.  It is really bad news that we have run into such difficult times, particularly when so many people today are leaving the land, and it is so hard to encourage farmers' sons today to stay on the land when they see their neighbours in other employment &mdash; perhaps county council employment&mdash;with a 40 hour week, and getting increases in their pay packets, and so forth.  I do not grudge those increases, particularly to the small men, but it is hard to keep young people on the land.  If the Land Commission and the Minister are not in a position to help them to the extent that they could in the past &mdash;and it seems to me quite certain they will not be able to help them to that extent&mdash;that is very bad news, <Col N="2183" /> particularly for the people in the west of Ireland.</P>
    <P>On a previous occasion, I addressed a question to the Taoiseach asking him if he was aware of the committee known as the Defence of the West Committee which was taking a very deep and serious interest in trying to do something to prevent the west of Ireland from bleeding to death.  On this committee, there are bishops and churchmen of various denominations. The Taoiseach told me that if I waited for the various Estimates to be brought in, I would then know what the Government proposed to do to remedy the situation.  Here we have an example of what the Government are doing in connection with these vital matters of land acquisition, land division and the migration of people from congested areas.  If this is an example of what the Government are doing, there are bad times ahead for these people.</P>
    <P>I have with me a cutting from one of yesterday's daily papers.  I think it is the <i>Irish Independent.</i>  In it the Bishop of Cork and Ross, the Most Reverend Dr. Lucey, is reported as referring to the fact that 10,000 Irish farmers are being liquidated a year. That statement coming from a responsible Irish bishop should alarm this House and country.  It is shocking that in 1966, a Catholic bishop should have to make such a statement about Irish agriculture, which everyone must admit is our main industry.  It is a true statement and that is the true position.</P>
    <P>The Minister's Estimate, far from being more generous, and far from putting more money at his disposal to try to remedy that situation, is cut down.  It is one of the most important Estimates that comes before the House, particularly in relation to the problem with which the Minister is concerned and with which I am concerned, the problem in Mayo.  In the past the Land Commission gave a rather smaller acreage of land to people with whom they were dealing either in the matter of migration or fixing them up at local level where land was available at local level, due, perhaps, to some neighbours being migrated.  The acreage in <Col N="2184" /> many cases was around 25 or 30, but due to the change in the whole outlook of farming and in the view of the Land Commission themselves&mdash;because they have increased the acreage and brought it up to around 40 to 45 acres&mdash;many people who got holdings in the past are now looking for another ten or 15 acres to bring them up to an economic level.  That applies not only to the west of Ireland but also to the eastern counties where some migrants, as they are called, have settled down.  In any re-arrangement proceedings that are undertaken, these people should be considered by the Land Commission for increased acreage to bring their holdings to an economic level, to bring them in line with their neighbours and with people who have been migrated in more recent times.</P>
    <P>There was much criticism, and rightly so, of the length of time the Land Commission hold land which they require for the relief of congestion. I have given this matter some study because I know instances where land was held by the Land Commission for ten or 12 years after acquistion.  I think in rare cases it was held up to 15 or 20 years.  Judging by the prices the Land Commission get at auctions, this must be a profitable line of business for the Land Commission to engage in.  I have been told in the past when I made inquiries into this matter that that policy was pursued with a view to reducing the rent to the incoming tenant.  I know it would be bad policy to impose on an incoming tenant a rent which would break his back from the word `go'.</P>
    <P>There should be other means of reducing these rents than by letting the land in conacre, with a consequent deterioration of the land, because we all know that the person who takes conacre is not very worried about how he farms the land.  Some other means should be found of getting an economic rent than making use of these funds for the purpose of reducing rents or putting money into the national Exchequer.  That is a very wrong policy.  The Minister should get around it.  He should see to it that the holdings of land in the possession of the Land Commission are made available to <Col N="2185" /> tenants within a matter of six to 12 months, or two years at most.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission cannot divide land unless they have land in the pool to divide, any more than I could divide sweets if I had not sweets to divide.  They have to start the process of acquisition and it can be difficult. Deputy Murphy spoke at length this evening, as he did on previous occasions, on the question of purchasing or attempting to purchase land with land bonds.  Deputy McLaughlin mentioned this matter briefly also.  We all know that people regard the Land Commission as the worst customers who can show up to purchase their land, because they feel they will not get money for the land.  Consequently, they dread them.  The Land Commission have a very bad public image in that regard.  If the Minister and the Department want to discourage people from surrendering land needed for the purpose of creating a greater pool of land for division, I know of no better way of doing so than by continuing to offer bonds for land.  We know the people dread them.</P>
    <P>I was a member of this House some years ago when a colleague of mine was sitting over there as Minister.  That problem came up and I spoke on it. Down through the years that policy has been pursued.  We know people who had land taken from them compulsorily or by voluntary acquisition. Many of those people lost heavily on it.  We are known as a Christian country.  Our standards are Christian and in accordance with Christian principles but if that is not Communistic, I do not know what it is.  It certainly is not in accordance with Christian principles to deprive those people of a good price for their holdings.  I do not intend to refer to the case dealt with by Deputy Murphy but the Minister knows that injustice has been done to people by the purchase of land through the land bond system.  I would ask the Minister to try to devise some better method of purchase.</P>
    <P>It is unfair and unjust to deprive those people of a just price for their land and the system deprives the <Col N="2186" /> Department of many offers of land that would normally come to them.  In the west of Ireland, many people have emigrated to England and these will never return.  Their holdings, very many of which have nice slated bungalows, with hot and cold water, toilet facilities and other facilities installed are lying idle.  There are stables and cowbyres for which this State and the Irish taxpayers paid money.  Those houses are now derelict. I believe that if the Land Commission communicated with some of those people who are in England or other places and offered them cash for their land, they would get it.  It is easy to get the addresses of those people &mdash; the rate collector usually has them.  I do not know how they are obtained but the rate collector is able to get them.</P>
    <P>Some of those people are living in London, Birmingham, Manchester and even the USA.  If the Land Commission got in touch with them and told them they were paying cash for their holdings, they could obtain them.  I do not believe in their compulsory acquisition at all.  It is our own people we are dealing with and it is not very nice to go after them and say they must hand up their land.  Some of those people had to leave this country through no fault of their own.  I have no doubt, as I say, that if the Land Commission got in touch with those people, particularly those from the west of Ireland, and said they were willing to pay cash for the land, it would be given up to them. It is a pity to see the slated bungalows on these holdings falling into ruin because of neglect.</P>
    <P>When families who lived on some of those holdings grow up, they either come to Dublin or emigrate to some other cities outside the country.  They do not want to go back.  They get accustomed to city life, the large pay packets, amusements and so forth. They find they would not have these at home and there are many of those holdings which would come into the Land Commission if they paid cash for them.</P>
    <P>We all know that a gentleman named Mr. Mongey has been appointed recently to look after the interests of the west.  Some people, including myself, <Col N="2187" /> have been critical of this service being carried out with regard to the west.  I was critical of that appointment because many members of the Mayo County Council and I have pointed out many things which can be done to improve the lot of the western farmers. I should like to make this point to the Minister.  I know that the duties of this gentleman are not relevant on this Vote but I should like to say if this man does not get some good co-operation from the Department of Lands, it will be a very gloomy prospect.  When we speak of small holdings, I want to say that although we have many small holdings in the west of Ireland, there are also some of them in Meath.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>There are lots of them.  I wish others west of the Shannon would realise that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasOHara" hpid="Mr. O'Hara Mr. O'Hara">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>There are some small holdings in Meath but not many.  I have met some of the people on these small holdings.  The small holding problem is a very serious one.  It is impossible for those people to borrow money from any source by reason of the fact that their holdings are small and uneconomic.  That is another very important reason why the Minister, as far as he can, should acquire land, pay cash for it and bring those small holdings up to a reasonable standard so that the people can go into their bank managers and get money on loan.</P>
      <P>Some of those people are living on small holdings of £15 or £20 valuation. If those people were able to borrow money, they would be creditworthy.  I fully appreciate that in the west of Ireland many people migrate from Achill, Erris and Foxford up to Meath and this is a very costly thing. It must take £6,000 or £7,000 to migrate one family.  That is quite a costly item but when you consider the amount of good it does, we are getting value for the money spent. Many of those people go to places like Cork and other places in the south and east of the country and they are a great benefit to the community in those areas.  They become very good citizens when they get an opportunity to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2188" /> With regard to forestry, I regret that this Estimate is cut down drastically and that the planting programme, of which we were so proud, is being reduced. It is just too bad.  I looked forward to the day when it would be possible to expand our planting programme. During 1948 to 1951, the Government of the day thought fit to enlist the support of Mr. Cameron, of Canadian nationality, to go into the whole question of forestry here.  He told them the best ways to expand and advance forestry schemes in Ireland. He suggested two separate schemes of forestry.  His report is available, probably in the Oireachtas Library and elsewhere.  It was advice tendered to the Government at the time.  Some Deputies may think he was living in the moon but I am firmly convinced that if we could make the money available to implement his recommendations we would be working in the right direction.  Mr. Cameron made a thorough survey of our soil conditions and our employment position in relation to land usage and commented very intelligently on the whole position.  I should like to go on record as advocating that the recommendations he made be implemented, particularly in relation to what he called a social scheme of forestry.</P>
    <P>We have a commercial scheme.  We grow good quality timber in the main and with the passing of time I am confident that this timber will be very useful, together with our other natural resources, in getting us out of our economic difficulties.  People sometimes ask me if we have anything in this country.  I tell them, of course, that we have timber coming on as well as crops in the ground which we hope to harvest. I look at the time when forestry will be a big help in solving our economic difficulties.  I suggest that the Minister use his imagination and his drive to get on to the social side of forestry as recommended by Mr. Cameron. This would provide work for people who have to emigrate.</P>
    <P>It may be argued that we have not got money at the present time to do this.  I suggest that a start should be made in the west, even in a small way. Mr. Cameron's idea was not to worry <Col N="2189" /> too much with the quality of the timber.  He suggested we should put some kind of tree in the ground and that it would restore the soil balance so that later better quality, commercial timber could be produced.  He pointed out that because of neglect throughout the years our soil conditions had gone out of balance.  I cannot argue the point in a technical way but I agree with him that if we engaged in the social scheme of forestry it would be good business for the future.</P>
    <P>It may be 20 or 30 years before we could hope to see the results of such a scheme but we would reap the harvest in giving employment to people who otherwise would have to emigrate. I, therefore, repeat my request to the Minister to read this report if he has not already done so and to try to implement at least some of the recommendations.</P>
    <P>The Minister has told us that our plantable acreage is down to 20,000 this year.  I am afraid it will drop below that figure later.  I feel sure the Minister this year did not wish to shock the country by telling us he expects the acreage to fall to 15,000. I sincerely hope he will reach the 20,000 figure and will not have to tell the House later that he does not find it possible to do so.</P>
    <P>I am not quite clear what the position is in regard to acquisition because, like the Land Commission question with which I dealt a while ago, you cannot divide land until you have it on hand.  Similarly, you cannot plant trees on land you have not got.  I wonder is there a slowing down on the acquisition side.  Has the pool of land for forestry purposes shrunk or what is the problem there?  If it has, it is very serious because you must have a certain ratio between what you plant and the acquisition pool, that is, the pool of land you have on hand.</P>
    <P>There is a lot of planning ahead involved in forestry.  One does not just rush out and start sticking down trees here and there at a certain time of the year.  Drainage, fencing and other works have to be undertaken, and there is the question of acquiring the land.  There is also the question of <Col N="2190" /> mountain commonage.  That question was dealt with on a previous occasion by one of the Minister's predecessors. I know all the problems were not perhaps ironed out and I can well imagine that even yet the problem of acquiring mountain ranches of the type of land suitable for forestry can be difficult. There may be 15, 20 or even 50 tenants concerned.  Out of 20 people, you may have 15 with you and five pulling against you, and the five delay the operation.</P>
    <P>There is also a question of title. Title can be difficult to establish in relation to these mountain regions. There is trespass of some of these places from time to time and somebody may come along and remind you that he is the owner and tell you to get off about your business. When Department officials come along and see that somebody has an interest in the land, it can be difficult enough to deal with.</P>
    <P>Deputy McLaughlin made the point that there is too much bidding when an inspector comes along and inspects a certain area.  We know our people in the west of Ireland are bargain-makers. If they ask £100, they expect to get £90.  The forestry people are aware that it has been a tradition with those people to ask a higher price than they really are inclined to take.  The Land Commission should take into account that even those mountain regions have more value to-day than they had down through the years and that the purchasing power of money has dropped seriously.</P>
    <P>We know how important is the goodwill of the local people where a forestry scheme is established. Deputy Geoghegan has stressed that point.  Whatever the forestry people do, they should make very sure to have the goodwill of the people in those regions in which they plant forests.  There is a sure way of getting that goodwill, that is, by being reasonably generous and straightforward with the people.  If after ten or 15 years somebody wants to get his own back and late one night throws a match into a forest, it is difficult to put a finger on the amount of damage <Col N="2191" /> that might be done by that single act. We have national schools in most of those regions and teachers and parents should educate their children in the matter of keeping matches or fires away from such places.  I think our own people would have enough intelligence not to do anything like that; but we should try from the first day to get all the goodwill we can, and the Minister and his Department should be more generous in the matter of prices.</P>
    <P>There are still vast areas of land in the west of Ireland suitable for forestry, and for nothing else.  From time to time, I hear from my constituents that they have communicated with the Forestry Division but that prices have not been finalised, that title is clear and that six months or 12 months, or two years ago somebody from the Forestry Division called on them but they have not heard from the Forestry people since. I think in that regard that the good offices of somebody local&mdash;not necessarily a member of the Dáil, or the county council for that matter, but a priest or teacher&mdash;could be availed of with a view to hammering out a bargain between the Forestry Division on the one hand and the person selling the land on the other.  Time is ticking away in the matter of acquiring land and it is important that we should try to increase the acreage in the pool of land for forestry.</P>
    <P>I know of a few specific cases, and I have another case in mind but I do not think it would be of particular interest to the Forestry people as a large area for a big plantation.  It is outside Swinford and actually in the Minister's own territory&mdash;Mitfield.  I know the land is not first-class and would not be regarded as high-grade. In this case the Forestry official, who was quite nice about it, pointed out, what I already knew, that it was not a first-class piece of ground.  There are a number of plots made up of five, eight or ten acres.  At the same time, I think that special consideration should be given to areas like that and, although it may not seem to have <Col N="2192" /> a great value from the commercial point of view, if the acquisition of land for planting had the effect of providing local employment, it would be worth a lot.</P>
    <P>The local parish priest and many others are very anxious to see something started, even something small. It may be possible to implement in that area the scheme recommended by Mr. Cameron, a Canadian expert, that forestry in a small way would provide work for ten or 15 people by way of fencing and drainage.  The scheme as recommended by this expert should be tried out in order to see what the prospects are.</P>
    <P>Again, I say it came as a shock to many people in the west of Ireland to hear that there is a slowing down in Land Commission activity and in the Forestry Division.  It came as bad news and I, as a Member of this House, want to say that it should be quite in order for Deputies to make recommendations to the Land Commission regarding holdings of land that may be divided in their particular areas. I am not afraid to go on the records of this House as having told everybody who came to me in connection with land problems that the matter of land division, and so on, is a matter for the Land Commission and that we as Deputies are powerless.  If we made recommendations, the Land Commission would no doubt look into them and examine their merits and after that they would have full power to deal with them.  The Minister has not that power; he has not assumed it under any Land Act, and the Government are afraid to take it.</P>
    <P>I have always pointed out to people that there are three Deputies in my constituency and that it is quite on the cards that while a group sit down in my room telling me how to divide this land, there is another group talking to Deputy Calleary 20 miles away and making a different case, and in a day or two perhaps somebody else will speak to the other Deputy about it. So, if three different Deputies are talking about dividing the land, how can the Land Commission do their work? It should be made clear to the people outside that we have responsible officials. <Col N="2193" /> I am quite satisfied that the officials in Ballina, and indeed in the Castlebar area, are responsible men, and so, too, are the Forestry men. Very often they work hours when they should not be working&mdash;until 8 or 9 o'clock at night out in remote areas. It should be made clear to the people that Deputies can make their recommedations and that they can do as Deputy Kitt did here&mdash;raise matters in the House by way of question or on the Estimate as he and Deputy M. P. Murphy did.</P>
    <P>To conclude, I should like to say that it is bad news for the people in the Minister's constituency and in my constituency that this Vote had to be cut.  It will cause more and more unemployment and more and more people will leave the western regions, and I do not know where the whole thing will end.  At the present time, it is certainly the case that homes are closing down in areas where families were brought up in reasonable prosperity with a reasonably good standard of living.  It is regrettable and I am sure the Minister regrets that he had to come to this House and relate this bad news.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Moran)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know how far I shall get in the time at my disposal tonight.  There are a few matters I should like to pursue. They are matters of priority arising out of this debate, particularly a few matters raised by Deputy M. P. Murphy involving in principle the question of payment in land bonds, which was also raised by Deputy O'Hara and others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me preface my remarks by saying that I do not regard all my geese as swans.  There are officials in my Department who are human and who may make mistakes from time to time. I can also say that I accept what Deputy M. P. Murphy has said about the matter he raised and which he said in good faith, that he does not want to indict me and is going on some story which he has been told.  I know when he hears what I have to say that certainly if he had any legal training, he would retract many of the insinuations and allegations he has made.  In <Col N="2194" /> view of the allegations made, I have to go into the facts in connection with this particular incident rather extensively. Difficulty may arise if a matter like this gets out of hand by way of publicity without any presentation of the facts.</P>
    <P>First of all, let me deal with land bonds in general.  There have been issues of land bonds under different laws down through the years.  There are 3½ per cent land bonds, four per cent land bonds, five per cent land bonds, and so on.  Many of these issues are still there.  Land bonds are a fixed interest bearing security, the same as thousands of other securities, and land bonds fluctuate the same as any other type of bond or any other type of debenture.  As money gets dear, as it has in present circumstances, and as those in the private sector, companies and so forth, look for money and are prepared to pay 7 per cent or 7½ per cent or 8 per cent for money, that is bound to depreciate the price of a fixed interest security, be it a land bond or any other type of bond carrying an interest rate of 5 per cent or 4½ per cent, or less.  You have a situation then in which the industrial giants, like the Dunlop Rubber Company or Imperial Chemical Industries, offer 7¼ per cent or 7½ per cent for money.  Overnight that devalues the price of fixed interest securities which are paying less interest.</P>
    <P>Again&mdash;perhaps Deputy Murphy is not familiar with this&mdash;land bonds are issued on the basis that, if you have £100 worth, you get your full £100 even though on the open market you might only get £68.  However, forget about land bonds for the moment. Think of other fixed interest securities. Perhaps ten years ago, five years ago, or even six months ago, you put your money into some fixed interest security which looked good.  Perhaps the interest rate was six per cent.  Overnight some new issue may be floated carrying an interest rate of 7 or 7¼ per cent and you find immediately that your £100, if you turn it into cash, is worth only £80.  The same is true of land bonds.</P>
    <P>Another misconception under which some Deputies labour is that people hold land bonds for all time.  They do <Col N="2195" /> no such thing.  Deputy Murphy quoted Deputy Sweetman in a former debate when he challenged me to say that I knew from my professional experience that, where we get paid in land bonds the costs in land actions, we find it very difficult to get rid of the bonds if they are in small amounts. That is quite true.  It is equally true in relation to any small holding or any small investment.  It is very difficult to get rid of it unless one's broker is prepared to wait until a number of other smallholders come on the market to enable him to sell a reasonable block.  What happens with land bonds is that the land owner immediately sends them to his broker and cashes them.  That happens in 99 out of 100 cases.  In the one case the person is probably not greatly concerned about getting an income.  Well-off people find that an interest rate of six per cent suits them and they hold on.  The 99 convert immediately into cash. That is the normal practice and those about whom the Deputy was arguing are those who purchase these on the Stock Exchange for the purpose of the income they will get out of them. If there is a new issue of something else which pays a higher dividend at a time when money is dear, these people find that, while their income is safe, their capital has depreciated.</P>

      <P>I will give chapter and verse because I cannot permit this allegation to go uncorrected. While everything in the legal section of the Land Commission is not perfect, if ever there was a case in which there should be no reason for complaint this is it.  If ever there was a case in which there were the softest ruling with regard to title this is it.  Those rulings <Col N="2196" /> were issued within three weeks of possession being taken by the Land Commission.  This was a voluntary case.  The proceedings started on a compulsory basis but agreement was reached with the owner in her solicitor's office.  She agreed there to take £11,000 in land bonds.  Deputy Murphy has no business telling the House this unfortunate woman did not know a land bond from a hole in the ground.  She was sitting beside an experienced solicitor and it was in his office this deal was made.  Let Deputy Murphy not try to create the impression that her solicitor did not fully explain to her what land bonds were. At the time she could not give possession because the lands were let for a year or two ahead.  But the agreement was made then.  There was an interval of six or seven months and, immediately the agreement was made, the letter quoted by the Deputy was sent to this lady suggesting that she could proceed in the meantime to prove her title in anticipation of possession being given.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not allow the Deputy to get away with this.  In common legal practice&mdash;I shall leave the Land Commission out of it&mdash;the purchase money is lodged in the joint names of the solicitors concerned until the title is investigated and possession given.  It is the fixed practice of the Land Commission to vest the lands when they get possession in order that the vendor may get the benefit of the interest on the land bonds.  In this case, contrary to what the Deputy has alleged here, this woman's money has <Col N="2197" /> been drawing interest.  The interest is piling up since the date the lands were vested and since she got possession. Her solicitor has failed to discharge four simple rulings on title.  He has discharged one, and all through the period the money has been lying there, drawing interest.  The solicitor concerned <Col N="2198" /> will not discharge the rulings on title.</P>

      <P>The Chairman of the Council of An Foras Talúntais is appointed by the President and the 12 ordinary members by the Government. Five of the ordinary members are nominated by agricultural and rural organisations in accordance with An Foras Talúntais (Nomination of Members of the Council by Agricultural and Rural Organisations) Order, 1958.  This Order provides that one person be nominated by each of five groups of organisations set out in the Schedule to the Order.  Accordingly, each Council nominee of every group represents more than one organisation. Of the organisations scheduled the following received grants-in-aid from my Department in 1965-66: Federation of Irish Beekeepers, £200; Irish Countrywomen's Association, £9,000; Macra na Feirme, £5,000; Irish Agricultural Organisation Society Ltd., £30,000.</P>
