    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power if he is aware of the unwarranted delay in calculating redundancy compensation under the Transport Acts in respect of a person (name supplied) and others, some of whom were retired as long ago as 1959; and if he will take steps forthwith to ensure that awards are made in these cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the delay in the determination of a number of redundancy compensation cases submitted to arbitration under the provisions of the Transport Acts.  A provision which is intended to provide a means for expediting the determination of outstanding cases has been included in the Transport Bill, 1966, which I introduced on 8th June, 1966.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>In advance of the enactment of the legislation, are there any steps open to the Minister to expedite the conclusion of these cases? I think he will agree that the delay has been quite unwarranted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, I have no statutory powers to compel the arbitrator to make decisions.  I can only bring further representations to bear and ask him to make decisions in the number of outstanding cases that exist.  As the Deputy knows, a considerable number of the persons involved are, in fact, receiving redundancy <Col N="990" /> compensation.  They have appealed in some cases for an increase or for a change in redundancy compensation and a number of people are receiving a measure of redundancy compensation, pending hearing by the arbitrator, in regard to various matters connected with their claims.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>While that is so, the real crux of the problem is that a number of them wish to make settlements in favour of their wives so that in the event of their death, it will be possible that some compensation will be available for the widows.  Because of the delay in making the awards, it is not possible to make that arrangement. Perhaps the Minister would draw that aspect of the matter to the arbitrator's attention and endeavour to ensure that the matter will be concluded.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughGibbons" hpid="Dr. Gibbons Dr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power if he will suggest to Bord na Móna that its sales of turf briquettes and sod turf be rationalised so that ample supplies will be available to retail merchants for sale to the household consumer who must buy in small quantities.</P>

    <P>4.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughGibbons" hpid="Dr. Gibbons Dr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power whether the <Col N="991" /> demands of the ESB for turf briquettes must be met by Bord na Móna before turf briquettes are made available for sale to retail merchants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 3 and 4 together.</P>
      <P>Out of each year's production Bord na Móna makes provision for the supply of turf on the basis of the following priorities:&mdash;(1) ESB power stations: these stations use sod and milled peat but not briquettes.  Their use of milled peat which is also required for production of briquettes will affect the supply of briquettes in a year when milled peat production falls below target; (2) industrial and institutional customers with whom the Board has fixed commitments; (3) cheap fuel schemes operated by local authorities for the supply of turf to necessitous households; and (4) the domestic market to which the balance available after meeting the priority requirements set out above is allocated.</P>
      <P>During the past few years there has been a shortage of both machine turf and briquettes for the domestic market owing to adverse weather conditions which made it impossible for the Board to reach its production targets and at the same time created an increased demand due to the failure of hand-won turf.</P>
      <P>Since July, 1963, briquettes for the domestic market have been allocated to merchants on the basis of their 1962-63 purchases.  During the past year allocations have had to be cut back to 50 per cent due to the restrictions on briquette production arising from the bad milled peat harvest.  It is not possible to say yet what the position will be in the coming year.</P>
      <P>Consideration is being given by Bord na Móna to the possibility of introducing a similar allocation system for machine turf should the quantity available for the domestic market continue to fall seriously short of the demand.  No decision on this matter can be taken before the end of the turf production season.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughGibbons" hpid="Dr. Gibbons Dr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power if Bord na Móna have acquired contracts in institutions by tendering a lower price than that tendered by suppliers of native coal; and if the Board have now asked that their price be increased and that the increased price be made retrospective.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughGibbons" hpid="Dr. Gibbons Dr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power how many institutions in the province of Connaught Bord na Móna have supplied with turf briquettes during (a) 1962, (b) 1963, (c) 1964 and (d) 1965.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 5 and 6 together.</P>
      <P>I am informed by Bord na Móna that contracts for the supply of turf to various institutions are undertaken directly by the Board; institutional contracts are also supplied by fuel merchants or others with turf produced by the Board.  Contracts are usually placed on a year to year basis and the price charged, either for direct or indirect contracts, is the Board's normal price as fixed from time to time.</P>
      <P>Bord na Móna are not in a position to say whether the price tendered is less than that quoted by suppliers of native coal.  In the majority of institutions supplied by the Board native coal is unlikely to be tendered at all; they are aware of only two institutions where native coal has been replaced by Bord na Móna turf in recent years.</P>
      <P>I am also informed by Bord na Móna that the number of institutions in Connaught supplied with turf briquettes during the years in question were:&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance what are the relevant provisions in relation to the offset of a pension granted by the State or by a State body when a pensioner takes up employment with another State company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Prior to the Pensions (Abatement) Act, 1965 the normal <Col N="996" /> abatement provision ensured that when a public service pensioner was re-employed anywhere in the public service, his pension was reduced by any sum by which the total of his annual salary on re-employment, plus his pension, exceeded the annual salary he had on retirement from the position in respect of which his pension was awarded.</P>
      <P>The 1965 Act eased the effect of abatement by limiting it to cases where re-employment was in the same service as that from which the pensioner retired. It also enabled abatement to be waived altogether if the re-employment, although in the same service, were in the public interest.  Further easement was provided by relating abatement to pay as revised from time to time with current pay levels, rather than to pay on retirement.</P>
      <P>Most of the pension schemes for semi-State bodies still retain the older abatement provisions under which a wide range of employment attracts abatement, that is to say, employment in any post remunerated out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas or out of the Central Fund or by a local authority or by a Board established under an Act of the Oireachtas.  It rests with the semi-State bodies to decide whether or not they wish to modify the abatement provisions in their schemes on the lines of the 1965 Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that in certain semi-State bodies a ridiculous situation arises now where persons whose jobs were declared redundant by CIE were superannuated at the request of CIE and received a pension?  These people got alternative employment with the B and I and they were entitled to receive their superannuation, as well as their remuneration from the B and I.  Now, because the Government have taken over the B and I, they lose their superannuation. It seems to me quite scandalous that this should operate in respect of a Government acquisition in regard to something that was not there at the time they got their employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that it is <Col N="997" /> anomalous that such a situation exists when the Pensions (Abatement) Act provides a different regime for people remunerated out of public funds, people who work in the Civil Service but the Abatement Act was intended to be a model for the adaptation of all other pension schemes.  I would be only too glad to see the different State-sponsored bodies adapt their schemes in accordance with the Act.</P>

      <P>I am aware that there have been delays in the payment of supplementary grants by the council. As regards housing grants, they were notified last March of a capital allocation for 1966-67 of £130,000 which would be adequate to meet their full requirements.  Loans amounting to £47,800 are available for draws from the Local Loans Fund and further loans will be sanctioned as required on the basis of the allocation. Temporary difficulties in the issue of moneys from the Fund have arisen as a result of the current banking situation.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare, why a person (name supplied) has not been able to have her social welfare benefit paid in full while she is in hospital, although this money is needed to assist in the upkeep of her family as her husband is a farm labourer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney (for the Minister for Social Welfare) Mr. Blaney (for the Minister for Social Welfare)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney (for the Minister for Social Welfare)</NameTxt>
      <P>Disability benefit has not been paid in full to the person named in the question while she is in hospital as under the Social Welfare (Overlapping Benefits) Regulations, 1953 payment in full, other than to a person who may be regarded as a dependant within the meaning of the Social Welfare Acts, may not be made until the patient is discharged from hospital.  The person named in the question has no dependant within the meaning of the Social Welfare Acts.</P>
      <P>Advances of benefit, however, sufficient to cover the purchase of comforts or the defraying of minor personal expenses while in hospital may be made and, in fact, such advances, up to 50 per cent of the benefit due, have been made in this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that this particular case highlights something and that a mistake was made in the passing of the Social Welfare Act when a case like <Col N="1005" /> this can arise?  The wife of a farm labourer was herself working for the purpose of helping to keep the house when she fell ill.  Her social welfare benefits would not be paid to her until she returned home.  The fact that she was in hospital prevented her from drawing benefit, even though the money was needed for the upkeep of the house.  Would the Minister agree that appears to be stretching the regulations a bit too far and would he ask the Minister for Social Welfare to consider amending the regulations so that where a wife is concerned, the regulations may be relaxed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know about amending the regulations.  It does not appear that there has been any stretching of the regulations in this case. Further, when we realise that the husband is working and three sons are working and living in the house, it can scarcely be said that the £1 withheld of the 40/- due would make all this difference in the meantime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely when the Minister has such a great file on the case, he is aware that nothing at all was paid to this woman until I raised the matter with the Minister's Department and made special representations that at least some of the amount be paid to her, pending a decision on the matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The regulations specifically provide for payment of personal comforts and personal costs that might fall to be defrayed while in the institution. I would not dispute whether or not it was as a result of the Deputy's representations: it probably was&mdash;I could not say.  However, it is being done in accordance with the regulations and not in spite of the regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister must know, from his file, that nothing was paid to the woman for the first month she was in hospital.  In fact, a letter addressed on 14th May last shows that she was not paid until representations were made.  Would the Minister have the matter further considered as it is a hardship on the family <Col N="1006" /> despite the fact that a number of the family are working?</P>

I might add that substantial progress has been made in the compilation of a register of these holdings, the total number of which comes to about 6,900.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 27 to 29 together.</P>
      <P>Detailed regulations for the sampling and testing at creameries of milk for butter-fat content and for the recording of such tests are set out in the Milk and Cream (Calculation of Price) Order, 1928, which was made under the Dairy Produce Act, 1924.</P>
      <P>The Order does not specifically provide for an appeal procedure in cases of dispute between suppliers and creamery owners, but the accuracy of sampling and testing of milk at creamery premises is regularly checked in the course of random routine inspections by officers of my Department and, in addition, check-tests are carried out as necessary to reassure any suppliers who may have doubts as to the accuracy of creamery testing in their particular cases.  Perhaps I might say at this point that a recent intensive examination of this nature extending over 15 days at a creamery in north Cork indicated that on no occasion during that period had milk samples been inaccurately taken or tested.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, under the general rules adopted by a large number of co-operative creamery societies, there is provision for the resolution of disputes between the society concerned and any of its members by means of arbitration conducted under the aegis of the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society.</P>
      <P>Arrangements for notifying milk suppliers of the results of butter-fat tests are matters within the discretion of the owners of the creamery premises concerned.  If any appreciable number of members of a co-operative creamery society should wish to be notified of the results of these tests at more frequent intervals than is at present the practice, it should be feasible for them to make effective representations to the management committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have seen the press report to which the Deputy refers in Question No. 27, and it seems to me to be a matter for <Col N="1010" /> regret that the co-operative society in question did not endeavour to have the case concerned settled by arbitration on the lines indicated in the general rules to which I have referred.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice (a) whether any interested parties, apart from the Department of Finance or any other Department, were consulted before he recently made the various fees orders, increasing fees payable by the general public in the Land Registry, Probate Office, Supreme Court, High Court, Circuit Court, and the District Court; (b) if he had any consultations with any outside bodies, and, if so who these outside bodies were; (c) if he had such consultations, what the reaction of such outside bodies were; and (d) if he will state in view of the fact that it once appeared to be the policy of the Government, in the light of various statements by members of the Government and in particular by the Minister himself and his predecessor in office to bring down the cost of litigation, the cost of dealings in connection with the transfers of land and in dealings with the Probate Office, whether that policy has now changed; if he will comment fully on this; and if the policy has not changed, how he can justify these increases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first two parts of the question is in the negative.  It has never been the practice or policy to have such consultations and when previous fees orders were made in 1956 there were no such consultations.</P>
      <P>With regard to the final part of the question, it is settled Government policy to keep down as far as possible the cost of litigation, the cost of dealings in land and the cost of taking out grants of probate and administration. The official fees which are payable in connection with these matters constitute only a small proportion of the total legal costs involved.</P>
      <P>The increase in court and Land Registry fees effected as from 1st April last were necessitated by increased operational costs.  I may add that in the case of the Land Registry there is a statutory obligation on me to ensure that registration fees are sufficient to cover expenses incurred under and incidental to the working of the Registration of Title Acts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs if he is aware that there is considerable difficulty in obtaining country numbers from the city of Dublin on the automatic dial and <i>vice versa</i>; if, in view of the fact that within the last three years he undertook to take steps to improve the telephone system generally, he will detail the steps that he took; and if he considers that the service is as effective as it should be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that difficulties in dialling trunk calls because of pressure on the automatic equipment during periods of heavy traffic are being experienced.  Additional equipment to cater for the increasing traffic has been installed and more which has been on order for a considerable time is at present being installed.</P>
      <P>Very extensive improvements have been made in the telephone system in recent years in the way of providing additional trunk circuits and the development of the automatic system, and the programme of improvement is continuing.  I shall give particulars in greater detail when the Estimate for my Department comes before the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not consider advertising what are the off-peak hours so that people who can do so could wait to dial in the off-peak hours and thus reduce the pressure in the peak hours?</P>

      <P>The report deals mainly with the need to develop a wide range of community services to enable the aged to live as long as possible in their own homes or in the homes of their relatives and friends.</P>
      <P>Broadly, the services recommended include specialist medical care; nursing care; care by para-medical personnel like occupational therapists, chiropodists, social workers etc.; home helps; meals on wheels and advice as to nutrition; laundry; social clubs; special housing; welfare type homes; boarding-out; community involvement; publicity; research and retirement counselling.  With regard to retirement, the report states that a rigid observance of 65 years as the age for retirement from many occupations could tend to accelerate the geriatric problem in a number of cases; if recommends that despite the obvious difficulties in treating the problem on an individual basis, it might well prove desirable to do so where feasible.</P>
      <P>The report is being examined in my Department and a copy has been made available to the inter-departmental committee which I have established to consider matters in this field generally.</P>

      <P>On becoming aware that a majority of the non-nursing personnel of the Dublin voluntary hospitals, who are seeking improved working conditions, had rejected a Labour Court recommendation and that a serious situation was threatening to develop, I arranged earlier this month to receive a deputation from the Irish Transport and General Workers Union to discuss the matters at issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following an exchange of views with the union representatives, I suggested that they should resume discussions with the employers under the <Col N="1027" /> auspices of the Labour Court and I offered my services in arranging a meeting.  This suggestion was accepted by the union, whereupon I made an approach to officers of the Labour Court who consented readily to initiate further discussions between the union, the Federated Union of Employers and the Hospitals Commission.  These discussions are now proceeding, and I am confident that an amicable settlement will emerge.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the Deputy's question springs from my recommendation, aimed&mdash;with other recent recommendations which I have also made&mdash;at sweeping away certain archaic practices and restrictions applying to the nursing profession.  In the case of nurses' uniforms, what I suggested was that the traditional type of uniform should be replaced by one simpler and modern in design.  So far as I know, no new design has yet made its appearance, and I fail to understand how the Deputy could know, any more than myself, what a simple, modern type of uniform would cost compared with the traditional uniform.  I cannot <Col N="1028" /> accept at this stage that a new type uniform should cost more than the old.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Clearly my knowledge is superior to the Minister's.  Is the Minister aware that the nursing profession, particularly those who are required to pay for their uniforms, are concerned that the changes he recommended may cost them more?  In the event of such changes costing more, will the Minister ensure that they will be remunerated on a scale which will avoid them being at a loss?</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>To the first part of the Deputy's question, the answer is in the negative and therefore the second part does not arise.  In other words, no anxiety was expressed to me by the worthy representatives I met from the Irish Nurses Organisation and the other representatives I met.  They get an allowance for a uniform&mdash;I think the figure is £15.  I do not think a new uniform is going to cost that.  As a matter of fact, with new designs there will be less material.  I have already given the nurses shorter hours.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The expenditure arising from reductions in the working hours, as approved by me, will, in the case of local authority staffs, be included in the revenue expenditure of these authorities and will be reckoned towards the grants payable from the Vote for my Department.  In the case of a voluntary hospital participating in the scheme for payment of grants from the Hospitals Trust Fund towards revenue deficits, approved expenditure will be recoupable by way of grant to the extent to which it cannot be met from the ordinary income of the hospital.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he is aware that a claim for a 40 hour week was made on the 20th April, 1966, by trade unions representing psychiatric nurses; and if having regard to his recent statement that general trained nurses should not be expected or required to devote more than 42½ hours a week, or 85 hours a fortnight, to the exacting duties of their profession, he favours the introduction of a 40 hour week for psychiatric nurses.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is in the affirmative.  I understand that the psychiatric nurses' claim has been discussed at a meeting of the Mental Hospitals Joint Industrial Council <Col N="1032" /> under the chairmanship of an officer of the Labour Court and that a further meeting of the council has been arranged.</P>
      <P>Deputies will be aware that, in the course of a recent statement, I said that &ldquo;the nature of nursing duties places nurses in a special category in the matter of working hours and that they are entitled to a reduction in the hours of duty which they have accepted so cheerfully down the years as a commonplace of their vocation.&rdquo;  I propose, very shortly, to issue a recommendation to the employing bodies that duty schedules should be adjusted as soon as possible so that nurses, including psychiatric nurses, will not be required to work more than 42½ hours a week or 85 hours a fortnight.</P>

      <P>While I should like to be of assistance, since I appreciate the Deputy's interest, it would be very unwise, I think, for me as Minister for Health to make any comment that might anticipate the outcome of this particular claim, beyond stating that nurses in general, including psychiatric nurses, have got an improvement of a reduction in working hours.</P>

      <P>Last night we were discussing this amendment in the context of, I think, amendment No. 11.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>And we were also to discuss on this amendment matters which might consequently arise under section 17 which was put through the House.  The Finance Act of 1965 provided certain new and onerous provisions which unduly penalised those endeavouring, either through contributory schemes, or otherwise, to make provision for their dependants after they had passed on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Various representations have, I know, been sent to the Minister in relation to this over the past year, and it is a matter of great regret to those who made those representations that the Bill introduced by the Minister does not contain greater amelioration than is contained in section 18.  Section 18 does increase, to some extent and with retrospective effect to the passage of last year's Finance Act, the remission of duty that will arise to a widow and children.  I do not know whether the Minister will be able to find any other precedent, but this is the only precedent that I could find whereby the remission dated back to the Finance Act of <Col N="1038" /> the previous year.  I suggest the reason the Minister went outside established practice&mdash;and I am glad he did&mdash;was that he realised when he sat back and thought about it that the action he had taken last year was, as we said from these benches and as we endeavoured to prove to him in the Division Lobby, harsh and onerous.</P>
    <P>One group of people affected in relation to the passage of this Act is the officers' association of the ESB.  The Minister is aware that they sent him a memorandum on 19th May last showing the additional duty that would be payable by members of their association as a result of the Act of last year. In the first example the association gave, the increase in duty that was payable was no less than 130 per cent, going up from £274 to £632.  In the second example given, the increase was 138 per cent, and the Minister has had before him the figures concerned.</P>
    <P>It seems to me there is no justification for the Minister, because he wants to stop tax avoidance, hitting innocent people in this way.  The Minister said last year he was anxious to avoid a person's utilising the non-aggregable provisions of the Married Women's Property Act as a means of avoiding tax and as a means of making artificial companies for that purpose.  That may be, but it does not justify his taking a step to ensure that his net covered the genuine, innocent case, as it does in respect of the association who made these representations to the Minister, as well as catching avoidance cases.</P>
    <P>There is another class of case which will be hit by this and which is not going to get, as far as I can see, any of the relief provided by section 29 of the Finance Act, 1965.  That is the case of a person who brought up children but who, because of the age of the children at the date of the Adoption Act, was not able legally to adopt them.  There are not many such cases but there are a certain number.  I have in front of me a case in which a person is faced with the payment of duty of the order of £500 instead of its being of the order of £50, because the Act does not take account of these cases where there has been <i>de facto</i> but not <i>de jure</i> adoption.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1039" /> I find it difficult also to understand how this section of last year and section 17 will operate in respect of the many schemes there are for widows' pensions. In many companies pensions are payable to widows for life or until remarriage. I understand the Revenue Commissioners are able to arrive at an appropriate discount of the widow's likely chances of remarriage.  I do not know whether the Minister or I would be able to do it, but I understand the Revenue Commissioners do arrive at such a discount.  I would be interested if the Minister knows how the computations are made, unless, of course, personal attendance is also required.</P>
    <P>Whether that is so or not, there is a substantial number of cases in which there are other discretions vested in relation to these pension funds.  In one case in respect of which representations have been made to me, the widow's pension is made up of two parts.  The first part is the funded part, that is, the part that is payable by the pension trustees out of funds and investments in their hands.  It is easy to deal with that, but the second part is expressed in the terms of the pension deed to be payable so long as the prosperity of the company justifies it.  I do not know how it is going to be possible to make any computation of value in respect of pension schemes that are in that form, and many of them are.  Many of them provide a basic pension and a bonus on to that basic pension, varying according to the prosperity of the company.</P>
    <P>How can the value of the widow's pension and, therefore, the gratuity which follows from the pensionable amount, be assessed where it is expressed to be payable only during the payer's capacity to pay it?  The vagueness of the provisions in the Act will mean that in the case of many pension schemes, administrative difficulties will arise which would not arise at all if the Minister had not introduced section 29 of the Act of 1965.  Apart from the principle involved in relation to the aggregation of pensions, the Minister will have to do something in regard to this analogous to what he agreed to do yesterday in relation to Part VII of the Finance Act of 1965 <Col N="1040" /> dealing with the all-embracing clause for developments.</P>
    <P>What has happened is that, in his efforts to prevent avoidance, the Minister has thrown his net in such a way that it catches other cases&mdash;though it does not catch all of them, as I reminded the Minister by an interjection on the Second Stage&mdash;and it is unfortunate that for the sake of alleged uniformity, the position so arises.</P>
    <P>We had a long discussion on this last year, and I do not think there is anything that one can fruitfully do today except to say that all the fears we indicated last year have proved in practice to have been justified.  The last 12 months experience of the Act of 1965 has shown that it was undesirable and that the Minister would have been well advised and would be well advised even as late as this, to repeal the provisions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Lynch) Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>I know it is not necessary to go into the history of aggregation of different parts of a deceased's estate for the purpose of death duties, but, in order to explain the background of the introduction of section 25 last year and to indicate why I cannot accept the amendments put down by Deputy Sweetman and Deputy Cosgrave this year, it is no harm to remind the House, in the first instance, that insurance policies as such were never free of aggregation with the rest of the estate.</P>
      <P>This question went back as far as the original Act dealing with property left by a deceased, in 1894.  Section 4 of that Act included a proviso that property in which the deceased never had an interest was not aggregable with the rest of the estate.  That was to deal with the situation that was often created at the time where A left property in trust to B for the life of C.  When C died, that property, in which C never had an interest, would be aggregable with the estate.  The property that A left in that form to B, and possibly his successors, would be aggregable with the estate of C for estate duty purposes.</P>

    <P>In time, the exclusion of property of that kind was extended to property in which the deceased never had an interest.  Property, even though it derived <Col N="1041" /> from the deceased and was, in fact, provided for him and his successors, and formed part of the deceased's estate, nevertheless, was not aggregable with the rest of the estate for estate duty purposes.  Therefore, if somebody left money in one form or another to a person indefeasibly vested in that person, that property was not aggregable with the rest of the deceased's estate even though the deceased himself provided it.</P>
    <P>Policies of assurance as such were never in that category, unless the policy, on the death of the deceased who paid the premiums, was indefeasibly vested in, say, his widow.  If it was not so indefeasibly vested, even though he had made it in such a form that his personal representative would be the immediate payee, even though he had left it in his will, the proceeds of that policy would have been aggregable with the rest of his estate and, therefore, subject to estate duty. Even the policy itself, if it was up to a certain amount, would have been, in any event, subject to estate duty, even though not aggregated with the rest of the estate.</P>
    <P>There evolved, then, the system whereby, under the Married Women's Status Act, policies of assurance were effected by a man in favour of his wife and these were not aggregable, nor even aggregable <i>inter se,</i> but Deputy Sweetman, when Minister for Finance, made these policies aggregable <i>inter se</i>.  In other words, if there was a lump of an estate, £x value and another lump, £y value, made up of Married Women's Status Act policies, as a result of legislation put forward by Deputy Sweetman, all these policies were aggregated in the lump of the estate value £y and, if the aggregation was high enough, would be subject to estate duty.</P>
    <P>The only change effected, then, by this section 25 was that that kind of property of the deceased was aggregated with the rest of the deceased's estate.  From the wording of Deputy Cosgrave's amendment, unwittingly, I would say, the impression is created that insurance policies were not aggregated with the rest of the estate for estate duty purposes.  Indeed they were. <Col N="1042" /> There is only one kind, what we know now as Married Women's Status Act policies, which were not aggregated formerly.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman mentioned last night that the case where a man dies young leaving a widow and young family is more hard-hit by this provision than others but I think it is no harm to take a couple of examples.  If he were a young man, I take it he would not have had much time to accumulate a big estate.  Under section 29 of the Bill now, which extends certain reliefs, if a man leaves £10,000 after him and leaves a widow and one child the estate does not pay any duty. If he leaves a widow and two children, there is no duty payable on his estate up to £12,600 and if he leaves a widow and three children, up to £13,750.  That is a sizeable estate to be free of duty.</P>
    <P>As well as that, if there were superannuation death benefit which did not exceed £5,000 that, too, would be exempt.  So that the type of hardship cases that are referred to are in the main exempt, certainly up to the limits I have mentioned here.</P>
    <P>With regard to the comment about retrospection, I readily admit that I deliberately made the new reliefs given in section 29 retrospective with the introduction of the section last year because I recognised that some hardship cases arose during the year and since the legislation was introduced for the first time last year, I thought it was only right, no matter with what precedent I was breaking, that I should give the benefit of the extra reliefs being provided this year to estates which came under duty since the Finance Act of last year.  I do not think there is anything wrong in that. Deputy Sweetman welcomes it and, if there was a breaking with precedent, I think it was worthwhile in this case.</P>
    <P>There are, of course, under the provisions of last year's Act, other means whereby the value of an estate is reduced. If the estate consists of insurance policies, the value may be reduced for the purpose of estate duty. That is, we have made use of the device of a reduction of the value of gifts <i>inter vivos</i> from three to five, three to <Col N="1043" /> four and three years down, whereby the policy, five years before death, will be reduced by 60 per cent and the value of the accumulative part of the policy will be reduced proportionately in the succeeding two years.</P>
    <P>So that all these easements are considerable and, I think, take most of the hardship cases out of the estate <Col N="1044" /> duty net.  As in all legislation designed to defeat avoidance of payment of tax and of duty, it is difficult not to hit some cases where hardship might accrue but I suggest that the manner in which I have met these hardship cases is reasonably adequate and, indeed, takes hardship out of the payment of death duties in most cases, if not in all.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 12;</P>
      <P>Before section 20 and in Part V, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;20. &mdash;(1) In lieu of the provisions of paragraphs (i), (ii) and (iii) of section 37 (1) of the Finance Act, 1963, the following provisions shall, subject to the next subsection, apply and have effect in respect of every accounting period ending on or after the 1st day of April, 1966:</P>
      <P>(i)  subsection (1) of section 52 of the Finance Act, 1920, shall be construed and have effect as if &lsquo;twenty-three per cent&rsquo; were substituted for &lsquo;five per cent.&rsquo;</P>
      <P>(ii)  paragraph (a) of the proviso to that subsection shall be construed and have effect as if &lsquo;tax shall be charged at a rate of seven and one-half per cent on so much of the profits as does not exceed two thousand five hundred pounds, and where the profits are profits arising in some shorter accounting period, tax shall be charged at a rate of seven and one-half per cent on such amount of the profits as bears to two thousand five hundred pounds&rsquo; were substituted for &lsquo;no tax shall be charged on the first five hundred pounds thereof, and where the profits are profits arising in some shorter accounting period, no tax shall be charged on such amount of the profits as bears to five hundred pounds&rsquo;;</P>
      <P>(iii)  paragraph (b) of that proviso shall be construed and have effect as if &lsquo;thirty per cent&rsquo; were substituted for &lsquo;ten per cent&rsquo;.</P>
      <P>(2)  In the case of any such accounting period which began before the 1st day of April, 1966, the profits shall be apportioned between the part of the period before that day and the part thereof after the 31st day of March, 1966, in proportion to the respective lengths of those parts and&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  as respects so much of the profits as is apportioned to the first-mentioned part, corporation profits tax shall be charged thereon at the rate of fifteen per cent, provided that tax shall be charged at the rate of five per cent on so much thereof as bears to two thousand five hundred pounds the same proportion as that part bears to twelve months,</P>
      <P>(b)  as respects so much of the profits as is apportioned to the second-mentioned part, corporation profits tax shall be charged thereon at the rate of twenty-three per cent, provided that tax shall be charged at the rate of seven and one-half per cent on so much thereof as bears to two thousand five hundred pounds the same proportion as that part bears to twelve months,</P>
      <P>(c)  the amount of tax payable by a company incorporated by or under the laws of the State shall in no case exceed the sum of the following amounts:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(i)  the amount represented by 20 per cent of the balance of the profits apportioned to the first-mentioned part remaining after <Col N="1047" /> allowing such proportion of the deductions specified in paragraph (b) of the proviso to section 52 (1) of the Finance Act, 1920, as would be appropriate to that part if those deductions were apportioned in the same manner as the profits are required by this subsection to be apportioned, and</P>
    <P>(ii)  the amount represented by 30 per cent of the balance of the profits apportioned to the second-mentioned part remaining after allowing such proportion of those deductions as would be appropriate to that part if those deductions were apportioned as aforesaid.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is an amendment in effect putting in a new section to measure the rate of corporation profits tax.  It was not possible to do so before because the rate of British corporation tax was at the time of drafting not known.  It is now known and our corporation profits tax, because of the double taxation agreement with the British Government, is related to the British corporation profits tax.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 13:</P>
      <P>Before section 21, but in Part V, to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Section 8 of the Finance Act, 1924, as amended subsequently (which provides for relief in respect of error or mistake) shall apply to tax charged under an assessment to Corporation Profits Tax as it applies to tax charged under an assessment to Income Tax.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to provide for corporation profits tax the same provision as already exists for income tax, namely, that if there is an error or mistake in the accounts submitted <Col N="1048" /> and consequent assessments to tax, they can be corrected later.  As I understand the matter, there is no such provision in relation to corporation profits tax and I do not quite know why.  It may well be that perhaps the reason was that in earlier years corporation profits tax did not become applicable until after the first £2,500 of income.  The Finance Act of 1963 provided that the first £2,500 of profits would be assessable to corporation profits tax at five per cent.  The remaining profits are taxed at 15 per cent.  The effect of this is that corporation profits tax is no longer something with which the big company alone is concerned: every company of every size is now concerned with it.</P>
    <P>The suggestion I make does not add any new principle to the taxation law.  It merely provides that the income tax provision in relation to error and mistake can now be applied to corporation profits tax.  The provision, of course, is only operative if the mistake or error is found within six years, I think, after the end of the year of assessment.  As I am merely transferring a provision of section 8 of the Finance Act of 1924 which already applies to income tax, that limitation of six years would also apply to the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no objection to the principle of this amendment. As Deputy Sweetman has said, the principle already applies in the case of income tax.  One can readily understand why it is statutorily provided for in the case of income tax.  Individuals may be more prone to make mistakes in the matter of returns for income tax purposes than companies would be in the case of returns for corporation profits tax.  In practice, however, it seldom arises and when it does, the Revenue Commissioners make very adequate provision for the admission of late appeals.  I have no objection to making provision for something that has become common in practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Deputy would leave the amendment to Report Stage, and if it is possible to bring it in on that Stage I shall certainly do so.  I understand, however, there may be a lot of loose <Col N="1049" /> ends to tie up and it might not be possible to do it even there.  No hardship is ever caused by the fact that it is not written into legislation and I can assure the Deputy that if it cannot be done on Report Stage, it will be done in the next Bill in any case.  I think he could withdraw the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly, I could. As I understand it, the Minister will do it on Report Stage if he can and, if he cannot do it on Report Stage, it will be reintroduced next year by the Minister for Finance and, meanwhile, the relief will be given, concessionwise, by the Revenue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 14, in the name of Deputy Byrne:</P>
      <P>Before section 21, but in Part V, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Subsection (2) (b) of section 53 of the Finance Act, 1920, is hereby amended by the addition of the words &lsquo;other than loans granted by the Industrial Credit Company which are repayable over a period not exceeding twenty years.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment is to prevent a limitation on permanent loans.  I never knew quite as much about corporation profits tax as I should and therefore, because this is entirely a technical matter, I am treading a little on dangerous ground.  I may accept from the Minister a little tuition as he has had to accept it in other matters before.</P>
      <P>Section 53 of the Finance Act, 1920, provides that no deduction is allowed from corporation profits tax in respect of interest on permanent loans.  It is difficult to see why that provision was introduced.  It seems that it was introduced to prevent the allowance of interest on semi-permanent capital such as debentures.  In the then conditions, it did not seem unreasonable: nowadays, the position is entirely different.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many firms get accommodation and finance from people such as the Industrial <Col N="1050" /> Credit Company on the basis of repayment over as long as five, ten and 15 years.  Such accommodation would more normally have been the type of temporary bank accommodation that would have ranked as a corporation profits tax deduction.  Section 53, therefore, does not seem to apply adequately in the present circumstances. I think it desirable that it should be liberalised so as to provide for this new machinery of industrial finance and to define as permanent loan something that was perhaps repayable by instalments over perhaps 20 years. I think that the term &ldquo;permanent loan&rdquo; is not defined in section 53 of the Finance Act, 1920.</P>
    <P>One of the provisions that has been accepted in practice in relation to these loans is that if a loan is repayable at not more than three months notice, then it would be termed a short-term loan and would rank for relief for corporation profits tax purposes.  The Minister will agree with me that the type of loan given by the Industrial Credit Company for working accommodation, or perhaps the type of loan given by finance houses for extended hire purchase, which is a loan repayable at fixed intervals over perhaps five or seven years, is much more the basis at present and it would be entirely contrary to the need of those loans and to the spirit of those loans if it were to be provided that they would be repayable on less than three months interest.</P>
    <P>The whole modern industrial trend is to obtain working capital from the Industrial Credit Company and the merchant bankers.  There is a swing away from the commercial banks.  The ordinary interest due to the commercial banks on overdrafts is allowable as a deduction from corporation profits tax assessments but the type of merchant bank and industrial credit company interest to which I have referred is not so allowed.  I think, therefore, the Minister should allow this and, if I may so put it, modernise section 53 of the Finance Act, 1920.  Whether the exact wording of the amendment is such as he would like is another matter.  I am not interested in wording in Finance Bills: I am always interested <Col N="1051" /> in principles.  If the Minister tells me that he will accept the principle but does not like my wording, I shall be quite happy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot go quite as far as that.  On the other hand, what the Deputy has suggested is something that will have to be considered and is being considered at the moment. Obviously the framers of the 1920 Act, when they introduced corporation profits tax, wanted to ensure that there would be no deduction from the tax in respect of dividends, distribution of profits, interest on money borrowed from a person having an interest in the firm, and so on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot see how it would arise for a dividend.  Is corporation profits tax not payable before the dividend is struck?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>

      <P>If this amendment is adopted, there would be a danger of shifting the capital of companies from shares to loans and that could ultimately lead to tax avoidance by the directors of the company, particularly if it is a fairly tightly-held company or a small company.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the word: a closely-held company.  Times have changed considerably since 1920.  There are many reasons for getting in new capital by way of debenture and loans <Col N="1052" /> from organisations such as the Industrial Credit Company.  There are other types of organisations that would advance loans to companies as loans are often advanced to the Stock Exchange and to insurance companies. If loans from the Industrial Credit Company were excluded, there would be little reason why loans from insurance companies should not be excluded as well.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the motivation of the amendment.  I also suggest that I could not go so far, in principle, as accepting all the Deputy says.  There is a reason for the change in the law at the present time and the general question of amending section 53 of the 1920 Act, by allowing a deduction of interest on permanent loans, is under consideration.  I could not undertake that that consideration would be no deduction from the tax of the passage of the Bill through the Dáil.  Nevertheless, it is under consideration.  However, there are so many factors to be taken into account and so many safeguards would have to be built into any change in the law that I would prefer if the Deputy would not press his amendment at this stage.  I could not give any indication at all that I could provide for a suitable amendment on Report Stage &mdash;in fact, I think I could say I could not&mdash;but consideration of the amendment of section 53 is proceeding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be quite happy with that in one respect.  I agree with the Minister that the type of amendment that might have to be drawn on this might be too complex to be drawn between now and Report Stage next Tuesday.  But I do not want to let the matter rest so that nothing will be known about this matter until this time next year.  It would be desirable that public notice be given of the completion of the Minister's examination without waiting for the Finance Bill, 1967.  I shall put down a question for the first day of the resumption.  If the Minister is not able to deal with it then, he can give an indication when I am to repeat it.</P>

      <P>Do I correctly read paragraph (a) that in the case of dances, tax is payable where the dance is the primary attraction?  If one has a dinner dance, it is fair enough to say one goes to take one's dinner while one dances and therefore dancing is the primary purpose.  But if one has a dinner and a few minor instrumentalists come along afterwards, one has a social and two or three people get up and strum a piano and there is an impromptu dance, not a dance as such, I think that is outside the terms of the section but I would like the Minister to confirm that I have correctly understood it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">

The Deputy will be aware of many such functions. There might be a reunion.  Speeches are made after dinner and a dance follows as a matter incidental to the rest of the proceedings.  These are not caught by the section at all.</P>

      <P>The purpose of section 23 is to secure that action against a defaulter for the recovery of turnover tax will not be prejudiced by the submission of late returns while the proceedings are in train.  It has happened that people default in making returns and when proceedings are ultimately brought against them, they wait until the proceedings have reached a late stage and then make a return.  That nullifies the proceedings taken up to that stage.  This is again putting the situation back in the same position as applies in income tax at present.</P>

In other words, is the qualification of processing operative for the year to which the <Col N="1058" /> accounts refer rather than the year in which the accounts are made up and presented?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I say something on this section in extension of what I said at Question Time today? This provides for the payment of somebody to manage the Government stocks and there is genuine difficulty at present for many people who are not being paid their interest on Government stocks.  During the currency of the bank dispute, anyone can obtain currency of some sort or another for what might be termed good cheques.  Even for this Government, a pay order of the Government would be considered a good cheque, or a dividend warrant even of this Government, but the dividend warrants are not being issued.  The position is, therefore, that many people who are retired and who are in tight circumstances depend to a very large degree for their very existence on what they are able to buy with the interest from fixed Government loans.  We are now in the situation, unless I am wrong, in which one Government loan is more than a month outstanding and&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, Deputy Norton is right.  There are two.  A large number of people literally depend for their existence on the amount they get from these loans to eke out small pensions and small incomes. <Col N="1059" /> I dare say it is true that the Minister cannot go in and inspect the records of Government holders in the banks but there should be some scheme provided by the Government&mdash;and it should not be necessary for us to refer to this in the House in order to get it done&mdash;whereby the person who is able to prove that he has a Government loan of so much, and would have received on 1st and 15th June, or whatever the dates are, an instalment of the amount payable by the Minister, could at least get an advance on account of that.</P>
      <P>I wonder what is going to happen if I issue a writ against the Minister for Finance for the dividends and interest due to me on the loan that was payable earlier this month, if I had any.  The Minister would have no defence in law against such an action.  Because people in difficult circumstances are not taking actions like that against him, it is very wrong that he has done nothing whatever to relieve their plight.  In one weekly paper recently there was an example given&mdash;I do not know how true it is&mdash;of a person who had money on deposit in a bank and would not be paid.  He threatened to issue a writ and was paid forthwith, as he was entitled to be paid.  Had he gone to court, he would have got judgment against the bank.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I venture to state that if anybody, who has not received interest on any of the loans which he or she holds, and which interest was payable by the Minister for Finance on a date past, and if he or she issues a writ against the Minister, he or she must get judgment. It is reprehensible in the extreme that before the Government should act in relation to this matter, there would have to be a flood of actions against them.  This is not an abstract matter. It is not a theoretical suggestion.  I have received more than one letter from people complaining.  I have received one letter in which the man concerned says he will go to his solicitor and take an action against the Minister. If he does, he will get judgment and the costs should not be paid out of the Contingency Fund but out of the <Col N="1060" /> joint personal fortunes of the various Ministers who have done nothing to see that the bank dispute be brought to an end, on the one hand, and on the other hand, nothing to relieve the plight of those who are really badly affected by it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with what Deputy Sweetman has said.  I was approached the other day by someone who was due to be paid a dividend on 15th June on the 5½ per cent National Loan.  I did intend to put a question down, but Deputy Sweetman forestalled me, to find out what steps the Government are taking and why something has not been done.  Surely it should be a simple matter for the Government to do something about this?  It is possible for some people to cash Government cheques through commercial concerns, but surely it is the Post Office, which is a Government Department, which should be responsible for cashing them?  Since the amount of money involved in paying these two dividends must be fairly considerable, as a matter of curiosity, who is saving money? Will the investors get additional interest on their interest for that period during which they are out of their money or will the bank hold on to it? What is the position about the amount of money the Government have been lending to themselves interest-free?</P>

With regard to the strike, Deputy Sweetman alleges we have done nothing about setting it.  The Deputy knows we have our organisation for that purpose and that organisation is working constantly, and was working constantly up to last night when certain disagreement was expressed by the staff side with the proposals put up by the employers' side.</P>
      <P>I do not like to comment further on the strike, since it is not yet settled, but it has created difficulties.  It was hoped, having regard to the settlement in the Six Counties, that the strike would also be settled here.  I am told the terms being negotiated were somewhat similar to the terms accepted in Northern Ireland.  Unfortunately no solution has been reached.  I promised the Deputy today that I will see what, if anything, can be done.  When his question came into the office, I got the draft answer and made inquiries then to see if there was anything that could be done.  I was assured that any steps we might be able to take would be impracticable. That unfortunately happens to be the position still.  Nevertheless, I will see if anything can be done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The register of some Government securities is held by the Central Bank and the old section 19 of the 1937 Act is the section that makes the Bank of Ireland the agent for certain Government stocks.  The Central Bank is now an agent as well and the type of remuneration the Central Bank would require would not be the same as that for the Bank of Ireland.  Even though it has not been settled yet, this section deals with the Central Bank being established as an agent for managing some Government stocks.</P>

      <P>Oh, yes, but never before did the Minister for Finance of the day have to go to the Central Bank and get it to take over and fund a loan in that fashion?</P>
      <P>The Minister said just now that they have done something to end the strike. The fact is either the Minister is at fault, or his colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, is at fault, or the agency is at fault, because nothing has been done effectively to bring this dispute to an end and the dispute is causing serious disruption of the life of the business community.  I can understand the Minister hoping until last night that the strike might be settled because the one in Northern Ireland was settled.  But the fact is it has not been settled and the House and the country are entitled to know what the Minister for Finance now proposes to do about it because he is the Minister for whom this is a particularly appropriate matter.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce still deals with labour relations, but this particular matter is within the purview of the Minister for Finance.  It is a fact in regard to the non-payment of the interest to which Deputy Norton referred, that the person who is going to make money out of that non-payment is the Minister because he will not have to provide by Exchequer Bills, as early as he would otherwise have to provide, for the payment of the interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1064" /> Be that as is may, the baby is squarely with the Minister and the country wants to know what he is going to do to bring this disruption of business to an end and to bring to an end the hardship that is being caused to many people who are not being paid Government loan interest and in respect of which the Minister has made it clear he has great difficulty in finding a means of taking them out of the hardship.</P>

      <P>When this strike started, at all times the Chief Conciliation Officer of the Labour Court was in touch with the situation and keeping the Government, through the Minister for Industry and Commerce, informed of the situation. When the current negotiations, that is, the negotiations that ended last night, started, it was at the instigation of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, following a meeting of the Government, that the Chief Conciliation Officer entered the fray, so to speak.  These negotiations broke down only last night.  Surely Deputy Sweetman does not suggest that somebody should go rushing in&mdash;even though I recognise the urgency of the situation&mdash;when we have not yet had a report back from the Chief Conciliation Officer and, even if we had, we would not have had time to consider it?  It is hardly fair, so soon after these negotiations have broken down, for the Deputy to imply that the Government are doing nothing.</P>

Now the Minister will not even say whether he is prepared to pay interest to them on the money which he is withholding.  If anybody tried to keep money from the Government, the Revenue Commissioners would be up in arms, looking for one per cent interest per month on it.  If the Minister does not do something about it, he, or his Department&mdash; I do not mean the Minister personally &mdash;is engaging in theft from the shareholders, the people who subscribed to Government loans.  The bank strike has been on now for a period of five or six weeks.  Commercial firms in town, to whom it was obvious the strike was coming, had the foresight to make arrangements for the withdrawal of money to meet their obligations. Surely the Government could have made arrangements so that the warrants could be posted earlier and that they would not be overtaken by the situation which has developed?</P>

The import preferential rate goes up from £13 5s 6d to £21 4s 10d.  That is very nearly threequarters as much again. There is a difference in the strength of an Irish liqueur and a good bottle of Power's Gold Label.

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>When the House adjourned, I had just time to refer to the fact that we were approaching the Indian summer of Fianna Fáil rule in this country.  I did not have time to develop that very far.  In the earlier debate in March last, the Minister asked what had gone wrong with the Budget introduced in the previous May and went on to recount some of the problems which forced him to bring in the pretty harsh Budget of earlier this year. He referred at that time to the deficit of £8 million and he indicated last week some of the problems that had forced him to bring in what has been described as this mini-Budget, although I think some of the political commentators <Col N="1074" /> have been rather fanciful in describing it as a mini-Budget.  He indicated then what the breakdown of the additional expenditure was.  He referred to the amounts that would be going to agriculture and to certain State employees.</P>
      <P>Probably the most regrettable thing about the money going to agriculture is that the Government do not appear to have harnessed this money to any constructive programme for agriculture. The amount now being paid to agriculture is an attempt to buy off the criticism which has been mounting in the agricultural sector of the community of the mismanagement of the Government during the past few months.  City people must regret the fact that the money now given to agriculture is not being tied to a productive programme or to one in which the small farmer, with whom we are concerned, could see much hope for the future.</P>
      <P>The most regrettable feature of the series of disastrous Budgets which the Government have been pushing through has been the necessity which this Government have brought about of financing the capital programme from external sources.  I doubt if the framers of the Second Programme, which this Government were happy to acknowledge as one they were proud to implement, anticipated that the productive increases so necessary to bring this country forward would need to rely so much on external sources.  This is a very dangerous manner in which to finance this productive part of our programme to the extent to which the present Government are doing it.  Probably the most depressing feeling of all at the moment is that the people can hardly see any way out of the economic morass into which the Government seem to be bringing the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last Budget gave a chilly hint of further measures in the autumn, and from all sides of the House, we must record our deep alarm at the manner in which the economic affairs of this country appear to be run on a day-today basis.  We have a capital programme which is being based more and more on external resources in a market which the Government admit is becoming <Col N="1075" /> tighter and tighter as regards the raising of loans.  It is regrettable that a so-called sovereign Government should have to seek the Nova Scotian loan.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>How would the Deputy suggest that we fill a programme of £100 million?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government, by their mismanagement of the nation's affairs, are now creating a situation in which the problems are becoming more and more difficult of solution.  These problems have now come to the sorry pass that the people can see the chaotic state of affairs behind the smokescreen of the alleged progress of the past year or two.  In this year the truth has become clearer and clearer to the ordinary people and all around the country they are beginning to see through the Government's smokescreen. The most educational exercise the Irish people have ever undergone is these two Budgets brought in by the Fianna Fáil Government.  These Budgets have shown the Government to be growing reckless in the application of their policies to the country; they have shown them to be a Government grown arrogant in power.  A Government who have been in office for ten years are apt to lose touch with reality and this is what has happened to this Government.</P>
      <P>This foreign borrowing to which the Government seem to have committed themselves is expensive, and will be found to be more expensive as time goes by.  The repayment period is shorter than for domestic loans and the repayments of the principal are onerous to our particular economy.  Added to this particular policy of borrowing from abroad is the undeniable fact that there does not seem to be any sign of an effective improvement in our economy, any evidence that the Government know where they are going or any hope that we can see our way out of this particular spiral.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This wholesale tax the Government have brought in is selective to the extent that it has avoided some of the pitfalls which we feared at the time <Col N="1076" /> would occur when the turnover tax was introduced.  It excludes certain items on which at that time we warned against the imposition of that tax.  We pointed to the effect it would have on the vast majority of working people at that time.  I do not think there is any guarantee that the wholesale tax now being imposed will not result in the end in affecting the retail or consumer level. The Government, by tampering once more with the retail price level, may make out of date the particular struggle now going on for the £1 increase which the trade unions have been fighting in the past few months.  It may give the final push to the shaky structure of prices and wages and this interference with retail levels may occur as a result of the wholesale tax.</P>
    <P>I know the Government have been anxious to avoid interfering with items which appear most prominently in the Consumer Price Index but I feel that items, even excluding the imposition of extra tax on these items, that come in at wholesale level, may find a way to transfer their increases to the retail level and give an extra push to inflation because, as others have pointed out, this country is in the grip, if not of galloping inflation, of inflation which is going at a steady trot and which needs to be arrested very rapidly.</P>
    <P>We have argued for a stay on prices. We have pointed to the dizzy procession of rising prices which occurred in the past year and a half and which has brought the people out on the streets in strikes of one kind or another.  We felt some sort of prices machinery was necessary and the Government, in one of the reports available on this matter, acknowledged that prices since the period of bringing in the actual price control machinery have not risen at the same rate as in the period before that. The price control machinery, as we pointed out, was brought in by the Government very near the end of the lifetime of the late National Wage Agreement and so was not as powerful an instrument as it could have been at the start of that National Wage Agreement in stabilising prices.</P>
    <P>All this travelling abroad by Government Ministers and this dependence <Col N="1077" /> on foreign sources of revenue to finance our capital programme occurs against the background of an economy in which employment has been dropping, and catastrophically in agriculture. Industrial employment has not risen at the rate envisaged two or three years ago by NIEC.  This is a severe disappointment to all of us because of the very thin partition, economically speaking, dividing this part of the country from becoming a tourist resort for European countries.  I am thinking now of population figures because if this country follows a downward course once more in its population, just one more drop in that direction will mean that we have passed the point of no return.  If our population is rising and job opportunities increasing, one can see hope for the economy in the future, but against a background of inflation, falling employ-ployment and emigration that is very difficult.</P>
    <P>Government Ministers during this debate have been at pains to assure us that regimes in Europe and elsewhere that have a left-wing look have to cope with this problem of inflation but we must point out the unique position of this country in that inflation takes place in a situation in which you have unemployment and emigration and where there is a general growth of depression about the possibility of bettering ourselves economically in the future.</P>
    <P>Throughout the year we have been eliciting the rather gloomy information on the housing position and no city Deputy can avoid knowing the pretty horrible situation that obtains in Dublin.  I have many families in my constituency of six in one room living in deplorable conditions and many families living in what I might almost call dangerous building conditions. These people find themselves in a situation of rising prices coupled with inability of their working members to get reasonable wage increases and they are beginning to see through the official line that the country is going forward under purposeful leadership.  I know many families where people with what we would regard as more or less secure jobs in other days have emigrated.  This is <Col N="1078" /> something we must consider more seriously when we have wage rates dropping dramatically below similar rates elsewhere because that is when the workers begin to leave.  A Government who are so keen on reminding us of our economic ties with Britain and considering their own efforts to make these ties even closer should appreciate that we share our labour market with Britain, and if we cannot preserve some rough wage parity with standards in Britain we will not hold key professional and industrial men here.</P>
    <P>I should like to see social welfare recipients left out of the arena of the Budget debate.  The entire social welfare code should be brought out of this position.  It has been brought out a little more often this year than in other years because we have had more Budgets and in fact social welfare recipients are only mentioned in this House at Budget time, Budgets in which the Government more or less decide on a patchwork approach to social welfare, giving an increase only at Budget time in an attempt to soften the blow of imposing taxation in other areas.  It is time the grants and the benefits of social welfare recipients bore some relationship to the increase in incomes in other sections of the community.  That is one part of the incomes policy to which this Government have not given much attention.  The thoughts of this Government on the whole subject of an incomes policy amount merely to a convenient cliché.</P>
    <P>This Government should have been able to approach the different income group interests in this country quite some time ago, certainly before the £1 increase and certainly before the end of the lifetime of the National Wage Agreement.  They should have been able to say: &ldquo;This is how we see an incomes policy figuring out in the different income groups&rdquo;, and then let the matter be open to the free winds of discussion.</P>
    <P>When the Minister for Finance introduces his Budget, I should like him to leave aside the fig leaf of the social welfare recipients &mdash; this policy of pointing out what they are doing in <Col N="1079" /> other parts of their Budget programme &mdash; and concentrate, instead, on the economic issues in the Budget.  I should like to see left to the Minister for Social Welfare, on an agreed annual basis, the treatment of the social welfare recipients and to have the matter dealt with in a constructive fashion.</P>
    <P>This second increase this year in the tax on petrol is very alarming.  If the cost of motoring in this country is not the highest in Europe, then we must certainly be amongst the countries in which it is extremely expensive.  Today, the motor car is not the privilege of a very small section.  The number of motorists in this country is increasing year by year.  It is a problem for another day but it appears to be a trend in every European country and one which this country will not escape. Therefore, this second increase in taxation on petrol this year must be very dangerous.  It is certainly overloading this particular item in the ordinary citizen's budget.  I should imagine that our tourist interests must be extremely worried by this development.  It certainly affects our economy.</P>
    <P>A Budget which adversely affects our economy also has an adverse effect on our tourism.  Year by year, we are steadily pricing ourselves out of that particular market in hotel costs and now in motoring costs and in many other costs which the tourists to this country hitherto had at a reasonable rate.  This country is steadily becoming an exotic possibility for many tourists.</P>
    <P>In future Budgets, mini-Budgets or otherwise, we would hope to see something done by the Government to even out the incidence of taxation amongst the different sections in our community: that is something we urged during this debate.  This is not something for the large farmers.  We pointed out pretty clearly in this debate that, while the great majority of our farmers are up against extreme hardship and must work extremely hard to make ends meet, quite a sizable minority of large farmers are getting away with murder.  It is time the Government appreciated that there is no more burning subject than that to the ordinary people of this country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1080" /> The Minister cannot call for the co-operation of different elements in our community in the matter of taxation unless justice is seen to be done in the matter of taxation.  At the moment, justice in taxation is not seen to be done in certain sections of our community. Take, for example, a farmer in County Dublin who has 40 acres and who is catering for a market-garden produce demand in Dublin city.  How much money is that man getting away with at the moment without coming within the net of taxation?  Consider the farm labourer on that farmer's land and how he is being taxed under PAYE.  That is only one example.  We can think of many others throughout the country. Surely this is an example where justice is not seen to be done and where one section in our community can feel justifiably aggrieved at the way our taxation operates?</P>
    <P>Some political correspondents may think the suggestion of a capital gains tax amusing but we were serious in our suggestion.  We consider that the sooner capital gains are brought under the taxation code the better, and the nearer the day that justice will be seen to be done in regard to this section in our community &mdash; those who have dividends, and so on.  A Government intent on bringing the elements of an incomes policy home to the people would be anxious to see that all these sections in our community are brought within the taxation code. It is important from the point of view of the peace of mind of citizens who have no escape from taxation and, furthermore, it would help the Exchequer in the matter of the collection of taxes.</P>
    <P>The Minister has admitted a principle that we have pointed out to him <i>ad nauseam</i> in the years since the turnover tax was introduced.  We could see no reason that would debat a Government from being selective in any tax of this nature in the purchasing area. Now, at last, the Minister does admit the truth of what we have been saying. I suppose we should be grateful for admissions of wrong on the part of any Government Minister.  The Minister for Finance and this Government now <Col N="1081" /> admit the possibility of a selective tax on purchases and have singled out particular items.  The tragedy is that the turnover tax still exists in its blanket application and that added to it now is this wholesale tax which the Minister has introduced.  At any rate, it is selective and this proves the point that a tax of this nature can be selective without adding needless complications. It was pointed out before now, on argument, that it would be impossible to operate a tax on a selective basis. It was found possible to do so in other countries and now, at wholesale levels, the Minister has seen it to be possible here.</P>
    <P>The Minister is being pretty optimistic in his estimate of how far the Consumer Price Index will rise in the remaining months of this year. I feel that this wholesale tax will have the effect of tampering with the retail price and will give it one or two jumps too many in this year, certainly more than the Minister would seem to expect. When the turnover tax was introduced, the Taoiseach was extremely conservative about how far it would affect this country and how far it would interfere with the Consumer Price Index.  This new tax is bound to have unfortunate effects in industrial relations and is bound to add fuel to an already dangerous situation there.</P>
    <P>The working organisations have, this year, confined themselves to looking for merely £1.  They have come under extreme pressure and criticism for that decision.  Trade union members have been extremely critical of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions because of their restraint this year in looking merely for £1.  It was quite obvious the £1 could not keep any kind of balance.  It could certainly not keep pace with the cost of living.  They have been under extreme pressure.  This Government have added fuel to a dangerous situation in this Budget.  Income tax under PAYE is already extremely heavy.  Any further interference with the actual cost of living, adding to the imposition by tax measures or otherwise, is bound to worsen the trouble already existing in the country.</P>
    <P>This is a Government, as a result of <Col N="1082" /> two Budgets, as a result of policies who appear to lurch along from day to day, who do not appear to be able to have any comprehensive policy for the betterment of the country.  Certainly, their life expectancy has been seriously shortened.  I know the Taoiseach has been flourishing a diary in the last week or so.  We know the Taoiseach has flourished diaries before now and he has not been loth to push dates around before now.  The local elections have been put off for so long that so far as Dublin Corporation are concerned, the people have practically forgotten when the last election was. In fact, there is a strong rumour in Dublin that Dublin Corporation is a hereditary institution which does not have to bother with elections.  Unfortunately, this is not something the Government can get away with.  However, what most people are asking is not when the local elections will be held but when a general election will take place.</P>
    <P>The most hopeful thing that can happen at present is for those of us who are thinking constructively about the country's problems, who are battering out policies in our own ranks, hoping for an answer to the present situation, to come out more into the open and invite this Government to discuss their programmes more in the open so that the people can judge impartially between us.  I have been heartened by the fact that the old-time supporter of Fianna Fáil is becoming a fast diminishing quantity. I think that the forward-looking members even of the Government would be rather scornful of the kind of support which their elders were glad to receive in the past, given on a kind of personal loyalty basis.  They would be more interested in getting political support for constructive programmes. This will be the path of politics here in the future.</P>
    <P>It is in this area that the Government are lacking.  The programmes of civil servants lack one quality&mdash; contact with the people and contact with reality.  The programmes which this Government, without understanding and comprehension, have been putting forward as their programmes <Col N="1083" /> do not answer our present problems. In consequence of the disastrous economic policies pursued by this Government, our Party have put down a motion of no confidence in the Government.  We hope to bring into the open some of the really serious issues behind the Government's mishandling of our economic situation. We hope to muster every member of our Party in bringing into the open some of the skeletons which this Government have been hiding in their capacious cupboard.</P>

      <P>Before I go on to discuss the general matters it was agreed would be discussed on Resolution No. 3, I want to make a reference to the terms of the Resolution itself and to a habit which appears to be growing up, a habit which justifiably caused a great outcry last year and which should cause exactly the same outcry on this occasion.  When the Minister was introducing his Budget on 14th June &mdash; I will not call it a mini-Budget because it is going to be major in its disastrous effects on our economy &mdash; he said:</P>
      <P>...there should be a new tax at the rate of five per cent from 1st October next on all goods affected by the existing turnover tax except food, clothing, fuel, medicines, drink, tobacco and oil.</P>
      <P>But when later he came to bring in the Resolution we are discussing, that was not what he did.  He brought before the Dáil an entirely different Financial Resolution, a Resolution that is not in any way restricted to goods subject to turnover tax.  The Resolution says:</P>
      <P>That&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) with effect as on and from the 1st day of October, 1966,</P>
      <P>&mdash; at least we had the same commencing date &mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>a tax, to be paid by such persons and in such circumstances as may be specified in the Act giving effect to this Resolution, shall, subject to the provisions of <Col N="1084" /> that Act, be charged at the rate of five per cent in respect of goods sold within the State and goods imported into the State;</P>
    <P>Then he went on to say that the tax would not apply to food, drink, etc. as he said in his Budget speech.  But the framework of paragraph (a) which we are asked to pass today, does not restrict this new tax to goods already subject to turnover tax.  If the Minister wanted to introduce and bring into force a tax that was not so restricted, he should have been more careful in the language of his Budget speech of a week ago.</P>
    <P>This Resolution, like all Budget Resolutions, is thrown at us just before the time comes to vote on them.  It is virtually impossible for Deputies in the time available to check and cross-check backwards and forwards with the wording of the Budget speech itself.  One expects a standard of accuracy, a standard of political correctness, from a Minister for Finance.  One expects that the Minister for Finance of the day would make certain that the Resolutions which he signed &mdash; not merely which he approved, because a Minister for Finance has to sign the Resolutions before they are sent down &mdash; would be in accordance with what he was telling the public it was and that he would not try to put a slick fast one across as has been done in the manner in which this Resolution has been framed.</P>
    <P>There are many goods sold within the State and many goods imported into the State not subject to turnover tax.  Under this Resolution, they will be liable to additional tax.  In his Budget speech the Minister led us to believe they were not going to be so liable.  That is not a way in which one would have expected the Minister for Finance to introduce a carefully prepared, carefully thought out speech to the House.  It is reprehensible in the extreme that the wording of the Resolution does not accord with the wording of the Budget Statement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>The Bill proposes to continue for three further years, as from 1st April last, the period in which buildings may be erected, reconstructed or improved in order to qualify for the rates remission under the Local Government (Temporary Reduction of Valuation) Act, 1954.</P>
      <P>The 1954 Act provided for the granting of a two-thirds remission of rates for seven years on the valuation of new buildings and on the increased valuation of existing buildings which were reconstructed or improved, where the work of erection, reconstruction or improvement was completed not later than 26th July, 1956.  The period for completion was extended up to the 31st March, 1966, by amending Acts passed in 1956, 1960 and 1963.  The remission of rates applies to all buildings such as factories, offices, shops, hotels, houses and so on which do not qualify for a remission under any other Act.  It is considered that the remission should now be continued for a further three year period, and this is proposed by section 1 of the Bill.</P>
      <P>The 1954 Act, as extended, constitutes a form of rating concession which has existed in local government legislation for almost half a century.  The effects of this and of the great number and variety of other similar concessions on the effectiveness of our valuation and rating system as an equitable means of distributing local taxation are being reviewed with a view to evolving general principles to govern such remissions for the future.  Pending the formulation of these principles I feel that the present concessions under the 1954 Act should be continued on a further temporary basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under section 14 of the Valuation (Ireland) Act, 1852, an exemption from rates for seven years was given for newly erected or reconstructed farm outhouses and outoffice buildings. This exemption was extended from seven to 20 years by the Local <Col N="1086" /> Government (Temporary Reduction of Valuation) Act, 1960, in the case of farm buildings built, enlarged or improved between 1st April, 1960 and 31st March, 1965.  The completion date was extended to 31st March, 1966, by the amending Act of 1963.</P>
    <P>It has been represented to me that the position whereby new or improved farm buildings will eventually become liable to be rated has a disincentive effect on investment in such buildings by the farming community.  Proper outoffice buildings have become increasingly important as the numbers and the acceptable standards of livestock rise.  The problem of providing extra accommodation or of substantially improving existing buildings is a serious one for our farmers.  The prospect of eventual rating may complicate the problem and tend to detract from the incentive value of the Farm Building Scheme.  In the circumstances, therefore, it appears desirable to remove any misgivings which may exist and section 2 of the Bill is intended to ensure that the valuation of any farm holding will not be increased in the future because of the provision or improvement of farm buildings.  As buildings completed since 1st March, 1959, have so far enjoyed a temporary exemption from rating they too will qualify for the indefinite exemption now proposed.</P>
    <P>The fact that the rating remission in respect of new or improved farm buildings will thus be continued on an indefinite basis, instead of the present temporary basis, will not, of course, preclude me in due course from reviewing the remission in the light of the general principles emerging from my current consideration of the whole question of rate remissions and exemptions.  I recommend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> The introduction of this Bill acknowledges that there is a problem to be dealt with.  It seems to me to acknowledge that the present system of rating and local taxation is unfair and inequitable. Few people can seriously dispute that proposition.  The present system of raising the necessary finances to finance local government <Col N="1087" /> was introduced or worked out during the last century and in my opinion, it is now completely unsuited to modern requirements.  At the time when it was decided to raise the national revenue to finance such local projects as health, main roads, housing and other matters of a local nature, an argument could be put up that only owners of property were possessors of any considerable amount of wealth.  At that time the ownership of a house or of land meant that the owner was a person of some substance and could afford to contribute generously to the local exchequer. That state of affairs no longer exists.  The whole pattern of wealth and income has changed.  It is now an undisputed fact that there are very many people occupying houses and occupying land who are unable to meet the demands of the rate collector.</P>
      <P>It can often happen that a man in a country town occupying a small business premises finds himself in open competition with large business concerns and yet that man's poor law valuation may be, say, £30.  As a result he is required to contribute the sum of, say, £100 per year or more towards the county council or urban council demand.  That is unfair and unjust and the Government in continuing to finance such projects as health, main roads, housing and other matters of that sort, out of taxation raised from occupiers of property are completely out of touch with modern requirements and are failing in their duty to move with the times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the last general election, my Party strongly urged that there should be rethinking and a new approach to local taxation.  They urged that the present system was out of date and unfair and imposed hardships on the occupiers of property. The Taoiseach, speaking in the last days of that election campaign, in late March or early April, 1965, seemed to accept our argument, seemed to accept as a fact that the present system was unjust and outdated. He promised to do something about it, to have it investigated, and <Col N="1088" /> to introduce a new system.  I am, I think, fairly summarising now a speech made at Navan.  I am somewhat disappointed, therefore, to find that the Minister here this evening does not appear to promise any such comprehensive review of the existing system.  He speaks of remissions and exemptions.  He appears to be determined to deal with the matter piecemeal. That is what his Bill suggests.</P>
    <P>Section I extends for a further period of three years remission of rates in respect of new houses and other buildings.  In that regard I approve of the measure, but there is no display of fresh thinking and no hint of any new approach.  Indeed, the suggestion seems to be that we are satisfied to continue the present unsatisfactory system, a system we inherited from another country and from another century.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister in section 2 has yielded to the suggestion that farm outoffices and outbuildings, as distinct from farm residences, should be permanently exempt from rates.  I understand that is what this section means.  That is a move in the right direction, but again the Minister is dealing with the matter piecemeal.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister, I wonder, aware of the hardship imposed on small farmers throughout the country who provide better living accommodation for themselves and their families?  Many of these farmers&mdash;I know them&mdash;have been living in houses totally inadequate for their requirements, certainly totally inadequate in the light of modern conditions.  A farmer may decide, with the help of his family who are out working, to provide a little more comfort for himself, his wife and his family.  He builds a new house consisting of three bedrooms, a bathroom, a kitchen, and perhaps another room or two.  He may even reconstruct his old house to provide the same kind of accommodation. Now, the valuation on the old house was, perhaps, 30/-, £2 or £3.  No sooner has he built his new house, or reconstructed his old house, than it is revalued.  I am not speaking extravagantly when I say that £7, £8 or <Col N="1089" /> even £10 can be put on that house, situated at the end of a lane.  With rates as they are at present&mdash;60/- and 70/- in the £&mdash;that farmer finds himself confronted with a bill from the rate collector for £30 or £40.  That is an undue hardship on that farmer.</P>
    <P>It is no use his going to the Commissioner of Valuation because he will tell him that the regulations are there; the law is such and such and he has to enforce the law.  There is nothing he can do about it: so much per foot is charged in one part of the country and so much per foot in another. There is no use in the farmer appealing to the Circuit Court because, the Circuit Court judge, if he approaches the matter in the light of the law, cannot reduce the valuation.  Circuit Court judges are, however, humane men and they try to approach these matters in a sympathetic way.  Sometimes by stretching a point by way of comparisons, or something like that, they may reduce the valuation a little. But really their hands are tied and as often as not nothing can be done.</P>
    <P>In my opinion, this demand for rates is unfair because those rates may go towards surfacing tarred roads a mile and a half from the farmer's residence.  They may go to provide public water and sewerage which he may never enjoy.  They may go to provide a regional water supply scheme which will not come within reach of his house during his lifetime.  At the same time, the provision of pumps in his immediate neighbourhood is suspended pending the coming into operation of a regional water supply scheme. That is unfair to that farmer, and I am not speaking exclusively on behalf of the farming community, although the case I have mentioned demonstrates the unfairness and inequity of this better than anything else.</P>
    <P>The same thing applies to a working man on a moderate income who is progressive enough to build a house on the outskirts of a town.  That house can be valued at £13, £14, £15 or even £20; one would not want to have an elaborate building to have a valuation of £15 to £20 placed on it.  There again he finds himself confronted with a demand for £45, £60 or even £75 rates when the remission goes.  That does <Col N="1090" /> not encourage people to provide houses for themselves.  I would go further and say it is not an equitable way of financing services such as the maintenance of main roads, the provision of health services or the provision of houses which, as I say, should be national charges.</P>
    <P>Therefore, while we are glad to see in section 1 of the Bill a continuation of the remission of rates in respect of houses that will be built up to 1969, and while I am very glad to see that farm outoffices are to be permanently exempt from rates, I am very disappointed that we had not some assurance from the Minister that this is the last time a temporary measure of this sort would be introduced into the House and that the Government had immediate plans, in accordance with the Taoiseach's promise, to tackle this question of local taxation and to put it on a more equitable basis in keeping with the distribution of wealth in the second half of the present century, and to discontinue the unsatisfactory and unfair system taken over from another country and another century.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing discussed in this House about which more cod is talked than this question of the remission of rates and so on. While we are all, both in the Government Party and in the two Opposition Parties prepared to say on every possible occasion that some other system should be found, I have not yet heard anybody proposing what that system should be.  Occasionally some rather bold person, before he realises what he is saying, suggests there should be complete revision of the system of rating.  All I say is, goodness help that person if it became known publicly that he was suggesting the 1857 system on which our present rates are based should be changed for a modern type of rating. I am quite sure that the rate in the £1 could be reduced very substantially all over the country, but that does not mean that people would not be paying a great deal more for their holdings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like Deputy Fitzpatrick, I have the greatest sympathy with people who <Col N="1091" /> improve their houses or their outoffices, and then somebody comes from the Valuation Office and revises the rate on the whole property or the whole building.  That does happen. I know myself of a small house which was derelict, and a man who was in a pretty bad position, having got married and having no place to go, went to live in this house and after a while succeeded in making it habitable. The next thing, a valuation of £15 was put on the house which was not worth £15 when he went into it. The whole place was not worth that.</P>
    <P>The farming community have from time been complaining about the amount of rates they have to pay and usually around the time the annual rate is struck by the local authorities, they make a lot of noise about.  The people who are really being stung in regard to rates are the people who have no land but who have house property or some business on which they are paying not two-sevenths of the rate but the full rates.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to suggest to the Minister that I know the answer to this, because I do not.  I am sure there must be some other way, but I honestly feel it is not good enough to say there must be a new system of rating or a new system of local authority financing devised.  Whether we like it or not, rates are so far the only means by which local finance can be found.  As far as the question of agricultural rates is concerned, while we have a lot of talk about the amount of rates which must be paid, I do not think that complete derating of agricultural lands would be very much use to the farmer. The farmer who is paying anything between £10 and £100 in rates would not be very much better if he had not got to pay these rates.  None of them was ever reared on £2 a week, which would be roughly what £100 rates would represent, and the £10 or £5 valuation farmer would get very little out of it.  It is a popular catchcry to say there should be complete derating of agricultural land, but it would mean very little, if anything, to farmers generally.</P>
    <P>We are all glad that an attempt is <Col N="1092" /> being made to prevent this revision of rates on the farmer or on the ordinary house-owner who improves his holding or his house.  Like Deputy Fitzpatrick, I say it is rather a pity that while the Minister says this is not going to be permanent, at the same time, I assume from the type of legislation which has been introduced we are going to have a repetition of this sort of thing year after year.</P>
    <P>An effort should be made to find out if there is some other way in which local authorities will be able to finance themselves and pay for the outgoings for which they are responsible other than by means of the present system. Let me repeat that the suggestions that we should have a special revision of rates would be grand for the person who built his house within the past five or six years, but it would not be so nice for the person living in a house which could be anything from 100 years old down.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether it is appreciated or not that a man with 200 acres of good land and a small house usually pays less rates than the man with 50 acres of land and a good house and stabling.  That should not be so. There may be some way of dealing with that kind of problem but, as I say, I do not know what it is.  All I can say is that the Minister or his officials might spend some time trying to find some system other than the present one, which is not satisfactory from any point of view.</P>

      <P>I do not quite follow the gist of Deputy Tully's complaint.  He started by saying that there was a great deal of &ldquo;cod&rdquo; talked about rates.  He is probably right in that.  He then went on to imply, as far as I could see, that when people suggested that there should be some general review of the whole question of rates with a view to seeing what can be done about them and getting some new system, that was all part of the &ldquo;cod&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>On that basis, let me say, I agree fully with Deputy Tully's argument.</P>
      <P>Quite frankly, I was disappointed when I read and heard the Minister's speech introducing this measure.  I do not disagree at all with the measure which he has introduced. I am glad he has done it. It had to be done.  But I was disappointed because it seemed to me to be implicit in what the Minister said that the Government have shelved the idea which received such prominence and publicity some time ago, that is, that a searching examination was taking place in so far as the whole question of local taxation is concerned.</P>
      <P>I may be wrong&mdash;I may possibly be misinterpreting the intention of the Government and the Minister's mind &mdash;in thinking that the Minister's speech in introducing this Bill indicates that the Government have turned away from that and have shelved it but the Minister has made it clear that he is now contemplating some kind of permanent legislation or regulations dealing with rates remission. If there is to be permanent legislation dealing with rates remission, it seems to be quite clear that the Government have thrown in the towel as far as any drastic alteration in the local taxation system is concerned and that they visualise a continuance of the rating system as it is at present with permanent legislation dealing with remissions.</P>
      <P>It may very well be that that is the best that can be done but at some stage &mdash;possibly this is not the occasion for it&mdash;the Minister for Local Government should take the House into his confidence as to what work has been done, what research has been done, in connection with the general question of local taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as this Bill is concerned, Deputies on all sides of the House will agree that the present remissions which <Col N="1094" /> are being extended for a further period of years should be extended.  I hope that before the times prescribed by the Bill expire, the Minister will have come forward with his proposals for permament legislation dealing with remissions or will have come to the Dáil with a report on the general position.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick has referred to the question of farmers and farm buildings.  I just want to be clear on one point.  It seems to me that under this legislation, which is being continued, the position is that buildings put up under the farm improvements scheme will be free of rates, that there will not be any additional rates in respect of them.  I should like to know if that continues to apply in the event of the dwellinghouse and outoffices being separated from the farm.  I may be wrong in this but it seems to me that if such a separation is made, then the position may very well be that even though the outbuildings which will now go with the dwellinghouse rather than with the land will fall to be rated, and if they fall to be rated in those circumstances, the Minister should give us some indication of what approach the rating authority will make in respect of the rating.</P>
    <P>The Minister did seem to me to draw a distinction between the farm holding and the buildings.  In the middle of the second page of the typescript which was circulated, he said:</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, therefore, it appears desirable to remove any misgivings which may exist and section 2 of the Bill is intended to ensure that the valuation on any farm holding will not be increased in future because of the provision or improvement of farm buildings.</P>
    <P>If the farm holding as such comes to be separated as to ownership from the farm buildings or the improved farm buildings, the information I am seeking from the Minister is what the position then is as between the farm holding, by which I mean the land, and the buildings.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is very much else that can be said with regard to this Bill.  It is presented by the Minister as being on a temporary basis <Col N="1095" /> with a forecast of permanent legislation in future.  I think most Deputies would like to see some form of permanency in this remission.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I intervene in this debate merely to say that when I first saw the Bill, entitled, Local Government (Reduction of Valuation) Bill, 1966, I hoped it would be a measure which would bring relief in respect of valuation, not to any one section of the community, but to all our people.  While we certainly welcome the intention behind this restricted Bill, which is to ensure that the valuation of farm holdings will not be increased in future because of the provision or improvement of farm buildings, nevertheless, we regret very much that the Minister did not avail of this opportunity to introduce a fairer, more equitable and more just system of valuation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having heard the speeches of my colleagues in this House for the past hour, I appreciate that this is a complex problem, not easy of solution. Nevertheless, I do want to avail of this opportunity to point out the anomalies which exist in our valuation system.  I would hope that some means would be devised very speedily to bring about a reduction in valuation for the vast majority of our people who reside in the cities and towns.  I am aware, as a public representative, of the anxiety and dismay which increases in valuations have caused in recent times.  It is true to say that the grants system for the building of new houses, and especially for the repair and reconstruction of houses, has not been very long in vogue.  There goes with them a stipulation that the valuation should not be increased until a period of seven years has expired.  It is just about now that a national review of valuations is taking place, especially in my constituency, and the valuations of all those people who availed of grants for repairs and reconstructions are going up.  The people are shocked at the excessive increases in valuation which have resulted.  The people who availed of these grants, presuming that they were free, gratis and for nothing, have now had a rude awakening and they realise <Col N="1096" /> that, in <i>saecula saeculorum,</i> they will have to pay through the nose for them in the form of increased rates.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned about those traders and shopkeepers who have improved their premises to keep pace with the times we live in.  For the money which they paid out to enhance the appearance of their premises, they now suffer a steep increase in valuation.  The whole system is a disincentive, a discouragement to enterprising people in that, having improved their property, they should have this imposition put upon them.  I would appeal to the Minister to find some way of lightening the burden on the town dwellers who are presently scourged by the high incidence of rates.</P>
    <P>It is also an anomaly that tenants of corporation or of urban housing estates do not seem to have any right of appeal in respect of excessive valuations. I am aware of two housing schemes in my constituency, identical in every way, except that one was begun a few months before the other. In one scheme a valuation of £4 10s per house was set and in the other scheme, there was a valuation of £8 per house.  This was a clear and flagrant injustice on the tenants.  Those who occupied the £8 estate did not seem to have any redress or right to appeal such as the individual owner of a house has.  They were told that they could only appeal through the local housing authority, the county manager.  I want the Minister to make clear the right of the tenant of a local authority house to the same right of appeal to the valuation officer as the individual owner of a private house.</P>
    <P>My feeling is that the valuation officers are rampaging through the country increasing valuations out of all proportion.  The many people who appeal against what they consider to be excessive increases in valuation have little or no redress.  The first they hear of the increase is when they get the rate demand note for that year. They cannot appeal until the following year and it is probably the year after when they are told the outcome of the appeal.  A person can safely assume that three years will pass <Col N="1097" /> before the appeal is determined and, very largely, these appeals are turned down.  If there is a reduction in a valuation as a result of the appeal, it is infinitesimal:</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick has cast doubts on the wisdom of taking the appeal to the Circuit Court.  He says that district justices are humane men, anxious to administer justice and that they probably would have sympathy in a case of excessive rates.  By reason of the system laid down by the State, it would seem that the courts are hamstrung in respect of amending in any radical way the decisions of the valuation officers.</P>
    <P>While we welcome this measure, which confers an additional benefit on the farming community, we cannot ignore the fact that a very large proportion of our people cannot now live on the land.  These are the people who are the worst equipped to bear increases in valuations and rates.  It is high time that some of these benefits were conferred on them.  Until such time as relief is secured for the town and city tenants as well as for the farming community, we shall have to contend that the present system of valuation and rates is unfair, inequitable and unjust.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that there is a time limit on the debate and I do not want to take up an unfair amount of that time but I hope that the next time we have a Bill of this kind, which has as its caption: &ldquo;Reduction of Valuation Bill,&rdquo; it will be a Bill which will bring relief to all our people and particularly to those who are ordinary householders, tenants of housing estates, and to the merchants and traders of the towns and cities who are at present being penalised instead of being helped for maintaining and improving their property.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish briefly to support the pleas of those speakers who have asked the Minister to avail of this opportunity to take a fresh look at the valuation system and, in particular, to remove from it the anomalies and inequities which are all too frequent in its operation in the city of Dublin. <Col N="1098" /> It is good to see that the Minister can consider it desirable and can afford to extend indefinitely the temporary reduction exemption on farm buildings. As a city Deputy, I wish he could find in his heart a similar measure of generosity to extend to my constituents.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that he found the fact that improved farm buildings would eventually, after the remission of rates period, become liable to be rated would be rather a disincentive to investment.  That argument can be applied to a wide range of desirable productive investments such as homes and business premises.  In the past year I have become aware of three cases of very harsh handling by the rating authorities of business extensions to very modest businesses in the Dublin area and in one case of very harsh treatment of an individual who availed of a grant to improve his home and to provide housing for his very large family.</P>
      <P>The rates burden in Dublin at present is really crushing on very modest houses for people who are living from day to day on a small income.  They have to pay rates of as much as £60, £70 or £80.  The valuations being applied by the authorities to newly-built houses are completely exorbitant by any reasonable yardstick and particularly when judged by the standards applied to equivalent houses in the past.  One finds the grossest anomalies in the Dublin area of newly-built houses being more highly rated than superior type dwellings erected 50, 60 or 70 years ago.</P>
      <P>This rates problem has become such a crushing one that drastic action is called for and while I welcome the temporary extension for a further period-of three years of the existing seven years remission, I urge on the Minister the point of view that far more radical amelioration of the rates burden is required if the demands of simple justice and equity are to be met even in part.</P>

That will not get us anywhere.  That is the &ldquo;bob each way&rdquo; business.  You never back a winner really or if you do, you will not gain much on it.</P>

      <P>There are two views about the overall valuation system.  One is that it should be scrapped but, as Deputy Tully has rightly said&mdash;and I am not reflecting on anybody who has made the point; I should be delighted to hear anybody who has another view &mdash;what are we to put in its place if we do throw out the old system?  Are we then to decide not to have local taxation in any form in future?  This would mean we would not have any local authorities as such in the future.  This may be good or bad but that is how I would see it.</P>
      <P>We come now to the condemnation &mdash;various terms were used by various speakers&mdash;of the inactivity of myself and the Government in this matter.  We have not been inactive&mdash;far from it.  A series of investigations has been and is going on.  An interim report was published in the fall of last year and that was designedly published to evoke public suggestions and discussions and more public interest in the whole matter so as to bring home to the people that the rating system is not as simple as it may appear to be.  The most disappointing aspect of the publication of this paper was that no serious worthwhile suggestion came from any quarter.  I wish suggestions would come because we are seeking them and this is no simple matter to which there is a ready alternative.  The investigations are continuing.</P>

You cannot have reliefs for all and continue a valuation and rating <Col N="1102" /> system: somebody has to pay for it.  Some Deputies exaggerated in order to make the best case they could but the situation is not at all as desperate as they would like to make it appear. Compare the situation today with that of 30 odd years ago.  Big changes have taken place in the incidence of the cost and the payment of the cost of local services.  Today, 51 per cent of the total expenditure of £97 million going into the service of local authorities is being contributed from the central Exchequer.  In the present year, only 33 per cent of the total cost will be carried by rates.  The State contribution, percentage-wise, has gone up to 51 and it has been reduced to 33 per cent for the local authority rate-payers. The difference between that and 100 per cent is by way of receipts of earnings from various institutions, and so on.  However, there is a big change in emphasis as to where the money is coming from.  Despite disparaging remarks, the Health Services White Paper&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The transfer to the Exchequer is becoming effective this year.  As the cost of the health services is 38 per cent of the total expenditure of local authorities, the House will appreciate that, as an interim measure and before final consideration has as yet been given by the Government to these changes, this Health White Paper is now a very significant step forward in the carrying of a greater part of these service costs by the central Exchequer, added to what we have been carrying in the past.</P>

    <P>Questions have been asked in regard to local authority houses occupied by tenants who pay rates in addition to rents.  It has been stated that they have no option whatsoever, that they have no right of appeal if they feel aggrieved that the valuation struck on the houses <Col N="1103" /> they now occupy is too high.  This is not so.  The law is that any person aggrieved by an entry in the valuation lists can send notice of appeal to the local authority and the secretary or the clerk must send the notice to the Commissioners. Such a tenant and any aggrieved person has the right to appeal against any entry in the valuation lists and when they make that appeal to the local authority, it must be sent forward to the Commissioners of Valuation.</P>

He also asked about the position if at some subsequent date, the farmhouse and this building should be separated from the farm&mdash;in other words, if it ceased to be a farm residence, a farmyard, whatever you may call it.  Let me put it this way. <Col N="1104" /> The answer to what I think is his problem is that if the farm building is ultimately converted to a factory &mdash;just an instance&mdash;then this building would become liable for revision in the normal way that buildings for revision are put forward to the Valuation Office.</P>

      <P>My question was not about use of the outoffices as a factory, and so on, but where the residence and the land become separated and the outoffices go with the building and they are just used as outoffices by the new owner for residential purposes.  Does that automatically mean that they will now be re-rated?</P>

      <P>It is rather difficult to be very definite about this.  I would say that when and if they ceased to be used for farm purposes, the intention of our reliefs here would have been somewhat obscured or broadened, and I would give the same reply as I have already given, that they would be entitled to be listed for revision.  We will have to wait and see where we go after that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Taking it all round, I believe the proposal here in regard to farm buildings is of some value to the farmers and should be some additional incentive to them to avail of the farm buildings grant scheme and get on with the extension of their farm buildings so necessary for further expansion of agriculture here. People may say that is all very well but what about the rest of the community? Such criticism does not take away from what we are trying to do <Col N="1105" /> here.  If this is good, it is good, and we are going to do it.  The overall question of the inequities in our valuation system as now operated is a matter that cannot be dealt with in a piecemeal way.  This Bill is a continuation of certain exemptions and remissions we have been enjoying in various degrees over the years.</P>
    <P>It cannot be said that this is an attempt on the part of the Government or myself to deal with the overall situation.  We do not admit that we cannot do anything in the future about the rating and valuation system.  We are still on that.  When we come to the stage of being able to bring to the Dáil firm proposals after a proper evaluation has taken place, we will do so.  Let the House know without doubt that this is our intention. We are not going back on the undertaking given about a year and a half ago.  In the meantime if anybody. Deputies or people outside, have any suggestions they feel would be of use to us in examining the local taxation system, might I invite them to send them to me?  They will be gladly received, fully examined and used with proper acknowledgment when the time comes if we find them worthwhile.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>When progress was reported, I was drawing the attention of the House and of the Minister to the lackadaisical, slick and yet extravagant manner in which he had drawn the Financial Resolution, or else had misdrawn his Budget speech.  It is, I suggest, entirely improper that the Minister in his Budget speech last week should give the impression he was going to tax with this wholesale tax only those articles which were already subject to turnover tax, but when the Financial Resolution comes along&mdash; which he will be exhorting his cohorts to vote for in due course&mdash;that Resolution imposes the tax not merely on those articles that are subject to turnover tax but on a great many other articles exempt from the turnover tax.</P>
      <P>The habit the Minister got in relation to that last year in the Resolution grounding one section of the Finance Bill of 1965 and which he has continued this year is one that is bound to cause great uneasiness and to disturb greatly the community as a whole.  I would have thought that after the public outcry last year he would have learned his lesson.  Apparently he has not because we find in this he has taken power to do far more than he indicated in his speech he was proposing to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I notice also that in his Budget speech the Minister described this as a selective wholesale tax.  The essence of a selective tax is to impose differing rates on different commodities.  This is <Col N="1107" /> a flat tax at one rate, taking no account of whether it is a luxury, a nearluxury or something absolutely and vitally essential.  While frankly I feel the manner of imposition of the tax is an improvement on the turnover tax of three years ago, at the same time, it is disturbing that it is being imposed, not in substitution for that tax but in addition to it.</P>
    <P>We were told at that time that it was utterly impossible, administratively and otherwise, to have anything other than a flat, one-scale, one-rate tax on everything.  The excuse given for including in that turnover tax the bare necessaries of life was that the tax itself would not be operative administratively unless it covered everything from bread to butter, meat and every single article of food.  Shortly after the turnover tax was enacted in 1963 and put into force, we found exemptions were being made, thereby showing it was possible not to have the universality of its application that the Fianna Fáil Party claimed was necessary for it.  Unfortunately, however, as we all know now, the damage had been done at that time and the spiral commenced which was continued for the purpose of Fianna Fáil saving themselves from a general election by winning dishonestly the Cork and Kildare by-elections of that time.</P>
    <P>It is not that I want to go back particularly to that turnover tax, but this tax in itself, while put on the wholesale level which is better than the universal turnover tax, is, however, contrary to the best present thought on taxation such as this.  The best thought on indirect taxation of this kind is universally accepted to be that propounded in Sweden.  I do not know whether the Minister reads the monthly pamphlet of the <i>Svenska Handelsbanken,</i> the economic review published by the Bank of Sweden.  In the issue that came at the beginning of the year, they made it clear that in Sweden they were moving on and away from a flat turnover tax to what is commonly called a value added tax.  It is extraordinary that when progressive countries in Europe and elsewhere are moving on to a value added tax the Minister <Col N="1108" /> has not thought fit to give any consideration at all to that but has applied a single rate tax at wholesale level.  I stress &ldquo;single rate&rdquo; in order to make it quite clear that it is not a selective tax.</P>
    <P>One of the advantages of the value added tax is that companies which have to pay tax on their turnover have the right to deduct from the tax payable the tax already paid in earlier stages of production and in earlier stages of distribution on goods and services required by them.  The reason for doing that is to avoid many of the disadvantages that there are in the flat turnover tax, operative at retail level by the disastrous imposition of 1963 and now to be operative at wholesale level.  The flat turnover tax, or what I may call the 1963 tax, was aimed primarily at consumption.  It was aimed, I believe, not merely at increasing revenue but also at damping down consumption, something of course which it was utterly impossible to do in that way and which was entirely wrong in the universality of its application.  It had the effect not merely of initiating the spiral but on businesses and investments and on some services that are used in production, it has led to double taxation in certain fields of taxation. This double taxation under the 1963 tax has affected different products in varying degrees and in a haphazard way.  Companies which sometimes manufactured goods they needed for their own investment do not have to pay turnover tax on these goods, whereas the companies which buy goods from other companies have to pay tax.</P>
    <P>The simplest and best example of that is in relation to the building trade where a company that buys its joinery from someone else has to pay 2½ per cent on the joinery for the house which it buys, but if it manufactures the joinery itself, no 2½ per cent tax goes into that house when it is being built. However, the value added tax which allows the company to deduct the tax paid on goods and services used in production is free from this disadvantage. It also means that the effect of it is that it is neutral in relation to comtage <Col N="1109" /> panies of different sizes and of different production structures.</P>
    <P>Another great advantage of the value added tax is that it is free in its impact on the export industry and therefore its impact on exports can be entirely eliminated.  I agree, of course, that there is no turnover tax as such on exported goods and I think the Minister will propose that because they are exported, they will be free from this new tax.  Again, he does not say so in the Resolution, although he did say it in the Budget speech.  It is another case in which the Resolution does not follow the Budget speech.  Exports are indirectly affected by the existing turnover tax and by the new wholesale tax because the tax is levied on investments at various stages of production and naturally those investments have to get their return and the effect of it is indirect in its application to the export field.  When you take into account how badly we need exports, and how badly we need to encourage those exports, it is to be regretted that the Minister used the most hamfisted method he could in 1963 and now in 1966 he is using another hamfisted method, although it is not as hamfisted as his earlier method.  If he had gone to the value added tax, it would have been possible to deduct this from goods and services included in the production of exported goods.</P>
    <P>I do not know why the Minister has described this as a selective tax.  The word &ldquo;selective&rdquo; to any ordinary person means something that chooses between one aspect and another.  It is perhaps, selective in that food, drink and tobacco are excluded from its operation.  Of course, they are excluded merely because they could not bear any more.  One of the things that appears from the Budget speech&mdash;and I use the word &ldquo;appears&rdquo; quite deliberately because it is very difficult to follow&mdash; is that the existing turnover tax of 2½ percent will apparently be paid on the mark-up to the retailer which includes this wholesale tax and therefore we are going to be in the position of paying 2½ per cent turnover tax not merely on the cost of the goods themselves to the retailer but in addition the 1966 wholesale tax.  How the Minister can suggest that that is fair or equitable, <Col N="1110" /> or going to inure to the permanent betterment of the economy, is another question.</P>
    <P>I gather that the wholesale tax is not to include services.  The Resolution appears to cover only goods and therefore services are completely exempt. There might be some justification for a tax of a certain kind on doodling or drawing caricatures of other people when one should be taking account for one's Minister of what is said and other such things but apparently the Resolution is so phrased that these services are left out.</P>
    <P>The Minister also suggests that the effect of this tax would only be to increase the cost of living by half a point.  I find it difficult to understand his calculation in that respect.  The Consumer Price Index, the cost of living, which has gone up in the manner in which it has in the past year, cannot bear an increase of even half a point.  In mid-May, 1965, when we were told by posters and in speeches that Lemass must lead on, we were not told that in the first year of his leading on, between mid-May, 1965 and May, 1966, the cost of living would increase by no fewer than five points, from 180 to 185 points, and that we have, in addition, another tax which, while it may increase the cost-of-living index figure by only half a point, will undoubtedly have the effect of increasing the price of the small comforts to which people have become accustomed and to which they were entitled to be accustomed before they had imposed on them this peculiar policy of Fianna Fáil which does not seem to know where it is travelling or exactly in what direction.</P>
    <P>Apart from the effect of the wholesale tax itself, this Budget will have the effect of making the cost of distribution of goods substantially dearer because of the increase in the price of petrol.  On the Second Reading of the Finance Bill, prior to the Presidential election, and before the exact details of the awfulness the Minister for Finance had in store for us were disclosed, I made some comments here about the cost of petrol as compared with the price of petrol in other countries.  Premium petrol at <Col N="1111" /> that time was 5/10d a gallon.  That was about the time the Budget was introduced in March.  The price was reduced slightly by the companies since then.  Then the Minister promptly ensured that the price would go back again.</P>
    <P>As far as I can make out from the figures available to me in relation to other countries, we have now got almost one of the highest prices for petrol in any European country, Iron Curtain apart.  I accept that in Poland the price of petrol is 7/2d a gallon. But who wants to go and live in Poland, behind the Iron Curtain?  It may be dearer in Hungary, again behind the Iron Curtain.  But we are dearer than Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia; we are dearer than East Germany; we are dearer than Austria; we are dearer than Belgium; we are dearer than Denmark; we are dearer than Finland.  We are dearer than&mdash; Greece is higher than we are&mdash;West Germany, Holland, Luxembourg, Norway, Sweden, Spain and Switzerland. As far as I can find out, there are only three European countries which have as high a price for petrol as we have, Greece, France and Portugal.  We are in the lamentable position of being the fourth highest petrol-cost country in Europe, with all that means in relation to increased costs in distribution and also with all it means as a deterrent on the tourist industry&mdash;the tourist industry which, God knows, will suffer enough this year as a result of the British seamen's strike.</P>
    <P>I must confess that I was surprised that the estimate of the hotels' federation was that we would lose only £3 million.  Perhaps what was meant was that we had already lost £3 million to date in our tourist industry as a result of the seamen's strike in Britain. Whether that is so or not, the increase in the price of petrol is a tragic blow to the tourist industry.  There is no tourist relief.  Of the countries that I have mentioned as being higher than Ireland, the only one of which I have any personal experience from the point of view of the price of petrol is France. There they have a system of tourist <Col N="1112" /> coupons.  Of course, the Minister for Finance and the Government here could not possibly do anything that would be as progressive as that, and so the deterrent of high-cost petrol remains and is exaggerated further by this new Budget.</P>
    <P>While these are the specific taxes, one must also look at this Budget in the context of the general picture. Before I do that, there are a few things I should like to mention.  Deputy O'Leary talked about a capital gains tax.  I have no fundamental theoretical disbelief in such a tax as a fair method, provided it is operated fairly, but one of the things that is crystal clear at the present time is that a capital gains tax, far from providing capital, would cost the Exchequer money.  You cannot have a capital gains tax without, at the same time, providing allowances in income tax for capital losses.  Anybody who knows anything about capital now knows that in the past year, for example, the Stock Exchange investment lists were down by about eight per cent and, far from a capital gains tax providing money, as Deputy O'Leary said, it would on the contrary cost the Exchequer substantial sums at the present time.  In any event, apart from perhaps the appearance of inequality, we have not got here the large-scale extravagant capital gains that they may have in other countries and our anxiety here must be the overriding one of ensuring that we get not merely more capital into the country but that we get sufficient capital to be able to maintain the employment we have and to extend that employment.</P>
    <P>When you consider that as our primary objective, as it must be, and when you consider the fact that the Exchequer would lose in present circumstances by the introduction of a capital gains tax, it is easy to see why the Minister turned his back on it, and he was quite right to do so.  I must confess I cannot pay the same tribute to the Minister for the manner in which he presented his Budget last week.  It was virtually impossible to follow, not merely when listening to him but also when reading his speech.  It was impossible to know exactly what he wanted and where he was going to get it.  He <Col N="1113" /> was jumping around all over the place. One moment he talked of what he wanted in a full year and the next minute, not giving any figure, he talked about what he would require for the remainder of the current year.  Nowhere in his Budget Statement did he give any figure for the amount required in this financial year for increases to State servants.  One was left to make one's own estimate on the figure he gave of £4 million in a full year and make a calculation as best one could.  The calculation, by a process of subtraction, arrived at a figure of £2 million.</P>
    <P>The Minister also failed to provide any tables, the kind of tables that usually accompany a Budget, showing the effect of the Budget.  Again, it was left to Deputies to make up their own tables&mdash;not a very easy thing to do when the figures were jumbled about in the way they were.  The Minister failed to provide any reason at all for the inclusion of the additional £100,000 for social welfare.  He did not say how it arose.  He did not say whether it arose, as I think it did, from bad estimation last March, or from some new service.  If it arose from some new service, I am pretty certain he would have been bound to have mentioned it in excuse, but he failed to give the reason why.  He merely said he wanted another £100,000, and I would suggest it was because he had mis-estimated the amount that would be necessary in March when introducing his Budget.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Minister's Budget, on all sides and in relation to what flows from it, we are struck by extraordinary coincidences in dates, struck by the fact that the Presidential election took place on 1st June.  Before that election, he announced he was going to pay more to State servants, but he did not announce until after the election the manner in which he intended to collect that payment.  Before that election, he and the Minister for Justice announced that the Garda were to get substantial increases in salaries, but, again, it was not until the election was over that they were told the details of how that £500,000 for the Garda was to be collected.</P>
    <P>It was before the election, before <Col N="1114" /> 1st June, that the Minister for Agriculture announced that farmers in the creamery areas and in the liquid milk area would get an extra 2d per gallon for their milk, but it was not until the election was over that the housewife had to pay the extra 3d per pound for her butter or that the details of the manner in which the Minister for Finance intended to raise the additional amount required were told to the people as a whole.</P>
    <P>It was an extraordinary coincidence, too, that CIE, with the connivance and assistance of the Minister for Transport and Power, announced before the election that those who were employed by CIE were to get an increase in wages, but it was not until after the election that it was announced by that company that fares were to be increased. In fact, we could say quite truthfully that in relation to anything good that they could announce, they were quite prepared to make sure that they paid with the people's money to get their nominee home, and even then they succeeded only by the skin of their teeth.</P>
    <P>We must consider this Budget also in connection with the general economic position.  We are told constantly by the Minister who has just left that there is no shortage in relation to housing, that there is more housing being carried out this year than ever before.  Let us have a look at <i>Economic Series</i> published on 14th June.  In relation to private houses being built with State aid, that is to say, grant houses, Table 56 shows that in the first five months of 1965, January to May, 3,282 new houses were built by private persons and public utility societies.  In the same five months of 1966, the number had dropped to 2,892, a drop of 390 houses, or approximately 12½ per cent.</P>
    <P>In Table 57, we find that in relation to the number of houses for which reconstruction grants had been obtained, in the same first five months of the year, it dropped from 3,643 last year to 3,352 this year, a drop of 291 or roughly eight per cent.  In regard to the total number of new houses built, which is only available for the first three months of the year&mdash;the figures <Col N="1115" /> for April and May are not given&mdash;we find a drop from 2,734 houses to 2,228, a drop of 506 houses in the first three months of the year, or in total house production, very nearly 25 per cent on this year's figures and 20 per cent on last year's figures.  How, in the face of those figures published by the Statistics Office, the Minister for Local Government can come in here and say regularly, as he does, that there is no reduction in housing, beats me and must indeed be beyond the comprehension of any reasonable person.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the position in regard to emigration.  I know very well that the net passenger movement by sea and air is not a complete picture of the emigration problem.  It is true to say that it is not always accurate, but it does show a trend.  Tables 54 and 55&mdash;Table 55 for the first four months of the year and Table 54 for the first two months&mdash;show there is an increased trend in emigration this year. That is borne out by the Economic Research Institute when they referred to the very matter to which Deputy O'Leary referred, that is, the shortage of skilled labour, particularly in the metals, engineering and vehicles section of industry.</P>
    <P>The latest industrial survey available from the Economic Research Institute is that which was made in April, 1966 and published a week or so ago. Anyone who looks at that and endeavours to analyse it cannot but be frightened by certain of the indices in it.  Total manufacturing sales in the first quarter of this year compared with last year are down.  Total manufacturing production in the first quarter of last year compared with the first quarter of this year is down.  In the metals, engineering and vehicles industry, which is to a large extent part of our basic build-up for other goods, there is no less a figure than 60 per cent given of cases in which production is lower this year than last year.  This is perhaps the worst of the whole lot.</P>
    <P>We find also that, in the beginning of the second quarter, sales are lower than they were last year, that exports, I am glad to say, are on average <Col N="1116" /> higher, prices are higher, employment lower on average than last year, orders lower on average than last year, and the general opinion appears to be that we are not going to be able to get a norm of progress at all.  We have an acknowledgement in this that in the metals, engineering and vehicle side of industry, in 71 per cent of cases they are able to obtain their skilled labour only with difficulty, that they can get only sufficient in the other 29 per cent and that nobody at all says they can get their skilled labour easily.</P>
    <P>The Economic Research Institute goes further and says that, on its estimate, total sales in the first half of 1966 will be less than the total sales in the first half of 1965, that home sales will be less, that investment expenditure on plant and equipment will be less&mdash;that is one of the worst features of the whole lot&mdash;that whereas, in 36 per cent of cases, it will be higher, in 23 per cent of cases, it will be the same, but in 41 per cent of cases it will be lower and, unless we are to get proper investment in plant and equipment, we cannot hope, not alone to increase employment, but to maintain the employment we have, nor can there be any prospect whatever of increasing our standard of living.</P>
    <P>The Economic Research Institute estimates that there will be less employment in the first half of 1966 than there was in the first half of 1965, and that in spite of the fact that it is not so many years since the Taoiseach gave vent to his grandiloquent and extravagant promise that if only he were allowed to lead on, he would provide 100,000 new jobs.</P>
    <P>The sum total of it all is that the prognosis of the quantitative result for the whole of the calendar year 1966 is that production will go up by only two per cent this year compared with the norm we know we have to get if we are to succeed, not merely in achieving the target set by the Second Programme for Economic Expansion but to achieve a target reasonably good enough to be able to take our place with the other nations in <Col N="1117" /> Europe, should we be able to become a member of the European Economic Community.  Indeed, that two per cent increase is accompanied by an estimate that production will be down by one per cent for the second quarter of 1966 as compared with the second quarter of 1965.  That production estimate of two per cent increase is taken after we have taken account of an increase in our exports and, of course, there will be some increase in exports, thank goodness, this year.</P>
    <P>I do not know where this new addition to our Budget will take us in relation to our social welfare proposals. It is a sorry reflection that, in the 1963 Budget, certain social welfare improvements were given, that, in the 1964 Budget, certain social welfare improvements were given, that, in the 1965 Budget, certain social welfare improvements were given but, in every single one of those years, the amount of the improvement was paid, not out of current revenue, but by borrowing.  It is the first time in the history of this State that a Minister for Finance has so mismanaged his affairs&mdash;of course, it was not Deputy Lynch all the time; before him it was Dr. Ryan&mdash;that one can say that the amount of social welfare benefits has had to be met by borrowing out of the already far too scarce pool of capital.  It is not that the people did not need the improvements they got.  Of course, they did, with the way the cost of living was going up spiral-wise, thanks to the initiation by Dr. Ryan of his turnover tax in 1963.</P>
    <P>Here are the details: the Budget of 1963 gave 2/6 a week to old age and other pensioners at a cost of £1,191,000, and gave an increase in public service pensions at a cost of £120,000, making a total to these two classes of £1,311,000.  Unfortunately, in that year the Minister for Finance so failed to balance his Budget that he had a Budget deficit at the end of the year of more than that figure and had to provide that figure by borrowing and an addition to it, because his total deficit was £2,220,000.</P>
    <P>In the 1964 Budget, the Minister for Finance at that time gave an increase of 2/6 a week to old age and other pensioners at a cost of £730,000 and <Col N="1118" /> gave an increase in public service pensions at a cost of £140,000, making a total of £870,000, but he did not get that £870,000 out of current revenue.  No&mdash;he had a deficit of not merely that but of a sum of £4,070,000.</P>
    <P>We come on to 1965.  The Budget of 1965 gave an increase of a penny a gallon on milk at a cost of £400,000, an increase of 10/- a week to old age pensions and other pensions at a cost of £3,220,000 and an increase in public service pensions of £400,000, making a total of £4,020,000&mdash;apparent beneficence by the then Minister for Finance but, unfortunately, when it came to the end of his Budget there was a deficit not merely of that amount but of virtually double it, £8 million.</P>
    <P>It is easy to be munificent with borrowed money but it brings its sad tale with it, and it is because Fianna Fáil Ministers for Finance in these three Budgets failed to do their job of seeing how their Budgets would balance that we are in part of our difficulties today.</P>
    <P>In fact, the record of Fianna Fáil in relation to Budget deficits is something that has to be totted up to be believed.  Let us take the past six years.  In 1960-61, the Budget deficit was £730,000; in 1961-62, £710,000; in 1862-63, £4,850,000; in 1963-64, £2,220,000; in 1964-65, £4,070,000; in 1965-66, £8 million approximately&mdash;a total of £20 million in six years&mdash;£20 million which had to be borrowed and paid for over the next 30 years, as a result of the incompetence of Fianna Fáil&mdash;£20 million, which means that every child born in 1966 will have to pay for approximately 25 years of his life something in taxation to make up for that incompetence of Fianna Fáil over the past six years.  Then they talk of Lemass leading on and of the economic improvements they have been able to make.</P>
    <P>The fact, of course, is that this Government are bereft of control, bereft of ideas and do not know where they are travelling.  The only records that the Government have been able to make are records that everybody would prefer not to make in his private life. They are endeavouring to curry support by an old maxim, statement, <Col N="1119" /> quotation&mdash;whatever word you like&mdash;of George Bernard Shaw, which was never so true as today, that is, that a government that robs Peter to pay Paul can always count on the support of paul.  They are even failing to get that support now.</P>
    <P>We have the worst record in Europe for industrial disputes, a record of industrial disputes that has its inception and beginnings in the spiral initiated by the turnover tax of 1963.  The Government have that worst record because of the manner in which they deliberately set their face against any effort to devise an incomes policy at an early stage and at the appropriate time.  We have said before from these benches, and we shall continue to say, because it is true, that Fianna Fáil never think in terms of an incomes policy until the crisis is upon the nation and then it is too late, and it is not the time or the climate of opinion in which to get it through.</P>
    <P>With regard to an incomes policy, the Taoiseach, speaking in Mullingar, made this categorical statement as reported in the <i>Irish Press</i> of 6th April, 1965:</P>
    <P>We of Fianna Fáil do not believe that any system of this kind is workable. It has not been successfully operated in any country except in Communist countries.  We are definitely against it.  If we are in Government we will not apply it and if we are in Opposition we will oppose it strongly.</P>
    <P>Later on last year the Taoiseach was reported in the <i>Chamber of Commerce Journal</i> as having said at a function of that body:</P>
    <P>As regard an incomes policy there are some very vague ideas floating around, and a reiteration of this phrase by many people who seem only dimly to comprehend what it means.  There is need to define precisely, and to promote understanding and acceptance of, what are the components of an incomes policy related to our circumstances.</P>
    <P>In Mullingar, the Taoiseach said that an incomes policy had never been <Col N="1120" /> successfully operated in any country, except in Communist countries.  Then he goes on to say:</P>
    <P>An incomes policy is a fundamental requirement of continual economic growth, and it is also the foundation of a just social policy, which must involve a degree of income redistribution.</P>
    <P>There he went very near the just society but checked himself in time. Again he says with regard to an incomes policy:</P>
    <P>In a totalitarian regime it is imposed by government order: in a free democracy it has to be worked out by consultation and agreement. There are many aspects of a sound incomes policy which have yet to be settled, and careful consideration has to be given to the social objectives which should inspire it.  These are tasks on which all who have responsibilities in this regard have now to embark.</P>
    <P>How could the Taoiseach reconcile that statement with that he made in Mullingar when he said: &ldquo;We of Fianna Fáil do not believe that any system of this kind is workable&rdquo;?  How can anybody hope to have any confidence in the leader of a Government and the leader of the country, and the present Taoiseach should be the leader of the country but he has abdicated that position both at home and abroad, who changes his mind so blatantly in the space of less than six months?  At least I am glad of his conversion if it is a genuine conversion but I doubt it. The Taoiseach has dithered along and has done nothing and has given us good reason to doubt whether his is a real, genuine conversion.</P>
    <P>I now go on to quote from a journal of 10th June, 1966, in which there is a photograph of Taoiseach Lemass and contains a heading: &ldquo;These are the Men to Blame&rdquo;.  They give various people to blame for the fact that Ireland is in a sorry mess and they say that in a mere 24 hours that week the typical Irish firm found itself: closed down by the ESB strike, penniless because of the bank strike, frustrated by the continuing delay in the docks and by the British seamen's <Col N="1121" /> strike and paperless because of the continuing closure at the paper mills, unable to get its internal telephone system fixed because of the picketing of the Standard Telephone offices.  It says that holiday-minded executives found themselves unable to be sure of an air ticket because of two weeks strike notice by 1,500 Aer Lingus clerks.</P>
    <P>Here is the answer they offer to the question why these men are to blame. They say that Deputy Lemass and his Government stood by through the critical months of the winter and did nothing save summon the occasional, ineffectual meeting; they say their industrial legislation has yet to appear and is too late to have any immediate effect, that fearful of upsetting an already touchy electorate, Deputy Lemass and his men fell backwards in all directions simultaneously in order to avoid losing a single vote for their candidate.</P>

      <P>This is not a journal that is by any means favourable to Fine Gael.  On the contrary, <i>Business and Finance News</i> has given, every week in recent months, favourable comment to many members of Fianna Fáil and the Government.  Now, apparently, they have seen the light.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already referred to the condition of the building industry, to the facts which are statistically there about the lesser number of houses being built with State aid.  I have already referred to the loss to the tourist industry we are going to have this year, both by reason of the British seamen's strike and the additional impositions in this Budget.  I have already referred to the capital stringency which has arisen from the unfavourable climate of opinion the Fianna Fáil Minister for Finance of that day brought in when he introduced the 1963 Finance Act and which was continued by the present Minister when, in his swaddling clothes as Minister for Finance, he allowed himself to consider narrow decisions rather than the broader viewpoint any Minister should concern himself with.  I have already referred <Col N="1122" /> to the capital stringencies that arise because the Minister for Finance has been hogging to himself all the money available in the banks which should have gone to the development of private enterprise and which could be utilised in the development of our economy as it should have been.</P>
    <P>I have referred to the fact that we are one of the four countries in the world in which, as the International Labour Organisation reported, the wages of our workers are lower than the wages of workers in other countries and one of the four countries in which the purchasing price of wages fell in 1966.  We face the situation in which we have from the Leader of the Government the statement that taxation increases will go on.  He said on television: &ldquo;No, they will never end.&rdquo; Certainly, so far as this Budget is concerned, they do not end.  In the past four years, taxation on incomes has gone up from £63 million to £92½ million and taxation on expenditure from £131 million to £180 million. The total increase in taxation is from £196 million to £285 million, an increase of 45 to 50 per cent.  If the Minister wants to make it up more accurately, he is welcome to do so.</P>
    <P>The amount in taxation, not merely in gross absolute terms but the amount of taxation taken on the percentage of the gross national product has gone up from 23½ per cent in 1963-64 to 26½ per cent this year.  We are told by the Taoiseach that now it will never end, that it will go on and on.  The increase in taxation this year over the amount raised in taxation last year is working out at about £32 million.  The share of the increase in the gross national product which there may be this year on the Department of Finance Estimate is going to be 58½ per cent going to the Minister for Finance and only 41½ per cent left for those who make that increase.</P>
    <P>Can we afford to see three-fifths of the increase in our gross national product being taken away by the grasping hand of a Minister for Finance?  Can we afford to see that in this year alone taxes on income will have gone up by 15 per cent?  Can we afford to see that taxes on expenditure <Col N="1123" /> will have risen by £18 million? Can we afford to see that total taxation will have risen in this year by £30 million or 12 per cent, that, in other words, where £1 was collected last year in taxation, another 2/6d will be taken out of the pockets of the people for the purpose which the Minister for Finance indicated?  The burden of taxation as a percentage of production&mdash;and that is the important thing&mdash;will this year have risen by 12 per cent.</P>
    <P>All those things are bad enough. All those are sufficient to make any self-respecting Minister for Finance and any self-respecting Government feel they should get out and offer the country and the people the alternative, if the country so desires, of choosing somebody else, but when one considers those things in the context I mentioned earlier, of the dishonest manner in which every benefit was announced to every class of the community before 1st June and the details of the impositions that were to come to pay for those benefits deliberately hidden by the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Transport and Power and the Minister for Agriculture until after 1st June&mdash;when one considers that dishonest method of attempting to bribe the people and that in spite of all that, they got their nominee home only by the shortest of short heads, it is sufficient reason why any self-respecting Government should get out and make way for a Government who could take control instead of continuing with loss of control, floundering on from day to day.</P>

      <P>Whoever coined the description or phrase, &ldquo;mini-Budget&rdquo; to describe the Budget introduced this month by the Minister for Finance was being very kind to the Government and the Minister.  There is nothing &ldquo;mini&rdquo; or midget-sized about the Minister's effort in his second Budget inside three months.  In this Budget in a full year, the Minister <Col N="1124" /> proposes to raise in taxation roughly two-thirds again as much as he proposed to raise in new taxation in the Budget of last March.  In every way, instead of being a mini-Budget, this is certainly a king-sized Budget, even for the Fianna Fáil (Republican) Party.  It is a Budget that proposes to raise in taxation in a full year roughly two-thirds as much again as the Minister proposed to raise in what should have been his main or annual Budget, introduced last March.</P>
      <P>The country is sick and tired of the present Government.  They regard it, as we on these benches regard it, as fantastic that the Government cannot formulate a Budget for longer than a three-month period.  We had the Budget last spring; we now have a summer Budget; and it may well be that the Government are setting the pattern of having seasonal Budgets, spring, summer, autumn and winter Budgets.  It is certainly fantastic that a responsible Government should introduce their annual Budget in March and should come back three months later with a major Budget, another Budget to raise millions of pounds in new taxation.  If any businessman or even any householder conducted his affairs in that way, he would be in the bankruptcy courts in no time, and very few of us&mdash;certainly very few on the Government benches&mdash;would have any sympathy with him because every businessman or individual householder has to budget according to his income. He cannot go along, as apparently the Government can, and bring in a Budget to raise new money every time he is short of money.  He cannot go around, as apparently the Government can, &ldquo;bumming&rdquo; for money around the world from America to Canada, to Germany.  That is the kind of Government we have had and which the Taoiseach had what I regard as the audacity to describe as &ldquo;the finest team of Ministers any country could hope to have&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Inside three months, the Government found their Budget was unbalanced to the tune of £5 million. Deputy Sweetman gave some figures going back over the past half-dozen years or so to show how year after <Col N="1125" /> year Fianna Fáil Governments have failed to balance their Budgets, how they have deficits of varying amounts at the end of each of their financial years and how, in introducing his Budget in March last, the Minister had to disclose a deficit of £8 million. That was at the end of 12 months or so and apparently that is not too bad for a Fianna Fáil Government because inside three months he had a deficit again of £5 million and he comes along to raise new taxation to cover it.</P>
    <P>It is no excuse for the Minister or any Government spokesman to say in this House that this money is required to meet the just demands of the farmers.  If the farmers had, as I believe they had, a just claim and if they had a fair case, as I believe they have, their claim was just as fair and just as strong in March as in June and surely it was the duty of a responsible Government to listen to that claim in March and to cater for it when bringing in what should be their annual Budget last March.  Judging by the speech of the Taoiseach on the Budget, I think the Government are very seriously misjudging the feelings of the people.  The Budget introduced last March was in many ways unnecessary but it was tragically unnecessary so far as the additional taxation was concerned, unnecessary because of the obstinate refusal of the Fianna Fáil Party to listen to the advice given to them then from these benches or to heed the warnings that were given, and because they dismissed that advice and those warnings as simply prophecies of gloom, doom and despair.  Instead of paying some attention to them, the Minister had to come into the House and throw himself on the mercy of the House and ask: &ldquo;What went wrong with my last Budget?&rdquo;  What went wrong with the last Budget was that neither he nor his Party had the good judgement to listen to the advice they were given over the years from these benches and particularly, if I may say so, by Deputy Dillon.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach tells us that we have the finest team of Ministers that any country could hope to have.  I think the people of the country, as well as Deputies, are entitled to look back, in <Col N="1126" /> a discussion of this sort, to see what the finest team of Ministers any country could hope to have, have given this country since they took up office little more than a year ago.</P>
    <P>I do not think there are any Fianna Fáil Deputies in the House who will question the accuracy of anything I say.  Is it not true that, since the general election, the finest team of Ministers any country could hope to have, have given this country as tight a credit squeeze as any country in the world has ever had?  Is it not true that they have succeeded, in the short space of 12 months, in bringing about a situation in which credit is restricted, in which by reason of credit restrictions, business is restricted, in which people find it difficult to get money to build their houses or to carry out improvements and certainly a situation in which anything in the nature of business expansion has to go by the board or be postponed?  That is one of the gifts to this country from the finest team of Ministers any country could hope to have.</P>
    <P>What else have the finest team of Ministers any country could hope to have given to the country?  In addition to the credit squeeze, we have had grave industrial strikes and industrial unrest in the country in the past 12 months.  I do not believe for a minute that that industrial unrest had its birth merely in the past 12 months. Certainly, so far as some of the factors which gave rise to the industrial strikes and unrest are concerned, they date back many years.</P>
    <P>As was pointed out here in connection with the ESB strike about six years ago, the situation which finally erupted in the ESB strike must have been known to the Government because we had a similar situation at that time and similar legislation was proposed.  Yet, six years later, nothing effective had been done to settle the unrest or the dissatisfaction which existed there.  Therefore, we have had the finest team of Ministers any country could hope to have giving us a credit squeeze in a situation of grave industrial unrest and giving us, during virtually the entire period since the general election, a very severe economic depression which culminated in <Col N="1127" /> the arrest of hundreds of decent farmers who came to Dublin to state their case to the Government and to the Minister.  It was only when the farmers took a strong line, when many hundreds of them were arrested, and in the throes of an election where people were having an opportunity of voicing their approval or disapproval of the Government, that the Government decided to accede to those claims.  As I have said before, if those claims were justified last week or the week before, they were certainly justified in March last.  I seriously suggest to any Fianna Fáil Deputy in this House that it was the responsibility of the Government to take account of those claims and to deal with those claims in March last, rather than to introduce a second Budget to deal with them.</P>
    <P>The situation which has now arisen is, as other speakers from these benches have pointed out, that with the cumulative effect of two Budgets in three months, we have now reached a level of taxation in this country which is eight per cent higher than the Government themselves proposed in their Second Programme for Economic Expansion for the period 1966-67. This was a programme which I think every Deputy in the Fianna Fáil Party probably believed quite sincerely to be the salvation of this country.  It was a programme which led them to believe that this Government knew what they were about, knew what they would do, knew where they were going.</P>
    <P>I think many Deputies in the Fianna Fáil Party, with absolute conviction, argued with the people outside church gates in the last general election that they should &ldquo;Let Lemass Lead On&rdquo; for the purpose of implementing the projections and proposals in the Second Programme for Economic Expansion.  We now find, so far as the level of taxation is concerned, that we have already gone eight per cent higher than the projections in that programme. We are taking eight per cent more in taxation from the people than the Government proposed in that programme. Not only has the level of <Col N="1128" /> taxation gone eight per cent higher than was projected, but, at the same time as that has happened, the output is some two per cent lower than was laid down as the target in the Second Programme for Economic Expansion.  When we add the increase in the level of taxation and the reduction in output, there is, effectively, an actual taxation burden of ten per cent higher on the people than was forecast by the Government in their Second Programme for Economic Expansion.  In other words, for every £100 the Government said they would take from the people in taxation in 1966-67, they are, in fact, taking £110 from the people.</P>
    <P>I said already that I believed this Government&mdash;I do not think it applies only to the members of the Cabinet; I think it applies also to a number of Fianna Fáil Deputies&mdash;seriously misjudged the depth of feeling aroused amongst the people by the actions and policies of this Government over the past 12 months.  I know it is very easy for Opposition speakers to challenge the Government to go to the country. But it is even easier for a Taoiseach with a majority behind him in this House to answer that by saying: &ldquo;We are not going to the country until 1970&rdquo;, or whatever it is.  He backed up that argument of course by counting heads and saying: &ldquo;We have more votes inside the House than you have&rdquo; But if Deputies opposite think on the position seriously, they will agree that in the long run it is not good either for themselves or the country that a Government who have so clearly aroused such strong feelings amongst the electorate, have so clearly lost the confidence of the people, should carry on in those circumstances as a Government.</P>
    <P>It is true that the Government cannot be defeated in this House by virtue of the number of seats they now hold.  My personal belief is that, if Fianna Fáil persist in holding on to office, despite the feeling they have aroused amongst the people, it will only mean that they will fare very much worse in the long run than if they decided to take the plunge, go to <Col N="1129" /> the country now and let the people pass judgment on them.</P>
    <P>I believe that one of the principal reasons the people feel so strongly&mdash; I would invite any Fianna Fáil Deputy to test out what I am saying by consulting his constituents&mdash;is that the ordinary people in the country felt right through the last general election that they did not get adequate warning from the Government of the difficulties facing the people.  In fact&mdash;I quoted this before but I will refer to it again&mdash;going into the last general election, in what must have been the first television programme of the Fianna Fáil Party in that election, the Taoiseach said that the tide of Irish affairs had reached a flood and declared, as reported in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 19th March, 1965:</P>
    <P>We must sail out capably to new horizons declared the Taoiseach, Mr. Lemass, in a telecast last night.  Paraphrasing Shakespeare, he said: &ldquo;There comes a time in the affairs of every nation which must be taken at the flood.  The tide is with us now.  It is at the flood and we must not leave the ship of State in the harbour to people who don't know how to operate it and would not know where to take it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was in March, 1965, just a year before the Minister for Finance introduced his March Budget.</P>
    <P>How different is the picture today. The Taoiseach intervened in this debate on Wednesday last, 15th June. There was no talk then about the tide being with them; there was no talk about sailing out capably to new horizons.  On Wednesday last, there was no question of the kind of picture the Taoiseach must have presented to the people in his telecast.  Instead we had the Taoiseach virtually crying out for help.  At column 576 of the Official Report for that day, he refers to the difficulties of the country's tax system and goes on to say:</P>
    <P>If we are to succeed in getting the country over this difficult patch through which it is now passing and going ahead again, going ahead as strongly as before, then we will need <Col N="1130" /> a great deal of understanding of the nature of our present problems and the way out of these problems, both from the leaders of business and from the trade unions and, indeed, require not merely their understanding of the nature of our problems and the solution of them but their active co-operation in working out the solutions.</P>
    <P>Not merely did he cry out to the leaders of business and the trade unions for a helping hand to the Government in the mess in which they have got themselves and the country, but he even looked across the House and sought support from the Parties opposite.  As column 579, he was referring principally, I think, to the problems of unemployment, and he said:</P>
    <P>This problem can be solved only by the assiduous application of the minds of Members of this House to the various solutions that are possible and the preparation by the Government of the plans which derive from that consideration to which we all can, I hope, give adequate support to secure their implementation</P>
    <P>Here we are 12 months after the Fianna Fáil Government have been re-elected to office, 12 months after the Taoiseach was speaking of sailing out capably to new horizons, 12 months after the Taoiseach had warned the people, according to the <i>Sunday Independent</i> of 4th April, 1965, that:</P>
    <P>The only prospect now in sight of future difficulty and of a slowing down of the momentum of the nation's advance would be a temporary interruption of the Government leadership by reason of an interlude of ineffective minority Government.</P>
    <P>Twelve months after all that kind of talk was indulged in, we have a period of severe difficulties, to put it at its mildest.  We have a period which culminates in the Taoiseach coming into the House and crying out for help from the leaders of trade unions and from the Opposition Parties.</P>
    <P>It is true to say for all political <Col N="1131" /> Parties in this State, and I think I can certainly make the claim for the Party I have the honour to represent that, as far as this State is concerned and as far as the economy is concerned, we will do our best to see that this country comes out of its difficulties. We will do our best to demonstrate not only in this House but in the country that we have confidence in the basic soundness of the country's economy, in the ability of this country to survive, even to survive such a period as it has gone through under one of the finest teams of Ministers any country could hope to have, in the words of the Taoiseach.  However, the fact that that is our attitude in relation to the country and to the economy should not be taken as meaning that we in any way intend pulling our punches in dealing with this Government and it should not be taken as indicating that we have even the smallest degree of confidence in this Government, or that we agree with the policies they are pursuing.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach in his speech here last week warned that we would have a fight on our hands.  That may be true, although I doubt it.  So far as I can judge, in any event, this Government do not seem to have any stomach at all at the moment for fighting.  They are not giving any evidence that they are fit to put up a fight, either a political fight or any other fight, but if they have a fight on their hands, their fight is going to be to convince the people that they are fit to continue as a Government, a fight which I do not think they will win.</P>

      <P>I am sorry.  I have heard no suggestion as to what they would have done.  Not one suggestion has come from that side.  We hear enough about the sins of Fianna Fáil. <Col N="1133" /> We have been blamed for the credit restriction but everybody knows that there is credit restriction all over Europe.  There is a drop in production in Germany and Belgium is feeling the pinch.  There is a restriction on the export of capital from every European country, as well as from the United States.  It is something which often happens after a period of great expansion.  It is quite common and you take steps, and this Government have taken steps to prevent it.  I wonder what the other fellows would have done?</P>
      <P>We have been blamed for industrial unrest but how can you blame any Government for industrial unrest when it has set up all the different necessary organs to deal with it?  We have the Labour Court and conciliation arrangements and industrial councils.  All of these were set up under the Industrial Relations Act and until all those have been tried, a Government would not intervene.  I hope that whatever industrial legislation will be introduced it will strengthen these existing arrangements. A Government do not intervene except in a case of crisis, like the ESB crisis.  To say that the Government should have anticipated the ESB crisis&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is a very good idea.  I hope we get better industrial legislation in consequence, but with the existing legislation the Government could do no more.  The only thing you could blame us for was the bad weather in spring and the British seamen's strike.  Indeed, one Deputy almost blamed us for that strike.  It may affect our balance of payments and it will mean a great loss to the tourist trade and I could almost detect a note of gladness that it was happening.</P>

    <P>The Minister for Finance has been accused of dishonesty for not bringing in his mini-Budget in March.  Was the Minister for Finance to anticipate the unformulated demands of the farmers? Was he to anticipate one of the worst <Col N="1134" /> acreages, from the farming point of view, we had in history?  Was he to concede the £1 increase before it was decided on?  Was he to anticipate all those things and include them in his Budget of March?  He solemnly warned the House that he would be bringing in a second Budget and possibly he brought it in sooner than was anticipated.  It was brought in to meet the £1 increase to State employees. No Deputies object to that? It was also brought in to pay the farmers.  We saw Deputy O'Higgins shedding tears over the farmer.  How is this to be paid except by taxation? That was why the mini-Budget&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It depends on your view.  I have heard no constituent of mine complaining.  What does a man who is earning £16 a week and who has a wife and two children pay in income tax?  Not a penny.  A man with a wife and two children who is earning £1,200 a year pays something like £70 to £90, or about 7½ per cent.</P>
      <P>Reference was made to the selective tax but that hurts nobody except those who wish to purchase these articles. My point is that the mini-Budget had to be brought in to fulfil the obligations to farmers and State employees who are getting the £1 per week increase. The Minister should not have been expected to anticipate those in his major Budget.</P>

      <P>It has been pointed out that any responsible Government budgets from year to year.  The best we can get now from Fianna Fáil, the best their collective effort can produce, is a Budget for three months.  The best they can do is to budget from March to June.

    <P>Fianna Fáil must take full responsibility for the present position of the country and every Deputy who sits behind the Fianna Fáil Front Bench and who votes for these taxes must shoulder the responsibility for those taxes.  Surely the Government must realise that their efforts, and their <Col N="1138" /> efforts alone, are driving the cost of living higher and higher?  When Deputy Lenihan was speaking, and presenting us with a chapter from history, I thought he would bring his mind back to the root cause of all our ills.  Can he, or any other Fianna Fáil Deputy, deny that the financial and economic difficulties from which this country now suffers were the sole making and sole responsibility of Fianna Fáil as a result of their efforts to remain in office?  Is it not common knowledge&mdash;this was revealed in the recent Presidential election&mdash;that the start of all our difficulties was the price that had to be paid for the Cork city and Kildare by-elections?</P>

      <P>Had the un fortunate by-elections in Cork city and Kildare not arisen, I doubt if this country would be in the plight in which it is today.  At that time Fianna Fáil saw the ground slipping from under them.  They had been rejected in one of the principal Dublin constituencies and, in order to save themselves, in order to hang on to office, they made an attempt&mdash;a successful attempt&mdash;to purchase the votes of the people of Cork and Kildare.  This country is today paying the price of that purchase. Those two by-elections were the most expensive, and the most tragic, by-elections that ever took place in this country.  As a result of those by-elections, we have today a very serious situation.  The country has never experienced so many strikes.  There is a wave of unemployment.  In towns in rural Ireland.  labour exchanges have had to extend their hours of opening. I never remember so many unemployed as there are in the midlands today.</P>

      <P>The position is that the old age pensioners, the widows and orphans, the lame, the blind and the sick and the unemployed are on the verge of starvation.  In relation to the sick, I would remind the House that it was Deputy T. F. O'Higgins who brought in the disablement benefits which had never been thought of by Fianna Fáil.  The first time children's allowances were mentioned in this House was on a debate on a motion by Deputy Dillon asking for family allowances which put the idea into the heads of the Government. A Government in office for 32 out of 40 years must do some good some time.  They cannot do bad the whole time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to what I have said, we find that agriculture is in its most depressed <Col N="1143" /> condition since the State was founded.  Reference has been made to taxation imposed this year and here we can see the additional taxation contained in what has been described as a mini-Budget.  I do not see anything &ldquo;mini&rdquo; about it.  The Budget of last year was described as a savage Budget and, in my opinion, this supplementary Budget, which has been described as a mini-Budget, is as savage as the one passed through the House three months ago.</P>
    <P>We have in this country today, thanks to Fianna Fáil, the most expensive motoring in the world.  This has already been referred to in a statement made by Mr. Prole, Secretary of the Irish Motor Traders Association, who said that the effect of the supplementary Budget was that the tax on a gallon of premium petrol would now be approximately 3/11.  A spokesman for Esso said he was disappointed to see that the efforts of his company to reduce petrol prices should be overtaken by new taxation.  A spokesman for Irish Shell and BP said:</P>
    <P>We are disappointed that the decreases we applied within the last week have now been nullified by this Budget.</P>
    <P>The petrol companies reduced the price of petrol and within a week or ten days Fianna Fáil, in their supplementary Budget, again increased the price to the consumer, and that after the savage increase in the road tax which we had earlier this year.</P>
    <P>We also find that this Budget has made the usual raid on beer and spirits.  The distilling industry has been seriously perturbed as result of this Budget and I would like to make a case for those engaged in the licensed trade who must now be practically out of business.  It is only a few weeks since the Government endeavoured to prevent the publicans increasing the price of drink.  They made it an offence for any publican to increase his prices but when the publicans were not allowed to do it, the Government came along and increased it twice in the course of a few months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaugeBrennan" hpid="Mr. P. Brennan Mr. P. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Not this time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The last tax imposed on spirits has been responsible for driving those engaged in the licensed trade out of business.  Everybody knows that in the licensed trade, there is now less employment and less business.  Ask any of the publicans in the large provincial towns and they will have to admit that it is only on two or three afternoons of each week that they find any rush of business.</P>
      <P>This supplementary Budget inflicts great hardship on our people because everything appears to be at a standstill. Works of importance such as drainage schemes and housing are at a standstill and our health services are not up to the standard that they should be.  There have been restrictions and reductions in Army expenditure.  There has been a reduction in relation to the Local Defence Force; certain economies have been made in CIE; and there is a general all round atmosphere of depression.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is only one way in which this can be brought to a halt, that is, a change of Government.  That is the only solution to our problems.  The people are beginning to realise that as long as Fianna Fáil remain in office, they are going to be faced with continuously increasing taxation.  The Government have publicly admitted that they are not going to try to call a halt to taxation. The Taoiseach has said that there is no prospect of an end to new taxation. Now the people see that the only solution to their present serious problems is a change of Government.  As Deputy O'Higgins has already pointed out, the Government are afraid to face the electorate.  If they say that the country is passing through a financial crisis, they should be honest and tell the people that they have done what they could and cannot possibly do any better.  Having deliberately caused a situation in which the cost of living has increased, unemployment has been created and the people have been deprived of the standard of living to which they are entitled, the fairest thing for the Government to do now is to resign.  That plea has been made by many Opposition Deputies, and when the time comes, the electorate will have <Col N="1145" /> no hesitation in putting the Government out of office for all time because that would appear to be the only hope they have of getting relief from these half-yearly or quarterly Budgets which appear to be the order of the day so far as Fianna Fáil are concerned.</P>
    <P>This mini-Budget, as it has been described, is disastrous.  It will have a very serious effect on the country.  It will increase the cost of living.  The trade union movement will most certainly take steps to see that, if the cost of living increases, wages of workers will be increased accordingly.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil have failed miserably in their responsibility to the country. Any honest Government, realising that they had failed, would get out of office and leave it to the alternative Government to put this country back on the road to economic progress.  I am satisfied that our Party can and will form the Government after the next general election.  When we take office, we will most certainly apply suitable remedies for the difficulties which Fianna Fáil have deliberately created and will do everything in our power to safeguard the people from the savage attacks and raids that have been made on their pockets by Fianna Fáil.  The sooner, therefore, there is a general election, the better for all of us.</P>

Fourteen Fine Gael Deputies and ten Labour Deputies participated in the discussions.  Many salty tears were shed by Members on the Opposition benches about unfortunate farmers and their low incomes. When we sought the money to make additional income available to farmers, the Parties who cried so long and so loud voted against the unfortunate farmers.

      <P>Since this Government came into office in 1957, many things have happened.  I feel that the financial circumstances prevailing in the country are directly the responsibility of this administration for the following reasons: (1) Deputy Seán Lemass, as Tánaiste of a Fianna Fáil Party, made a promise of 100,000 new jobs in 1957 and got control of a Government; (2) he got control of that Government by pledging to the Irish people that, if elected, he would not remove the food subsidies but immediately he got into power he removed them, and that was the beginning of the spur which we now call the credit squeeze; (3) he introduced the turnover tax; and (4) he gave a 12 per cent increase to workers plus status claims to higher-paid civil servants in many cases up to £1,500 each.  He did all these things for political expediency and for no other reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember going back to Donegal, a very disheartened young Deputy, immediately after the Kildare by-election. <Col N="1156" /> I remember one of my strongest supporters, in the depths of despair&mdash; shall we put it that way&mdash;saying to me: &ldquo;But Lemass has proved himself a man.  He went into the by-elections the underdog.  He has come out the strong statesman, the strong national leader.&rdquo;  Just before those remarks were made, I remember reading two statements in that morning's <i>Irish Independent,</i> one by the Taoiseach, and the other by Deputy Dillon, the then leader of the Opposition.  I do not quote verbatim but any person who wishes to challenge this can read the <i>Irish Independent</i> of the Friday morning of that week.  Deputy Lemass is reported as saying that the vote in Cork and Kildare for the Fianna Fáil candidates was a vote of confidence in his administration and that it was the green light for him to carry on with the Second Programme for Economic Expansion.  Deputy Dillon is reported as saying that time would vindicate the principles of Fine Gael policy and expose the weaknesses and follies of the Fianna Fáil administration. I ask any sane, rational-minded Deputy to ask himself if these two statements, brief and to the point, did not sum up the feeling in the country then and the position in which the country now finds itself at this particular time.  Many Deputies can play cat and mouse with the political ball of wool.  Many Deputies can use all the mascara and political cosmetics that are to be used by shrewd and astute politicians but, in the final analysis&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Molloy would be best advised to keep quiet.  Deputy Dowling asked us here on these benches and on the Labour benches if we did not realise that when we were voting against increased taxation we were voting against the increases in wages for different workers.  Does any Deputy, least of all Deputy Dowling, believe that workers do not pay taxes? We were voting against increased taxation because we believed the country can be run without any increased taxation.  If the Government cannot figure out how to do so, I put it to them that they should get out before they are thrown out.  I heard it said recently that before long the Taoiseach might be a captain without a vessel. Deputy Dowling spoke of the social services provided by Fianna Fáil.

Speaking on Deputy Esmonde's amendment last night, the Minister said that Fine Gael as members of the inter-Party Government were responsible for the introduction of no fewer than six Budgets and they never thought of abolishing death duties.  As Deputy Flanagan has said, I think the Minister will break that record in 12 months.  There is no guarantee that when we come back after the summer recess, he will not introduce another Budget.  The Minister is a man of high integrity.  He is an honest, unassuming, modest individual.</P>

      <P>The weather is quite good in Donegal.  I do not know what it is like in Galway.  I do not believe the Minister for Finance did not know these things.  I am convinced beyond doubt he knew them well.  However, being a politician in touch with public opinion, he knew that on the eve of a Presidential election, the Government could not afford to be anything but <Col N="1159" /> popular.  He was afraid to be politically honest in case their Presidential nominee might be a has-been.</P>
      <P>The Minister's Budget in March was one of the earliest ever introduced here and it was also one of the most severe.  Now we have a second Budget. A few evenings ago a doctor friend told me of a conversation he had with a group of Americans visiting this city. They are on a tour of the world.  They claim that Dublin is the most expensive city in the world at present.  It is not expensive because the hoteliers are fleecing the tourists or because the taxi drivers charge exorbitant fares.  It is not expensive because the traders fleece everyone who come into their shops. It is expensive because these people must live and to provide services they must charge certain prices.  Those prices are necessary because of the bad economic planning of Fianna Fáil. Not alone did they claim that this was the most expensive city in the world but some of them who were on the same trip in 1954 said at that time they considered Dublin to be one of the cheapest cities in the world.  What has gone wrong?  I may be accused of being politically biased but I believe that when the former leader of the Fianna Fáil Party was Taoiseach, he held that office because he was a legendary figure.  I admit he had control over the Irish people.  When Deputy Geoghegan, Deputy Molloy or other backbench Deputies were seeking election to this House, the people who voted for them did not really vote for them but for &ldquo;the Big Chief&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>When the Taoiseach took over the administration, he lacked that persuasion.  The only way in which he could keep the confidence of the people was to increase taxation and thereby create the illusory situation that prosperity was in our midst and that employment was plentiful. This is the basic and fundamental idea of the Fianna Fáil economic programmes, first and second: increase taxation in the belief and in the hope <Col N="1160" /> that the Government who spend more and who keep spending will remain popular.  That is a fair approach, provided the nation is producing more and exporting more and provided our balance of payments is reasonably secure and controlled.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Adjournment, Deputy McAuliffe has given notice of his intention to raise the matter of the school strike at Derrygallon national school, County Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcAuliffe" hpid="Mr. McAuliffe Mr. McAuliffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McAuliffe</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I should like to stress to the Minister and to the House how serious the situation is.  In this locality there are roughly 70 children who failed to attend school last week.  This strike took place last Monday morning as a result of the Minister's decision not to erect at Derrygallon a new school which the people expected would have been erected three or four years ago.  The condition of the existing school is bad, particularly from the point of view of the sanitary arrangements.  For a long time the people have been agitating for an improvement in the sanitary accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A few years ago the school manager decided to purchase a new site and to build a new school.  In addition, he spent a considerable amount of money on the provision of a water supply. The total expenditure to date has been around £1,200.  The people believed that as soon as the site was bought, and as soon as the Department approved the erection of the new school work would start immediately.  Recently the people were informed that the Minister had decided not to erect a new school but to transfer the children to a school at Derrinagree three or four miles away.  I am informed that the parents did not know the exact position until they received a letter from another Deputy which was dated 5th June and which had been sent to him by the Minister.  He duly gave it to the parents' association <Col N="1161" /> within the past week or ten days.  The letter stated that the Minister had made up his mind not to erect a new school at Derrygallon but to transfer the children to the proposed new school at Derrinagree.  The letter was written to Deputy Crowley who sent it to the secretary of the association.  According to the letter, there is not a sufficient area of land available at Derrygallon to meet the requirements of the new school in regard to playgrounds, etc.</P>
    <P>I am familiar with the locality because I live within three or four miles of the school and I should like to tell the Minister that he will be actually taking children from three different parishes and from two different dioceses.  The schoolgoing children come from Kanturk, Boherbue and from Dromtariffe.  This is an amalgamation of three parishes and two dioceses.  I attended a parents' meeting recently and the parents' principal objection is that they are not conversant with what the Minister is going to do.  It is all right to tell the parents: &ldquo;We are going to provide transport&rdquo;, but in this as in any other locality there is a considerable number of workingclass people and they are under the impression that when transport is provided for primary education, it will probably be their responsibility to meet part of the transport costs.  They received no account of any decision on this very important matter and as a result, wisely or unwisely, decided to use the strong hand and take their children from the school.  The position is very serious.  I do not know how long they will be away from school but it is up to the Minister to give a guarantee to the parents' association in regard to the future.</P>
    <P>At present, temporary repairs are being carried out to the school but this appears strange to the parents because it is not today or yesterday they requested that repairs be carried out.  They asked for sanitary accommodation to be provided but this request was swept aside when the manager decided to buy a plot of ground and to provide a water supply which is available to the plot.  I am asking the Minister to consider seriously what I am saying.  It is most <Col N="1162" /> unreasonable that any Minister or Department should say: &ldquo;We are going to do a certain job, whether you people like it or not&rdquo;.  The people should be asked for their opinion.  Surely nobody is more conversant with the situation than the parents and therefore no matter what the policy may be in regard to one-teacher or two-teacher schools, there is a sufficient number of pupils here to justify the erection of a new school.</P>
    <P>The Minister should take into account the demands being made by the parents of those 70 children.  They claim they are entitled to have a school erected in the parish of Derrygallon where it always existed.  They also claim that they were never consulted other than by having public representatives present at their meetings from time to time to give them advice. I am sure that almost every public representative in Mid-Cork has attended their meetings.</P>
    <P>It may seem strange that I am interested in this but 50 per cent of the children going to the school are from East Cork because it caters for children from East Cork just as it caters for children from Mid-Cork.  I decided with my colleague, Deputy Mrs. Desmond, to raise this matter because the association asked me to do so.  I ask the Minister to examine carefully the points I have made.  I appeal to him, in particular, not to do anything that will drive a wedge between the parents and the school manager and the Department. I believe the greatest unanimity should exist between the three different interests.</P>
    <P>More important still is the fact that the sooner something is done and the sooner the Minister decides on making some approach, either to the school manager or to others, and gives some guarantee to the existing parents' association, the better it will be for all concerned.  Most important of all is to get the children back to school, having given that guarantee.  When I attended the last meeting, the parents were very firmly entrenched in their outlook on this matter.  I do not know if there has been any change within the last week, but I appeal to the Minister now to do <Col N="1163" /> something.  I could go on but I wish to give my colleague, Deputy Mrs. Desmond, an opportunity of intervening in this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EileenDesmond" hpid="Mrs. Desmond Mrs. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The education of some 70 children is in jeopardy because of the decision of the parents to keep the children at home from school. At the outset, I should like to say that, when speaking here on a Supplementary Estimate for the Department of Education, I agreed in principle with my colleagues in the Labour Party, to the Minister's policy of centralisation of national schools.  We believe that, in certain circumstances, centralisation will result in the educational advancement of the children.  In some cases it is virtually impossible to secure teachers who will remain in particular schools for any length of time.  Once a better opportunity offers, the teacher automatically leaves.  Teachers are frequently changing and, because of that, the progress of the children is retarded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1164" /> However, even though we believe in amalgamation in certain circumstances the question arises as to whether centralisation is practicable in the case of Derrygallon at this stage.  I am not at all sure that it is practicable and I support my colleague, Deputy McAuliffe, in his argument.  Lest the Minister should say in reply that I am doing a somersault since I spoke on the last occasion on education, I should like to quote what I said on 15th February last at column 1549 of volume 220 of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>Deputy Jones stated that a special inquiry should be held into each case before a school is closed.  I do not know whether that would be possible.  I think the Minister, up to a point is being fairly consistent.  He is receiving deputations from the various areas where schools are being closed and he is apparently considering every case but I think, by and large, the only argument which will carry any weight with the Minister is whether or not a certain number of pupils will be available on the rolls within the next five years and whether there will be enough pupils for the appointment of a third teacher.</P>
    <P>Now, there may be other considerations to be taken into account quite apart from the number of pupils on the rolls.  Those of us conversant with education in the rural areas, while in agreement in principle with the Minister's policy, feel that certain local considerations may, in some circumstances, make it necessary to retain two-teacher schools.  The organisations concerned should be consulted and the question of transport should be taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>I join with Deputy McAuliffe in appealing to the Minister to review the position now with regard to the closing of this school.  It would appear now that no great urgency arises with regard to a decision in this particular instance.  As far as I know, sanction for a site has not yet been obtained. The matter is progressing and it would appear that the central school will not now be built for some considerable time.  There is, of course, a <Col N="1165" /> priority list and, from what we can gather, in regard to representations about individual schools, it would appear now that progress in the building of schools will be very slow.  There would appear to be no great urgency in this matter.  Time is on the Minister's side in this instance and he has an opportunity of entering into further negotiations with those concerned.  This is very desirable because of the serious situation that exists.  Nobody wants a strike.  Nobody would suggest to parents that they should keep their children away from school.  But that has happened in Derrygallon and I am sure neither the Minister nor any Deputy would do anything to aggravate the present situation.</P>
    <P>The principal objection to the closing of rural schools is the transporting of very young children considerable distances.  Parents, as we who have attended these various meetings know, object to small children being away from home for such long periods, leaving early in the morning and having to wait, perhaps, for an older sister or brother to finish school in the evening.  If they become ill, they cannot, as they do now, return home.</P>
    <P>I am speaking now as one who is in general agreement with the Minister's policy and I would suggest, in order that this policy may operate smoothly, that it might be advantageous to reconsider the position from the point of view of small children in particular. It might be desirable to set up small nursery schools in particular localities in which schools are closed.  If something of that nature were done, there might be a much smoother operation of the policy the Minister is endeavouring to implement.</P>
    <P>Another point is&mdash;I do not really like making this because it may possibly be unfounded&mdash;that people in areas where these agitations are on foot believe that economic considerations rather than social ones are&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I protest; we did not interrupt the speakers from the Labour Party.  In the time available, would the Deputies please listen to what has to be said on the other side of the House? First of all, I want to set out the preliminaries of this case which are that the Department propose not to build a new school at Derrygallon but rather to build a five-teacher school at Derrinagree, about four miles away from Derrygallon, and to transport the children from Derrygallon to that school.  It is also relevant to note that the Derrinagree school which is a three-teacher school, is in a very bad condition and needs to be replaced and replaced urgently; more urgently than Derrygallon, Derrinagree needs to be replaced.  I am, therefore, faced with the position that in replacing Derrinagree, if I build a three-teacher school there, Derrygallon can have only a two-teacher school for another 80 or 100 years, and all the children of that area are condemned for that length of time to education in a two-teacher school.  I hope Deputy McAuliffe bears that in mind in his approach to this matter.</P>
      <P>While agreeing that Deputy Mrs. Desmond was a little out of order, she made a point I wish to answer.  She suggested that it was thought that this policy was being pursued for economic reasons.  I do not want to go into that but just to put this point to the Deputy: does she think the Irish National Teachers Organisation agreed to this policy, after full discussion, for economic reasons?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EileenDesmond" hpid="Mrs. Desmond Mrs. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Desmond</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that.  I am just <Col N="1168" /> pointing out it is quite unfair for people who should know better&mdash;I am not referring to Deputy Mrs. Desmond &mdash;to suggest that economic reasons are the main reason for this policy. The INTO would hardly have agreed to it for economic reasons.  Clearly it was for educational reasons in the interests of our children.</P>
      <P>In regard to this case, I was amazed listening to Deputy McAuliffe in his description of the matter and in his putting forward of the case, including the fact that a number of these people were workingclass people who could not afford to contribute to the cost of transport.  Deputy McAuliffe must have paid no attention not only to his own Party's policy but to the discussion on this question of two-teacher schools which took place in this House.  He mentioned that the first indication the people in Derrygallon had that the school was not going ahead was on 5th June.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make it clear that this matter was raised by Deputy Meaney in March and that it was evident from my reply that amalgamation was being contemplated.  While I understand Deputy Mrs. Desmond's position in this regard, I feel it is only fair that I should point out that she and other members of her Party, in speaking on this matter in the Dáil in the debate to which she referred, made it quite clear that they agreed with that policy.  The reservation was: would the transport be free?  I assured them in the strongest terms I could that it would be free.  With that undertaking, they expressed themselves as being in complete agreement with this policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>She said, and rightly, there would be <Col N="1169" /> circumstances one might have to take into consideration in relation to closing a two-teacher school.  I have continually made this point myself.  I have said there have been a number of cases where we have decided to go ahead and build two-teacher schools because of the particular circumstances. However, Deputy Mrs. Desmond did not attempt to tell us here tonight of any one special circumstance that should apply to prevent us going ahead with what we are proposing to do in regard to this school.</P>
    <P>As regards the point that the parents are very strongly against this &mdash;I will admit Deputy McAuliffe can make a case on this in view of the withdrawal of the children&mdash;I have information, reliable information, I believe, to show that very many of the parents there want the amalgamation but are afraid of being called blacklegs, that there has been a very active campaign carried on to stir up opposition to this.  I might comment in passing on the fact that the honorary secretary of the parents' committee is unmarried and has no interest as a parent in this matter.  Indeed the note of protest which was sent to me over her signature and which included a list of signatures referred to them as parents and householders.</P>
    <P>We ought to examine carefully what we are doing here.  There is a responsibility on public representatives, particularly those who are members of a Party who have advocated a certain policy, either to stand up in public and say they do not agree with their Party's policy or to say to their constituents that what is being done is in the best interests of their children. Unless they can put forward good reasons why this should not be done, these public representatives should have the backbone and the sense of responsibility to stand up in public <Col N="1170" /> and say this.  In public life, one has to do unpopular things from time to time, but even from a political point of view, it does not always do one a lot of harm to be honest and say what one believes to be true.  Public representatives who subscribe to their Party's policy on this question ought to have the courage to say that this is in the best interests of the children.</P>

      <P>We ought not to have this kind of thing of talking about people having to pay for transport when there is no question of paying for it.  I have made it clear on many occasions in regard to a number of these cases that if parents want consultation with me, I am prepared to have it or to send a representative of my Department to discuss the problem with them.  I have never been asked to do that in this case, nor have I refused to do it.  I am still prepared to do it, but I say it is grossly irresponsible of anybody who has any influence in this matter to have these children kept away from school, and I would ask the Deputies concerned of all Parties to use their influence in getting the children back to school.  We are not helping the children by keeping them out of school.  I can only say we are doing this on foot of the policy I have explained to the House at great length. No reasons have been advanced to me to show why it should not apply in this case.  However, I am quite willing to send a representative of my Department to discuss the matter with the parents.</P>
