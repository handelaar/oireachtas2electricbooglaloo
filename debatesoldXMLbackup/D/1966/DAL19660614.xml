    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he is aware that the various safeguards required by the British Government prior to joining the EEC have recently been listed by Mr. George Brown, Minister for Economic Affairs; and that these include safeguards for Commonwealth trade, for Britain's EFTA partners, safeguards for British agriculture, freedom to pursue their own foreign policy, and the right to plan their own economy; whether this country has demanded any similar safeguards, particularly in regard to foreign policy and economic planning in making application for membership of EEC; and, if so, what safeguards this country has sought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen reports of recent speeches by the British Secretary of State for Economic Affairs in which he spoke of the problems arising for Britain for which solutions would have to be sought in any resumed negotiations for British membership of the European Economic Community.</P>
      <P>As regards the second part of the Question, I would refer the Deputy to my statement of 18th January, 1962, to Ministers of the Governments of the member States of the European Economic Community, the text of which is contained in Appendix I to the White Paper on the European Economic Community laid before each House of the Oireachtas on 28th June, 1962.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="332" /> It is not our understanding of the Treaty of Rome that any limitations are resolved in respect of foreign policy other than commercial policy, or economic planning except in so far as this may be related to the implementation of the Treaty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I take it that no formal conditions have been laid down by the Taoiseach or the Government in respect of entry into the EEC?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I should not like to paraphrase the statement I made to the Council of Ministers in 1962 which set out the matters about which we would wish to negotiate when the question of our membership was being dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Far be it from me to compare this Government with the British Government but might I point out that they have laid down specific conditions with their application for membership?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Their situation is different from ours.  Having regard to the activities of some of the Member States of the EEC at the present time, it does not seem to me that there could be any suggestion that a limitation of freedom of action in respect of foreign policy is imposed by membership and the British Secretary of State for Economic Affairs did not suggest there was any problem in respect of limitation of economic planning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach said the British Government looked for an inclusion of safeguards for agricultural policy.  Does the Taoiseach think it necessary that we should have some similar condition for the safeguarding of Irish industry, for example?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>By and large, and without being held to this in any detail, the agricultural policy of the EEC would be acceptable to us as it stands.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach if the terms of his considered statement to Mr. Sulzberger, the diplomatic correspondent of the <i>New</i><Col N="333" /><i>York Times</i>, in regard to Ireland's entry into the EEC still stand?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether any estimation has been made of the probable effects of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement on the targets set in the Second Programme for Economic Expansion; and, if so, whether these estimates are to be published in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Lynch) Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would draw the Deputy's attention to chapter 7 of the White Paper on the Free Trade Area Agreement which includes some consideration of the impact of the Agreement on the Second Programme targets.  This issue is also dealt with in Part II of the 1965 Progress Report on the Second Programme and special attention is drawn to the revision of the target for transportable goods industries indicated at page 53 of the Progress Report.</P>
      <P>As I stated in my Budget address on 9th March last, a general review of the targets for 1970 which were set under the Second Programme has been initiated and the studies necessary for this review are proceeding.  While this review will take the Free Trade Area Agreement into account, the Agreement is only one of a number of factors which will have to be given due weight. When the review has been completed its results will be published as soon as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if county councils and urban sanitary authorities may use the powers available under section 28 of the Public Health (Ireland) Act, 1878 and section 19 of the Public Health Acts Amendment Act, 1907 for purposes similar to the objects of section 35 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963 in relation to the completion of works in unfinished housing estates, for the purpose of recovering the cost of the works from the landlords <Col N="335" /> in the estates concerned receiving ground rents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney) Neil T. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>The powers given by section 28 of the Public Health (Ireland) Act, 1878, to secure the completion of private streets are exercisable by all urban sanitary authorities.  Rural sanitary authorities may be given these powers by an order, applicable to a particular rural sanitary authority, made under section 1 of the Public Health (Ireland) Act, 1896, or by an order, applicable to all rural sanitary authorities, made under section 33 of the Local Government (Ireland) Act, 1898.  Orders have not been made under these sections giving these powers to rural sanitary authorities.</P>
      <P>Section 19 of the Public Health Acts Amendment Act, 1907, applies to all sanitary authorities both urban and rural.</P>
      <P>Neither sections 28 nor 19 enable the cost of the completion of private streets to be recovered from ground landlords.  Section 28 requires the cost to be borne by the owners or occupiers of premises on the street, and section 19 requires recovery of cost from owners only.  The word &ldquo;owner&rdquo; is defined in the Public Health (Ireland) Act, 1878, as meaning a person receiving a rent which is not less than two-thirds of the rateable valuation of the premises.  In practice, this excludes most ground landlords and under sections 28 and 19 the liability to complete a private street falls on the occupiers of premises on the street.</P>

      <P>I propose, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 6 and 7 together.</P>
      <P>The proposals to accept tenders for these cottages were received in my Department on 11th March last.  I am not in a position to say when a decision on them will issue.  I am, however, reviewing the position in County Cavan specially.  There were tender proposals before my Department for two cottages, only, when the housing capital allocations were calculated and the county council's provisional allocation for new works was, therefore, very small.  I hope to make a supplementary allocation in the near future which will enable the council to proceed with the building of a substantial number of additional cottages.</P>

      <NameTxt>Messrs. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>and <b>Larkin</b> asked the Minister for Local Government if he is aware that a number of tenants of cottages at St. Brendan's Terrace, Coolock, County Dublin are anxious to purchase their dwellings under the terms of the Labourers Acts; and if, in view of the fact that these cottages were built and tenanted by Dublin County Council through the provisions of these Acts, he will arrange with Dublin Corporation to enable such tenants to exercise their purchase rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so aware. I understand that these cottages are situated on land which formed part of the 1953 extension of the city of Dublin.  The county council were required under the Housing (Amendment) Act, 1950, to notify the tenants, at the time of the boundary extension, of their right to purchase their cottages under the Labourers Act, 1936. Apparently some of the tenants did not avail themselves of the right to purchase and this right lapsed when the cottages were transferred by the county council to the corporation in 1958.  It is open to Dublin Corporation to consider the formulation of a purchase scheme for these cottages under the Housing of the Working Classes Acts or under the new Housing Bill when it becomes law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the grade of differential rents applicable to these cottages is at the county council level as distinct from the corporation level?  This would seem to indicate there is still a tie, remote though it may be, with the county council.  In view of the fact that the suggestion in his reply indicates the operation of lengthy and, indeed, unwieldy machinery, would the Minister not consider it would be no more <Col N="338" /> than socially desirable that a small amendment of the Act be introduced to enable this small group of tenants to buy out these cottages which were not originally corporation houses but were erected and tenanted by the county council?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>

I am arranging to have the matter discussed further between the Department's inspector and the county council at an early date to decide whether the group scheme could proceed independently of the regional scheme.</P>

Examination was carried out when the inspector was next in the area.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, a Cheann Comhairle, with your permission to answer Questions Nos. 13 to 16 together.</P>
      <P>The items which constitute means for purposes of non-contributory pensions are set out in the relevant legislation and I have no power to add to or take from that list.  All income in cash, with certain specified exclusions, is assessable as means and British pensions come within that category.  They have always been assessable.</P>
      <P>Consequently, adjustment, and, in some cases, cessation of pension has been necessary following the granting of increases in British pensions as a result of the recent reciprocal arrangements but no pensioner will receive less by way of pension or combined pensions than he had previously.  Where pension is still payable but at a different rate new books have been issued without delay.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that the recent increases in British pensions to persons living in Ireland may reduce by about £268,000 the yearly expenditure on non-contributory old age and widows' pensions.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have received representations in regard to the proposals to close these schools and I am arranging that members of the inspectorate will discuss the matters in question with representatives of the parents.  All these schools are one-teacher schools and it seems clear that the educational interests of the children attending them would best be served by providing for them in larger schools to which they would be brought by transport services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the situation with which we are dealing?  In regard to Kileevan and Dartry, I think, there are 23 pupils attending each of these schools.  All strongly object to their being closed.  Is he further aware that these are the only two Protestant schools in the pilot area set up by the Minister for Agriculture and does he think it desirable, having set up a pilot area to demonstrate how a rural area should best be developed socially, that the first thing we should do is to close the only two Protestant schools, leaving all the Catholic schools open?  Will the Minister realise that in the very special circumstances obtaining in Monaghan, of which his colleague, the Minister for Transport and <Col N="361" /> Power, should have some knowledge, we have always protected very vigorously what our Protestant neighbours regard as a fundamental right; securing the consent of the parents to any arrangement in respect of any one of the four schools in question?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The representations so made have been considerably more helpful than those made by Deputy Dillon who says he is in favour of this policy and yet when it affects an area in his own constituency is capable of suggesting&mdash;by implication, if not more strongly&mdash;that this is being done because these are Protestant schools.  I want to repudiate that most strenuously. This policy applies to all schools. Furthermore, the co-operation being obtained from the authorities of the Protestant schools is such as to leave me in no doubt that what we are doing is in the best interests of their children and of the members of their particular churches.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I never made any concealment of the fact&mdash;and I now reiterate it&mdash;that I agree with the general principle adumbrated by the Minister in regard to these schools but there are special circumstances obtaining in Monaghan.  It is not good enough to say that the ecclesiastical authorities controlling these schools want this or that.  It is the parents who matter.  I am asking the Minister to go beyond the ecclesiastical authorities and ask the parents.  If the Minister for Transport and Power has told the Minister what he thinks the ecclesiastical authorities want or do not want, he can take a running jump at himself. He represents the people and that is what I am talking about.  The people on whose behalf I am speaking vote for the Minister for Transport and Power.  I get no votes from them.</P>

They are very well capable of doing that themselves and have done so.  The Minister was representing the views of his constituents and I have said in the answer I gave to the Deputy, to which he does not appear to have paid much attention, that members of the inspectorate of my Department will be meeting the parents and discussing this matter with them.</P>

      <P>Before I make a statement dealing with those motions, I already notified you, Sir, that I intended to mention the procedure which should be followed.  In the case of a Budget Statement, the practice is that short statements are made by the Leaders of the main Opposition Parties after the Budget Statement has been made.  This statement refers to three Resolutions and it will be in the form of a Budget Statement as such.  I would propose at the end of the statement formally to move the three Resolutions.  Those Resolutions will be circulated during the reading of my statement.  In the case of the ordinary Budget Statement, these Resolutions are not circulated until after the Budget Statement has been made.  If the Leaders of the Opposition Parties want to make short statements today, then those Resolutions will not be circulated until after the short statements have been made.  I want to know what is the procedure to be followed today?  I suggest the procedure to be followed should be that I move the Resolutions at the end of my statement during which the Resolutions will have been distributed.</P>

      <P>Ordinarily we may have ten or 11 Financial Resolutions.  Those are, by courtesy, given to the Minister for Finance for administrative convenience but we always reserve our rights to demur or assent to the several Resolutions on the General Resolution. Usually, the Leader of the main Opposition Party moves the adjournment on the General Financial Resolution and opens the debate on the following day.  We then all participate in a debate on the merits or demerits of the proposals.  In view of the close analogy that obtains between what we are about to do today and the normal Budget, I am asking if you propose, under Standing Orders, to provide for a discussion on the general proposals here today analogous to that which we normally have on the General Resolution?  I think the House would want that and I think the Taoiseach will agree, as I feel sure, the Leader of my Party will agree and as Deputy Corish has intimated he will agree.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>When introducing the Budget for this year on 9th March last, I remarked that at a time of unsettled conditions it was scarcely reasonable to expect that budgetary arrangements made in March or April would continue to fit the year's needs, <Col N="381" /> both financial and economic, until the following March or April.  I expressly mentioned the likelihood that, as a result of a general increase in outside pay, the Government, as employer and paymaster, would have to find more money than was provided for in the Budget.  I gave notice that, if I found it necessary during the year, I would come back with proposals to raise more revenue because my duty required that I should not countenance the payment of salaries, subsidies or social welfare benefits out of borrowed moneys.</P>
      <P>Events since the Budget have reinforced the need to reserve for capital purposes all the money it may be possible to raise by borrowing.  One adverse development has been the British restriction on the outflow of capital to this country.  In order to finance the public capital programme at the level fixed in the Budget, it will be necessary to borrow £10 million or more from abroad to supplement home savings, even when allowance is made for the credit which can be supplied by the banking system without adverse effects on the balance of payments or on the needs of the private sector for productive capital.  Of course, one way out of the difficulty would be to cut the capital programme by several millions, but to do this otherwise than under stress of financial and economic necessity&mdash;and particularly to do so merely to use the money to meet current expenditure&mdash;is definitely not this Government's policy.  It is the Government's aim that public capital expenditure for economic and social purposes should be sustained at as high a level as, taking one year with another, we can afford.</P>
      <P>The cost of extending to State-paid personnel the current round of pay increases still overshadows the Exchequer. The cost in a full year of an increase of £1 a week for men and 15/-a week for women, within the income limit of £1,200 a year, for all categories, including teachers and health authority staffs, would not be far short of £4 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the impending liability under this head, not yet exactly measurable, commitments have been assumed since the Budget which <Col N="382" /> would throw it out of balance if steps were not taken quickly to provide extra revenue to meet them.  The main item is the cost of the recent income increases for farmers, increases granted in consideration of the unexpected disimprovement in farm income prospects this year.  Three months ago it was thought&mdash;and the National Farmers Association agreed with the relevant projection&mdash;that without any additional redistribution of incomes, but simply on the output and prices prospects as they then appeared, farmers' incomes per head would rise by at least as big a percentage as other incomes this year. These prospects had to be revised because of the exceptionally long spell of bad spring weather.</P>
    <P>The various new supports recently provided for farm incomes will cost up to £5½ million in a full year, of which roughly £1½ million is being passed on to the consumers of milk and butter, leaving £4 million to be met by taxpayers.  It is this figure which must be kept in mind when increased taxation is being considered, though the net Exchequer liability in the current year is £2.36 million.  The Government have kept before the public the implications of these income supports for farmers.  They have repeatedly made it clear that further additions to taxation, as well as an increase in market prices for some farm products, would be necessary to provide for them.</P>
    <P>A second large item of expenditure which has arisen since the Budget is the cost&mdash;£½ million this year&mdash;of the pay increases awarded to certain ranks of the Garda Síochána by an independent arbitrator.  The £½ million figure allows for retrospection, the continuing annual cost being of the order of £300,000.  A similar claim for other ranks awaits arbitration.</P>
    <P>The social welfare increases from 1st November next, announced in this year's Budget, involve higher expenditure next year.  The various improvements incorporated in the Bill now before the Dáil will add about £100,000 to this liability.  The extension, announced last March, of the price supports for beef and lamb exports to <Col N="383" /> quantities in excess of those covered by the Anglo-Irish free trade arrangements also involves an increased Exchequer liability of possibly £¼ million.  However rigidly economy is enforced, various other services will inevitably require more money.</P>
    <P>Since I do not want to impose more taxation than is absolutely necessary, I have gone carefully into the question of revenue buoyancy.  There is as yet, however, no sign of buoyancy; indeed, the signs are the other way.  Receipts from turnover tax have reflected the lack of buoyancy in retail sales and the returns from PAYE have been affected by work stoppages.  If the existing conditions of industrial unrest should continue&mdash;and I most earnestly hope they will not&mdash;the yield from both income tax and turnover tax would certainly be reduced, while the British shipping strike, if prolonged, would have a serious effect on customs revenue.  I am hopeful that buoyancy may appear later in the year as a consequence of the income increases now being obtained in so many employments, but I would consider it unwise at this stage to count on more than £2 million being available from this source, since this factor had already been allowed for in large measure in the Budget.  It is clear, therefore, that, faced with additional expenditure of the order of £9 million in a full year, I must now impose extra taxation calculated to bring in at least £7 million in a full year and to go as close as possible to maintaining a budgetary balance this year.</P>
    <P>The rate of income tax can, from the practical standpoint, best be raised from the beginning of an income tax year, i.e. from 6th April.  To my regret I have already had to raise it this year and I do not now propose to raise it further.  I consider it more appropriate to try to find the requisite money by taxing expenditure.  The same reasons which set aside consideration of an increase in the general turnover tax at Budget time still operate.  I am, therefore, compelled to look once again to those expenditure taxes which, however unpopular, can at least be said not to bear on the necessities of life.  In <Col N="384" /> this connection, I have had to pay attention to the fact that retail sales have been virtually static for some time.  This accentuates the risk that any big increase in the tax on the traditional consumer items might produce very little, or affect consumption so much as to cause an actual revenue loss.  The price increase in beer which the Prices Advisory Body considers permissible has turned my mind away from that item.  I can, however, turn to petrol with less misgiving because of the price reductions just announced by the oil companies.  Tobacco can also, I think, bear something extra.</P>
    <P>It is, nevertheless, clear that what can safely be done to raise further money from petrol and oil and from tobacco will be far from sufficient to safeguard a budgetary balance even over a full year.  It is necessary, therefore, to have recourse to some new form of taxation to supplement the existing range of taxes.  In my view, this should be a tax which, while providing a substantial sum in a full year, will make a worthwhile contribution even in the current year and will do so with minimum impact on essential living costs.  What I am proposing is that, in addition to an extra twopence a gallon on petrol and oil and the equivalent of an extra two-pence on the standard packet of 20 cigarettes (with a corresponding tax on stocks), there should be a new tax at the rate of 5 per cent from 1st October next on all goods affected by the existing turnover tax except food, clothing, fuel, medicines, drink, tobacco, petrol and oil.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The new tax, which may be described as a selective wholesale tax, <Col N="385" /> will distinguish between different classes of commodities, will operate at wholesale level and by reference to wholesale prices.  As in the case of the turnover tax, it will apply to any additions made to prices to recover the tax. The definition of wholesalers will extend to manufacturing retailers and manufacturers who deal direct with retailers.  Taxable goods which are imported will bear the tax at the point of import unless they are imported by wholesalers as so defined.</P>

      <P>The tax will be administered as closely as possible on the lines of, and in conjunction with, the retail turnover tax.  In many cases very little additional record-keeping should be required.  Where the same concern handles taxable and non-taxable goods, however, or operates both a wholesale and a retail business, new procedures will be necessary.  I am anxious that the business community should have an opportunity of expressing their views on these procedures before the tax comes into effect and I shall be glad to arrange for discussions on this over the next month or so.</P>
      <P>The new tax is not expected to bring in more than £1½ million this year because some forestalling is bound to take place.  It is estimated that it will not have the effect of increasing the consumer price index by more than one half of one point.  The expected yields from the taxes now announced, both this year and in a full year, are as follows:</P>

    <P>This year's £3.1 million yield, plus the hoped-for revenue buoyancy of £2 million, will go within a reasonable distance of meeting the extra outlay now foreseen but not covered in the Budget.</P>
    <P>The Financial Resolutions dealing with hydrocarbon oils and tobacco need to be passed this evening as the new taxes are to come into effect from midnight tonight.  They will form the subject of amendments to the present Finance Bill at Committee Stage.  The Resolution on the selective wholesale tax, when approved, will be confirmed by a special Finance (No. 2) Bill which I propose to introduce without delay and circulate within a fortnight.</P>
    <P>I hope that there will be some appreciation of the unavoidable necessity for these additional taxes.  It would be inconsistent to complain of them and at the same time approve of the recent income increases for farmers since they are needed to help pay for these increases.  It would be unrealistic to expect finance to be made available for housing and other capital purposes if the money had to be used instead to defray current outgoings. It would be unreasonable to suggest or imply that all the available bank credit should be claimed for State purposes to the neglect of the legitimate needs of productive private enterprise.</P>
    <P>I consider I am doing my duty in trying to balance the Current Budget and safeguard all the available funds for the Capital Budget.  When the balance of payments position is secure enough to allow higher spending from borrowed moneys, this should be capital, not current, expenditure.  I would like to assure the Dáil that I shall do everything I can, as Minister for Finance, to contain current expenditure within the revenue now likely to be available and to effect all possible savings.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="387" /> Because of the effects, not only on the Exchequer but on the national economy, of excessive income increases, I have placed a motion on the Order Paper asking the approval of the Dáil for the findings of the majority report of the tribunal on clerical pay and urging that they be accepted and effect given to them by all concerned.  I set up this tribunal with the approval of the Dáil and Seanad some months ago to advise on the appropriate pay relativities in clerical jobs.  I did this because of the evidence that, with different arbitrators and different pay scales, a situation existed which made &ldquo;leap-frogging&rdquo; inevitable.  Some groups were pressing for parity with the highest rates and those who already enjoyed the highest rates were striving to maintain the differentials they had secured.  The tribunal has now given an objective and authoritative judgment on this question of relativities and a great responsibility rests on all concerned to ensure respect for its findings.  I shall be saying more on this topic when the motion itself is being discussed.</P>
    <P>We are going through an anxious time in Ireland.  The economy is being upset by strikes and threats of strikes. There are calls for Government intervention, though procedures already exist to deal with wage and salary claims and guidelines have been laid down by the Labour Court.  These guidelines, indeed, go further in regard to the amount of income increase to be accepted at present than a strict concern for price stability would justify.  A general rise in pay of 6 per cent or 7 per cent is not reconcilable with a rate of increase in national output of only 3 per cent; adverse effects on prices must be expected.  The Government accepted these guidelines only on the basis of the Court's judgment that even more serious economic results would otherwise follow.  Notwithstanding all the efforts made to achieve industrial peace, there have been a number of serious and prolonged disputes.  The calls for Government intervention either do not specify what action the Government is expected to take or do not show a realistic appreciation of the basic limitations <Col N="388" /> of democratic Government in this area.  Because of the paramount public interest, emergency legislation has been introduced and enacted to deal with the ESB situation.  A new Department of Labour is in course of being set up to concern itself more immediately and actively with problems of industrial relations and their bearing on national progress.  Proposals for new legislation on industrial relations have been drafted and are under discussion.  The Government will continue to keep in close touch with developments in the unsettled disputes and will take any initiative likely to lead to reasonable settlements.  But the Government cannot be expected to turn its back on its own judgment of national policy needs and to sponsor or welcome settlements which would cause serious harm to the economy.</P>
    <P>We have here an economy which, having made only limited and erratic progress in previous decades, began to move forward at a more satisfactory rate seven or eight years ago. We needed to maintain this higher rate of growth&mdash;indeed, to increase it &mdash;in order to overcome the national problems of unemployment and emigration.  For over a year now, however, progress has been retarded by a number of factors, not all of which have been outside our own control.  It has been necessary to make an adjustment in the level of national spending in order to bring it more closely into line with dependable resources.  In spite of all the difficulties, we may still be edging forward at a rate of 2½ per cent to 3 per cent per annum, which indicates the basic resilience of the economy, and exports are on an upward trend.</P>
    <P>It is time that excessive preoccupation with sectional interests was suspended and that our energies were turned again towards raising the general standard of living and the level of employment by increased competitive production for export.  By pressing too hard for large income increases now&mdash;and bringing output to a stop or making our products less competitive&mdash;we would frustrate not merely the economic advance on which greater employment and less emigration depend but even that <Col N="389" /> needed to satisfy our own expectations. At present we are not using our full potential for economic progress. On all sides we are working below capacity.  We cannot continue to do this and achieve the objective of higher incomes and improved standards for growing numbers.  It is of the greatest national importance that disputes should now be settled, that reasonable solutions should be accepted even if they are not fully satisfactory, that more time should be given for the achievement of legitimate ambitions&mdash;and that all should join together to work for the maximum rate of national development.</P>

      <P>It was well he should have asked that question because the Budget he had introduced in May, 1965, resulted in a deficit of £8 million.  It covered a situation in which there had been a definite reduction in our external assets.  It produced a shattering position in which our credit-worthiness as a nation had been substantially reduced and it ended with a condition of great economic <i>malaise</i> throughout the country.  It was in these circumstances that in his Budget 14 weeks ago the Minister indicated that he might find it necessary to introduce a further Budget towards the end of the year.  It is now 14 weeks later and we have a second Budget in the month of June.  This time I should like to ask: what went wrong with the Budget of last March?  What went wrong with the people who introduced it?  What is wrong with the Government today and what is wrong with the country itself?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think there is strong evidence that this Government lack leadership; strong evidence that they are incapable of planning even for a period of 365 days.  There is strong evidence that this Government have lost whatever zip or verve they ever possessed and are now staggering on from one difficulty to another, hoping by makeshift arrangements to avoid trouble and difficulty. Here we have this Budget introduced by a Minister for Finance who says among other things that he could not <Col N="391" /> have contemplated in March of this year that farmers would face a difficulty in relation to their incomes.  If he did not know that and if the Government did not know it, they are about the only people in the country who were not aware of it.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask very seriously whether this country in present circumstances can afford a continuance of the makeshift policies and expedients now being indulged in.  We are, as a country, on the verge of a new era of fierce competition, in which our people and the country will face the sternest of all possible competition, an era in which our young people will be in danger of being swept and sucked away by the power of great industrial nations with whom we compete.  It is an era in which we now have the opportunity to prepare and surely there is a crying need for proper and efficient economic planning towards a just and desirable end?  That is what we in this Party have advocated and put before the people.  The Taoiseach has been against it; he has scoffed at the idea.  He has preferred to tell the people that everything necessary to be done and achieved lay in the Second Programme for Economic Expansion. What has happened to that Programme? It was talked of quite a lot 12 or 18 months ago: I now notice that it is rarely mentioned in Ministerial speeches.</P>
    <P>Let us look at where the Programme stands now.  The Budget of this year increased central Government taxation by six per cent.  It raised taxation from £211 million to £223.5 million.  With the fresh taxation imposed today, there has been an increase in taxation this year of 9½ per cent.  Surely that is a staggering figure?  It indicates a load is being put on the people generally which is almost intolerable.  When that substantial increase is considered, whether it has got to be borne or not, the ordinary test to apply is, what social benefits have been conferred on people in return?  Of course, if that is examined, this year, for an increase of 9½ per cent in central Government taxation, there has been practically <Col N="392" /> no increase in our social benefits.  Our health services, despite many promises, still remain unreformed. Our educational structure is still unchanged. The desire and goal of equal opportunity for our young people is still as far away as ever.</P>
    <P>I should just like to go a little bit further into this.  With these taxes, the burden of taxation from all sources totals £285.2 million this year and that is out of a gross national product of £1,070 million.  This means that roughly 27 per cent of our national output is now being taken in taxation.</P>
    <P>How does this compare with the Second Programme?  In terms of 1960 values, £230.5 million is now being taken in taxation out of a national output, in 1960 values, of £863 million.  That is what is involved in the total of the two Budgets this year but the Programme envisaged that this year taxation would be just £211 million out of an expected national output of £853 million.</P>
    <P>So that, in relation to the Programme which the Government said they were supporting and were going to see achieved, we find now, in the third year, that national output has dropped short of the target figure by £27 million while taxation has increased beyond the target figure by £19.5 million and has, in fact, risen 50 per cent faster than was envisaged. That is so far as taxation is concerned.</P>
    <P>How about the ordinary people for whom we are responsible in this House, who do not concern themselves with percentages or millions or things of that kind, the families who are struggling to eke out an existence, the young people who are seeking a way of life and an opportunity to live and to work and to raise their families in their own country?  How about them? The Second Programme assured them that, this year, there would be 35,000 new jobs and that this increase in employment would result from the implementation of the policy in the Programme by the Government.  In fact, today, not only are there not 35,000 new jobs but employment has dropped by 6,000.  With national output lower than promised, with taxation <Col N="393" /> having risen 50 per cent faster than expected and already reaching a figure higher than the Programme envisaged in 1970, with employment dropping, with emigration continuing apace, it is clear that this Government have ignored the discipline of planning, have turned their backs on their own Programme, have failed to produce any great social aim which could make national effort significant for our people and, in fact, are indulging in a series of exercises in expediency to bridge them from one difficulty to another.</P>
    <P>I know that it may be said that in any programme fluctuations may take place but a drop in employment from an expected 35,000 increase to a reduction by 6,000 is no fluctuation.  The raising of the level of taxation well above the 1970 target cannot be considered as any fluctuation.  These are disastrous failures and they indicate that this Government have not been able to give the country either the leadership it requires or the kind of efficiency in government which is essential now if the country is to survive.</P>
    <P>Today, with this Budget, we have reached the appalling position that 60 per cent of the yearly increase in our national output is now being taken in taxation and only 40 per cent is being left to the workers and the farmers and the business people who produce the wealth of the country.</P>
    <P>I do not know what immediate future the Taoiseach has in mind but it is perfectly clear that this is a Government which have lost control of the situation.  It is perfectly clear that people outside desire new leadership and I believe that the economic and financial difficulties which we now face can only be met by a new Government that can give new leadership to the country, that can put forward worthwhile social aims for our people, that can point the way in an efficient and responsible manner, that can see that economic planning towards the desired aims is carried out, that targets are achieved, not merely hoped for.  It is only in that way that we can face the challenge which the future has in store for us.  Certainly, we will not be able to <Col N="394" /> do so if we continue on now with a Budget introduced 14 weeks after the earliest Budget ever introduced in this country, with no assurance that next autumn we may not have a third Budget this year, with a Government that allow a whole lot of other incidental expenses to affect the people and then complain if living costs go up.</P>
    <P>Here we have the turnover tax now increased along the specialist lines which were at one time indicated but scoffed at.  That is bound to increase living costs.  We have a further tax on petrol, made possible because of a reduction, but that again will add to distributive costs and there does not appear to be any evidence anywhere of an earnest effort by the Government to control and restrict spending on their part.</P>
    <P>I believe that this Supplementary Budget will add further to the picture of general deflation which exists in the country, will add further to the economic difficulties which the country is facing and I am certain that the only real hope for the country, the only real thing the people desire, is the opportunity to change the policy even if that means a change of Government.</P>

We had an early Budget on 9th March, about three months ago. It is becoming abundantly clear now that, while the Minister for Finance on that occasion talked about not shirking his responsibility, he and the Fianna Fáil Party did, in fact, shirk their responsibility in March because that Budget was framed early in March so that the effects of the proposals introduced on that occasion might have worn off to some extent before the Presidential election held a fortnight ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister now says that, because he has extra commitments, it is necessary to introduce this Budget in order to get an extra £7 million. This is not the only year and this is not the first year in which a government were confronted with extra taxation.  This is merely part of <Col N="395" /> the Budget he should have introduced in March or April of this year.  This is political dishonesty.  I am reminded of a reference I made some time ago to the Fianna Fáil Party; I said then they appeared to be much more concerned with election rather than with the economy of the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>We had demonstrations of that.  We had it in the proposal of the Minister for Local Government to postpone the local elections.  We had it before general elections and, in what was supposed to be a non-political contest, the Fianna Fáil Party shirked their obligations in relation to balancing the Budget to such an extent that they are forced three months later to introduce a Supplementary Budget.</P>
      <P>It is true that the Minister for Finance in his Budget Statement on 9th March talked about the possibility of another Budget.  I think it was accepted he might have to introduce that in view of the fact that the economy was not progressing as well as it should have been.  But everybody assumed that this Budget would be an autumn Budget because nobody believed there could be such miscalulation that the Minister would have to come in three short months afterwards to the House and say that he wanted another £7 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At that particular time, as has been pointed out, he knew there was a clamour from the agricultural community for extra assistance.  He knew on 9th March that he would have to make some provision for increases in salaries to certain public servants.  It is true he did not know whether it would be X, Y or Z pounds or X, Y or Z shillings, but he definitely must have known&mdash;it would have been necessary for him at the time to keep in mind the 10th round of wage increases for civil servants, the gardaí, the teachers, soldiers, and so on&mdash;that all these categories would be looking for more money and it is no excuse for him to say now that the pattern had not <Col N="396" /> emerged.  He did not even make provision to the extent of £1,000.</P>
    <P>It appears to me now that this Government are quite capable of coming along again in the autumn and introducing a third Budget.  Mark you, the importance in all this is the effect on the people and on the economy.  At page 10 of his speech today the Minister, in a very long paragraph, devoted certain remarks to strikes and threats of strikes.  He began by saying that we are going through an anxious time in Ireland: that the economy is being upset by strikes and threats of strikes.  The Labour Party and the trade union movement would readily agree that strikes, no matter how they are caused, have an adverse effect on the economy, but it is a little too much for the Minister, referring to unrest in the country and lack of stability, to appear, whether deliberately or not I do not know, to give the impression to ordinary people that the economy is in the state it is because of strikes and threats of strikes.  In the latter part of his speech on the last Budget the Minister, the Taoiseach, speaking on that Budget, and the members of the Fianna Fáil Party who contributed to the debate disclaimed all responsibility on their part for the state of the economy.</P>
    <P>Do they believe they have done everything and tried everything in order to ensure that the economy will progress?  The Minister talked about strikes and threats of strikes.  There was talk of outside influences too. Surely everybody knows now that it is the incompetence of the Government in the main that has brought us to the state in which we find ourselves. However, let us talk about strikes. Some of the Minister's constituents must, I am sure, be on strike at the present moment, as are some of the Taoiseach's, Deputy Seán Lemass. What does he think the workers are at?  Does he think they are on strike because they are anti-Fianna Fáil or anti-Government?  Does he think they are anarchists?  Do Fianna Fáil believe they want to disrupt the country?  I am sure they know them well enough to know that all they want is a fair <Col N="397" /> crack of the whip where their weekly incomes are concerned and, if they are dissatisfied, the Government and the Fianna Fáil Party must bear the brunt of the responsibility for this apparent dissatisfaction right through practically every sector of the working class.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance said in his speech that the Minister for Agriculture had carried out a recent review of the position and prospects of agriculture and that the report following on this review was now in his hands and he would be announcing on the general Budget proposal certain decisions.  I do not remember any world-shaking decisions on that occasion.  I do not remember him announcing any further assistance one way or the other for the agricultural community.  In any case, I think all of us will agree with the last speaker who said that the Government and the Minister for Agriculture must have known and must have been aware of the clamour for some assistance from the agricultural community right through the winter and spring months.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister be able to tell us now&mdash;there is a vague reference here to prospects in relation to capital works &mdash; whether there is any more money for capital works, such as housing, water supply and sewerage?  Does he not know&mdash;he must since he has been sitting alongside his colleague, the Minister for Local Government, for the last six months &mdash; that local authorities are in a desperate position and those in need of houses certainly cannot look forward with any degree of optimism to prospects of obtaining houses this year or even next year? Prospects are poor, not alone for those who need houses but also for those who expect to get employment, employment not alone in housing but in water supply schemes, sewerage schemes, and so on.  As well as that, if money is not forthcoming for such essential services as roads, not alone will the roads deteriorate but there will be fewer road workers as the year goes on because the money raised through motor taxation, money ordinarily paid into the Road Fund, has <Col N="398" /> now been taken by the Minister for Finance and devoted to some other purpose.  Roads and road workers will suffer because of that.</P>
    <P>Ministers and Deputies must see for themselves the evidence of the decrease in employment in the building industry. A document was circulated to Deputies last week, or the week before, which showed there are 1,550 fewer workers engaged in building and construction work generally in May, 1966, as compared with May, 1965. Some would protest that this is desirable because we cannot afford that kind of capital expenditure, but all this means a loss of employment; it means these people will be compulsorily attracted to other places, particularly to Britain.</P>
    <P>Have the Government any responsibility at all for that situation?  Do the Government recognise that, despite the valiant speech documented and sent to the members of the Fianna Fáil Party recently, in every single employment group there are more unemployed in May, 1966, than there were in May, 1965?  In textiles, in the services, in building and construction, in the metal industry, in agriculture, in every single industry the figure at the middle of May this year shows that fewer are employed as compared with the previous year.  If anybody wants simple evidence of that, the document circulated weekly to Deputies showed last Friday that there are 6,000 more workers in receipt of unemployment benefit in the fourth week of May, 1966, as compared with the same period last year.</P>
    <P>Who has the responsibility for this? It is the Government.  There is no point in the Minister's trying to give the impression that the present industrial unrest is a big contributing factor to the depressing state of the economy.  I do not think the Minister was fair to himself in the short speech he delivered. This could, I suppose, be described as a mini-Budget but, in our present circumstances, I do not think we should have got a mini-speech.  He said the buoyancy of revenue was not as good as he would like it to be or anticipated <Col N="399" /> it might be when he spoke here on his Budget on 9th March of this year.  However, having regard to the general increase that has now been given to workers, he must have regard to an increase in turnover tax receipts.  He must also take into account the tax he will get from other taxable goods by reason of the fact that there will, I am sure, be increased spending.  The Minister also omitted to mention that the ten per cent British surcharge will be discontinued from 30th November next so that, while he budgeted for a 12-months period, there is, in fact, a saving for the four months: I do not know the actual figure concerned. These factors, in a speech such as the Minister has given, should be mentioned and taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred briefly to the extra amount he must collect by way of PAYE.  The increase of £1 that has been conceded to many workers and which we trust will be given to many more, will also mean an increase in income tax revenue.  I am sure the Minister must have taken all these factors into account but he did not mention them in his speech or say what effect on taxation generally they would have.</P>
    <P>I believe that this Budget and these proposals are another example of indiscriminate taxation.  I believe the time has long passed when we should look at and revise the whole system of raising money in this country.  It is a little too simple: it is an expedient to which any boy out of secondary school would have recourse in a situation like this, where he wanted £7 million, to look again at petrol, cigarettes and the turnover tax and, by putting 2d on this and 2d on that and an increase here and an extra percentage there, he would get his £7 million.  Do the Government understand or fully appreciate or ever examine the effect of these taxes on individuals and various sections in the community?  I believe the whole system of raising money should be re-examined and re-examined quickly.</P>
    <P>I do not talk about taxation alone: I do not talk about indirect or direct <Col N="400" /> taxation alone.  I have in mind the money our citizens are expected to pay for the running of our community and the country generally&mdash;rates, indirect taxation, direct taxation and even social welfare contributions.  I do not think anybody knows how much, for example, a man with a wife and two or three children is paying for the upkeep of the State and for the running of the community.  I do not think anybody has considered that point.  The Commission on Income Taxation did not give any clear opinion as to whether or not the burden is shared in a fair and equitable fashion.  All these factors, as has been pointed out by the NIEC report, have contributed towards the present unrest which undoubtedly prevails.</P>
    <P>I do not want to make a point about this and particularly I do not want to make a personal point.  We had a serious debate here last week on an incursion, so to speak, on the rights of trade unions.  It was big news last week.  However, the one fact that caught the public mind more than anything else was that a retiring chairman of a semi-State company will get a pension of £3,500 per annum, plus a golden handshake of over £8,000.</P>

If CIE pensioners are asked to live on 22/6d per week, plus their contributory old age pension, and then read of a man getting a pension of £3,500 per annum, plus a golden handshake of over £8,000, surely they are entitled to be dissatisfied?</P>

I had a letter this morning from a couple who are in receipt of £3 7s 6d per week.  Surely they are entitled to be uneasy and to demand more?  When the Government talk about industrial unrest, do they understand that there are 100,000 male workers in this country who have less than £10 per week?</P>

      <P>If I were as provocative as some people in this House are, I could go on for another half an hour and the Leas-Cheann Comhairle could do nothing about it.  The reason for the prevailing unrest is that our sense of values is wrong.  Let us stress that the Government should examine the burden of taxation in respect of rates, indirect and direct taxation and even factors such as social welfare contributions.  Furthermore we ought to try to get more <Col N="402" /> money by way of direct taxation in the form of income tax from people who can afford to pay more.  Many people in this country would be surprised to hear that surtax is not payable until a person is earning approximately £3,000.  Therefore, the fellow earning £8 or £9 a week is paying income tax at the same rate as everybody else.  Furthermore, the person who has more than £6 per week is bound to pay income tax.  I do not think the income tax laws as originally conceived intended that a man with £6 per week should have to pay income tax, a tax which, from its description, means and meant that, after purchasing all necessary requirements, he should pay a tax on his surplus in order to contribute to the coffers of the community.  Until all these factors are examined and put in order, I do not believe we can say that the burden of taxation is equitably distributed.</P>
      <P>A few years ago, Senator Dr. Ryan, the then Minister for Finance, said, when introducing the turnover tax, that to increase taxation on petrol and cigarettes would be a dead loss from the revenue point of view. Nevertheless, in the past two or three Budgets, the Government have had recourse to increased taxation on petrol and cigarettes for the purpose of securing money.  What surprises me is the change of mind and the change of heart by the Fianna Fáil Government as far as the turnover tax is concerned.  When this tax was introduced to operate from 1st November, 1963, the then Minister for Finance and every member of the Fianna Fáil Party said it could not be a selective tax.  From these benches we asked the Minister for Finance could he exempt food, fuel and particularly medicines.  He said the machine was set up to such an extent that nothing could be excluded.  Now we discover that the Minister for Finance can operate the turnover tax in a selective way cutting out what would be regarded as the essential things of life. The Minister again made a serious omission on this occasion.  He did not tell us what effect this new turnover tax would have on the cost of living.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>It is going to have an effect.  This again is going to cause some trouble and the consequences will certainly be on the head of the Minister for Finance and on the Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
      <P>When we advocated a capital gains tax we were pooh-poohed.  We were told we did not know what we were talking about.  On one occasion the Taoiseach said that taxes on wealth in this country were no good because there was no wealth in this country worthwhile; but when the Secretary of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions made this suggestion after the last Budget the Taoiseach thought it was a great idea.  If the Taoiseach wants this to be a deliberative assembly in which we can have free discussion and exchange of ideas, he will have to have a little more regard for suggestions made by individuals and Parties. Because it was made by an outsider, the Taoiseach thought it was a great idea.  However, he said it would bring in nothing this year.  I have heard that from the Taoiseach and from Senator Dr. Ryan when he was Minister for Finance in the past five or six years&mdash; a protest that it was no good because it would get in nothing this year.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister for Finance seriously to consider it for his Finance Bill of this year.  I do not know how much it will bring in, whether it is £500,000 or £1 million, but at least it is more money from people who can afford to give it as against the man who will have to pay another 2d for his cigarettes, the driver who will have to pay another 2d for his petrol or the person who travels by train or bus who has to pay the increased fares.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On one occasion, I think in 1956, we had, apart from the turnover tax, somewhat similar proposals submitted by Deputy Sweetman.  As far as the Fianna Fáil Party were concerned, the merits of those proposals were never considered.  The Taoiseach on the last occasion taunted Deputy Tully and other members of the <Col N="404" /> Labour Party with voting for an increase in the price of minerals, cigarettes and tobacco.  I remember on that occasion what Deputy Lemass as he then was did and said.  He said he would not examine these proposals at all because he was not concerned with them.  He said he was going to vote for them because of the state to which the Government had brought the country.  He was not concerned about the merits of the taxes.  We are concerned about the merits of these taxes.  We are concerned about the state to which the economy has been brought by the Fianna Fáil Party. We will not be as irresponsible as Deputy Lemass was in 1956.  But we will vote against these proposals as a mark of our dissatisfaction with the Government and that we have no confidence in them.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is for me or any other Deputy to say the country has no confidence in the Government. The Taoiseach demonstrated that when he sent out this long letter to his Party members, who should have been informed, containing a restatement of mere pious resolutions to keep them going until, like Mr. Micawber, something would turn up. He will have to change his plan.  He will have to do as the Labour Party would do and intervene as a Government and not leave everything entirely to private enterprise.  Some sections of private enterprise have done well out of this country.  Some sections of private enterprise have not done their job.  Unless the Taoiseach is prepared to plan not in the way talked of but in the manner in which the Labour Party advocated in their policy statement, we may find that the Minister for Finance may have to come back next autumn for more money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>(1)  That there shall be charged, levied and paid on tobacco imported on or after the 15th day of June, 1966, a duty of customs at the following rates, that is to say:</P>
      <P>(a)  for every 1b. of unmanufactured tobacco containing 10 per cent or more by weight of moisture &mdash;3s 5d,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="409" /> (b)  for every lb. of unmanufactured tobacco containing less than 10 per cent by weight of moisture &mdash;3s 9½d,</P>
    <P>(c)  for every lb. of manufactured tobacco&mdash;4s 1?d.</P>
    <P>(2)  That&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  this paragraph applies to manufactured tobacco which was manufactured in, and consigned from, the United Kingdom and was manufactured therein from materials other than materials falling within Tariff Heading number 24.02 in the Schedule to the Imposition of Duties (No. 128) (Customs Duties and Form of Customs Tariff) Order, 1962 (S.I. No. 163 of 1962),</P>
    <P>(b)  the customs duty on tobacco mentioned in paragraph 1 of this Resolution shall, as on and from the 1st day of July, 1966, be charged, levied and paid on manufactured tobacco to which this paragraph applies at the rate of 3s 5d for every lb. of manufactured tobacco in lieu of the rate chargeable under paragraph 1 of this Resolution,</P>
    <P>(c)  the provisions of section 8 of the Finance Act, 1919, shall not apply to the duty imposed by this paragraph,</P>
    <P>(d)  in this paragraph &ldquo;the United Kingdom&rdquo; means Great Britain, Northern Ireland, the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands.</P>
    <P>(3)  That there shall, as on and from the 15th day of June, 1966, be charged, levied and paid on tobacco which is grown in the State a duty of excise at the following rates, that it to say:</P>

    <P>(c)  for every lb. of Cavendish or Negrohead manufactured in bond&mdash;3s 5d.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="410" /> (4)  That as respects unmanufactured tobacco delivered from a bonded warehouse to a licensed manufacturer of tobacco on or after the 15th day of June, 1966, the Revenue Commissioners may, subject to compliance by the manufacturers with such conditions for securing payment of the duty as they may think fit to impose, permit the manufacturer to defer payment of the duty charged under paragraph 1 or 3 of this Resolution on the tobacco to a day not later than the last day of the month succeeding the month in which the tobacco is so delivered.</P>
    <P>(5)  That subject to the provisions of paragraph 6 of this Resolution, there shall be charged, levied and paid on all stocks of tobacco of every description which at five o'clock in the afternoon of the 14th day of June, 1966, are in the ownership or possession of a licensed manufacturer of tobacco and in any place in the State other than a bonded warehouse, a duty of excise, payable by the manufacturer, at the following rate, that is to say:</P>
    <P>(a)  so far as the stocks consist of unmanufactured tobacco, 3s 5d for every pound weight of the stocks, and</P>
    <P>(b)  so far as the stocks consist of tobacco (including snuff) other than unmanufactured tobacco, 3s 5d for every pound weight of unmanufactured tobacco from which, in the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners, the stocks were derived.</P>
    <P>(6)  That the duty imposed by paragraph 5 of this Resolution shall not be chargeable on any manufactured tobacco (including cigarettes, cigars and snuff other than offal snuff) as to which it is shown to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners that it was at 5 o'clock in the afternoon of the 14th day of June, 1966, fully prepared for sale by retail and that either&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  it was not the product of any operation carried out by any manufacturer in whose ownership <Col N="411" /> or possession it was at that time; or</P>
    <P>(ii) it was at that time held as retail stock in premises used for selling tobacco by retail; or</P>
    <P>(iii)  it was at that time in transit from seller to buyer under a contract of sale:</P>
    <P>Provided that no tobacco shall be deemed for the purposes of this paragraph to have been fully prepared for sale by retail if, according to the ordinary course of business of the person in whose ownership or possession it was or to whom it was in transit, it had still to be subjected to some further process (other than packing) before being sold by him.</P>
    <P>(7)  That every licensed manufacturer of tobacco shall not later than the 21st day of June, 1966, make a return to the Revenue Commissioners in a form approved by them giving such information as they may thereby require and, in particular, showing the quantities by weight of tobacco of every description in his ownership or possession at five o'clock in the afternoon of the 14th day of June, 1966, in any place in the State other than a bonded warehouse.</P>
    <P>(8)  That every licensed manufacturer of tobacco shall&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) produce, if so required, to any officer of Customs and Excise the trade books and all accounts and documents belonging to or in the possession of such manufacturer which are necessary for verifying the return made in pursuance of paragraph (7) of this Resolution, and</P>
    <P>(b) render all reasonable assistance to such officer in the taking of an account of the tobacco which was in the ownership or possession of such manufacturer at five o'clock in the afternoon of the 14th day of June, 1966.</P>
    <P>(9)  That every licensed manufacturer of tobacco shall, immediately upon making the return required by paragraph (7) of this Resolution or on the 21st day of June, 1966, <Col N="412" /> whichever is the earlier, pay to the Revenue Commissioners the full amount of the duty mentioned in this Resolution on any tobacco which was in his ownership or possession at five o'clock in the afternoon of the 14th day of June, 1966, and was chargeable with the said duty, and the Revenue Commissioners may, if they think fit, defer the payment of the duty to a day not later than the 31st day of December, 1966, upon the manufacturer giving security by bond or otherwise to their satisfaction that such duty will be paid.</P>
    <P>(10)  That every manufacturer required by paragraph (7) of this Resolution to make such return as is mentioned in that paragraph who either fails to make such a return or makes a return which is incomplete, false or misleading in any material respect or fails or refuses to do anything which he is required by paragraph (8) of this Resolution to do shall be guilty of an offence under the statutes relating to duties of excise and shall for every such offence incur an excise penalty of fifty pounds, and all tobacco in relation to which such offence was committed shall be forfeited.</P>
    <P>(11)  That where drawback is payable in respect of tobacco on which the excise duty provided for by paragraph (5) of this Resolution has been paid, such drawback shall, to the extent of the duty paid in pursuance of the said paragraph (5) as determined by the Revenue Commissioners, be a drawback of excise.</P>
    <P>(12)  That the duties imposed by this Resolution shall be in addition to and not in substitution for any other duties chargeable in respect of tobacco.</P>
    <P>(13)  That section 24 of the Finance Act, 1933 (No. 15 of 1933), shall not apply in relation to the duties imposed by this Resolution.</P>
    <P>(14)  It is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that this Resolution shall have statutory effect under the provisions of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1927 (No. 7 of 1927).</P>

      <P>I do not understand. The existing Resolution already has force under the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act and this is the Resolution for the addition.  In the ordinary course, for as long as I can remember, at Budget time the Resolution on tobacco is in a Resolution for an increase.

      <P>It refers to section 24 of the Finance Act, 1933, which provides <Col N="414" /> for payment of customs drawback on imported goods.  There are special provisions in relation to payment of drawback on tobacco and therefore it is necessary to show that section 24 will not apply to the additional duties imposed in this Resolution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad you called for order, Sir.  When the Budget was before this House, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Industry and Commerce intervened to say that substantial as the burdens were, they were compensated for by the fact that the cost of living had remained stable. They pointed out that the cost of living last May was 180 and that looking at the February figure, it had only gone up by one point.  Within a week of that reassurance, the cost of living figure for the month of May was produced and we discovered that the cost of living had gone up by four points. Does anybody realise that these increases that are being voted by these Financial Resolutions are going to increase the cost of living still further? Have you all gone daft?  You have landed yourselves in this appalling mess by the perennial turn of the spiral that began with the ever-accursed turnover tax.  I remember that when we <Col N="416" /> contested North-East Dublin our addresses on television were concluded by showing a tiny figure, representative of the turnover tax, and with the subscriptions to it &ldquo;Watch me grow&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Resolution deals only with tobacco and the turnover tax does not come into it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Either this House can wind up or we can discuss what effects a Financial Resolution is going to have on the cost of living.  That is the only concern I have.  It is not going to kill me to pay twopence per packet of cigarettes but in so far as the cost of living is still further affected by these Financial Resolutions, we are going to get back into exactly the same spiral as that with which we have been desperately struggling and which finally forced us to pass legislation in this House last week forbidding men to picket.  I voted for it, but remember we only voted for it because we were forced to the point where we felt that the existence of society itself was at stake.</P>
      <P>That has its roots in the Financial Resolutions passed in this House ten weeks ago.  It is this House raised the cost of living.  It is this House that created a situation in which people's weekly wages shrank in their hands. It was this House created a situation in which people went out to try to redress the losses their families experienced through the increase in the cost of living, 70 per cent of which was precipitated by the direct action of the Government as passed in the teeth of our opposition in Dáil Éireann and this Financial Resolution is another nail in the coffin of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="417" /> I want to say deliberately, Sir, that I am 34 years in this House and I often felt that the Government of the time were doing desperately foolish things, but, as I walked into the division lobby, my anxiety was: Get the so-and-so's out and we will put it right. It was the first time in my life when I walked into that lobby today to vote against that Resolution that I felt a weight of depression on me that I have never known before.  What shocked me is that none of you realise this country has its back to the wall.</P>
    <P>Mark the character of these Financial Resolutions.  They are designed to yield cash at the earliest possible moment and the reason is that we have left ourselves no room for manoeuvring.  The Minister waltzes in here with a Resolution on petrol and tobacco.  Not a month ago the Minister put a tax on tobacco.  Now, would not any rational Minister for Finance, faced with the knowledge with which he is faced, when the revenue has literally failed, say: &ldquo;I will have to come back in the autumn and redress the situation with a supplementary Budget&rdquo;?  If the situation was not utterly desperate should the Minister for Finance not say to the Government: &ldquo;Let us wait until the autumn; let us see how the revenue is running; let us see if any element of buoyancy will come back to the revenue when the strikes are over; let us see if my last Resolution, affecting tobacco and spirits, petrol, and other things, has brought us nearer to the point of diminishing returns&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>I would have said, if I were Minister for Finance, to the Government, &ldquo;Let us carry whatever debts have accumulated into the autumn and then we will get a clearer picture and in the meantime we will turn the matter over in our minds.&rdquo;  But, within three months&mdash;about ten weeks&mdash;of a Budget imposing a tax on tobacco, we are called back to this House to increase the taxation on petrol and tobacco and we are called back&mdash;I want to warn Deputies&mdash;at a time when this country never stood in greater economic peril than it does today.  I think the Government are trying to <Col N="418" /> negotiate a loan of £5 million in London to pay their costs and they cannot get it.  I believe the reason these Resolutions are brought in today, and not in October, is to raise the money to pay the bills.  Remember, in the memory of none of us since this State was founded have we ever found ourselves in the position that we had to impose taxation on an emergency basis and raise the revenue necessary to carry on the State.  We have always had reserves behind us which enabled us to hold our hand and review the position, never acting in panic.</P>
    <P>God be good to the memory of Bill Norton.  I remember the agony he went through in 1956 before we put the levies on, and it was only when conviction was carried to his mind and to Deputy Corish's mind, when we had to choose the alternative between temporary levies and protracted mass unemployment and emigration, that they took the grave courageous decision to protect the working man of this country from that disaster and within 12 months the situation was retrieved.  How did we stand then when we took that decision at that time?  We owed the joint stock banks of this country not a penny.  The general reserve of the Central Bank was intact.  There was not a penny, as far as I know, of the currency reserves invested in Irish security and we did not owe a penny abroad.  We kept all that&mdash;Deputy Norton knew it was there: Deputy Corish knew it was there&mdash;because we said that when you move into an emergency position, an unforeseen emergency may superimpose itself on the emergency and we must keep that.</P>

We stand now, for the first time in my experience, or in the <Col N="419" /> experience of any person in this House, in the horrible position that we have our backs to the wall and partly because these fellows who constitute the Government today have not the courage of the members of the Government of 1956 to keep a reserve in hands to protect our people.</P>
      <P>When the bad winter came with the heavy losses experienced by the agricultural community, we had to go to their assistance but we had not the reserve.

      <P>I was about to answer Deputy O'Connell when Deputy Dillon started his speech.  In the Budget I introduced on 9th March, there was provision for an increase of 2d per 20 ordinary standard-type cigarettes.  That meant that the increase on tipped cigarettes should have been less, there not being the same content of tobacco in the tipped cigarettes as in the standard cigarettes. Because of the difficulty of there being no farthings in circulation, and because the manufacturers would therefore have difficulty in adjusting prices, they decided instead to increase the quality and standard of the tipped cigarettes, mainly by putting more tobacco in them.  That was done following the increase in the Budget on 9th March.</P>
      <P>Since then there have been certain increases in the costs of tobacco manufacturers.  The full 2d on the standard type cigarettes will go to the Exchequer but there will be a small margin on the tipped cigarettes which will be in favour of the manufacturers. That small margin is now being permitted to be retained by the manufacturers in order to cover their increased costs.</P>

Surely we should try to ensure, in so far as we can, that people do their mixing of tobacco here instead of making it a penal tax for manufacturers of tobacco. Secondly, can the Minister tell me what is the estimated proportion consumed of tipped cigarettes to untipped cigarettes?  Thirdly, can the Minister tell me, after this Resolution has become operative, what will the percentage of revenue on tobacco be to the total tax revenue?  Will it be somewhere about 20 per cent?  Fourthly, on paragraph (9) of this Resolution with regard to stocks on hands, what <Col N="425" /> is it estimated that paragraph will bring in?</P>

      <P>I do not know if I can answer all these questions offhand. With regard to the last question, the estimate would be £100,000.  The first question was why there is a higher duty on manufactured tobacco as against non-manufactured tobacco.  That is for the protection of the manufacturers here.

That is the way it operates at present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I share with Deputy <Col N="426" /> Corish the wonder that we cannot be more precise and that the House cannot be properly advised as to the real effect of the Financial Resolution on tobacco.  We can have the one-twentieth of a penny with regard to hydrocarbon oil but when we come to something like tobacco, we are unable to break the pennies into notional quantities.  The Minister said something today that was completely in conflict with what was said by his predecessor.  He said there were no farthings in circulation.  It is on the records of this House that there are over ten million farthings.  Senator Dr. Ryan waxed most indignant, as indeed did also the present Minister when he was Minister for Industry and Commerce, and said that the turnover tax was workable because of the farthings in circulation.  He was indignant when it was pointed out to him that although there were ten million in circulation, they are not readily available to ordinary people.  Today we are given the reason for the kind of activity that has been going on for the past year, that they are not in circulation.  This is typical of the conflicting arguments which have been put forward by this Government with regard to changing circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister in his disclosure was less than frank today.  When we complain about this again and again, the Minister and his colleagues get very annoyed.  If the Minister wants specific examples, I can give him plenty of them.  When the increase was put on tobacco recently, the tobacco manufacturers had the greatest difficulty in notifying the retail trade as to the consequence of this increase.  I informed the Minister that the tobacco manufacturers made three different drafts of the circular to the retail trade and on each occasion after submitting them, they had to scrap those drafts and revise them.  The trade experienced the longest delay in its history between the time of the Budget and the notification from the tobacco manufacturers of the consequences of the increase in prices.  That is not fair to traders.  A certain amount of criticism has been made today on the question of profits on the part of retailers and <Col N="427" /> manufacturers.  It is not wrong to say that profit is a legitimate factor in the economy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We must realise that whenever increased taxation is imposed on commodities such as tobacco, the retailer must get some kind of marginal increase in his profits.  If you increase the cost of a commodity, you increase the price to wholesalers and retailers. The retailer must be allowed a percentage profit on his turnover.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a perfectly simple exercise for anybody to use.  If we were only to maintain the extremely small profit margin, there would have to be some kind of adjustment made so that the retailer could continue to enjoy the same margin or the same percentage of profits.  I do not believe any person is so far removed from commonsense and commercial activity as not to know that as far as the retail trader is concerned, he must operate on a percentage margin profit.  It is a perfectly respectable thing and I do not think it desirable that we should say otherwise.  Otherwise, you are making of the small huckster shop down the country nothing more than an institution for the collection of taxes without reward.</P>
      <P>These things are not said in justification of the ruthless, flatfooted approach to taxation indicated in the Minister's second Budget speech today.  One wonders if budgeting is the correct term to apply to this financial activity, because budgeting implies a sense of balance, a weighing up of the consequences of one's actions.  This has not been done by the Government when they came in in a state of panic 70 days after the most savage original Budget in the history of the country. We had the highest taxation ever imposed in a single instalment earlier this year and now, 70 days later, we make a bad job even worse.  This is a deplorable state of affairs and that is the reason why we shall vote against all these Resolutions.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to swoop on the labouring man, the road worker and in particular, the old age pensioner. We know that is the tobacco used most commonly by those people who will now feel the pinch.  I am aware that it is not relevant to discuss other things here but I should like to point out that when the inter-Party Government were in power, they considered these matters and excluded this tobacco. It is hawk-like on the part of the Minister to descend on those people as he has done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>On paragraph 6, does the Minister think that the celerity with which he dispatched his announcement allowed the manufacturers time to complete contracts of sale before 5 o'clock?  The Minister finished well before a quarter to five.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I take this opportunity of inquiring from the Minister whether the Government considered, when they were thinking of this increased taxation on tobacco and cigarettes, that there are many thousands of people in this country who regard a smoke as being as essential as a meal and whether any proper consideration was given to the importance of making available cigarettes and tobacco to old people whose incomes are very limited and who find it impossible to obtain the smoke to which they have been accustomed at a reasonable price.  I think the time has arrived when the Government must ask themselves if they are not killing the goose that lays the golden egg.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely the Minister for Finance must know that since his Government commenced their attacks on tobacco and cigarettes, thousands have given up smoking.  Since the Budget 70 days ago, hundreds were added and as a result of this imposition, many hundreds will renew their resolutions and further <Col N="429" /> resolutions will be made by further people.  The fewer people who consume tobacco and cigarettes, the less of those commodities that will be sold, the less that will be manufactured and consequently the smaller the return for the revenue.</P>
    <P>I see at the back of this something that is very evil and ill-conceived politically.  It is involved in the margin of profit that will be available to the manufacturers of tipped cigarettes.  I should like to ask the Minister to be honest and to tell the House why, if he imposes a tax of 2d a packet on cigarettes, there is not some machinery available, with all the resources of the Revenue Commissioners and the financial experts behind us, to ensure that when a tax of 2d per packet is imposed, the Revenue will benefit by the full 2d. Are there loopholes in this, and if so, for what purpose are they left there?</P>
    <P>As a result of this, I hope Fianna Fáil at a later stage will not walk on the stepping stones they have always walked on and go again to the cigarette manufacturers and say: &ldquo;Stump up now for Fianna Fáil funds.  We have made a handsome present to you in the framing of the Budget.&rdquo;  Fianna Fáil have been far too long in office through such ill-conceived methods.  I am quite sure that if there is a margin of profit as a result of this imposition on tobacco and cigarettes, for political purposes, Fianna Fáil will make certain appeals and raids on the generosity of the cigarette manufacturers.  The Minister has told us he cannot seal these loopholes but I put it to him that they are left there deliberately to swell the political funds of Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>Through this loophole, it is in the power of the Fianna Fáil Government to say to the cigarette manufacturers: &ldquo;We have left you a handsome profit as a result of the Budget and if we remain in office after the next election, we shall leave you another handsome profit.  What about forking out £5,000 or £6,000?&rdquo;  We all know that Fianna Fáil are quite capable of doing that and that they have been 100 per cent successful in it.  While they are forgetting the poor old people who love a smoke, the people to whom a <Col N="430" /> smoke is as essential as a meal, while they sacrifice them, they are guilty of introducing this dangerous motion for the purpose of swelling the Party fund of Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>I think it is disgraceful, evilly-disposed and wrong.  These Resolutions have been conceived with the intention of raking in money for the funds of Fianna Fáil.  By this cute concoction, they have deprived the old age pensioner and the worker of their smoke, and I am convinced there is not a smoker in Ireland, whether he was for Fianna Fáil three weeks ago in the Presidential election, who does not now see he was tricked and who will not resolve to put this Government out of office as speedily as possible so that a Government may be elected who will not leave room for suspicion.  As a result of this tax on tobacco, certain profits are being made available to the manufacturers of tipped cigarettes.  I can assure Members of this House that there is a reason for that, that the reason is bad and ill-conceived, and is for the purpose of putting the gun to the foreheads of the manufacturers for funds for the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose it is a good job for the Government's present financial plight that cigarette smoking is more or less a habit because if it were simply a matter of rational choice, then the smokers of Ireland&mdash;if there is such a body&mdash;would surely tonight lay down their last butt because this Government certainly have discriminated unmercifully against the people who smoke tobacco in the recent period.  In our calculations, it is 70 days since the last Budget but, in that time, we have seen cigarettes again singled out for further taxation to help the Government in their present financial straits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are to be asked to vote on particular Financial Resolutions, more information should be supplied on the question in each case.  If the Government are asking individual Deputies to give their considered support, then we should have more information about the possible breakdowns in the Financial Resolution.  It is just not good enough to require practically legal <Col N="431" /> training to separate the actual clauses of a Resolution and ask what each, in fact, means; to actually have to ferret out the information from the Minister as to whether the benefits of a particular measure will go to the manufacturer or to the consumer.  It is time we had a more clearly etched Financial Resolution.</P>
    <P>It is a great pity that the tax on plug tobacco, which is mainly the smoke of the older citizen, should be lumped in with the rest of the tobacco taxes and not at least given some favourable consideration or exception.  We should also consider that most of the plug tobacco belongs to old brands and some exception could have been made in that case. God knows we shed enough crocodile tears on behalf of the old age pensioners without imposing extra taxation on something of tangible use to them.  I have the feeling that the smoking of plug tobacco cannot be as extensive as cigarette smoking and certainly we could have made an exception in that case.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable also, in the case of cigarette smoking, that tipped cigarettes should have to bear the same heavy imposition as the others because we would in fact wish, for people who do smoke cigarettes, that they smoke tipped.  There is, of course, the rather mysterious arrangement whereby manufacturers will get some undisclosed sum from the general Exchequer charge.  The Minister is not aware of the actual sum it will mean in one year.  I do not think that all these manufacturers will secure the benefits accruing to the manufacturers of tipped cigarettes, but one's suspicions are aroused by the fact that this kind of arrangement could exist between different manufacturers of cigarettes. The Minister did finish his speech in admirably short time and there is an uneasy feeling that it may have allowed certain people to actually overcome some of the provisions in paragraph 6 and include contracts on all sales today.  I should like the Minister to assure me now that certain people in our country could not anticipate the actual provisions of the <Col N="432" /> Financial Resolution and make admirable profits on what we do here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>Once upon a time we had a Government.  As each Government succeeded another&mdash;some were good and some were bad but the feature of good Government was that they made their provision at the beginning of each financial year for their financial requirements for that year.  They availed themselves of all the expert advice available to them and made their plans accordingly. Supplementary Budgets are notoriously an attribute of bad governments and governments whose harsh measures are ultimately and, sometimes within a very short time, rejected by the people.  The last time we had a Supplementary Budget of any note was in 1952 which resulted in the change of Government, subsequently, in 1954.  I am not suggesting that the time in between the imposition of these duties and the fall of this Government should be that long.</P>
      <P>This year we had an imposition put on tobacco on the 9th March, which was the Budgetary time chosen before what used to be the end of the financial year.  Now, as Deputy Oliver J. Flanagan says, 70 days later we have a further imposition on tobacco.</P>

      <P>Like Deputy Lindsay, I am interested to know if this is, for this year, the end of taxation.  There has been a good deal of talk concerning the probability of an autumn Budget.  In the context of the Resolution we are discussing, it is appropriate to repeat what Deputy Lindsay has asked and that is&mdash;does the Minister see any prospect that today's performance will be repeated before the year is out because if there is even the remotest possibility of that it is a sure indication that the words of Deputy Dillon are only too true. There has been created in the public mind the idea&mdash;created in fact by the words of the Minister and others on the occasion of the introduction of the normal Budget earlier in the year&mdash;that he would, if he felt it necessary, come back, it was assumed in the autumn, for further moneys. Is this a kind of interim move between the Budget of March and the autumn Budget which is to come?  Can we regard this as a mid-summer Budget with all the connotation which that adjective suggests because, coming so quickly after the Budget proper, it reflects a sad condition in the economy and one on which the House is entitled to be enlightened?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I said in my statement today that I hoped the increased taxation I proposed today would be sufficient to cover the expenditure likely to be met during the current year.  In that event, there would be no further supplementary Budgets and I certainly do not want to come before <Col N="434" /> the House again this year to propose new or increased taxation.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Leary referred to the stocks held by manufacturers.  As I explained, it is at the stage of the release of the leaf from bond that the duty becomes payable.  Manufacturers have to take leaf out of bond in the ordinary course of their manufacturing business and, therefore, at a certain stage, having taken out the leaf and having been assessed to tax for a quantity of tobacco manufactured and unmanufactured in their possession, the imposition of increased duty would enhance the value of that tobacco and therefore to the extent that they have stocks on hand, having been released from bond, these stocks must necessarily bear the increased tax.  To that extent they would make a handsome profit in respect of the quantity of stocks they have in hand. I can assure Deputy O'Leary that I have not contrived in any way, by fixing 5 o'clock as the time this evening at which this new duty will be put on stocks, to give any of these manufacturers any bonus.  There is no question whatever of that.  I do not know to what extent there was an implication in his rather innocently worded question against me, especially when he referred to the expedition with which I finished my speech.</P>
      <P>The question of hardpressed tobacco has been raised on a number of occasions and I have told the House that the great bulk of pipe tobacco smoked is in fact hardpressed.  It represents 80 per cent, and I repeat that for about the fiftieth time.  Although hardpressed tobacco will carry an increase equivalent to the increase of 2d per 20 cigarettes, it will still have a very favourable differential in price compared with flake tobacco&mdash;which is 20 per cent of the pipe tobacco smoked &mdash;of upwards of one shilling.  Nobody can ever say exactly what the differential is because the prices of both hardpressed and flake tobaccos vary but, roughly speaking, there is a differential in favour of hardpressed tobacco at the retail level of about one shilling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reply to Deputy Flanagan, I want to say that I do not know if I should take his allegation seriously because <Col N="435" /> in the same speech he said that I was using the tax on tobacco in order to gain political favour, financial or otherwise, on the one hand, and on the other hand, he accused me of turning people who might have voted Fianna Fáil in the Presidential election against Fianna Fáil.  It is very difficult to take Deputy Flanagan seriously at any time but when he contradicts himself twice in one speech on the Financial Resolution, it is sufficient to say nothing and just pass on.  But in so far as there is any imputation against my honesty, I shall let the country judge.</P>

      <P>I can only endorse what Deputy Ryan said about the <Col N="436" /> profit motive being important in ordinary commercial life.  It is becoming important even in Soviet Russia.  Apparently, they have realised now that it gives some stimulus to production and economic advance and for that reason they are encouraging profit motives.  But as the total prices of commodities increase, there is usually a marginally increased profit for the retailer and, indeed, for the manufacturer. That has been permitted in this case because manufacturers and retailers have, I understand, demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Department of Industry and Commerce that increased costs justify some little increased margin for them and, to the extent that the margin will be available in the sale of tipped cigarettes, the retailers and manufacturers will be able to take advantage of that.  As to what proportion the increased profit will be, I am afraid I am not in a position to say.</P>

Although it is not, I am sure, done intentionally for the purpose of showing the Government's hand, it is indicative of the Government's attitude that the only element of the population which will be relieved by this mid-summer Budget, even if only in a very fractional way, are the groups normally required to pay corporation profits tax, companies and elements of a similar kind in our society.  That conveys to me the attitude of mind of the Government <i>vis-à-vis</i> the economy.  Had the Government bent their energies and their minds in the direction of increasing corporation profits tax with a view to reducing the demand they are making on the ordinary taxpayers in the other Resolutions, the picture would be <Col N="441" /> somewhat different.  The tax on cigarettes, tobacco and petrol has been increased.  This increase, it must be obvious to everybody, will have the effect of substantially increasing the cost of living and will have an inflationary effect therefore upon the economy.  Steps of this kind taken by the Government invariably lead to wage demands, and increases, which, in turn, lose their value by reason of price increases imposed by manufacturers and distributors implementing the terms of this mid-summer Budget and the Resolutions under it.  The matter should, I think, therefore be commented upon.</P>
      <P>We cannot do much about it, but it does at least call for comment from these benches that the one instance in which there will be a possible lightening of taxation is in relation to corporation profits tax.  To my mind, that speaks for itself.  I put that in juxtaposition with the positive steps taken by the Government to increase the price of hardpressed tobacco which makes up 80 per cent of the tobacco used in the country.  One remembers that this particular tobacco is used by the older generations, particularly the old age pensioners.  When one looks at these facts and assesses them in their perspective, that adds further to my conviction, at any rate, that the bias so far as this Government are concerned is towards the protection of the wealthy vested interests and the relative disregard of the interests of those upon whom the cost of living bears most heavily.</P>

      <P>This is a very highly technical proviso which both Deputy Sweetman and the Minister understand more readily than the average Deputy. I do not agree with Deputy Dunne when he says there is nothing we can do about it.  I think there is a great deal we can do about it by exposing its true meaning to the country.  I would, therefore, ask the Minister to bear in mind that we are not all ex-Ministers for Finance.  I fully appreciate this is a very complex business, but would I be right in seeking to popularise the effect of this Resolution taken within the meaning <Col N="442" /> to which Deputy Sweetman has referred, namely, that it is in pursuance of the reciprocal income tax agreement with Great Britain?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think, therefore, that Deputy Dunne is perhaps, if I may say so with profound respect, off the beam here.  This is a piece of machinery more than anything else.  Does this, in fact, mean that if a citizen of this State holds shares in a British company, where heretofore the income tax was deducted from his dividend and, at the end of the year, he filled up a form and the British sent him a cheque for the amount of income tax deducted from his dividend, he can now fill up a corresponding form and recover from the British Government the corporation profits tax on the profits of the company from which he draws his dividend? I could understand that perfectly well but I am not quite clear as to how this piece of machinery the Minister has devised is designed to operate.  Does it relate to the individual Irish shareholder in a British company and, if it does, is some machinery envisaged by which the individual Irish shareholder will ultimately recover from the British Government a sum corresponding to what he used to get by way of refund of income tax on a dividend received from a British company which has paid income tax under the old fiscal system that obtained in Great Britain before their last Finance Act which substituted corporation profits tax for income tax?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>To use the old Question Time jargon, the answer to the first part of the Deputy's question is in the negative and therefore the second part of his question does not arise.  The Irish companies that do business in Britain were charged on their profits <Col N="443" /> in one way or another by profits tax but the corporation profits tax was introduced in the second last Budget of the British Chancellor of the Exchequer.  The profits tax was eliminated and there were certain adjustments between the company and the shareholder as to the inclusion of their profits or dividends as the case might be.</P>
      <P>As a result of these double taxation agreements, there are devices by which adjustments are made.  We give credits to Irish companies, in relation to their taxability in this country, for what they pay in Great Britain.  By reason of the increase in the amount, we have contrived a way of giving them increased credit but, in order to do this, we have increased the corporation profits tax which helps us to get from the British companies operating in Ireland the amount of relief we give to Irish companies for the tax they have to pay in Great Britain.</P>
      <P>It is rather complicated.  I find it difficult to understand myself and therefore all the more difficult to explain.  In so far as we have increased income tax which is payable by Irish companies on their profits, then we have hit the Irish companies fairly hard in that respect.  The increase is from 6/4d to 7/- in the £.  The marginal decrease in corporation profits tax, which is hardly worth taking account of, is that, having taken a figure of 23 per cent, to which we increased corporation profits tax from 15 per cent, the relief given against income tax payable works out very slightly marginally in favour of the taxpayer but, over all, by reason of the increase in income tax, the company will pay much more tax to the Exchequer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>It is extremely difficult to follow this.  This Resolution, and the amendment on the Order Paper, relate only to corporation profits tax and are specifically referable to that and to the percentages in it.  The old basis was that the first £2,000 of profits was taxed five per cent and that now goes to 7½ per cent.  The residue of profits was taxed at 15 per cent and that now goes to 23 per cent. <Col N="444" /> The effect of that, with the British charge for corporations carrying on business outside this country, is virtually marginal either way.  But, regardless of that, any company operating here, be it an Irish company or not, will be chargeable to income tax at 7/- in the £ instead of 6/4 in the £. Therefore, the Irish company resident here, that is, managed and controlled here, will effectively be paying 8d more in the £.  However, the company trading here but not managed and controlled here will not be charged more for income tax purposes because it will get that extra 8d in the £ repaid to it under the double taxation agreement. Therefore, is it not a fact that what will happen is that the Irish company, the company resident and controlled here, will pay more tax but that the British company operating here, which is not resident, managed and controlled in Ireland, will not have to pay any more income tax?  I want to know where that foreign company stands in relation to corporation profits tax.  As I understand it, the foreign company pay corporation profits tax.  Not merely is it chargeable but they pay and do not get any double taxation relief.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am thinking of this from the standpoint of the Exchequer. The Irish company, resident here, is paying 8d in the £ more income tax this year.  The Irish company is paying, under this Resolution, the same amount of corporation profits tax this year.  Therefore, the Irish company is contributing 8d in the £ more on its profits to the Exchequer. There may be a marginal difference but it is roughly 8d in the £.  The British company that trades here is assessed to income tax but discharged by the double taxation agreement and has to pay corporation profits tax. Will the increase in corporation profits tax on the British company operating here be equivalent to the 8d that has gone up in income tax for our own companies?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be higher, in my opinion, because the 8d increase for Irish companies on income tax is ascertainable.  It will be an eight per cent increase for corporation profits tax in respect of the British resident company&mdash;from 15 per cent to 23 per cent.  I could not say whether the 8d increase paid by the Irish companies is more onerous than the eight per cent increase in corporation profits tax payable by British companies. Perhaps if the Deputy would let me inquire, I may be able to get an answer to that.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>That for the purpose of any Act of the present session to charge and <Col N="446" /> impose certain duties of customs and inland revenue (including excise) to amend the law relating to customs and inland revenue (including excise) and to make further provisions in connection with finance, it is expedient to authorise as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) to redeem borrowings, and interest thereon, in respect of capital services, there shall be charged annually on the Central Fund or the growing produce thereof a sum of £1,739,171 in the twenty-nine successive financial years and a sum of £1,819,988 in the thirty successive financial years commencing in each case with the financial year ending on the 31st day of March, 1967;</P>
    <P>(b) there shall be made any repayments of estate duty which are provided for by any section of the said Act providing for amendment of section 29 of the Finance Act, 1965;</P>
    <P>(c) there shall be made any repayments of income tax and corporation profits tax which are provided for by any section of the said Act providing for amendment of Part III of the Finance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1956.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (a) of the Resolution is in the usual form, that is, a Money Resolution to redeem borrowings and interest thereon in respect of capital services.  Paragraph (b) is necessary for the purpose of giving effect to the increased benefit that will be given to widows and dependants for the purpose of estate duty in the Finance Bill.  As I announced in the Budget Statement, provision is being made for an increase in the amount of the estate which can claim relief and for an increase in the amount of the relief from estate duty given to a widow or other dependant.  The section makes that relief retrospective to the introduction of the Budget last year. In order therefore to provide for payment in retrospect, it is necessary to have a Money Resolution passed.  That is for payment of sums paid in discharge of death duty which under the <Col N="447" /> present relief ought not to have been paid.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (c) refers to the relief from tax on profits derived from export by companies who do not manufacture goods of their own but to whom goods are consigned by, say, a company in Germany, which are processed further here and reconsigned back.  The profits made on the added value of those goods will now be liable to the export tax relief as in the case of goods manufactured by persons themselves and exported.</P>

If a person brings in here 100,000 tons of any particular commodity and redistributes that 100,000 tons by keeping 80,000 tons in this country and exporting 20,000 tons, on which he makes a profit by reason of the fact he has been bulk buying, does he get the relief on his profit on that 20,000 tons he has exported?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as the sale of the goods within the country is concerned, naturally he cannot get any relief on that.  I see the Deputy's distinction.  Having imported 100,000 tons, the unit cost per ton is less than if he only imported 20,000 tons which he was going to export in an advanced processed form.  I should imagine this would be a matter for accountancy anyway.  We are not interested in the degree of processing as long as there is some processing done and as long as the processor or manufacturer can show he had to pay a certain amount. He may have paid nothing for the goods.  In fact, he does not own them at all.  He does not in fact buy them. The practical case is this.  The Industrial Development Authority came up against a couple of cases whereby firms in other countries were prepared to have work carried out here by Irish firms or by subsidiaries of the firms in these other countries. They found it perhaps profitable to have that work done here.  The goods would be consigned from the company in Germany to the Irish company here. That company may or may not be independent of the German company. The goods would never actually come into the possession of the Irish company.  Therefore, they would not be bought by them.  They would have been consigned to them for processing and reconsigned back to the company abroad.  The Irish company would of course have made some profit by reason of whatever payment they got from the company abroad.  That would be assessable and therefore entitled to the tax relief on profits derived from exports.  I do not think the example given by the Deputy is envisaged in this Resolution.  I am speaking without further consultation and I shall have to confirm that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I can quite understand 1,000 gross of handkerchiefs being consigned to this country for the purpose <Col N="449" /> of being embroidered and re-exported to the country from which they came or elsewhere and the embroidery of each handkerchief costing 1/- and the profit on it being 1½d per handkerchief. That would be the profit of the Irish <i>entrepreneur</i> for the purpose of paragraph (c).  I can see the point of capturing that kind of processing trade. At the other end&mdash;I am not referring to any particular firm&mdash;I am thinking of another kind of processing.  We all know that razor blades come from the steelworks in strip, are run through a machine and are substantially cut up; and razor blades in strips are relatively cheap.  The razor blades are passed through a razor blade machine and have a substantial value.  Suppose a firm abroad consigns to a subsidiary in Ireland a roll of steel ribbon at a fair price and then has consigned back to itself a million dozen of razor blades at a fair price but, in fact, at ten times the price of the original consignment and secure from us a large income tax concession in respect of what is described as a processing operation within our jurisdiction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason I offer these two extreme examples, one of which appears to me to be legitimate and desirable and the other of which would present an opportunity for manifest tax avoidance which none of us here has in mind to facilitate, is that I wonder if paragraph (c) is too widely drawn and, if it is, can any measure be taken substantially to constrict the application of the proposal?  I would recall to the Minister's recollection that in regard to trade agreements we have made in the past, when dealing with the question of country of origin it has been admitted that raw materials purchased by us from abroad and submitted to a processing operation which added at least 25 per cent to their value qualified as goods originating in Ireland.  Has the Minister in mind applying any percentage of valuation which the Revenue Commissioners could contest if they thought an attempt was being made to drive a coach and four through a loophole in the law and in order to have some standard which would enable the Revenue Commissioners to say to a skilful <i>entrepreneur:</i>&ldquo;This is a kind <Col N="450" /> of processing which was never contemplated because it is not a genuine processing operation which provides employment of material value within our jurisdiction, and it is for that purpose, to provide material employment within our jurisdiction, that we devised this resolution&rdquo;?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy Dillon will refer to the opening words of section 27, he will see there in regard to the type of case he envisages, that is, importing goods by way of purchase, processing and re-exporting, this does not apply.  Section 27 (1) specifically states:</P>
      <P>In the case of a body corporate carrying on a trade which consists of or includes the rendering to another person of services by way of subjecting commodities or materials belonging to that person to any process of manufacture...</P>
      <P>it may claim the exports profits.  It may not involve purchases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The other question raised by Deputy Dillon was whether the Revenue Commissioners would set any minimum percentage of the value for commodities to be processed in this country.  The Revenue Commissioners would not be interested in that.  It does not matter what percentage processing done in this country bears to the total value of the commodity as long as the amount of processing is capable of being assessed and the amount of profits made derived from the processing is similarly capable of being assessed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not see the danger that a subsidiary whose principals are resident abroad could have material consigned here and submitted to some operation which involves the employment of virtually no labour at all?  It could agree with its principals that the processing that took place here increased substantially the value of the material, thus creating a loophole for a claim for such a company to trade here in a processing <Col N="451" /> capacity free of income tax, when the processing is virtually valueless and yet they can represent the end product as having a very substantial added value.  I can appreciate, however, that in complex matters of this kind, one can raise all sorts of odd cases, which no Minister can answer off the cuff.  I simply invite the Minister to glance at the matter from this angle to see if the danger exists and, if so, whether it would be appropriate to ask the Revenue Commissioners to close such a gap if it emerges.</P>

      <P Just="Center">SECTION 1.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 1 stand part of the Bill&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 1 is the section which imposes the charge to income tax and surtax for the coming year, including, in relation to income tax, the charge on everybody's salary <Col N="453" /> under PAYE.  It is relevant that in relation to the charge of these taxes on income we should look at the pattern and the picture which we have had over the past years, coming up to this year.</P>
      <P>For the financial year ending on 31st March, 1961, the total taxes on income were £38,300,000.  In the current year, as a result of this section that figure will have risen to £92,500,000 or, as near as makes no matter, three times what it was.  Even if one takes it in much more recent times, one finds that in 1964-65 the total taxes on income were £71,400,000 and this year they will be £92,500,000.  Let us look at what the increase is from a percentage point of view.  Between 1961 and 1966-67, that is to say, a period of six years, the amount collected in income tax, surtax and corporation profits tax has gone up by no less than 133 per cent. The total taxes on income in that period have gone up by no less than 142 per cent.  The increase in the past three years, 1963-64 to 1966-67, for income tax, surtax and corporation profits tax, is one of 52 per cent.  The total taxes on income have gone up by more or less the same amount or, to be exact, by 51 per cent.</P>
      <P>In three years the amount taken out of the pockets of the people by direct taxation has increased by over one-half. What greater disincentive can we have when we have one-half more taken out of the people's pockets by taxation?  In so far as this year is concerned, the effect will be that the people about whom Deputy Corish was speaking earlier are going to pay 14/6d in every £1 in taxation to the Minister for Finance and if they are earning that money out of a company, the company has already paid 7½ per cent on the first £2,500 of profits and 23 per cent on the remainder.  The individual taxpayer-salary earner in every walk of life who is liable to pay tax under PAYE is now going to pay in this year 5/3d out of every £1 compared with 4/9d last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is it any wonder when we see these direct taxes going up year by year that we find an inclination not to do the same amount of work and that we find <Col N="454" /> people saying that it is not worth while undertaking any additional work, and therefore undertaking any additional responsibility, because the Minister for Finance is going to take it all from them in any event?  The Budget of last March is going to take out of the pockets of the people, in taxes on income, £13 million more than last year. Last year the total taxes on income were £79,800,000 and this year the figure will be £92,500,000.  All this is in spite of the fact that a very short time ago the Fianna Fáil Government published a White Paper stating that they were against an increase in direct taxation, trying to give the impression that they accepted the view that taxes of this magnitude and of this sort meant that there would be a disincentive to work.</P>
    <P>The increases I have mentioned are staggering figures and the tragedy is that the extra money being obtained &mdash;as will be dealt with more fully on the General Resolution&mdash;is not being taken for the things which really matter and which, unfortunately, are still awaiting a solution.  For that reason, because of the appalling increase which is typified and summarised and put into effect by section 1 of the Bill, we propose to vote against it and not merely to protest but to endeavour to get the Minister for Finance to put some brake on the manner in which he is digging his hands into the pockets of the people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. P. Byrne Mr. P. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>This section not only imposes the charge to income tax of which Deputy Sweetman has been speaking but re-enacts for a further year the several statutory and other provisions which were in force on 6th April last.  I do not think I spoke on the Committee Stage of the Finance Bill last year, but in previous years, during the regime of the Minister's predecessor, it had been my custom on this section, so to speak, to call for three cheers for a great English gentleman, Sir William Pitt. He has been dead for 150 years, resting in Westminster Abbey.  We are here re-enacting for the Republic of Ireland a vast volume of legislation, the principles of which were laid down by him <Col N="455" /> for a country which is now a foreign country to us, for a time and in circumstances which had no similarity whatsoever with the present time or circumstances.</P>
      <P>These laws of Sir William Pitt were first brought to this country in 1853. That means that we are now re-enacting them for the 113th year and the fact that the Minister some weeks ago brought in an income tax consolidation measure is not going to make one whit of a difference because the bulk of the provisions in the Consolidation Bill are taken from the British Act of 1918, and the bulk of them go back to the original Act of 1853.  The principles go back even earlier, to Sir William Pitt's time.  We are now going through the absurd farce of translating that Income Tax Consolidation Bill into the Irish language, a process which will take perhaps three or four years and will cost us tens of thousands of pounds.  That is not an exaggeration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are deluding ourselves into the belief that we have a tax code which suits us.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  I felt that with the Minister's predecessor one was beating one's head against a stone wall on this question of tax reform, but I would hope that the present Minister would have a more open mind on the subject.  I did urge him, I think, last year briefly to study the five reports of the Income Taxation Commission which was established by Deputy Sweetman, when he was Minister for Finance, and which had the misfortune to report to the former Minister, now Senator Dr. Ryan.  The bulk of the recommendations of the Income Taxation Commission has not been implemented.  They make five lengthy reports.  The members sat for years and they gave tremendous national service completely without remuneration.  The labours of these public servants have been very largely ignored by the Government.  In two White Papers the former Minister, now Senator Dr. Ryan, rejected most of their recommendations.  There is a tremendous need for a radical approach to tax reform and I would hope that the implementation of the proposed <Col N="456" /> consolidation measure might have this effect, as indeed has happened I understand, with other cumbersome and unwieldy statutes and it may well be the first step in the reform process.</P>
    <P>But let us face up to the fact that the bulk of this law is completely unsuited to our conditions and was never designed for them.  Deputy Sweetman adverted to the fact that, as compared with three years ago, there will be collected in the coming year 50 per cent more direct taxation. As compared with ten to 12 years ago it will be found that the number of wage and salary-earners, persons taxed under Schedule E of the tax code, has multiplied tremendously. There are something like 200,000 wage-earners taxed under Schedule E. If there is one part of the taxation code which is more unsuited to Irish conditions, which creates resentment and social injustice, than that part of our law which relates to Schedule E, I have yet to hear of it.</P>
    <P>The rules applicable to Schedule E have been condemned time out of number by eminent judicial authorities. We shall have a further opportunity of discussing that in relation to a later amendment.  I do want to say that the majority of wage and salary-earners in this country, those who are taxed under the PAYE system, labour under a sense of acute grievance because they are paying tax on 20/-in the £ of their income under a set of restricted rules.  It is time, because of the situation that has arisen whereby we are depending for direct tax revenue on the wage and salary-earners to an inequitable extent, that a fresh look should be taken at the whole concept of taxation as applied to these people, who, incidentally, are probably the most sorely affected section of the community as far as indirect taxes are concerned also.</P>
    <P>It is time we recognised the inherent difference in concept between income which arises from personal efforts and is remunerated by way of salary or wage and income which springs from business profits which has built into it, as it were, an element of return for capital invested.  The salary or wage-earner <Col N="457" /> has a precarious form of livelihood which is dependent on his personal efforts.  If his personal efforts cease his income ceases.  Though most business people are hard-working it is nonetheless true to say that if the publican on the street corner falls ill his income in one form or another will continue to maintain itself.  He will not be left stranded as the wage or salary-earner will.</P>
    <P>There is that fundamental basic difference in concept between these two forms of income, and a code of rules applicable to one is not necessarily the right code of rules to apply in equity to the other section of the community.  Notwithstanding that, it is anomalous that the code of rules applying to wage and salary-earners is often more vicious and restrictive than that applying to any other sector of the community.</P>
    <P>In this matter we must get away from the British precedent.  There is not in Britain the unjust situation, which exists in this country, of the economy being so dependent on wage and salary-earners for direct tax revenue.  The social injustice in this country is greater and, therefore, it behoves us to branch out on our own in our thinking about this fundamental and inherent difference in concept between the two types of income.</P>
    <P>The disincentive effect of PAYE has a bearing on this.  I am sorry Deputy Corish is not present.  He was here a few moments ago.  What I am saying is relevant to a few remarks of his which I saw quoted in a newspaper last week. At a trade union function he spoke about the rate of taxation evasion.  If there is one section of the community which does not evade taxes it is the wage and salary-earners.  On that account, among other reasons, they have this sense of grievance which I spoke about a moment ago.  I am asking that this difference be recognised in a broad way and compensated for, in effect, by tax differentiation as between these two sections of our community.  There is built into our tax system the means of effecting that differentiation, namely, earned income relief at one-quarter of the total <Col N="458" /> taxable income which is effectively exempted from tax up to a maximum income of £2,000.</P>
    <P>I suppose the conclusion one can come to from what I have been saying is that the rate of earned income relief applying to salary and wage-earners should be an increased rate as compared with the rate of earned income relief applied to other sections of the community, simply by reason of the fact that other sections of the community have a return for capital built into their income.  The wage-earner and the salary-earner are not in that position.  I hope I have not laboured that point unnecessarily.</P>
    <P>In the field of tax reform, there are many other bristling anomalies and injustices.  Have we ever taken a long hard look at the personal allowances for tax purposes?  Have we ever decided what these allowances are intended to cover?  On what principle are they based?  One thing is very clear, and it reinforces what I have been saying about this question of social justice. The usual starting point at which we try to measure inflation is 1938 and 1939.  We speak of the pre-war £.  It is provable that the £ today is worth approximately 6/8d in terms of the 1939 £.</P>
    <P>In 1938 the personal allowance for a married man was £225.  If we are to maintain the relative position of the taxpayers with each other and with society as a whole, the personal allowance on that basis should be £675 today. In fact, it is £380.  That brings into context this question of social justice, because these anomalies and injustices are far greater by reason of the fact that we are now relying on the small man for direct tax revenue to a fantastic extent, to an extent which was never visualised by those who drafted our tax laws.  Indeed, it is true to say that in Sir William Pitt's time, 150 years ago, the income tax drafted by him related very largely to land and fixed capital.</P>
    <P>To get back to the Commission's report which I would urge the Minister to have a fresh look at, there are many other grotesque anomalies.  There is the Schedule A tax on notional income&mdash; the householder's tax&mdash;which the Commission <Col N="459" /> strongly recommend should be mitigated almost entirely on valuations up to £30.  Nothing has been done about that.  It is a maxim of the law that equity is a stranger to income tax. That has been too rapidly accepted by successive Ministers for Finance in the past.  We must cast that concept overboard if we are to create in this country a just society.  It is a concept which the Minister's predecessor was far too readily prepared to live with.</P>
    <P>This grotesque tax on notional income&mdash;the householder's tax, as I call it&mdash;has been done away with by a Tory Government in Britain but that arch-Tory, the Minister's predecessor, Senator Dr. Ryan, not only refused to do anything about it but on doctrinaire grounds, tried to defend his refusal.  I could readily appreciate a Minister for Finance who would say: &ldquo;We cannot afford to do away with it.  I need the money.  I must find it&rdquo;, but a Minister who on doctrinaire, antiquated theories endeavours to justify what is unjustifiable is making a damned fool of himself.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, these anomalies of old British law&mdash;unsuited to us&mdash;were added last year in our Finance Act, 1965 and because we are re-enacting them here again, and because this would hardly be relevant at any other stage of the discussion, I want to say a few words now about Part VII of last year's Finance Act, the notorious provision which brought in a tax on the sale of one's property.  I only wish I had succeeded before I left the office this afternoon in finding the opinion of a learned counsel which I saw some weeks ago in relation to a point arising out of Part VII.  I should like to have quoted the concluding paragraph of that opinion for the Minister, but I could not find it.  The gist of it was that this learned counsel, this leading counsel, would take no responsibility for the advice which he had given because of the obscurity of the provision, and because of his extreme difficulty in deciphering the intention of Part VII of last year's Finance Act.  It has caused consternation.</P>

These rectories were first built about a century ago and this Body are now apprehensive that on the sale of these rectories they will be assessed for tax on the profit.</P>

      <P>We are endeavouring to encourage business people to modernise and re-equip.  You cannot modernise and re-equip and move your factory to a new premises without disposing of your old factory.  If you dispose of your old factory, are you going to be assessed for tax on the gain at the sale?  Surely, if there is a gain, that is part of the financing process of the modernisation and development in which you are engaging?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="461" /> The Institute of Chartered Accountants had something to say about that very example in a submission which they made to the Minister some months ago.  If I may quote from their submission to the Minister which was circulated to members of the Institute, it was to this effect:</P>
    <P>In general, the reason why trading concerns move to new premises is to facilitate the expansion and re-equipment of the business in line with the Government policy on the development of industry.  The result of the imposition of tax on the incidental surplus arising on the disposal of the old premises will be to reduce substantially the funds available for the purchase of new premises and to finance the expansion of the business.</P>
    <P>This is a very simple statement of the fact.  I know the Minister has set up a special section of the Revenue Commissioners which is dealing with property disposals.  I am also aware that a few weeks ago the Minister took the unusual step of issuing a press statement of his intentions in respect of Part VII of the Finance Act, 1965.  I invite him here and now to elaborate on these intentions to Dáil Éireann.  Is it intended next year, if the Minister is still in office&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not realise that Deputy Byrne was going to go on to Part VII of the Finance Act, 1965, which he undoubtedly was entitled <Col N="462" /> to do under the Rules of Order. I welcome the fact that he did so because he has done so in precisely the same way that my amendment No. 2 would do it.  The fact, of course, is that nothing has denigrated more the personal reputation of Deputy Lynch as Minister for Finance than what he did in relation to Part VII of last year's Finance Act.</P>
      <P>He stood in this House about three months ago and said he had got no complaints whatsoever in relation to the working of that part of the Act. Yet, within a matter of days, we had the Revenue Commissioners announcing that they were setting up a special section in Upper O'Connell Street to deal with people who had queries on the Act.  It showed either that the Minister for Finance did not know what was happening in his Department or that he was, deliberately, not telling the Dáil the whole facts.  I prefer to believe the first of him rather than the second. I do not think he would deliberately tell us a lie but the fact is, as everybody knows, that there is not a single person in the Bar, a single accountant in outside practice, other than the ex-accountant, the Minister for Agriculture, who is able to tell anybody what Part VII of the Finance Act, 1965, means.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture says it is simple and everybody can understand it.  If he goes to his profession or if Deputy Vivion de Valera goes down again to the Bar Library both of them know the advice they will get as to what Part VII of the Finance Act means as to the circumstances in which liability under it will operate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I will go back and advise the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I would suggest to the Deputy that there will be a certain amount to be gained if he studies Part VII of the Finance Act, 1965, and as an expert on Part VII operating in future down in the Four Courts he will be well rewarded for it.  I do not know what his remuneration in his present business is, but whatever it is if he was able to tell people what Part VII meant he would get a great deal more because <Col N="463" /> none of his colleagues in the Bar is able to do so.</P>
      <P>The fact, of course, is, as Deputy Byrne said a minute ago, that people in all walks of life are being caught by that Part.  The manufacturer who wants to move to a new factory inevitably has, during the last six years in which he has been in his factory, done some little reconstruction work. The effect of doing that reconstruction work brings him within the purview of Part VII of the Finance Act, 1965. When he goes to sell his factory he has to pay tax on the difference between what he bought the factory for and what he gets for it less what might have been spent on it.  The same applies in the case of the single individual who buys a house and then, having bought the house, adds a bathroom and then perhaps he is unfortunate enough to die.  His widow finds she cannot keep that house and she has to sell it.  She will be taxed on any increase in price there may be because the bathroom has been added and because there has been reconstruction work of that sort within six years.</P>
      <P>We all know what Part VII of the Finance Act of last year was designed to catch.  Nobody on this side of the House no more than anybody on the other side objects to that.  It was designed to catch builders who were developing and who were syphoning off the profits of their building in a way which was legal but which in effect meant they were free from tax. That was because the builders concerned were prepared to tell a lie that they had not the intention when they bought the building site of developing it.  It was only if the Revenue Commissioners could prove they had the intention of developing it that the Finance Act, 1965, section 6, caught them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No reasonable person could disagree with the desire of the Minister for Finance to close the gap.  It is quite outrageous to close the gap in such a way that those outside the ordinary building trade, those outside the ordinary development trade, those outside the ordinary speculators in land <Col N="464" /> today and many innocent people are caught.  It is quite outrageous to close it in such a way that not merely were those people caught but they were caught for what, in effect, is a capital gains tax on the diminishing value of money.  That is something which we will be able to discuss more clearly when we get to the point in amendment No. 2.  The sections of Part VII of the Act of 1965 which have been referred to by Deputy Byrne have proved unworkable in operation.  That Part of the Act may have proved unworkable to the extent that it has meant there is such a collection of queries under it that it has proved such a clog on building, already sufficiently depressed by the credit squeeze, that no profits have escaped.</P>
    <P>It was never intended, however, to catch a person who wished to do a reconstruction job and who, because of that reconstruction, was brought within the terms of the Act, in the same way as the person who is buying land for development and building 100 or 200 houses on it.  Everybody was quite prepared to meet the Minister for Finance in regard to that type of avoidance by the builder, the developer, the speculator, but the Minister gave an assurance that the ordinary individual would not be hit.  In fact, it means, as the Act was drawn, that ordinary cases are liable and the Revenue Commissioners, in pursuance of their job, must pursue all those who are liable.</P>
    <P>Many of us did not raise this earlier because there was a rumour that Part VII of the Act would be severely amended this year.  Having believed that&mdash;I frankly did believe it&mdash;we thought it was better to let the official amendments come to light.  None has been introduced.  The Minister for Finance has dug his head further into the sand like an ostrich in relation to that Part of the Bill and no amendment has been produced.  For that reason, Deputy Byrne was entirely correct in the strictures he passed not merely on those sections of the Act but on the Minister for having introduced them and retained them.</P>
    <P>There are a couple of other things in relation to the general trend of taxation <Col N="465" /> that it might be desirable to stress again.  If one goes back over the past five years one can see that taxation on income in that period has doubled&mdash; that the amount taken out of the pockets of the people by the Minister for Finance during the past five years is now twice as much as it was.</P>

      <P>I shall come to percentages in a minute if the Deputy would have just that little bit of patience.  Total taxation has gone up from £45.5 million to £92.5 million in the current year.  The burden of taxation, the proportion of the output absorbed by taxation&mdash;the point made by Deputy de Valera&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall give the Deputy any percentage he likes.  I have all the percentages.  The proportion of output that is absorbed by taxation of the community has increased by more than one-fifth since the beginning of the decade.  I made a shot at calculation when the debate began and I have calculated that the percentage of direct taxation of net output this year compared with last year has increased by about one-sixth.  I do not bind myself, in my arithmetic, to a quarter per cent either way.  It has increased by one-sixth of what it was last year. That, of course, is a percentage we should like to hear from Deputy de Valera as regards employed persons who are subject to PAYE.  The deduction now is 5/3 out of £1 instead of 4/9.  The ordinary taxpayer not subject to PAYE must pay 8d more this year than last year and can pay up to 14/6 out of every £1.  If that is a percentage of which the Minister for Finance and the Government can be proud, the sooner they go out among the people and ask them if they like those percentages the better.</P>

      <P>The section is concerned essentially with the rate of income tax.  Once that has been debated there is little else to be said on the section.  There is one point, <Col N="466" /> though, on which Deputies opposite have been somewhat obscure.  They talk about the intention of Part VII.  I do not understand the argument that there is any lack of certainty about what Part VII did.  It did something very like what Resolution No. 19, which was withdrawn, would have done.  The situation in relation to that Part appears to me to be perfectly simple.  As Deputy Sweetman has said, there is no doubt as to the primary purpose of the legislation.  The weakness was in the over-cautious drafting of it from the point of view of its implementation.  The drafting was such as to capture practically anything. Deputy Sweetman challenged me to advise him on that and I said it captured practically anything.</P>
      <P>This raises the principle of precision in taxation.  At first flush it may be administratively easy to provide precision if one can foresee all contingencies and rely on rational implementation but we are now experiencing administrative complications.  Again I am taken by surprise.  I did not intend to refer to this on section 1 but Deputy Byrne opened up a field on this point and I should like to content myself with the remark that there is no doubt about what is the intention of the section, and the charges Deputy Sweetman made against the Minister were unfair and unfounded.  I repeat that they were unfair and unfounded.  The difficulty I see in the legislation is one of precision in taxation.</P>

      <P>I said there are no difficulties about interpretation.  It is quite clear that it captures anything in a sense.  I am saying that the Deputy was not fair in what he said about the Minister in this regard.  The difficulties which have flowed from this are difficulties in the drafting and <Col N="467" /> framing of these provisions, designed for a purpose of which we all approve, which through the understandable motives of over-caution or over-provision&mdash;a very natural desire that anybody drafting such a provision would have&mdash;would make sure that the thing would be effective.  I am sure the consequences have flowed from that. The problem here for the Minister is, in fact, a question of amendment and drafting essentially, if one looks at it from that point of view.  I have got on my feet mainly to point out that Deputy Sweetman was not altogether fair or objective to the Minister in that regard.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister like me to repeat it quite quietly? I was talking about Part VII of the Finance Act of 1965.  The Minister came in here one day and informed the House that he had neither received nor heard any complaints in relation to the interpretation of Part VII.  Within a matter of a few days afterwards, the Revenue Commissioners had an advertisement in the Press that they were setting up a special section in O'Connell Street for the purpose of dealing with difficulties which were arising in relation to Part VII of the Act of 1965. I said in relation to that that there appeared to me to be two possible explanations only of the statement made by the Minister for Finance in the House: either he did not know what was happening in his Department and did not know what complaints had been made, or he was telling the Dáil an untruth.  I do not believe the last one: I do not think he was telling the Dáil an untruth.  It seems to me perfectly clear that he was not aware of what was happening in his Department; that was the only alternative left open to me.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not keep the Minister very long, especially on income tax.  Some years ago this PAYE system was introduced and I thought it quite a good idea at the time.  As <Col N="468" /> far as my memory serves me, the body which is accepted as being the voice of the wage and salary earners also endorsed the introduction of the PAYE system.  As a matter of fact, they had advocated the introduction of this system for quite a number of years and were pleased that it was introduced. But whilst I still think it is a good system, when one relates it to the payment of income tax generally &mdash;I think Deputy Byrne referred to this while I was out&mdash;it cannot be said that those who operate under PAYE are, to put it bluntly, getting a fair crack of the whip.  I do not want to labour this point; I think Deputy Byrne may have mentioned it, and I mentioned it before.</P>
      <P>It must be abundantly clear to everybody that a person who is in receipt of a wage or salary, whether paid monthly, weekly, or quarterly, cannot in any way evade his responsibility for the payment of income tax.  There is no escape.  Under this particular section, he will, in fact, suffer a wage cut by reason of the increase of income tax from 4/9d to 5/3d in the £.  I wonder if the standard rate of income tax would be 7/- in the £ if all those who should by law pay income tax were, in fact, paying it on their taxable incomes.  The Minister's predecessor, two or three Budgets ago, introduced a measure or made proposals in a Finance Bill or, possibly, in a Budget Statement, for the detection of tax evasion.  I still do not know what, if any, results there were from that particular proposal or whether, in fact, anything was done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those who are interested in the introduction, or even the consideration, of an incomes policy must also have been impressed by that part of the Report which talked about the income of people who could be deemed to be self-employed.  They advocated very strongly that these self-employed people should be required to keep accounts and they spoke particularly about professional people.  In any case it seemed by inference from what they stated that there are an awful lot of people in this country who do not and who were not required to keep accounts.  That, according to <Col N="469" /> their argument, was for the purpose of trying to evade income tax.  If they are not required to keep accounts, if their actual income cannot be ascertained, it surely means that there is some evasion of the payment of income tax.  As I said, an employed person&mdash;whether a civil servant, a road worker, a clerical worker, a tradesman or whatever his occupation&mdash;has got to pay right down to the last penny because his employer will do that every week or month on his behalf.</P>
    <P>Mind you, there is another factor in this as well.  Many of those people have not an idea of all the allowances to which they are entitled.  I assume that the income tax offices throughout the country help them in the preparation of their claims.  Therefore, I think &mdash;and I referred to this in my speech after the Minister set out his proposals &mdash;some effort should be made to ensure that the tax burden will fall fairly and squarely on the shoulders of all those who, under this law, are bound to pay.  I do not know how much money is involved but I do not think anybody in this House will deny that there are many who do not pay their fair share of income tax related to their incomes.  I do not believe either that the original income tax laws were framed to ensure that any single person who had £6 per week should pay, out of any balance over and above that, a sum of 5/3d in the £.  I do not think the income tax code was ever designed or intended to make that sort of person with £6, £7 or even £8 per week pay income tax.</P>
    <P>The allowances were the subject of a motion which the Labour Party had before the House last autumn.  We advocated that the various allowances, personal allowances and dependants' allowances, should be increased.  We also advocated that children's allowances should be increased as well beances had no relation in the wide earthly world to what was originally intended.  The Minister did increase the children's allowances but still within a certain wage group.</P>
    <P>Much emphasis has been placed here <Col N="470" /> on production and incentives, particularly with regard to industry, and there are certain tax allowances given to industry for the purpose of encouraging them, not alone to produce more but particularly to export more.  One of the big factors in the wages or income of many tradesmen and operatives is the income tax they must pay on overtime.  I believe they should pay some income tax on their income but if a man is required to work over the stipulated 42 or 44 hours per week&mdash;I know he is compensated in that he gets time and a quarter, time and a half, or, perhaps, double time for Sundays&mdash; the Minister should consider, if not in this Finance Bill, in the future, some sort of incentive for those required to work overtime, particularly in producing industries.  Over and above all this, the Minister should have regard to the inferences, if not statements, in the NIEC report, to ensure that those who can pay, those who have the income, are made to pay their fair share of income tax.  I am not qualified to talk about business and about industries and their profits but I am particularly concerned to ensure that those who are self-employed will pay their fair share of tax.</P>
    <P>Some years ago income tax did not bother ordinary workers because allowances related to their wages and salaries at that time meant that they need not pay income tax.  Wages and salaries have increased, particularly in the past five or six years, and so has the standard of living, but what has trailed behind and has become an impost and a burden on those workers is the fact that these allowances have not changed.  Therefore, the Minister in his autumn Budget&mdash;if he is going to have one&mdash;should consider these allowances because they certainly can be a deterrent to increased production and above all, should ensure that those who, according to NIEC ought to be required to keep their accounts, should do so and that they should be taxed on their incomes and that there should not be any &ldquo;fiddle&rdquo;.  With all due respect to this particular section and others, I think the Minister must understand that there is &ldquo;fiddling&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Yes.  I believe farmers are afraid of their lives of income tax, but in fairness to them, I suppose the great majority of them would not be required to pay income tax.  Any time anybody mentions income tax in relation to the agricultural industry, every farmer, even though he may have only five acres, thinks that he is going to be made pay income tax. They should not pay income tax unless it is proved that they have a certain amount of money.  There are big farmers who are not paying income tax and who should pay it.  The majority of them, if we are to believe the statements of the Minister for Agriculture, the NFA, and the ICMSA in regard to their yearly income, would not be required to pay income tax if they have not got the money but the person who is in the farming industry and whose income is £2,500, £3,000 or £3,500 per year should be examined to see whether or not he should pay income tax.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make a very brief interjection <i>apropos</i> what Deputy Corish was saying.  The Deputy is concerned about the position of the PAYE taxpayer, as I am concerned about it, and he is also concerned about evasion and he inter-connects the two, quite rightly.  Because of this consideration of social and distributive justice, the salary-earner or the wage-earner under PAYE has a chip on his shoulder.  The country business person, the country shopkeeper&mdash;I shall not say the big Dublin shops&mdash;will not be stopped from &ldquo;fiddling&rdquo;.  It is impossible. When he is emptying his cash register at night, everybody knows, including the inspector of taxes that he pockets at least £1 out of the £10 or £20 takings for the day.  It would be contrary to human nature to try to stop that.  The accountants acting for these individuals frequently know this and they give very restricted certificates with their accounts.  Inspectors of taxes know this. That leads to a situation in which, if you can do nothing about it, how can you create a situation which has regard to distributive justice as affecting the wage-earner and salary-earner?  You come back to what I was stating in the Minister's absence: you recognise the inherent difference in concept between income which derives from wages and salaries and income which derives from business profits.  You tax wages and salaries on a different basis by reason of that inherent difference in concept. The mechanism is there by reference to earned income level.  You give him a higher rate of earned income relief.</P>

      <P>I am corrected by a Member on the Fianna Fáil benches who says that it is £60 million.  Nobody quarrels with assistance for the agricultural community where it has to be assisted.  There may be doubts justifiably expressed as to the extent that this assistance is truly warranted.  The arrival of pickets by taxi from expensive hotels is not a convincing argument as to a depressed economic condition. However, that may be superficial. I shall not make a particular point of it.  Indeed not for one moment do we think that the Government will alter their policy and, in the words of Deputy Byrne, take a hard look at the tax structure.  Nor do we think that the Government will run the risk of offending these large landlord farmers whose income is a multiplication of the income of the average wage or salary-earner in a city or town, and who are completely tax free.  These <Col N="475" /> are not many.  I would not think they are very numerous but they do exist.</P>
      <P>I would say that a source of a considerable amount of possible revenue is being neglected by reason of the Government not applying their mind to the collection of tax from these very large farmers.  I want to underline and emphasise that so that it will be understood where the Labour Party stands in relation to this.  We stand for the small farmers, for their protection and support equally with any other Party in this House and we, perhaps, are more concerned for them in the true sense of the word.</P>

      <P>Taking the national view and looking at the picture in that way, there is tax avoidance or evasion.  I hope I was mistaken in taking Deputy Byrne as making the point that this is O.K., that it goes on and, because it goes on, it is all right, it is inevitable, it cannot be corrected, nothing much can be done about it.  Is it all right?  What is the moral law on this question?  It is not a matter that can be resolved by discussion in this House.  It is the subject of discussion at various levels outside the House and it has been a matter of contention amongst all kinds of people at all levels of society as to what is the moral aspect of tax avoidance.  It is not a matter with which I would concern myself.  There are others in this House far more qualified than I am to deal with questions of morality, I am sure, but I would say that, if it is the law that tax should be paid, that law should be applied to everybody with equal kindness or severity, as you will.</P>
      <P>It is a fact that the wage earner and the salary earner pay their tax.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>It is all right; he is probably going off to Strasbourg.  The worker is trapped inescapably by the collection machine.  On the other hand, there are many people, professional people, as Deputy Corish instanced, who are in a position to evade or avoid income tax.  I am quite certain many of them do not do so, although they could.  But there are many who do. It is true also that many businessmen probably find themselves in a position to evade or avoid paying income tax and avail themselves of that opportunity. It is a human enough failing. I suppose any of us, if we were in the same position, could be guilty of it. But that does not take away from the fact that nobody, so far as it is possible for us to arrange matters, should be put in the position of being able to evade tax.  It goes on, and on a pretty widespread scale, and the sufferers are the ordinary workers, the wage and salary earners.</P>
      <P>I am not one who is given to undue thought in relation to the trials and troubles of civil servants.  I think most public representatives have at times felt that civil servants, dealing with matters which Deputies bring to their notice, might move somewhat more speedily, but, on behalf of the Civil Service, I would say that these people render an important service to the country.  They are caught inescapably by the taxation system.  Whatever the law lays down, they must pay because tax is deducted at source in the same way as PAYE is deducted at source. These are the main contributors of income tax to the Exchequer.  Many other classes manage to evade their responsibility.  That is not right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should, as has been suggested, in his next Budget&mdash;he is a man with a Budget apparently for all seasons&mdash;produce something which will make the income tax laws more effective in so far as they relate to the classes to which I have referred.  I shall be compelled to leave the matter <Col N="479" /> of the farmers over until there is a change of Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so. A great many people, especially the political neophytes I see around me, make the mistake of thinking the people of this nation can be easily fooled.  They also think the people want to hear sweet talk all the time and cannot listen to facts or to the truth.  That is the mistake they make. The Irish people can take long, hard looks at their own condition.  They know what the facts are and our political history has shown that, even when difficult or unpopular things had to be done, and were done, while politicians might run away, the people did not.</P>
      <P>Deputy Booth says it might be as well to drop that one.  That, of course, is political expediency at work in his mind and the hope expressing itself that we will forget these unpleasant facts and roll along nice and easily, keeping things going, and the boat will not be rocked.  But life will not have it that way.  The people will not have it that way.  Facts are things that cannot be put down and the fact is that there are in this country a section being compelled to pay income tax, and another vast section not even looked at from the point of view of income tax. Amongst that vast section are people who would be well able to pay but who are not being asked to pay.  That is the position as we see it.  Again I emphasise, so that there can be no possible misrepresentation or misinterpretation of our stand in this matter, that we accept that there are great numbers of farmers who, if their means were assessed, would not fall liable to income tax under our present system.  We also believe there is a considerable number who, if their means were examined, would fall liable. These moneys are being allowed to go by default by the Government purely for reasons of political expediency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another aspect of the incidence of income tax to which I would draw the Minister's attention. <Col N="480" /> I am sure that has been done by other speakers.  I refer to the disincentive effect of taxation.  We live in a time when workers are being continuously and monotonously, almost boringly, adjured to produce more.  In securing greater production, the question of overtime working arises.  I have met many workers who tell me that, because of the application of income tax to their packets, it is not worth their while to work overtime. Overtime in itself is not a desirable thing and anybody who has suffered overtime&mdash;I say &ldquo;suffered&rdquo; advisedly &mdash;agrees with me that there is a certain number of hours during which the average worker is able to work at his best; after that, his effort progressively slows down.  Overtime working seems to go against nature.  Even the shift system seems contrary to normal, natural methods of work.</P>
    <P>Now, if we are to encourage people to produce more and if, with that object in view, we ask them to work overtime, then we must reward them. Single workers and workers with small families are at the moment being discouraged from working overtime simply because of the fact that the State comes along and rifles their pay packets at the end of each week for income tax purposes.  All this is, of course, related to the whole question of an incomes policy.  An incomes policy was suggested in the NIEC report.  We discussed that report here earlier this year.  It was adopted formally by the House without, I think, any dissenting voice.  The question of an incomes policy was touched upon, but not in the detail it should have been.  The whole question of greater production depends upon the development of a proper incomes policy.  It is here a start can be made.  The Minister can encourage greater production by lessening the burden of income tax as it falls upon those workers who are required to work overtime.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to consider these points, and consider them carefully. I would ask him to put them into operation, if he can.  It would appear it is not his intention to do so now, but I think they are valid points and the setting up of machinery to <Col N="481" /> prevent the wholesale tax evasion that now takes place is of vital importance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody will disagree with the Deputy's proposition that the incidence of taxation should be fair and uniform.  Nevertheless, I think his development of the picture is somewhat distorted.  Deputy Dunne would leave one under the impression that a large amount of money was lost through evasion, that a majority was evading and a minority was paying. We had better look at the facts to get that in proportion.  The bulk of individual payers of income tax&mdash;I have not statistics and I am open to correction&mdash;are those who are paid salaries and wages and, as the Deputy quite rightly pointed out, there is no escape for them.  Income tax falls on corporations but, in most cases, corporations have got audited accounts. The task of the Revenue Commissioners is relatively clear and is often negotiated with the help of auditors. That leaves only two categories to be embraced in Deputy Dunne's indictment and these are professional and agricultural.  There is the general class, to which Deputy Corish referred, and, additional to that, there is the agricultural community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the professional and the self-employed classes, there may be, and everybody will agree there are, opportunities for evasion.  Human nature being what it is, there is the possibility that, in cases, there are evasions.  But let us not under-estimate the efficiency and the devotion of the Revenue Commissioners.  Let us not think that the Revenue Commissioners wash their hands in these cases.  The fact is that any professional or self-employed person with any sizeable business is paying income tax.  I must admit the <i>a priori</i> possibilities which Deputy Dunne says are there.  That the actual rates of payment and the incidence of income tax falling on these people are or are not exactly parallel to the wage-earning classes is a different story.  That is a question that is probably a problem for the Revenue Commissioners.  They are doing the best they can.  Let us get our picture <Col N="482" /> clear.  I would need convincing that a large amount of revenue is lost to the State through that source, on the one hand, or that there is much disparity in regard to these things: there may be some disparity.</P>
    <P>Now let us come to the agricultural side which Deputy Dunne was very keen to saddle on my back.  There is a very good case for tax reliefs to our farming community and I, a city Deputy, say it.  They are our primary industry and this country is dependent on our agriculture and our agricultural produce.</P>

      <P>I am not.  I am telling the truth.  We, as a community, are depending on our agriculture in this country and that is the whole basis of our economy.  Deputy Dunne wants to saddle me with something. He has got his answer which is that there is a very strong case for special reliefs for our agricultural community. Deputy Dunne has, himself, given the second answer.  In our agricultural setup, we have a large number of small farmers with small units.  I completely agree with Deputy Dunne that, on investigation, by comparison with non-primary producers and other people in this country, even under the existing code, an assessment would probably be nil.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dunne wanted to wrong&mdash;foot me.  I am giving him the answers.  Let us come back to income tax.  Let none of us think that the Revenue Commissioners are either inert or inept.  From the point of view of most of the community they are a little bit too energetic and too able.  My complaint with them in the past and generally, if I get up here, has been rather that they have not had enough self-confidence or whoever is providing them with the law has not had enough confidence in their energy and powers and has sought to give them more powers than were really necessary with results that were unforeseen and we were back to that matter a little bit earlier.  Deputy Dunne complains that the law will not catch people.  Other people, including myself, were complaining that we were making the law too all-embracing. In other words, the mesh of the net was too fine.  You cannot have it both ways.  It is obviously a matter of balance.</P>
      <P>In principle, I want to oppose Deputy Dunne.  If he has any constructive suggestions they could be brought forward by way of amendment. I think the Minister and the rest of us would welcome them.  At least, Deputy Sweetman has tried.  I really did not get the depth of that amendment until he explained it to me but at least Deputy Sweetman has given us an amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>At least it shows that after many years someone in the Fianna Fáil Party has come to realise the importance of the farmer and the standing of agriculture in the community.  We welcome that.  I hope we will be hearing similar sentiments expressed by every other Deputy who realises the importance of the farming community, be they big farmers or small farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of professional people evading income tax has been mentioned. Nowadays the farmer can be regarded as a professional person.  How can any Deputy say that a farmer, big or small, should pay income tax when we have agriculture in such a depressed state today?  Never before since this State was founded was it in such a condition of depression.  Some of the money to be raised by this additional taxation will be used to assist farmers improve their income.  Some millions <Col N="485" /> are provided by the State to assist farmers by way of grants, subsidies and loans.  Surely, if farmers were so prosperous as to be obliged to pay income tax, it should not be necessary to provide millions to help them with loans, grants and subsidies?  If the farmer was in an independent position and his income such as would warrant the payment of income tax, there should not be any necessity for this House to provide funds to help him.</P>
    <P>I want it to go on record that I bitterly oppose the suggestion from any side of the House that the farmers of this country should pay income tax at any time.  I feel there is a growing tendency in this regard in the House. The thin end of the wedge has already been driven in regard to an effort to make farmers pay income tax.  Any such effort is bad and will not help the economy of the country.  I hope we have heard the last of an effort, either now or in the future, to compel farmers to pay income tax.  It is even unreasonable that income tax inspectors should send the various claim forms to farmers for completion.  It is a fact that the district office of every inspector of taxes has received from the local authority the valuations of various farms.  The claim forms are dispatched to the farmer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not pursue the matter further.  If the Minister for Finance is as sympathetic to the farmers as Deputy de Valera has conveyed to the House, then I am sure we have heard the end of any effort to seek to make farmers pay income tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The PAYE system imposes a great hardship on taxpayers at present. Under it wage-earners are not encouraged to work overtime.  We have had appeals from the Taoiseach, from the Minister for Industry and Commerce and from no less a person than the Minister for Finance asking our people to work harder and produce more.  We have had on more than one occasion replies from Ministers to various trade <Col N="486" /> unions saying the workers are not working as they should or producing the amount the nation expects them to produce.  I have had the experience of industrial workers and other workers in my constituency and other parts of the country who would gladly work overtime.  I have known many instances where overtime was available but the workers declined to accept it because they felt they would be only handing it over to the income tax authorities.  If workers are good enough to work overtime, if their management ask them to do so, it should be sufficient for their basic salary to be subject to income tax.  When the country needs more production and a greater return from its manpower, it is wrong if we tax the worker industrious enough to work overtime.  As I say, I have known many workers who declined to work overtime simply because they felt it was only a matter of getting it with one hand and handing it out with the other.</P>
    <P>The allowances made under PAYE are absolutely insufficient.  With every increase in wages there appears to be a greater amount paid over to the income tax authorities.  The allowances for dependants and for the education of children are insufficient.  When a child goes to school at four or five years it has to be prepared and clothed and provided with books.  Some generous allowance should be provided for the wage-earners for the education of their children from the time they go to school.</P>
    <P>Time and again we hear references here to the section of the community who are evading the payment of income tax.  I should like to know who they are.  There is an income tax section under the Revenue Commissioners. I think I could describe them as probably the most vigilant section in our community.  I doubt if anybody in receipt of wages or salaries escapes the eye of the income tax inspectors at present.  I do not know who they are but the income tax authorities have been pressing very severly a section of the community that are least able to pay income tax. In many instances, wage-earners who <Col N="487" /> have family dependants are not granted any allowances, and many of them have to travel distances to work, a point which I think Deputy Dunne covers later on.  The time has come for a complete review, with greater sympathy for and greater understanding of the position of workers who are obliged to pay what I consider to be more than their share in income tax. My complaint is that at present the set-up is too rigid.  Some Deputies complain that it is not rigid enough in regard to certain members of the agricultural community who, they say, escape the payment of income tax.  I cannot subscribe to that idea and, as I have said, any effort made in this House, either now or in the future, by the Minister for Finance or any other Fianna Fáil Minister for Finance to impose any heavier impositions by way of income tax demands on the agricultural community will meet the strongest opposition I can possibly give to it.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> Section 1 of this Bill proposes to increase the standard rate of income tax from 6/4 in the £ to 7/- for the current financial year.  That would appear to be an increase of 8d in the £ in the rate of income tax, but, of course, it is far more, because, with one exception the rate of allowances remains static and the value of money has become less and less.  It is high time the rate of personal allowances was increased. It has remained static now for several years, although the value of money is drastically reduced and the cost of living is increasing.  Therefore, the House and the country should realise that this is much more than an increase of 8d in the £.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is bad enough for wage-earners, for industrialists or for anybody else who has control over his income, or who can agitate for or demand an increase in his wage if he is a wage-earner or negotiate with his employer and, failing that, by resorting to strike action, do something to offset this impost of an increase in the rate of income tax; manufacturers, business people, professional people, within <Col N="488" /> certain limits can do likewise.  However, the object of my standing up here this evening is to make an appeal on behalf of retired persons, on behalf of people living on fixed incomes which they cannot increase, people who have retired and who have seen better days, who have served the country well in one capacity or another.</P>
    <P>These people find they are now liable for an increase of 8d in the £ in the standard rate of income tax, while the value of their comparatively small income is contracting.  It is most unjust, it is inhuman, that the personal allowance of retired people on a fixed annual income should not be increased, and increased considerably, to compensate them for the increase in the cost of living, the reduction in the value of money and the increase in the rate of income tax.  It is true that in response to pleas in this House, something has been done in regard to the rate of allowance for secondary schoolgoing children.  That is to be welcomed, but it is the only field in which the Minister has done anything to relieve the hardship on the incometax paying community.</P>
    <P>It is hardly necessary to make a case at any great length on behalf of these people, whether they are retired civil servants, retired local government officials, or people who have retired from private business or private occupations, anybody who provided for himself or herself an income on which he or she thought it would be possible to live in retirement.  Such persons now find themselves being attacked by the Government and by the Minister and having their standard of living reduced drastically at a time when it is beyond their capacity to do anything about it.</P>
    <P>It is even worse than that, because many of these people have been encouraged down through the years to invest their savings in Government loans, and the capital value of these Government loans has been depressed by Government action.  Loans which they were encouraged to invest in and which were worth £100 at par are now worth only £60, £70 or £80.  These <Col N="489" /> people have a real grievance and it is a poor state of affairs if that is the only consideration a Christian Government in this so-called Christian country are prepared to give to this category of people.  I do not know what it would cost the Minister for Finance to be decent to these people, to treat them in a humane manner, but I believe if some of the extravagance that is going on were cut out, it would be possible to treat these people properly.</P>
    <P>This is not a matter of making a case for these people now that the Budget has been introduced and that the Finance Bill is before the House to implement the Budget Motions were put down by this Party and by the Labour Party in the early months of this year calling on the Government to do something for the category of people about whom I am speaking, but the Government turned the deaf ear to it.  As a matter of fact, this Government have very little consideration for the weaker sections of the community.  Perhaps the General Resolution is a more opportune time to discuss this, but just to give an example of the attitude of the Government towards the weaker sections of the community, the Budget was introduced in March of this year and was supposed to distribute the wealth of this nation.  That is one of the functions of a Budget.  It made certain provisions for the social welfare classes and then the Budget debate was not really over until up went the cost of living.  It has gone up two or three times since&mdash;and I will have more to say on that on another occasion&mdash;but still the social welfare classes were provided for in the Budget.  I give that as an example of the tendency of the Government to disregard people on a fixed income.  They are disregarding the unfortunates of this country who are on a fixed income, in the declining years of their lives.  It is a disgrace and something about which a protest should be registered here.  That was the principal reason I got up, to register that protest.</P>

      <P>In regard to subsection (3), when the Finance Bill was <Col N="490" /> introduced last year the Minister was explicit in explaining that he was throwing out the net to bring in others and his main preoccupation was with speculators and others in regard to matters affecting property.  I now understand that in its application by the Revenue Commissioners this provision applies to profits made on the sale of any property and there is no differentiation between the speculator and the ordinary house-owner.  I should like to get a more explicit explanation from the Minister as to what category of people comes within this section.  I know several reasons why it should not be widely applied.  There is the simple reason that a private person with property may, for one reason or another, wish to form a limited liability company and transfer that property to the company.  On that transfer will the question of profit be taken into account and come to be taxed?  There is also the question of amalgamation for greater efficiency in the field of industry and business management.  Will these operations come in under the collector's net? These are points which I should like explained fully.  I have no brief for the person whose business is speculation, buying a house, improving it and then re-selling it.  If such people were escaping before then it was time they were brought in.  However, I have some regard for the efficiently run business and the amalgamation of business which will take place in the future if we are to build up an efficient&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>On a point of order. Are we discussing section 1?  What has this to do with the section?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>It comes in under subsection (3) in regard to income tax and surtax.  When we move on from this I do not think there will be another opportunity to speak on it.  I am applying it to the sale of property by the private individual who will come in for assessment for taxation purposes.  I have been asked numerous questions about this and whether if a man bought a house four years ago for £2,500 and sold it today for £4,000, after the 1965 Act, the profit is assescient&mdash;&mdash;<Col N="491" /> sable for income tax and surtax in the one year?  So far as I know it is.  That is one aspect.</P>
      <P>Another is the question of the private individual or the private business with some assets and property worth, say, £6,000 or £7,000.  If that individual or business decides to form a limited liability company and decides to transfer those assets to the limited company, will they fall in for taxation on that profit, as it were, between the price originally paid for the property and the price they might transfer it in at?  These are questions which can have some relation to this section.  I am not clear, and I do not think many other people are clear, about this section especially in regard to the provision which was brought in to catch the speculators, the people who are buying houses, converting them into flats and making a large profit on the transaction.  By and large, those people were escaping heretofore. All of these people have more or less been incorporated in this.  There was the company which endeavoured to syphon off some of its profits from the sale of property to another company, and in that way make a capital gains which did not come in.  That has been sealed off but in sealing it off a lot of innocent people have been caught up. I should like the Minister to be a little more explicit about these matters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>When I was speaking before, I was talking about the avoidance or evasion of tax by certain tax classes and I mentioned the self-employed. I spoke about evasion under the present income tax code by those who are liable for the payment of income tax.  I do not know whether Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil deliberately tried to insinuate or allege that the Labour Party wanted a further tax on farmers. This seems to be the idea of both Deputy de Valera and Deputy Booth. I can assure Deputy O.J. Flanagan that he will not be called on this year, or next year, or the year after to conduct a spirited defence against any suggestion of taxation because even if the income tax code as we now have it was applied to the farming community <Col N="492" /> only a certain number of them would be required to pay tax.  For example, a farmer with a wife and two children need not have any concern, if the code was applied to him, if he has approximately £1,000 a year, which is £20 a week.  The same farmer can earn a certain amount over and above what we are told he is earning now and he would not be subjected to income tax.</P>
      <P>There is no point in anybody talking about the depressed state of agriculture. That is true if you think about the agricultural industry generally but I do not think anybody will deny that there are some people in agriculture who are doing pretty well out of it.  They may not be in the majority.  If we believe what we are told by the NFA and the ICMSA the average earnings are something like £300 a year which is £6 a week.  These people need not be worried.  Anybody whose income is not at a certain level does not have to worry about it.  Nobody need talk about defending the agricultural community against any attempt to apply the income tax code to them.  I referred to the evasion of tax, or, as Deputy Byrne prefers, the avoidance of taxation.  I still stick to what I said despite what Deputy de Valera said.  I believe there is evasion and I was going to give examples when I was talking about the agricultural community.</P>
      <P>I am talking now about the evasion of tax within the group liable to taxation. As far as incomes generally are concerned, I think we have to talk about them some time.  I do not think Deputy Booth, Deputy de Valera, or I, or Deputy O.J. Flanagan or Deputy Dillon could avoid talking about incomes generally some time.  There are some farmers who are doing well indeed.  As far as we are concerned, in the application of the aids to which Deputy O.J. Flanagan referred, we are concerned to see much more of this money going to the small farmer and not, as happens, going to the big farmers who do not need it.</P>

      <P>I should like to support my colleague, Deputy T.J. Fitzpatrick of Cavan, in the matters he raised today.  We have to raise the <Col N="493" /> revenue somehow.  I suppose that in the circumstances in which we find ourselves it is not unreasonable to ask the people to pay income tax, to bear their share of the burden.  I give great force to what Deputy Fitzpatrick has said.  I do not want to paint a picture that the Minister for Finance is a savage, out to tear everybody to pieces; nor do I think it is true or just to paint the Revenue Commissioners as a kind of public enemy.  I have been a long time in this troubled world and to any person who ever came to me about his income tax, my advice was: &ldquo;Go down to the tax inspector, if you have nothing to hide.  He is probably the best adviser you can find, that is if you have nothing to hide.  Put you cards on the table and the tax inspector will see that you get every allowance to which you are entitled under the law. If you go down and if you want to put your finger in his eye, you will find he has a very tough eye.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what he is paid for.  Sometimes we are inclined to be carried away by our eloquence in this House and to assail indiscriminately those of the public service who, in fact, are more entitled to our praise than they are to our strictures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not underestimate the Minister's difficulties in dealing with the problems raised by Deputy Fitzpatrick but I think it is universally experienced amongst us all that there are a great number of elderly people in this country who have retired on pensions or who have retired with a modest capital sum which they perhaps realised on the winding up of a little business or something of that kind and, as Deputy Fitzpatrick would say, on our advice. They have, not infrequently, invested that modest capital sum in Government stocks and, mind you, on both sides of the House we have to plead guilty. When the Minister for Finance announces the flotation of a National Loan, it has long been the practice in this House to commend it from all sides of the House, and to recommend people to invest their savings.  I have often quailed in conscience when I <Col N="494" /> think of recommending a National Loan of 3¾ per cent to unfortunate elderly people who have money to invest when I said: &ldquo;Well, the Government want us to put it in a loan.&rdquo; They put it in and they have lost 20 to 25 per cent of their capital.</P>
    <P>This adds strength to the case made by Deputy Fitzpatrick today.  These people have a fixed income.  Being a shopkeeper myself, I have detected in the last six or eight weeks in rural Ireland a collapse in the retail trade. That is due in rural Ireland to a variety of causes&mdash;closing of the banks, the bad price for cattle in the late spring and a variety of matters of that kind.  I walked into a shop recently in Dublin and inquired of the shopkeeper: &ldquo;How is trade with you?&rdquo; He said: &ldquo;It is awful.&rdquo;  I said I was surprised and he said: &ldquo;Oh, well, I do not mean that I did not sell anything; I sold today.&rdquo;  But, he said that the situation is growing in which the customer who comes in to him to buy a pair of braces buys them because he needs a pair of braces, but when he has paid the grocer and the butcher and paid for the children's clothes and everything else, there is no money left to pick up a tie or a canary-coloured waistcoat or anything else the shopkeeper has to sell.</P>
    <P>Those of us who are still engaged in business or trade, or professionally, do not, I think, feel the same pinch as the person who has a fixed income and who cannot supplement it, owing to age or infirmity, from some ancillary source.  There is no doubt whatsoever that as the burden of taxation grows we all feel ourselves getting a bit poorer. We have to do without things we ordinarily would not do without.</P>
    <P>I met today walking on the streets of this city a man who is 70 years of age, a man whom I knew, when he was practising his profession, to be a person in relatively affluent circumstances. When I say affluent, I do not mean rich, but very comfortable.  He stopped me in the street and apologised for his shabby appearance and said: &ldquo;To tell you the truth, I am hard set to keep going on the pension I receive from the State.&rdquo;  He entered the public <Col N="495" /> service at one stage of his professional career.  He ended in the public service and is now on retired pension. I am sure the Minister meets in his own experience a number of people of that kind.  The man who has been in the State service and who belongs to some association which will speak for him has some outlet for his distress and his sense of resentment.  I think he would be astonished at the number of elderly ladies who are living not only in this city but in other towns in Ireland, who had kept up a certain appearance, who had nice curtains on the window, who had kept the hall door painted and who wore a hat going to Mass on Sunday, and if you went behind the curtains in the past, you would find a neat comfortable home, a home which is getting more and more bleak as the value of money changes.</P>
    <P>Is it possible, is it administratively and fiscally possible, to do something to ease the burden of income tax on this category of people?  I admit the Minister will say: &ldquo;You know that really they have personal allowances and there are certain allowances they can claim and they cannot be all that poor.&rdquo;  That is perfectly true.  The argument we are now making is not for the destitute.  We do not want to make the case that we are speaking on behalf of those whose circumstances entitle them to receive a non-contributory old age pension at the maximum level.  We are talking about people who live in modest, comfortable rooms.  I do not think it just arbitrarily to see them reduced in their standard of living to a level which is barely above that of subsistence.  They are entitled to their personal pride, to their sense of independence, to their sense of security.</P>
    <P>Now the Minister is in circumstances at present in which he says: &ldquo;There is not much I can do about the situation; there is not much I can do about the depreciation of capital, and about the cost of living.  I am at present pressed by great forces that are swirling around me and I confess that the value of their incomes, not to speak of capital, has declined as a result of the <Col N="496" /> decline in the value of money.&rdquo;  I confess we were all jointly responsible in advising them to put their money into National Loans at 3¾ and 4 per cent. The Minister may say: &ldquo;I would like to help them if I could but, if I made any attempt to relieve their situation, the cost to the Exchequer would make the addition to the standard rate ineffective for the purpose for which it is required.&rdquo;  I wonder is that true?  Has he had time to examine that question and consider whether fixed income by way of investment income or by way of pension could be relieved, what it would cost, and whether it would be practicable to do so?  If it is, I suggest to the Minister that Deputy Fitzpatrick's proposal is entitled to a very high priority if he is in a position to make any concession at all.</P>

      <P>Deputy Corish has cleared up the fact that our anxiety is to see that income tax is generally applicable and does not appear to be unbalanced in being levied on one section of the community to the exclusion of another section.  It would be a very unfair taxation system which would give that impression to the citizens of the country.  Deputy Corish also pointed out that we believe that while the majority of the farmers may in fact be up against pretty hard economic facts, there is a sizeable section of the farming community in pretty comfortable circumstances and our taxation code appears to approve this situation.</P>

      <P>There is no danger of our Party being described as a Party who would exploit the situation at present existing, or the dissension that exists between people living in the country and in the city, or fan any rivalry between them.  The majority of our Party still come from the rural areas and we are very conscious of the problems of the people living in the rural areas.  At the same time, it is time we came down to the facts of life and brought within our taxation net any farmers who are wealthy <Col N="497" /> enough to contribute their part to the country's economy by way of taxation.</P>
      <P>We cannot expect taxation in the future as in the past to come exclusively from the working and salaried portion of the population.  Since our working force is declining, our industrial working force is increasingly bearing the major portion of increased taxation.  In my opinion we have reached saturation point in looking for more taxation from that section.  I was talking to a man in my own constituency about the £1 increase.  The taxation on that will be roughly 6/-. People have waxed hysterical about the state of the economy not being able to stand this increase of £1, but when tax is taken from it, we are left with the sorry remainder that some people had to go on strike this year to gain.</P>
      <P>If we are to get the co-operation of the working population on the industrial side, we must show them that justice is also being done in regard to the other sections.  Deputy Gallagher raised some interesting points about taxation liability, and take-over bids, and so on.  Deputy Gallagher spoke as a farsighted intelligent business man&mdash; and they are becoming very numerous in the Fianna Fáil Party.  I speak as one more concerned with the employment figures in these industries.  I wonder if Deputy Gallagher considered the situation of the work force in these factories with rationalisation and take-over bids.  The Deputy Gallaghers would have us believe that these companies are solely interested in the many messages from various Ministers to rationalise, and that they are acting solely according to the dictates of the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i>.  I do not say that &ldquo;profit&rdquo; is a dirty word, but there is a sweet smell of profit when employers come together to rationalise and merge.  Many of these mergers take place not with a view to rationalisation but in anticipation of a future trading pattern in which quite sweet retirement gratuities can be paid to private enterprise that is now selling out to foreign enterprise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we talk about income tax, we cannot escape talking about the alarming increase in indirect taxation.  If we <Col N="498" /> must have an increase in taxation, our Party think it should bear as equitably as possible on all people, and in strict justice, it should bear most heavily on those who can best afford to pay it.  If a man by his enterprise, working with Irish material, makes quite an amount of money, the State should extract more from him than from the man who has less money.  At the moment that is not happening to a sufficient degree.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon talks about cigarettes and says quite rightly&mdash;and many other Deputies could echo the sentiment&mdash; that it would not affect him in what way that increase in indirect taxation would fall.  That is quite true.  We must try to get increased revenue from taxation that will bear heaviest on those who can afford that increased taxation.  At the moment a very high proportion of our taxation comes from those indirect sources, from articles everyone is forced to buy.  I will not bring up another bad shadow now, but the turnover tax increased this tendency to extract more money from the things people need most.  The vast majority of the population must buy some of the articles which come under the turnover tax net.  In like manner they cannot escape some of the other things that come under indirect taxation.  That is why our Party would be for direct taxation to be levied on sources that can most easily pay it.</P>
    <P>I should like to see some allowances increased such as allowances for school going children.  They are not one of the more favoured sections. There are many families who cannot afford to send their children to secondary schools.  What type of taxation relief is there in this measure for that type of family?  Have we in mind in appraising the position of those school-going children, solely families with the type of income which most Deputies have?  Are we not being very parochial and closing our eyes probably to the major proportion of families in this country who cannot get benefit from this kind of relief?  I got the impression, when the Minister was presenting this type of allowance, <Col N="499" /> that many of us forgot that this would not apply to that number of families in this country.  That type of taxation allowance could be made far more effective if it was brought in for incomes for people who for the moment have their backs against the wall.</P>
    <P>This Finance Bill does not clear up this matter and does not clear up the tremendous air of discontent which is in the country at the moment.  This afternoon I spoke to some of the people living in my constituency. Those people would not have any fantastic political theories.  The only thing they would wish for in the future is that they would have some relief with regard to the cost of living and also some relief with regard to income tax.  Most of those people felt that if this country continues in the way it is then it will go down the drain in a very rapid fashion.  If this feeling becomes general throughout the country our work in this House will become irrelevant.  Our taxation problem needs to be drastically overhauled.  If the Minister is serious about overhauling it he should consult with all Deputies in this House who come up against many of those problems.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should just like to say a few words in favour of increased earned income relief or personal allowance for the lowest paid workers in this country&mdash;the farm workers.  It is altogether wrong that a single man working on a farm should have to begin paying income tax when he is earning £6 a week.  This has been the position now for many years and there has been no change at all in it.  Here you have a section of the community who are compelled to work longer hours than any other section of the community.  They have to work in all sorts of weather.  This poses a special problem where farm workers are asked to go in and work on Sunday to milk cows.  This job must be done.  In fact, one has almost to compel them to undertake this overtime or extra work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have run up against this problem of getting men to do this work.  I can see their point of view.  You bring in two men to do this extra work on <Col N="500" /> Sunday.  One is a single man and the other is a married man.  Since PAYE came into operation it has become very obvious that the single men do not want to do this extra work.  The figure for the job is a set figure.  The married man gets that sum of money entirely into his hands.  The single man gets 9s or 10s less.  He will ask: &ldquo;Why should I do this objectionable work on Sunday to earn 9s or 10s for the Revenue Commissioners?&rdquo;  As a result of this those men refuse to do the job. There is a great case for raising this £6 to something a good deal higher, say, £8 or £9 before income tax operates at all.  In the case of workers who are compelled to do overtime&mdash;because of the nature of their job this overtime must be done&mdash;there should be some special consideration given for that category of people.</P>
    <P>There is another case which we have made from this side of the House on many occasions and that is the case of the family who are unfortunate enough to have a mentally retarded child and this child has to be paid for in an institution.  This child may have the normal expectancy of life.  This is a very great burden that must be borne by families during their lifetime.  There are other classes of sickness and illness which are entirely paid for by the State.  This is not one of them.  This is an exceptional case and an unfortunate one.  Surely it is not too much to expect that there should be some sort of relief for the unfortunate man who has such a child?</P>
    <P>We have put in amendments during the past two or three years asking that this relief would be granted.  I got the impression last year that the Minister was inclined to meet this exceptional case.  He said he could not do it then but he would consider it again.  I hope, since the Minister has got considerable time now to have regard to the burden this places on families, he will see his way, on this occasion, to do something for this unfortunate type of family.</P>

      <P>I have a few remarks to make on this matter.  We must remember that any relief given must be given at the expense of someone else, just as any increase in wages or salaries must also be <Col N="501" /> given at the expense of someone else.  When I heard Deputies talking about farmers' taxation, I had to laugh because when you boil those matters down, you come to the fact that the ordinary tillage farmers 12 months ago had to go on strike&mdash;they went on strike last November 12 months&mdash;on account of the refusal of a State subsidised body to pay them a definite £7 16s a week for their labour on a 50 hour week.  The reason for it was that the Government were not prepared to put what would be considered by some Labour gentlemen as an extra burden on them, that is, an extra penny per pound on the sugar. Therefore, these people had to accept £7 16s for their labour.  I do not know what income tax Deputy O'Leary would put on that.</P>
      <P>Today 3d per pound has been put on butter because the dairy farmers had to come up here and demonstrate against their conditions.</P>

There should be a definite halt put on that type of salary until those lower sections of the community are brought up to something like a living wage.  I am sure even Deputy O'Leary will admit that £7 16s a week for an agricultural worker is not adequate.</P>

There <Col N="502" /> are anomalies in the income tax code that need to be remedied.  Two years ago I gave an instance, and I do not think it has been remedied since.  It was the case of a farmer, an old bachelor, as many of them are.  He and two sisters brought in a nephew and gave him the farm, holding two rooms for themselves in the house.  In due course the nephew got married and reared a family of six.  When the last of the three old people died, though transfer charges were paid when the holding was handed over to the nephew, the Revenue Commissioners came in and demanded death duties on the whole lot.  When I raised that matter here, the then Minister for Finance promised it would be remedied. I do not believe it has been. These are things I should like to see the Minister deal with.  I must admit I have not found any cases since.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately, there are these anomalies.  We all know what the general position is in regard to agriculture. It has been happening for generations.  The eldest son gets the farm and the rest work more or less as unpaid labourers.  That kept the price of food low in this country until people got so civilised that they would not eat spuds and cabbage any more. Now they want the imported stuff. When the eldest son reached the age of 45, the old lad said: &ldquo;We will get the young fellow married&rdquo;.  There were a couple more sons and daughters in the home and the whole lot came down on the eldest son.  When the old man died, if it were within five years of the handing over of the farm, the death duty gentlemen came in and <Col N="503" /> charged tax, though the son had paid the transfer charges on the holding. These things are unjust on the ordinary farmer and the Minister should deal with them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support Deputies who have pointed to the total inadequacy of the allowances for income tax in operation today.  Despite the colossal increase in the cost of living in recent years, it is a matter of dismay and wonder to the working classes that more adequate allowances have not been conceded.  If the Minister cannot be prevailed on to see the moral justice of this matter, surely the economic circumstances with which we have to contend, the hard facts, are sufficient justification for giving to the working classes of the country a better deal under the PAYE system?</P>
      <P>The burden of income tax on the ordinary working classes is becoming such an imposition that it is now recognised very largely as a disincentive. Production is suffering as a result of the inadequacy of these allowances. Imagine a worker being obliged to pay income tax on £6 a week.  I know it to be a fact that the lowest-paid workers in this country, farmworkers, road-workers, forestry workers, all men who happen to be single particularly, are obliged to pay income tax out of a meagre wage of £8 to £9 per week. There are no allowances in respect of the provision of domestic help, for instance.</P>
      <P>There are cases to my knowledge where men live alone who have to travel long distances, put in an arduous day's work in the forests, on the roads or on the farms and who must engage domestic help to cook and wash.  Yet our income tax code does not provide any allowance for such a situation, unless the care of children is involved. We know how extremely difficult it can be to get a dependent relative allowance in respect of the maintenance of an invalid unless one can get appropriate medical certificates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By and large, common justice demands that income tax reliefs under PAYE be increased out of all proportion. <Col N="504" /> PAYE is a good system inas-much as it revealed clearly to working class people how they stood.  It got rid of a system under which they were assessed at the end of the year for sizeable amounts and there was always deep anxiety at the end of the period and grave hardship sometimes in the matter of meeting the income tax demands.  It was a good thing that the worker should know from week to week what he was liable for but, having made him liable for a certain amount in the £ and a certain amount per dependent relative a number of years ago, surely&mdash;in equity, in justice and in fairness&mdash;those allowances should be reviewed in accordance with the rise in the cost of living?</P>
    <P>I do want to bring it home to the Minister that it is becoming a colossal disincentive to the lowly-paid workers in particular.  Mind you, with many of them, the most productive of our people in employment in this country &mdash;industrial workers, farm workers, forestry workers and the like&mdash;it is reaching a stage when they now feel they do not wish to do overtime.  They have no anxiety to work harder, especially in those jobs where task work is involved.  It is desirable, if one is to get the best out of any employee, that there should be an incentive.  Most of our employers and our State bodies do have incentives of a bonus of some kind or another for task work to be performed, for which some extra moneys are earned.  It is now becoming quite patent to those of us who are close to the working classes and the trade union movement that the incentive to work that bit harder is going because of the inadequacy of the income tax concessions and the unwillingness of workers to give large slices of these additional earnings to the Revenue Commissioners.  This is a matter to which the Minister must have regard.</P>
    <P>When workers become unemployed, it is extremely difficult to get a refund from the income tax authorities.  One must be unemployed for quite a considerable length of time and there is a lot of red tape and documentary signing involved before one gets a rebate of any kind.  The Minister <Col N="505" /> should devise a speedier method of repayment in this regard.</P>
    <P>Many of the things I want to say on this Budget I propose to leave to the General Resolution but I want to join with all those who have spoken here this evening and appealed for a better deal for our people in relation to income tax.  The Labour Party has made known its views on this subject in recent years, and particularly in recent months.  We did take steps by way of a positive motion in this House prior to the first Budget of this year. It did not reach deliberation stage in this House but it was designed to try to extract from the Minister some concessions in this Budget for all those of us who pay income tax.  We subscribed to all these various amendments which brought additional reliefs: for the provision of medicines, for the maintenance of sick persons in the household and for the provision of domestic help.  I appreciate that we are seeking these reliefs at a time when the Government find themselves in a great dilemma.  We have an economic and financial recession and perhaps it is a bit too much to expect reliefs of this kind at the present time.</P>
    <P>The first Budget of this year was one in which everything was taken and nothing given to our people.  It was a &ldquo;grasp-all&rdquo; Budget.  I can well understand the predicament in which this Government find themselves in grasping for money, irrespective of the hardship it imposes on the categories of people concerned.  It is an indiscriminate grasp for £sd, left, right and centre.  There is no element of social justice or Christianity involved in this Budget.  The only concession was a very meagre one to social welfare beneficiaries&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Deputy will keep to the income tax code which we are discussing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and nothing whatsoever for any other category of persons. This is then, perhaps, an appeal which will fall upon deaf ears: an appeal for a better deal in respect of income tax.  As far as this Party are concerned, I would not wish this House <Col N="506" /> or the country to think that we were taking sides in respect of this issue on income tax in respect of the different classes in our society, be they workers, employers or farmers, but we do stand on the fundamental principle that, in respect of the imposition of tax of any kind, it should be seen to be fair, just and impartial and that it should fall on the shoulders and backs of those best able to bear it and, particularly, that justice in this matter should be seen clearly to be done.</P>
      <P>My plea is in respect of the ordinary working classes who are virtually scourged by income tax at the present time.  The Minister, in strict justice, must review this position and must consider better dependants' allowances in conformity with rising costs and the depreciation in the value of money.  He must see to it that those people who are dependent on a fixed income&mdash;who have been adverted to this evening by many spokesmen&mdash;should also get reliefs.  This is nothing less than plain justice.  I sincerely hope, despite the plight which the country is in at the present time, that something will be done in this regard.</P>
      <P>If the Minister wants to rejuvenate the working classes and gear them to the productivity we all desire, if he wants to accelerate industrial and agricultural growth in our community, the best thing he can do is to make it clear to the working classes that he is being fair with them in respect of their real earnings and does not extract from them an unfair amount in direct taxation of this kind.  God knows, with the imposition of the turnover tax, the five per cent addition which we have had today and the extremely high cost of living, there is a good and compelling case to be made for further income tax reliefs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Lastly, if the Minister will have regard to the reports of the committees which sat on this subject, he will realise it was intended that, in accordance with the rise in the cost of living and the fall in the value of money, the allowances which have been untouched for so many years should be increased proportionately.  Perhaps the Minister will be able to give us some glimmer <Col N="507" /> of hope that this flagrant injustice in respect of the ordinary working class people of our country, in our income tax code, will be rectified at the earliest opportunity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>On 8th June I addressed two questions to the Minister for Health in relation to the inadequacy of the health services provided in the Schull district of Cork to two persons there.  The Minister, in his reply, refuted my allegations in both instances and as a result, and in view of the unsatisfactory nature of the Minister's statement, I asked permission of the Chair to raise the subject matter of both questions on the Adjournment.  You will recall, Sir, that today you ruled this out and would allow only the subject matter of the first question, that is, Question No. 28 on the Order Paper of Wednesday, 8th June last, to be raised.</P>
      <P>I have been a Member of this House for some 15 years and this is the first occasion I have had to impose on your time and on the time of the House to raise a matter such as that which I am raising tonight.  It is with deep regret that I impose on your time and on the time of the House but I regard the principle involved as being so great that there is no alternative open to me if I am to discharge my duty conscientiously and faithfully as a public representative in this House for the constituency of South-West Cork.</P>
      <P>In regard to the subject matter of Question No. 28, the facts are simple and incontrovertible.  The position is that a holder of a medical card, a woman of some 75 years, on 23rd January last, suffered a stroke.  It was the first time in a number of years that she had become ill and the first time she had to impose on the health authority or any officer associated with it in any way.  The doctor was summoned and gave, I am sure, whatever assistance was necessary and informed the relatives that the first bed that would be available in the local hospital would be given to her.  I may say at this stage that this woman lived within two miles of the local hospital and, while I do not want to go into the matter in detail, I must say that the conditions were not such as would warrant treatment at home.  The woman resided in a relatively small house with an elderly brother and sister who themselves suffer from rather indifferent health and consequently were unable to give her the care that she needed.</P>
      <P>Time moved on and, from 23rd January, with the exception of a visit of about one half-hour daily from the local nurse, who, I am sure, gave her every assistance she could, and within that short time visited her daily, the relatives were left to maintain the patient for the remainder of the time.</P>
      <P>I came into the picture on 31st January when her brother called on me to request my help in getting accommodation for his sister in the local hospital as her condition was deteriorating and it was so difficult for him to manage her at home.  The Minister and the House will appreciate that this is a request often made to public representatives.  Usually, when the request is made to public representatives, they have little or no difficulty in dealing with it because in nine cases out of ten, the help and co-operation we all expect is readily forthcoming and, because of that, we can deal with these matters locally and without making any fuss of any kind.  Unfortunately, such was not my experience in this particular instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="511" /> In accordance with the request of this woman's brother, I thought the best thing to do was to phone the medical officer of the local hospital with a view to getting bed accommodation for her, if possible, in that hospital.  Now my calls on doctors are rather infrequent but, having phoned this doctor, for reasons best known to himself, he did not propose to discuss the matter with me but he let it be known, through whatever assistant he had who answered the phone, that the first bed available in Schull hospital would be given to this woman.  On that particular day I happened to visit Schull hospital myself.  I am not trying to usurp the functions of any medical officer and I am not trying to give to the House the impression that I have any medical knowledge of any kind whatsoever but, from my own observations and because of the fact that a patient had died in the hospital that day&mdash;her remains were removed to the local church&mdash;I knew that accommodation was definitely available in Schull hospital.</P>
    <P>During that week, I was away from home for three or four days.  On my return, I was more than surprised to find that no hospital accommodation had been provided for this person.  I was quite positive she would have been accommodated.  Had a similar position obtained in any other hospital in West Cork, accommodation would have been provided without difficulty.  Schull hospital was not taxed to its capacity and should have had no difficulty in providing hospital beds for pateints.  In Skibbereen, extra beds were provided without any difficulty in order to meet increased demands for accommodation. But no extra beds were provided in Schull hospital.  For some peculiar reason no extra beds would be provided even if an emergency arose.</P>
    <P>I am particularly interested in ensuring that Schull hospital will give the best service possible because in the not too distant past the Minister's predecessor felt there was no necessity for continuing the hospital.  When I raised the matter here on the Adjournment, the Minister said: &ldquo;Do not talk about the hospital.  We know the hospital <Col N="512" /> has 17 beds.  Most of them are occupied, not by acute cases, as the Deputy knows very well.  I have the latest figures, but the excuse for keeping it open in 1961 was that it could be used as a maternity hospital.  The number of deliveries there in 1959 was 11 and in 1960 it was four.  The remainder of the beds are occupied by elderly people so that it is more a county home than a hospital.&rdquo;  The Minister's predecessor stated that the hospital in Schull was used to a big extent for the accommodation of elderly patients or the chronically ill.</P>
    <P>Having heard this woman was in a critical condition, and knowing she could not be removed to hospital, I raised the matter with the health authority at our local district meeting. Subsequently the health authority got a report, a rather peculiar report, in my opinion.  The authority said in that report that there was no specific medical treatment for her condition. That was No. 1.  Secondly, it was said that her condition took the prescribed course.  I assume that, if her condition took the prescribed course, the diagnosis was that this poor old woman&mdash; God be good to her&mdash;was not going to live very long.  Her health was steadily declining and her life was coming to an end.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons why I raise this matter here is to ask if our health services are such that a medical card holder, visited by a medical officer who diagnoses that there is no active medical treatment for such a patient, that she is coming to the end of her life and likely to die within a relatively short period, must not be accommodated in hospital.  If that is the correct position, if it is the attitude of the Department that sending a nurse to a house for half an hour a day, particularly in the family conditions in this case, constitutes adequate medical treatment, then it is about time we changed the regulations.  The treatment meted out to this woman and the service provided were more appropriate, in my opinion, to the 19th century than to the 20th century.</P>
    <P>After 16 days, on 8th February, this <Col N="513" /> poor woman passed away and raising the matter here now is not of much advantage in this particular case.  Despite the rather arrogant attitude of the Minister, when I raised this question on Wednesday last, the matter might have been cleared up with a few supplementaries, had the Minister's attitude been different.  I have no personal animosity against anyone involved in this case.  I raised the matter because I regard it as my bounden duty to do so and, as a member of this House and of a local health authority, I want to ensure that no other person will be treated in the way in which this old woman was treated.  Our Constitution says we must cherish all our citizens equally.  I maintain it did not apply in this case.  She did not get the treatment to which she was certainly entitled. It was unfair and unjust&mdash;to use two mild adjectives&mdash;to leave this woman to be cared for by an elderly brother and sister, both in indifferent health.</P>
    <P>We had some peculiar statements from the health authority.  The main one was that, seeing there was no specific medical treatment, there was no need to bring her to hospital; in other words, leave her at home.  In regard to the case of this woman who suffered from a stroke, the time at my disposal would not allow me to read in full this lengthy statement, but I wish to quote as follows:</P>
    <P>It seems clear to me that she should have been admitted to the institution if accommodation had been available, even though I make due allowances for the fact that she would not have been under active medical treatment and that there was no specific medical treatment for her condition.  Nevertheless I accept, with her social conditions and the stage of her illness combined, admission to the institution was necessary.</P>
    <P>Therefore, no matter from what aspect this case is examined, there is no doubt that this woman, who was depending on a medical card for health services, did not get the treatment to which she was entitled.  Schull hospital is not yet <Col N="514" /> 30 years old, and when it was opened, as the speeches made at the opening ceremony tell us, it was supposed to be a boon to the people in the Schull district.  No longer would they, except in the case of acute ailments, have to travel distances to find accommodation in other hospitals.  In this rather sparsely populated district, the Mizen Head peninsula, this hospital would meet the full requirements of the people.  That is what it should do, but this woman who, for the first time in her life, at the age of 75, required hospitalisation in that hospital which was within two miles distance of her small home, was unable to get it.</P>
    <P>Surely that should not happen in 1966.  I had hoped that when the Minister would have got the facts of this case he would have investigated it, as I believe it was mandatory on him to do.  The Minister is the person in control of our health services.  By virtue of his position he is responsible for the proper treatment of and facilities for the people, particularly medical card holders.  He is the final tribunal for such people who appeal for assistance. However, the Minister dismissed this case lightly on Wednesday last.  He stated that adequate treatment was provided, that there was no neglect on the part of any officer associated with it.  If that is so, it is peculiar that we are spending so many millions of pounds in this country on health services. If we treated other people as this woman was treated, our health bill in Cork would not be £5 million annually to meet the requirements of the health services; the State bill would not be several millions of pounds annually to meet our requirements, and the Department of Health would not have to come to the rescue of the local ratepayers as they were obliged to do this year in order to meet the added cost of these services.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, it is with the greatest reluctance that I raise a question such as this in the House, but I do so to ensure that no other such case will occur, and to bring home to the Minister responsible for our health services that such a position did obtain and that it is his bounden duty, during whatever time he is Minister for <Col N="515" /> Health, to see that this will not happen again.</P>
    <P>I could touch on certain other aspects of this matter but the time at my disposal does not allow me to do so.  Let me say, however, that the Minister for Health should take a more active interest in what is happening up and down the country.  He is the man in charge of health authorities and in charge of every person who is administering the health services.  As a public representative, I have always given credit where credit was due to our health officers, be they professional or lay officers, for the capable discharge of their duties.  I have never cared to make personal statements such as calling them &ldquo;pigs&rdquo; as has been done in regard to such professional people.</P>

      <P>Deputy Murphy has pursued this matter not only through three meetings of the Western Committee of the Cork Health Authority but at Question Time here and now on the debate on the Adjournment.  I would not dream of questioning his right to do this. Indeed, if it was a question of neglect of the sick or some serious inadequacy in our health services I would agree that it was his duty and I would commend him for it.  The broad facts of the case, which are not in dispute, show there is nothing of the kind at issue, and one must only wonder what the Deputy's motives are in this campaign of detraction directed against the service for which he and his colleagues in the Cork Health Authority are responsible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The facts are that this lady, aged <Col N="516" /> 75 years, living with relatives, suffered a stroke on the 23rd of January, of this year, and she was attended by the district medical officer who was also medical officer of the local district hospital.  The relatives initially requested the admission of the lady to the district hospital.  This was not possible at the time because there was no vacant bed in the hospital.</P>

      <P>I have challenged the Deputy, and in looking at this, I have I hope as much interest as the Deputy has in such type of case.  My information is that some days before the lady's death the relatives contacted the doctor to withdraw the request for the admission of the patient to hospital.  The Deputy says this is not so.  If he will give me an affidavit from the relatives, I will immediately take the necessary steps to see that an inspector of my Department will hold a sworn inquiry. As a matter of fact, I am tempted to hold one anyway, very tempted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The only complicating factor in this case is that a vacancy arose in the hospital.  I am trying to be as dispassionate as possible.  The complicating factor is that on 31st January a vacancy did arise This was allotted to another patient judged to be in more acute need of hospital treatment.  She was a young lady with a heart blockage. This was a matter of medical decision and it was made in the full knowledge of the circumstances of the two patients at the time.  Unlike the Deputy, I would not be so foolhardy as to question a judgment made by a competent and experienced medical officer in such a situation.  Indeed, this tendency of the Deputy to assume the role of supernumerary medical officer seems to be the whole crux of the matter.</P>

      <P>Section 28 of the Public Health (Ireland) Act, 1878, is in force in relation to all urban sanitary authorities.  The section does not specifically apply to rural sanitary authorities, but it may be applied to any <Col N="373" /> rural sanitary authority by order under section 1 of the Public Health (Ireland) Act, 1896.  No such order has been made.  Likewise no general order has been made under section 33 of the Local Government (Ireland) Act, 1898, applying section 28 to all rural sanitary authorities.</P>
      <P>Section 19 of the Public Health Acts Amendment Act, 1907, is in force in every sanitary district both urban and rural.</P>
