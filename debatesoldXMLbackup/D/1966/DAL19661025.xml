      <P>No further talks with Ministers have been arranged before the close of the year.  Following my meeting with the Prime Minister of the Six Counties on the 14th January, 1965, contacts with Ministers and officials from the North in the solution of practical mutual problems of public concern have become well-established practice, and meetings will, it is hoped, continue to take place as and when the need arises.</P>

      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether the Stormont Premier's recent request based on the Government of Ireland Act, 1949, was among the matters discussed at the meetings between him and the Premier; and whether he contemplates taking any action in relation to the request.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if his attention has been drawn to the speech made by Captain Terence O'Neill at Ballycastle on 19th October; and if he will make a statement on it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1816" /> I have seen newspaper accounts of the speech mentioned.</P>
    <P>I stated in the Dáil on 10th February, 1965, that no political or constitutional topics were touched upon at my meetings with Captain O'Neill either in Belfast or in Dublin.</P>
    <P>As I have indicated on many occasions, I am convinced that practical co-operation between the two areas into which Ireland is now divided can take place without sacrifice of principle, and it was in this spirit that my meetings with Captain O'Neill were held.</P>
    <P>We do not recognise that the partition of the country is a just or durable arrangement and could, therefore, not consider any constitutional change or other step which would imply an abandonment of that position.  Our hope is to bring about a situation in which the essential unity of the Irish people will be restored and expressed in the country's institutions.  Meanwhile, we must work towards the maximum possible measure of co-operation in practical matters of public concern without sacrifice of principle.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach admit to a feeling of surprise that the Stormont Premier should raise this matter, if as he says himself, this matter was not raised in discussions with himself and the Stormont Premier?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power if he is aware that a case has arisen where a man who had been declared redundant by CIE some time ago and was in receipt of redundancy payments has had these payments stopped on account of the fact that the British and Irish Steam Packet Company, by whom he is now employed, has become a State company; and if he will take steps to ensure that in such cases the redundancy payments which were payable to persons employed by a non-State company will continue if the State takes over the employing company.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Lynch) (for the Minister for Transport and Power)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Transport Act, 1958 provides that where a person who is in receipt of annual sum redundancy compensation under the Transport Acts becomes employed in a State or semi-State body or local authority, his redundancy compensation shall be abated by the amount (if any) by which the compensation plus his remuneration from the new employment exceeds his remuneration from CIE at the time his services were dispensed with.</P>
      <P>Redundancy compensation is payable in respect of loss of employment and is not a superannuation pension. The Government would have proposed the extension of the provision for abatement contained in legislation to private as well as public employment were that course practicable.</P>
      <P>It would be entirely anomalous if an employee in public employment should also be paid compensation at the expense of the Exchequer for loss of other public employment.</P>
      <P>I do not, therefore, propose to introduce amending legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware that, despite his assurances that the new wholesale tax would not be payable on clothing, all clothing under tariff reference 60/05 A2 is subject to wholesale tax on import; and that all piece goods and yarns for the manufacture of clothing are also subject to wholesale tax on import; and if he will take steps to have the wholesale tax removed from this type of goods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It was and is the intention to relieve from wholesale tax on import all goods such as clothing, and yarns and piece goods normally used for making clothing, which are exempt from wholesale tax where sold within the State.  Initially, it was hoped that the import exemptions could be expressed in ordinary tariff terms to conform with the internationally recognised form of Tariff Classification known as the Brussels Tariff and to <Col N="1822" /> deal with any exceptions which did not fit into this form by means of special authorisation to individual importers. Importers were advised in two notices issued to the public viz. the &ldquo;Guide to Wholesale Tax&rdquo; and Customs Public Notice No. 1041 to apply, where necessary, to the Revenue Commissioners (Wholesale Tax Branch) for an authorisation to import free of tax. However, the experience of the first few weeks of the tax as it applies to imports has shown that the number of exceptions is too great to permit of continued adherence to the standard form of Tariff Classification for Wholesale Tax exemption and steps have already been taken to grant complete freedom from wholesale tax on import of all such exempt goods irrespective of formal Tariff Classification. A public notice to this effect was issued by the Revenue Commissioners on the 14th of this month.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether loans received from the International Monetary Fund have been conditional on the Government's giving certain guarantees regarding the conduct of their financial and budgetary policy; and whether broad agreement was reached between the Government and the International Monetary Fund on the measures proper to solving Ireland's balance of payments difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The drawing made on the International Monetary Fund was not conditional on any guarantees by the Government regarding the conduct of its financial and budgetary policy. The obligations assumed by the Government were no more than in the case of any member making a drawing from the Fund.  These obligations relate to the repurchase which should be made at the outside within a period of from three to five years.  In my reply to a question on 9th February, 1966, I gave information about the Fund's charges which operate in connection with the drawing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the application was made in January this year for the drawing from the Fund, the Government outlined the <Col N="1823" /> circumstances which led to the deterioration in the balance of payments in 1965 and the measures which were taken to strengthen the domestic situation and redress the balance of payments. It may be inferred from the Fund's approval to the drawing that it was in broad agreement with the Government's policy.</P>
    <P>In particular, I would like to make it clear that there was no condition expressed in regard to the foreign exchange facility for travel or any other exchange control matter.  I should also recall that on 8th August, 1957, this country subscribed to the Fund's Articles of Agreement which are scheduled in the Bretton Woods Agreements Act, 1957.  This involved an obligation under Article VIII not to impose, without the approval of the Fund, restrictions on the making of payments for current international transactions including travel.  In the case of Ireland this obligation became operative on 15th February, 1961.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I was tempted to raise this question last week when we had a debate on the Estimate.  The question did arise about whether, in fact, we would follow the British Government's restrictions on the amount of sterling that could be used by travellers going outside the sterling area during the present crisis in Britain.  The Minister did usefully say to us on that occasion that, in fact, on the loan we had secured from the International Monetary Fund, they would not agree with our restricting the amount to be spent by our travellers outside the sterling area. That tempted me today to ask whether there were some guide lines laid down by the International Monetary Fund on receipt of this loan.  That was the reason I put down&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that it can frequently take from eight to 12 weeks for the High Court accountancy office to pay out money which is lodged in court?  The effect of this is to create certain doubts in the mind of litigants not only with regard to the efficiency of court offices but also with regard to the efficiency of members of the legal profession&mdash; indeed, to raise doubt not only as to their efficiency but also their integrity. Is the Minister also aware that in some offices a number of people are exclusively occupied in trying to trace lost files and documents?

      <P>The Garda have always regarded it as their duty to facilitate members of both Houses of the Oireachtas on their way to and from Leinster House and I do not think that any instructions are called for.

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The erection of barriers was a natural consequence of the prohibition on meetings or processions in the vicinity of Leinster House on the day in question.  The gardaí were concerned to ensure that no persons got past the barriers with the object of holding a meeting or forming a procession and they quite properly required persons who sough to pass through to produce satisfactory evidence they were <i>bona fide.</i></P>

      <P>I am aware that delay is experienced by persons covered by medical cards in obtaining surgical and medical equipment through Dublin Health Authority, and in August last I asked the authority to examine their administrative procedures for dealing with such cases in order to minimise delay.  This examination is proceeding.</P>
      <P>In a number of cases, however, delay is unavoidable; for example, the patient may delay in contacting the suppliers for measurement; the advice of the patient's doctor may have to be sought on the application or the equipment required may not be readily available.</P>
      <P>I do not accept the statement in the Deputy's question that persons paying privately for similar equipment are able to get it without delay.  My information is that generally suppliers do not give precedence to orders from private patients and that, while they are not subject to the inevitable time lag involved in examination of their application by the health authority, such patients may have in some cases to wait for quite lengthy periods for certain appliances.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 4, to delete lines 39 to 52 and to substitute:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(d) in case the land is a tenement, within the meaning of the Act of 1931, a person who, or whose predecessors in title, has or have been continuously in occupation of the land as yearly tenants during the whole of the period of twenty-five years next preceding the date of the service by the person of a notice under section 4 of this Act in relation to the land at a yearly rent of an amount that, at the date of the service of the notice aforesaid, is less than the amount of the rateable valuation of the land at that date.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1848" /> The object of this amendment is to meet the case made during the Committee Stage debate.  It is a case which, on consideration, I regard as having some validity.  It is to extend the category of yearly tenants who can benefit from the right of purchase provisions in the Bill.  As the Bill stands at the moment, this right is confined to yearly tenants or their predecessors in title who have been in occupation for at least 50 years at a rent which does not exceed three-quarters of the rateable valuation.  In addition, there is a prohibition against any sale taking place in that period.  In the proposed amendment, we abolish the restriction in regard to a sale having taken place and furthermore we reduce the 50-year period to 25 years, and raise the valuation from threequarters to the full valuation.  This widens the scope of the Bill considerably, extends it further in favour of yearly tenants.  In other words, the practical effect is that any yearly tenant who is in possession, whether through predecessors in title or by virtue of a sale, if he or she is in possession for 25 years and the rent does not exceed the valuation, comes within the provisions of the Bill.  I think this is a welcome extension and meets the wishes expressed by Deputies on both sides of the House.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 4, between lines 52 and 53, to insert a new paragraph as follows :&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(e) a person who is in actual possession of land under any lease or sublease made for a term of not less than ninety-nine years at least twenty-five years of which term remains unexpired provided such lease or sublease is not now subject to a rack rent or that the <Col N="1849" /> rent has been redeemed whether or not such lease is a building lease or a proprietary lease.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister will recall that during the Committee Stage discussion, I, and I think other Deputies, raised particular cases which are in danger of being excluded, some accidentally, from this measure.  The cases I have in mind are cases where the occupier is not in a position to prove that his lease is either a building lease or a proprietary lease and consequently is not able, so far as proof is concerned, to come within the ambit of the Bill.  I also mentioned during the Committee Stage discussion other cases where, for example, the rent has been redeemed or where there is no rent in fact at all attaching to premises and where there is no pecuniary interest vested in the landlords possibly for as long as 50 or 60 or 70 years to come.  I suggested to the Minister that it was anomalous in such cases that the occupying tenant, who, one might say, is the owner because in some of the cases I have in mind the question of covenants does not enter into it largely at all, should be put in a less advantageous position than a building lessee or a proprietary lessee who might in addition to being subject to ground rent, be also subject to fairly severe restrictive covenants.</P>
    <P>Probably the Minister will not mind my saying that I took the opportunity of discussing this amendment with him and I understand there might be opposition to accepting an amendment in this form which refers to rack rent.  I am not in any way wedded to this particular wording of the amendment.  It is probably true that the Minister, Deputy Ryan, I and other lawyers in the House know what we mean when we talk about rack rent but a person who has not some legal training may be misled by the term.  What I am trying to do, if the Minister will agree, is to allow it into the provisions of the Bill where it is clear that there is not a profit rent of some marketable dimensions coming out of the property.</P>
    <P>I suggest that where there is no rent <Col N="1850" /> at all, where it has been redeemed, there is a clear case for allowing the occupier to cover it.  Cases of doubt may arise when people are not sure and are not in a position to prove that they hold under building or proprietary leases, but where the rent payable would leave one to suppose that a ground rent was intended, I am perfectly prepared to adopt the same line of approach as has been adopted by the Minister in the amendment he has moved&mdash;to relate the amount of the rent to the rateable valuation of the premises or even to relate it to a proportion of the rateable valuation, if that would fit into the scope of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I strongly urge the Minister to accept the amendment either in its present form or as further amended, if that can be done.  I have no doubt that the Minister has had approaches made to him regarding the type of cases I have been talking about.  The framework of the Bill is to deal with lands and with the rents which are paid on the ground, and it is for that reason only that I drafted the amendment in this form.  I wish to make it clear that I am thinking in terms of cases where buildings have been erected and where people who are the occupying tenants at the moment are not in a position to show that their leases are building or proprietary leases.  I urge the Minister very strongly to accept this.  If he does not like the expression &ldquo;not now subject to a rack rent&rdquo;, I am prepared to amend it to state &ldquo;a rent which is less than the rateable valuation of the land&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I should like again to emphasise that the whole question of leases outside those in the category of building or proprietary leases, is under examination by the Landlord and Tenant Commission.  I have directed their attention precisely to the line of country covered by Deputy O'Higgins.  The question of giving a right to purchase to these lesses is one I have requested the Commission to examine as a matter of urgency and I expect them to report shortly.  I can see certain merits in the point of view <Col N="1851" /> expressed by Deputy O'Higgins, though I cannot go the whole way with him on the amendment.  There is a much broader field to be covered and it is under consideration by the Commission. However, I will consider going some way to meet his point of view by moving an amendment in the Seanad covering lessees as well as yearly tenants so that lessees will have the same right as yearly tenants have under the provision I moved in the previous amendment.</P>

At the moment, the Commissioners of Irish Lights may grant leases of some land which formerly has been used for the purpose of erecting lighthouses and the provision of assistance to shipping around our shores.  The Commissioners can give leases of such lands because, with modern development, there does not appear to be a need to use the land for that purpose.  All of these leases contain a covenant that if the land should ever be required by the Commissioners for the protection of shipping around our shores, the land would be ceded by the leases back to the Commissioners.

      <P>These amendments are designed to meet a point made by Deputy O'Higgins on Committee Stage.  They cover the case where a building lease or a proprietary lease expires within five years before the commencement of the Act.  The amendments give the lessee a right to acquire the fee simple for a period of 12 months after the commencement of the Act.  That is in amendment No. 13 and meets a practical point.  Amendment No. 24 cures a defect in the 1958 Act by making it necessary for the landlord to serve notice of termination not earlier than three months before the lease expires.  Deputy O'Higgins brought this to my notice on Committee Stage.  At the moment the landlord may serve this notice up to 15 years before the lease expires.  This amendments makes it necessary for him to serve it no more than three months before the lease expires.  Amendment No. 24 is consequent on amendment No. 7.</P>

      <P>The effect of these <Col N="1856" /> amendments is to insert a new paragraph in section 18 of the Bill, which contains the provisions in relation to determining the purchase price of the fee simple.  It covers the case where one of the superior landlords who is obliged to extinguish a rent or charge in order to give the leaseholder the full fee simple is himself required by statute to extinguish that rent or charge on particular terms.  In such a case, it is reasonable that allowance be made for that fact in determining the purchase price.</P>

      <P>The object of this amendment is to exclude from the automatic maximum price premises used for the purpose of business.  I am satisfied from fairly detailed investigation into this matter that considerations apply to business premises which are very varied.  They differ in regard to location, in regard to goodwill and so on, and it would be unfair to apply to business premises the maximum criterion which will be applied to residences.  In the case of business premises where there are these variable considerations it is much better to allow the arbitrator to decide having regard to the circumstances of each case as it appears to him.  I was in favour of the more fixed system but on full reconsideration I think it is better to allow business premises to be considered on the merits of the case.</P>

When I read this provision originally in the Bill, I took it for granted it was intended to apply only to the private residence type of case.  I did not appreciate it was intended at any time, either deliberately or accidentally, to cover business premises.  I think the Minister's approach to this amendment is the right one.  There will be a whole lot of considerations which would be special to business premises, and I do agree that in those circumstances it is better to leave such matters open to arbitration, in default of agreement, rather than try to fit them into this section dealing with a fixed maximum. As I say, I thought that was the position.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>In subparagraph (ii) to delete all words from and including &ldquo;or a lease&rdquo; down to and including &ldquo;to the land&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I was not aware the Minister had put down an amendment to the section, and that is the reason why it appears as an amendment to an amendment. My purpose in putting down this amendment can best be clarified by my reference to a communication which I have had from a constituent who feels he is very much affected by this Bill and who feels he is aggrieved by its present form.  In the course of a letter, he states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>...My lease has four years to run.  Accordingly the protection afforded to tenants by the Bill that the purchase price to by out the ground rent cannot exceed a certain number of years purchase of the present ground rent does not apply to me&mdash;because my lease has less than 25 years to run.  I will first have to negotiate a new ground rent which will be the determining factor. The landlord who will be aware that I am getting out will as I see it be out to exact the fullest pound of flesh and accordingly I see a worsening <Col N="1858" /> of conditions for the small group to which I belong.  In other words if this Bill never came along the landlord would likely be far more lenient in four years time than now. My present ground rent is £11 15s which they would hardly have stepped up to more than £14 even though they might legally have gone as high as £30.  They will, I am afraid, exact the full legal right henceforth.</P>
    <P>By &ldquo;they&rdquo; I presume he means the landlord.  I have put down my amendment in order to try to meet this man's position and the position of those like him, who, I am inclined to agree with him, are probably relatively few, but none the less very important.  The law must be made applicable justly to all citizens, in so far as that is humanly possible, regardless of whether they are numerically in the majority or in a minority of one.</P>
    <P>My correspondent goes on to inquire if it is possible to eliminate the distinction between the tenant whose lease has less than 25 years to run and the tenant whose lease has more years to run and he says:</P>
    <P>In a way, the tenant who has less should be entitled to any preferential treatment that is going as the fact that he has less than 25 years to go establishes that he or those who went before him have been paying the ground rent for over 75 years.  In my case the estate have been collecting for 96 years and I am to be put in a very worse position than if the estate had been collecting for 75 years or less.</P>
    <P>The Minister may argue that the tenant is protected by the terms of section 18 as to the factors that must be borne in mind in determining the new rent but clearly the very fact that the Bill excludes the &ldquo;less than 25 years to run&rdquo; group from the maximum purchase price fixed for the &ldquo;25 years and over&rdquo; group makes clear that the Minister feels that the under 25 years man should be charged more.</P>
    <P>He also inquires, if it is impossible to meet this small group fully and to accord them justice, could there not be some effort by the Minister on this <Col N="1859" /> occasion to deal with the problem with which he will be confronted.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal of justice in what this man has to say and I should like the Minister to consider it.  It may be that the form of my amendment is deemed to be too sweeping to cover such a limited section of the community. I put it down in order to get the opportunity of bringing this kind of case to the Minister's notice.  I do not believe the Minister wilfully wishes to impose a hardship on this section of the people but, if we let the opportunity of this Bill go by without taking all possible steps open to us to protect the interests of leaseholders, including leaseholders such as this man who has been a long time in possession of the property and whose people before him have been paying ground rent, and if we do not take this opportunity to endeavour to deal with such cases equitably, it may be a long time before we get another opportunity of discussing them.  Indeed, legislation affecting property comes under consideration in this House only at considerable intervals of time.</P>
    <P>It may be that none of us will be taking much interest in the affairs of Dáil Éireann when the next Bill to deal with this kind of problem comes before the House.  Therefore, it behoves us to take all possible precautions to make the instrument as perfect as it is possible to make it bearing in mind at all times the fact that it is not within human competence to make it completely and absolutely perfect and to ensure that it will cover every conceivable situation or problem.</P>
    <P>I would urge this case upon the Minister.  Since the number of persons affected would not be very large and as it would appear that this group of persons have a legitimate claim here, leaving aside the wording of my amendment, the Minister with his officials should seek to get legal verbiage which would cover what I am trying to provide.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see Deputy Dunne's point on behalf of tenants in this situation but my job in this Bill is to do justice to all sides and to seek to have enacted a measure which does <Col N="1860" /> justice to all sides.  There is also the other side of the case.  In any case where there is less than 25 years to run there is an obvious equity residing in the landlord.  If this measure never came before the House, he or his successor would have a very definite right in regard to renewal of the lease in respect of which he could ask for a considerably increased rent under the various landlord and tenant provisions which are already law, a rent which would be far above the present rent. This is a right which resides with the landlord.  This equity has a present value which depends on how far away the reversion is.  The figure must be put somewhere.  All the expert advice is that it should be put at 25 years. The Landlord and Tenant Commission recommended 25 years.  Deputy Dunne would suggest some lower period. There must be a period of time within which you recognise that definite rights and a definite equity begin to accrue to the landlord, that any landlord in contemplation of property with less than 25 years to run has got a definite stake in the property.  Under the law as it stands he can demand a renewal rent away and above the present rent and, having regard to this right, he has a certain claim to ask for reasonable compensation if the fee simple is bought by the tenant.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Dunne is well aware, we are not seeking to deny the tenant this right of purchase even where there is less than 25 years to run but what we are doing is making him come within subsection (a) of section 18, so that the county registrar can arbitrate the case fully, hear what the present value of the landlord's reversionary interest in the property is, hear the tenant's side and, on balance, having heard both, decide what is the appropriate compensation. If the landlord demands unreasonable compensation, then the costs can be awarded against him under this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think there is a definite distinction between the type of person mentioned by Deputy Dunne and the person who is lessee with more than 25 years to run.  We have to draw the line somewhere, whether at 50, 30 or 25 years. Twenty-five years is the period recommended <Col N="1861" /> by the Commission.  I think it is a sensible recommendation.  Once having drawn the line there, we say that everybody with more than 25 years to run has an absolute right of purchase subject to the maximum price, related to the yield of certain securities, of 14.8 years purchase but, under 25 years, we say that in some cases which might arise, where there is a particular interest by the landlord, a particular expectation, a particular goodwill attaching to the premises, it might not be equitable that the 14.8 years provision should apply.  On the other hand, I am certain that there are a number of cases, possibly including the case mentioned by Deputy Dunne, where the County Registrar looking at the circumstances might award 14 years purchase, or something of that kind.  The County Registrar, having considered all the facts, the nature of the property, the location of the property, whether the landlord was at any great loss in taking the compensation which we have provided under (b), might award 14 to 15 years purchase.  It should be left open to the County Registrar, the arbitrator decreed under the Bill.</P>
    <P>We are giving a new right to this lessee.  I think Deputy Dunne is wrong if he thinks that this Bill is prejudicing the lessee he has mentioned. He now has a right to purchase the fee simple.  We are giving it to him.  All we are saying is that where there is less than 25 years to run the landlord has a very definite stake in the property, an expectation in the property and, in that sort of case, by reason of the nature of the property, it might happen, if this expectation has a present value, that the landlord, in justice, would be entitled to more than 14.8 years purchase.  We are saying in all these cases that the matter be left open to the arbitrator.</P>
    <P>However, there are merits in what Deputy Dunne says.  I listened closely to the letter he read to the House and I will have a closer look at it between now and the Committee Stage in the Seanad.  At the moment on balance I am against the point of view put by him.  However, I will have a closer look at it to see if we can find a way around it, but I cannot give an undertaking <Col N="1862" /> at this stage.

      <P>These amendments are mainly of a drafting character.  As section 28 stands, it enables covenants in a building or proprietary lease to insure the property with a particular insurer to be varied.  These amendments make it clear that the power given by the section to vary covenants to insure with a particular insurer will apply also to covenants to insure through a particular agent.  It spells out that the property must be insured with an insurer who is licensed under the Insurance Act, 1936.  This, again, is a clearing up amendment.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;or relates to land or premises occupied by others holding as lessees or tenants of the owner of the lessors interest&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is to meet a particular set of circumstances that can arise. I had an amendment down on Committee Stage but for some reason I was not able to move it, although I dealt with the remainder.  Section 29 states:</P>
      <P>Where the fee simple in land demised by a lease containing a covenant, condition or agreement which protects or enhances the amenities of any land occupied by the owner of the lessor's interest in the lease or relates to performance of a duty imposed by statute on such owner or to a right of way over the land is acquired under this Act...</P>
      <P>The section goes on to say that these covenants will remain notwithstanding the purchase out of the fee simple by a tenant.  In other words, the position is to be that, if there are covenants in the lease which enhance in some way the amenities of the land and the lessor's own property, those covenants are going to remain.  I think it is quite right that they should.  I am not criticising that, but what I am concerned about is the circumstance which can arise where the lessor in his lease has himself entered into a covenant with the lessee, where there may be two, three or four different lessees all with a common lessor or where you have a covenant entered into by the lessor with lessee A in order to protect the positions of lessees B, C and D or that there are covenants entered into by the lessor with lessee D which are designed to protect him <i>vis-à-vis</i> lessees A, B and C.  I know it sounds a bit complicated but I am quite sure the Minister is able to grasp it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1866" /> What I am aiming at in this amendment is to ensure that in those circumstances, not only will the convenants which are designed or are necessary to protect the lessor's position remain, but also covenants which enhance or protect the rights of other lessees under a common lessor.  I am suggesting we should insert after the word &ldquo;lease&rdquo; the following &ldquo;or relates to land or premises occupied by others holding as lessees or tenants of the owner of the lessor's interest.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is a simple way of explaining this.  Although it is not particularly relevant to a discussion of ground rents, it illustrates the case I have in mind.  The Minister will be aware that very often where new shopping centres are created in new building estates, the developer or the builder is the lessor. He allocates three or four or half a dozen shops on the estate for the purposes of different businesses.  In each case he enters into a covenant with the persons concerned.  For example, he enters into a covenant with the person taking the drapery shop that he will not create a lease of any other shop in which he will permit the drapery business to be carried on, and so on in the case of the butcher and the chemist.  Each has the protection of a covenant with the landlord which ensures for them that theirs will be the only shop of that particular type to be carried on in the particular shopping centre.</P>
    <P>I know that that kind of lease is not in question here but it does serve to illustrate the kind of case I have in mind, where you have a common lessor who has given leases to a number of different lessees at a ground rent and who has in those leases covenanted with each individual lessee in some way to protect that lessee or that lessee's interest.  It may be against putting up buildings on adjoining land or it may be against allowing adjoining land to be used in a particular way. Whatever the covenant is, if there is a covenant of that sort given by a common lessor to two or more lessees, it is important that, in this legislation, we should protect the position of the lessee who is entitled to the benefit of <Col N="1867" /> that covenant.  If we do not, then the neighbouring lessee who holds under a common title may be enabled to buy off fee simple and kill off whatever covenants are there.</P>
    <P>I know that the matter is fairly complicated and possibly the Minister would like to look a little more closely at it.  I feel it is something we should be on our guard against, something that needs protection by way of amendment.  If the Minister feels he can agree in principle with me and would like to look at it himself and deal with it himself in the Seanad, I shall be quite happy.</P>

      <P>It is a question of balance.  One of the main attractions in the Bill is that these amenity covenants, subject to the reservations in section 29, will go.  This is the whole thinking behind it.  I know what the Deputy is driving at.  Deputy O'Higgins mentioned a case where a man was being restricted from having a certain type of business by virtue of a lease covering a whole developed area.  For instance, if he were a butcher, he was restricted under the lease from opening a licensed premises.  I do not see why such a restrictive covenant should not go.  I know it may affect other people in the area but business is business.  This is a freeing-out so that restrictive and amenity covenants will go.</P>

      <P>I am talking about a covenant by the landlord. Suppose a landlord has undertaken the upkeep of a particular park or crescent in a residential area.  That is a covenant which, as long as the lease continues&mdash;there might be several lessees&mdash;the landlord is obliged to perform.  If we allow the continuance of covenants to protect amenities of the landlord, we should also ensure continuation of covenants by the landlord for the protection of amenities of the tenant.</P>

      <P>This is an amendment which has strongly been urged on me by the Incorporated Law Society.  I do not think it is all that important, candidly, but this is the way they want it.  I do not see any objection in principle to a clear abolition of the present practice.</P>

      <P>(1)  Notwithstanding any rule of law, a party to a lease shall not (unless the parties to the lease agree otherwise in writing) be under an obligation to pay the solicitor's costs of the lease of any other party to the lease.</P>
      <P>The present position, as I understand it, is that if the agreement is silent, the lessor can then automatically claim that the cost should be paid.  The Minister was going some distance to alter that.  He was reversing that position unless there was an agreement in writing.  I understand that the Incorporated Law Society are urging on the Minister that there should be a complete reversal of the position, without the option: in other words, that you cannot opt out of this section and that the parties cannot hereafter agree that the lessee will in a particular case be responsible for the lessor's costs.  If that is their view, I disagree with it.  I think the Minister's section as it stood was better.</P>

      <P>I do not think we should limit the right of people voluntarily and freely to enter into their own contracts.  I can appreciate the point of view which probably <Col N="1870" /> motivated the Incorporated Law Society in their representations to the Minister.  I can appreciate the point of view which regards the lessee as necessarily being in the weaker position, as being the supplicant who is looking for the lease and that the lessor is consequently in a position to impose his conditions.  I think the Legislature would be going far enough if they stopped the present position where lessees are, so to speak, inadvertently trapped into paying the lessor's costs&mdash; it is not that they are trapped in a positive sense but if the agreement is silent on it, then that silence is taken as consent and the lessee is required to pay the lessor's costs.  If that were altered as the Minister had suggested, it would be better.  I say that, even though the representation has been made by the Incorporated Law Society.  I do not know their reasons for making it.</P>

      <P>In view of the fact that neither the Minister not Deputy O'Higgins seems very happy about this amendment, I find myself in some difficulty, but I think there is something in the amendment.  I tend to support the Law Society's view.  As Deputy O'Higgins said so very clearly, the lessee is the suppliant, the person who is in the weaker position, and the provision, as originally drafted leaves the lessor in a position in which he will be able to put pressure on the lessee to pay his costs.  I should imagine, though I have no definite information on this, that the intention of the Law Society was to ensure that the costs of the lessee would be very substantially reduced.  It has always seemed unjust to me that a lessee should pay the lessor's costs.  Under the provision as drafted, there would definitely be a temptation to a lessor to make it a term of the original contract that, if one accepts this lease, it will be on the basis that one will pay the lessor's costs.  Even if the Minister and Deputy O'Higgins do not support this amendment, I do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>The main object of this Bill is, as the explanatory memorandum states, to encourage the maintenance in proper repair of the present stock of controlled houses and to do this without causing any hardship to existing tenants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will need no convincing on the vital importance of preserving as long as possible what stocks of housing we already have, and on how much more economic it is to spend money on repair and reconstruction than on replacement of such stocks by new buildings.  This is particularly relevant when the demand for new housing continues to exist at such a high level. Moreover, this country has a high proportion of old housing.  The percentage of our housing stock which was built before 1919 is, at 58 per cent, one of the highest in Western Europe.  Only France, which has 62 per cent, exceeds it.  We, therefore, particularly need to provide every encouragement possible <Col N="1872" /> to keep our old houses in good repair. The provision of repair and reconstruction grants on a considerable scale has done much in this direction.  Some 153,000 houses have been repaired or reconstructed since 1948.  These grants are for repairs of a more or less capital nature and not for ordinary running repairs.  It is only common sense to advocate a &ldquo;stitch in time&rdquo; policy in the matter of housing maintenance to be followed by all owners of old houses, whether they be owneroccupiers, local authorities or private landlords.</P>
    <P>We are concerned in this Bill only with premises owned by private landlords which remain under the control of the Rent Restrictions Act, 1960.  A considerable number of rented dwellings are still controlled, though the proportion of controlled to uncontrolled dwellings is continuously declining. This is primarily due to obsolescence of existing dwellings and the construction of new, and, therefore, uncontrolled, dwellings.  Figures relating to the subject are hard to come by but in 1961 the percentage of controlled dwellings was approximately 14 per cent.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that controlled rents are far below present open market levels, even when full allowance is made for the fact that many of the dwellings involved lack amenities which are now provided as a matter of course in new houses.  And I think there will be no disputing the proposition that. having regard to the increase in the cost of repairs since 1960, when landlords who were liable for repairs were given their last increase of 12½ per cent, landlords who have to carry out such repairs can do so only at a considerable reduction in their net income and a corresponding disinclination to have the premises properly maintained.  Perhaps I might, very briefly, sketch the background to the increase of 12½ per cent given in the 1960 Act.  In 1960 most of the controlled property, that is, that built before 1919, was controlled at rents which were 25 per cent above actual 1914 rents and the only additions permitted to those rents were for rates, where the landlord paid them, <Col N="1873" /> and for any expenditure by the landlord on improvements, structural alterations, or certain exceptional repairs. By then repair costs were over seven times the 1914 level.</P>
    <P>Since 1960 the cost of repairs to house property has increased substantially as a result of increases in building wages and the cost of materials.  The increase in building costs is estimated officially at 29 per cent from 1960 to June, 1966, but, as the proportion of labour to materials in house repairs is higher than in building operations, the figure for the increase in repair costs would be substantially higher than this.  Moreover, the increased incidence of income tax since 1963 on the income from unfurnished lettings has further reduced the net income from controlled property.</P>
    <P>It is against this background that I am proposing in this Bill certain measures to encourage the maintenance of controlled property in proper repair and, not only this, but to strengthen the remedies of the tenant against the landlord who fails in his obligation in the matter of repair.</P>
    <P>First of all, the Bill proposes to allow an increase of 15 per cent in present net rents, subject to a minimum of 2/6 weekly.  This increase is no more than the maintenance of the <i>status quo</i> as in 1960, and it is subject to the important limitation that not only must the landlord be liable for repairs but he must have spent certain specified sums on the repairs in the six years before the 8th June, 1966, when the Bill was introduced.  The form of notice of intention to increase the rent, which every landlord must serve to avail himself of this increase, must contain particulars of this expenditure. In other words, only landlords who have actually been carrying out the repairs are going to get the increase. I think it is a reasonable provision, and that tenants generally, who are equally interested as the landlord in the proper maintenance of their dwelling accommodation, will regard it as such.</P>
    <P>The second provision relating to the <Col N="1874" /> maintenance of controlled houses is that which proposes to allow a lawful addition to landlords who have to spend more than one-fifth of the current rent in any year on any kind of maintenance. The addition is to be 10 per cent on the excess expenditure.  This addition will replace the existing provision allowing the landlord a graduated percentage of his outlay on what might be called &ldquo;once-andfor-all&rdquo; expenditure on major repair and reconstruction work.  It is at present 15 per cent on the first £100 of the excess expenditure over two-thirds of the basic rent, 8 per cent on the second £100 of the excess and 6 per cent on the remainder.  As the law stands, there is no provision for the recoupment to the landlord of what might be heavy expenditure on other repairs, for instance, on the replacement of the water pipes leading from the mains.  He has no incentive whatever to incur expenditure on regular outside painting, which is necessary to preserve the fabric of the building itself, quite apart from any considerations of decorative effect.  The Bill will ensure that, where landlords comply with their obligations to keep the premises in repair, they can no longer say that they will not receive a reasonable return on the expenditure or that it is unfair to expect them to incur the expenditure while restricting rents below open market levels.</P>
    <P>As a corollary, the Bill proposes, in section 11, to remove a great deal of the present uncertainties as to the incidence of liability for repairs in weekly or monthly lettings.  The tenants of many of these lettings have no written agreements and there is very often a great deal of difficulty experienced in determining who is liable for particular repairs.  From now on tenants will be able to pinpoint liability in this respect.  The section implies a covenant in such lettings that the landlord will be liable for keeping in repair the structure, including floors, the exterior, including painting facilities for water, gas, sanitation, electricity, etc. and, in the case of flats, the ceilings.  This provision, together with the increased powers which <Col N="1875" /> section 8 gives to the court to reduce the rent in cases where landlords neglect their repairing responsibilities as well as the increased powers in this regard conferred on tenants by the recent Housing Act, will ensure that tenants can insist on their dwellings being kept in good repair at all times.  Tenants have, of course, a number of other remedies against a landlord who fails in his obligation to keep property in repair and the removal of uncertainties about liability to repair will give these remedies fresh significance.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw special attention also to the provision in section 7 which enables a tenant to disallow a lawful addition obtained by the landlord for expenditure on maintenance if he satisfies the court that the expenditure was rendered necessary by breach of an obligation imposed on the landlord by contract or statute and that the landlord has not, during the three years immediately preceding the expenditure, spent a reasonable sum on the maintenance of the dwelling. However, in order that landlords may have an opportunity to put controlled property in good repair, it is proposed that this provision will not apply except to expenditure incurred on repairs done in 1970 or subsequently.</P>
    <P>What I have said so far deals with the primary purpose of the Bill, that is the conservation of existing controlled property, but the provisions in section 2 for the decontrol of certain houses will also indirectly server to further that purpose.  The proposed decontrol will take place in two ways, in each case with full protection for the interests of existing tenants.  First of all, there will be an extension of decontrol on the landlord getting vacant possession. At present there is decontrol on getting vacant possession only in respect of houses exceeding £30 valuation, in Dublin, and £25, elsewhere.  Under the Bill this will apply to all houses and also to self-contained flats.  This provision naturally does not affect sitting tenants at all.  The other decontrol provision in section 2 is that which <Col N="1876" /> provides for the decontrol of houses exceeding £40 valuation, in Dublin, and £30, elsewhere.  The tenants who may be decontrolled under this provision are being given by section 12 automatic rights to a 21 years lease under Part III of the Landlord and Tenant Act, 1931.  I should not imagine that there are many rented houses in these valuation categories which would be occupied by persons who could not reasonably be asked to pay an economic rent for them, but, in case there are, I have made special provision to ensure that no such tenant can be required to pay a rent under the new lease which would cause him or her hardship.  The decontrol will not apply to existing lettings of rooms or flats in houses which are over the valuation limits.  Moreover, future lettings of rooms and non-selfcontained flats in houses decontrolled under either of these provisions will still be subject to control, though section 5 of the Bill provides that the controlled rent will be determined on a basis which will not be quite so restrictive as at present.</P>
    <P>The final provision to which I should like to draw attention is that which will enable what I might call the &ldquo;small&rdquo; landlord to have a fair rent fixed by the district court, a rent which will be reasonable and which will take into account all the circumstances of the case but, in the words of the Bill, in particular the necessity of avoiding financial hardship to the tenant and the landlord.  I am satisfied that this is a fair and just provision to insert in the Bill and that it will help to remove what I consider to be an anomaly in the present code.  I have had several instances brought to my notice&mdash;and I am sure every Deputy in the House will know of similar cases&mdash;where the landlord has only one house or a few houses and is in relatively bad circumstances whereas the tenant is very comfortably off.  Where this is the case I see no reason why the tenant should not be asked to pay a fair rent for the house, a rent he can afford.  It will be observed that this provision applies only to the review of the rents of controlled houses.  It does not apply to any lettings of rooms or flats, which will <Col N="1877" /> continue to have the full protection of the Act as regards the restriction of rents.</P>
    <P>In general, the Bill is being put forward by me as a reasonable attempt to deal with a matter which is of vital importance to tenants as well as to landlords.  From the landlord's point of view it will put him in a position to maintain the premises properly by enabling him to recoup the costs of necessary repairs.  From the tenant's point of view it should help to ensure, so far as the law can do it, that controlled tenants will have properly maintained houses to live in for as long as proper maintenance can keep these houses in existence.  On this basis I believe that it will be regarded, by tenants as well as by landlords, as being a fair and reasonable approach to the problem, and I hope that in principle it will commend itself to the House.</P>
    <P>The Bill itself is, in form, somewhat complex, and necessarily so, because it is mainly concerned with amendments of the provisions of the 1960 Act.  For this reason I have had included in the Explanatory Memorandum, circulated with the Bill, an Appendix which shows the effect of these amendments on the 1960 Act and I hope that this will be of assistance to Deputies.  I considered the possibility of repealing the 1960 Act entirely and its re-enactment in amended form but I think that, on balance, the course which has been adopted is the better alternative. When the Bill becomes law arrangements will be made to have the sections as amended printed in such a way that they can be incorporated in existing copies of the 1960 Act.</P>
    <P>Although on this Stage we are concerned with matters of principle, I shall endeavour to clarify any particular provisions on which Deputies may require further information.  As to the principles themselves, I feel sure that every Deputy will be interested in seeing that the existing housing stock is properly maintained and that tenants have full facilities to avail themselves of their remedies against landlords who neglect their repairing <Col N="1878" /> responsibilities.  I want to say that I shall give very careful consideration to any suggestions which may be made in the course of the debate towards enabling these objects to be more effectively achieved.  On this basis I commend the Bill to the House and ask that it be given a Second Reading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;Dáil Éireann declines to give a Second Reading to the Bill on the grounds that it is not appropriate to do so until the Government provide an adequate number of houses to deal with the present acute housing shortage and thus enable the Rent Restrictions code to be revised in a manner equitable to houseowners and occupying tenants&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The object of this amendment is to do a number of things.  Firstly, it is intended in relation to the Bill the Minister has introduced to pinpoint the extremely grave and acute housing shortage which exists throughout the country at present.  It is also intended to emphasise the responsibility of the Government in this matter and to try to jerk the Government into a realisation of their responsibility in the matter and of the urgent nature of the problem which faces the unfortunate people in far too many areas throughout the country, and not merely in the city of Dublin.  Finally, as the amendment makes it quite clear, we want to record our view of how inappropriate it is to introduce a measure of this sort, whatever may be said about the merits of it.  I agree with the Minister that a lot can be said as regards the merits because I do not speak at all as an admirer of the rent restrictions code, but whatever may be said regarding the merits of the proposed legislation we want to record our view that it is inappropriate to introduce it at this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister and most Deputies will agree with me that scarcity conditions, where the demand far exceeds the supply, constitute the classical conditions for inflated prices.  Deputies on <Col N="1879" /> all sides will agree that so far as housing is concerned at the moment, and this has been so for some time, those classical inflationary conditions exist. Demand far exceeds supply and, therefore, it seems to us that those are the conditions in which the Minister should not introduce legislation designed to raise rents of tenants of controlled dwellings, whether they are sitting tenants or new tenants coming in, on the one hand, and, secondly, to bring about a fair measure of decontrol which is going to take a certain number of these houses&mdash;whether it be large or small is not particularly important to my argument&mdash;out of the market and make them unavailable for renting at the same controlled rents at which they have been available up to the time of decontrol.</P>
    <P>As I say, so far as housing is concerned the classical conditions for inflation exist.  It is true of all commodities that where demand exceeds the supply, you get inflated prices.  I think that is true of everything.  It is particularly true of the commodity which most people will agree is the essential commodity, that is, the commodity which keeps the roof over a person's head.</P>
    <P>I am moving this motion in the belief that those two propositions are true, firstly, that it is reasonable that in the year 1966 reasonable housing conditions for all our people should be regarded as a realisable aim and that we should accept that our people are entitled to seek such conditions and to regard them as a necessity.  I do not believe that proposition will be disputed by most Deputies.</P>
    <P>The second proposition is that far too many of our people are, today, not enjoying those conditions because of the acute and grave housing shortage which exists.  If the House is prepared to accept those propositions as being true, then, to my mind, it follows logically that nothing should be done by us in our legislation here to make it more difficult for any section of our people to achieve reasonable housing accommodation at rents which the tenants can afford to pay.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1880" /> It is in this context that I would invite Deputies to consider the proposals the Government have introduced in this amending Bill.  I do not think the Minister will disagree with me when I say that the main features of the Bill are firstly that there will be a mandatory 15 per cent increase in rents of controlled dwellings.  I know the arguments the Minister has advanced in favour of that and in other circumstances I would go a long way in agreeing with the Minister that there is justification for this, that prices have increased, wages, labour and so on have increased, and consequently the cost of repairs has gone up.  However, one of the principal provisions of this Bill is to impose a mandatory 15 per cent increase in rents.  Secondly, that mandatory 15 per cent increase in rents will be imposed on tenants of controlled houses, irrespective of their arrangements with their landlords. This increase is not one which it is intended to apply only to tenants coming into controlled dwellings.  It will apply to all tenants of controlled dwellings, irrespective of what arrangements they have made already with their landlords.</P>
    <P>The next main feature of this Bill is, of course, that which the Minister has referred to, the further extension of decontrol.  I think I have already indicated to the Minister that I do not regard either of those steps as being intrinsically bad.  In other circumstances, I would be prepared not only to concede that the Bill and the particular steps I have referred to have merit but I think I could see it within me to urge their desirability on the House.  A condition precedent to that, to my mind, in any event, would be the availability of sufficient houses at least to ease the present crisis conditions. Until the Government are in a position to say to this House that they have brought about some fairly dramatic improvements in the housing conditions, a Bill of this nature is premature.</P>
    <P>As I said, I am not, and never have been, an admirer of the rent restriction code.  As the Minister in his speech pointed out, it is a code which goes back to 1914.  In fact, I believe <Col N="1881" /> it is true to say that the first Rent Restrictions Act was introduced as an emergency war measure at the beginnig of the First World War at a time when people were coming from the rural areas into the cities and towns where accommodation consequently was becoming short and the demand was growing.  In other words, you had very much the same kind of conditions, in relation to housing, as you have at the moment.  You had this shortage of accommodation and overcrowding, and in those circumstances the first Rent Restrictions Act was brought in, as I said, as an emergency measure, intended, I think, to last only for the duration of the First World War and a period of six months or thereabouts afterwards.</P>
    <P>In fact, it was found necessary to continue the code in the 1920s and in a number of other Acts.  The most recent, so far as this House goes, was the Rent Restrictions Act of 1960.  The 1960 Act, of course, brought in a fairly large measure of decontrol.  It also contained similar provisions to the provisions which the Minister is introducing here with regard to increases of rents.  The only thing is that six years ago when the 1960 Act was introduced, the rent increase was limited to 12½ per cent.  Now, six years later, we find the Minister adding another 15 per cent to that so that in fact over the past six years the increase in rents which is being imposed in a mandatory, arbitrary way, on tenants, is a total of 27½ per cent.</P>
    <P>I do not make the case that that cannot be justified by the increase in the cost of repairs and I agree with the Minister regarding the importance of trying to preserve the existing stock of houses.  One of the faults which I saw in the rent restrictions code from the very beginning was that it fell down on the question of repairs, that there was nothing in the code which clearly imposed obligations regarding the repair of premises in such a way to ensure that repairs would be done and that by the repairs being done the houses would be preserved.</P>
    <P>Consequently the Act of 1960, when <Col N="1882" /> it was introduced, allowed a 12½ per cent increase in rents and when it was argued in that connection that this increase was necessary on account of repairs, we pointed out at the time from these benches that the provision was a bad one because it was making a mandatory increase in rents which was to be payable where the landlord had responsibility for repairs or part repairs, but that there was no provision being written into the Bill to ensure that the increase would operate only provided the landlord carried out these repairs.  I have a quotation here but I shall not bore the Minister with it.  I remember arguing strongly on the occasion of the 1960 Bill that if these mandatory increases were to be imposed, there should be something in the Bill which would make them payable only in the cases of landlords who not alone were responsible for repairs but who actually carried out these repairs.  I think it is right to say that I do appreciate the fact that in the present Bill that situation has been remedied and the receipt by the landlord of the increase in rent will be dependent on the repairs being done.</P>
    <P>It is something of an anomaly that some 50 years after the introduction of emergency war legislation we should still be carrying it forward, but I do not think we are in a position yet to get rid of it, and I do not think we will be in that position until the Government of the day are able to point to the fact that sufficient houses have been erected to make the rent restrictions code no longer necessary. In fact, what is done by the rent restrictions code is that the private landlord is required to subsidise tenants. That, to my mind, should be the job of the Government operating through a local authority, or however it is done, but, in any event, the emergency conditions which necessitated the introduction of the rent restrictions code are in no way lessened today.  I do not remember the time of the introduction of the first rent restrictions code but I have no doubt that the present housing conditions are every bit as acute as in 1914 or 1915 when the first Act was introduced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure we have improved since then, but I want to call the Minister's attention to an interesting figure given by his colleague, the Minister for Local Government, in a debate in the Seanad earlier this year when he pointed to the fact that between 1946 and 1961, we built some 125,000 houses, but that in that period the total housing stock grew by only 14,000 units; in other words, 125,000 houses were built but the housing stock increased by only 14,000 units.  He said that the balance disappeared through obsolescence, demolition, change to other uses, and so on. So, when you have that kind of situation where even the erection of some 100,000 houses gives a net addition of only 14,000 new houses, it does show that the problem is very slow of solution.</P>
      <P>What I am suggesting to the Minister is not that the rent restrictions code should be regarded as something sacrosanct to be upheld by this House but that until we are in a position of having available to our people a sufficient number of houses to take away the emergency atmosphere, to take away the danger of inflation, until that time arrives, we should not do anything which will, or be likely to add to the problem and worsen the already grave housing shortage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this Bill gets a Second Reading and goes into Committee, there are a number of matters, as the Minister has indicated, that may require detailed discussion.  One of the matters which certainly should be considered very carefully by this House, if we reach the Committee Stage, is that we are here in 1966 once again, six years after discussing this matter in the 1960 Act, going to impose mandatory increases on sitting tenants.  I believe there should be a differentiation in this respect between sitting tenants, people who are there already and who have already come to arrangements with their landlords, and new tenants of controlled premises.  If we are going to amend the code at all, we should <Col N="1884" /> consider also something on the lines of a fair rent tribunal which could mete out a measure of justice both to the landlord and the tenants.  I am quite well aware that the last rent tribunal, the Conroy Tribunal, did not favour the idea but, personally, I believe it would be workable and could work not only in relation to rents but in relation to decontrol.</P>
    <P>So far as the landlord is concerned, the most irksome thing in the rent restrictions code is not necessarily that he is tied in regard to rent but the fact that he is excluded from getting possession of the premises.  As I said before, one of the faults of the code was that it failed to deal with the question of repairs.  Naturally enough, the tenant who is never likely to be the owner was not going to concern himself with laying out money for repairs and, likewise, the landlord who was kept out of possession by virtue of the restriction against possession in the rent restrictions code was not going to concern himself with the question of repairs.  I think possibly that slack is being taken up a bit now, possibly a bit too quickly.</P>
    <P>The point I want to make is that in regard to the landlord, very often the question that concerned him most acutely was not being able to get possession of his own house.  As I see it, some type of tribunal which could go into questions of greater hardship between the landlord and the tenant, not only rent questions but possession questions, might be of considerable assistance.  I do not propose saying anything further at this stage in relation to the Bill.</P>
    <P>We do not think the Bill should get a Second Reading, not because we particularly favour the code as it stands, but because it may create a very difficult situation for many people who are seeking reasonable living accommodation at reasonable rents, if legislation of this sort is passed at the moment during a period of acute housing shortage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been trying to analyse this Bill and find out if, in fact, any useful purpose can be served at present by introducing a Bill of this kind.  Like Deputy O'Higgins, I feel that the suggestion that simply by introducing a Bill in this House and getting it passed through while there are so many people who need houses and who will have to compete with those already in possession of housing accommodation means that the Bill can have very little effect at least for some time.  We are all in sympathy with the person who owns a house and is receiving a very bad rent for it and who, because of that, is not prepared to carry out repairs but ownership of property must carry a certain responsibility and if those people deliberately allow their property to fall into bad repair rather than expend some money on keeping it in repair, then I feel the State should not be in such a hurry rushing to their assistance.</P>
      <P>As it stands, most people who want to repair houses can obtain a very substantial State grant to do so.  This may not meet the full requirements, particularly where larger houses are concerned.  In fact, I know of somebody who wanted to carry out repairs to a house and asked the Department of Local Government to give an estimate of the cost of the necessary repairs.  They came up with a bill for something around £5,200.  In view of the fact that the house had been bought a few years previously for £4,000 this looked a little ridiculous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am afraid that the Bill, as it is worded at present, will be accepted by property owners as an excuse to attempt to raise rents one way or the other and, if they must do repairs, to do the bare minimum of repairs necessary. Costings or finding out what the repairs actually cost or whether or not the repairs were all that was necessary in order to qualify for raising the rent will mean that either their word will have to be taken for it or a contractor's word or a horde of officials will have to be employed who will go around checking on facts or supposed facts. For that reason I think this Bill is <Col N="1886" /> likely to be just another gimmick which gives the impression that it is doing something but is, in fact, not doing anything at all.  If it means anything at all it means that the authority to increase rents is being considered.</P>
    <P>Deputy M.J. O'Higgins made a comment&mdash;I do not think he was thinking too clearly when he made it&mdash;that a 12½ per cent increase in 1960 plus a 15 per cent increase now means an increase of 27½ per cent.  Twelve and a half per cent on 1960 rents with a 50 per cent increase on top of the revised rents means very much higher than the increase suggested, inadvertently, I suppose, by Deputy M.J. O'Higgins.</P>

      <P>On the original basic rent if we go back to that.  I cannot see where the justification is for that over a few years because it means that those who succeded in getting a 12½ per cent increase in 1960 will now be applying for a further increase by claiming to do certain things.</P>
      <P>There is another section of the Bill which makes me a bit nervous about the whole thing.  The Bill says that the release from the terms of the Rent Restrictions Bill will, of course, apply where a tenancy is ended.  Does the Minister not consider that this will raise an issue where certain people who own property will attempt to break the existing tenancy?  We have at present under orders from the Minister for Local Government local authorities attempting to break the tenancies in order to increase the rents of labourers' cottages.  If it can be legally done by a Department of State surely we will have quite a lot of it done by private individuals who will only be too anxious to avail of any loophole that may arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1887" /> It is all right for those who own houses to say that, of course, they must get some money back.  I recently had a case brought to my notice of somebody who was getting 5/- a week for a house.  The house was not in good repair.  The landlord asked me &ldquo;What do you expect me to do?  I am paying 8/- a week rates on the house and getting 5/- a week from the tenant. I am paying out more in rates than I am actually getting in rent from the tenant.  Why should I be expected to carry out repairs?&rdquo; The result is that that person got the local authority to condemn the house and to pull it down and got the tenants rehoused in a local authority housing scheme.  If the Minister is moving to prevent this sort of thing happening and trying to encourage property owners to repair their houses and thereby to make more houses available, I can go a long way with him.</P>

That is what it may be supposed to be about but in the Bill itself or in the White Paper or even in the Minister's statement I see far too many loopholes to accept that it will achieve that.  It may be that the net result of this will be that a certain number of people will avail of an Act of this House for the purpose of putting out tenants or breaking longstanding tenancies in order that they may raise rents and that there will be all sorts of dodges and tricks tried for the purpose of trying to have rents increased without the necessary repairs being carried out.</P>
      <P>If we go to any house which is occupied by a tenant for a number of years and ask the tenant what repairs he thinks are necessary to put the house in good repair we will get a list of repairs.  We can then go to the landlord and ask him the same question and see whether the two lists coincide.  The Minister is well aware of the fact that what the landlord thinks is necessary and what the tenant thinks is necessary are two different things.</P>

      <P>There is no provision in the Bill to deal with this. Who decides what the necessary repairs are?  Will we have a new Department of State whose sole function will be to check on old houses and find out whether or not they need repair or whether or not the repairs which the tenant claims are needed are the repairs which should be carried out or the very much smaller number of repairs which the landlord feels are sufficient should be carried out before rents can be increased?</P>
      <P>This is the type of Bill which will have to be discussed at length in committee.  I am quite sure that before it goes through this House, if it does, quite a number of amendments will be introduced and discussed both from our Party and from the other Parties. I would ask the Minister to be very careful about the wording of a Bill of this kind because I know that at present there are sections in this country who are writing to Deputies and pointing out that the Bill means a certain thing which I cannot find in it, and another group of people writing pointing out that certain safeguards they wanted are not included in the Bill.  From my reading of the Bill, they were there all the time.  Therefore, this is the sort of legislation the lawyers love to have coming up because they can argue two ways about it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;with due apologies to my colleague.  But at the same time, as the Bill stands at the present time, it is far too loosely worded and does not mean what it is supposed to mean, according to the Minister's statement.  For that reason, I would ask him to have another look at the Bill before he asks this House to give it a Second Reading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for only one thing in this Bill.  Deputy Tully has suggested that lawyers welcome legislation of this kind because it is so intricate.  May I say the only reason I welcome this Bill is that in <Col N="1889" /> future, whenever a lawyer is consulted by a client to calculate what the rent ought to be after repairs, he will have one sum only to do whereas heretofore he had five?  That, in itself, is something for which to be grateful but it is about the only provision, in present circumstances, which we in the Fine Gael Party can welcome.</P>
      <P>We are told in the Government's White Paper that the main object of the Bill is to encourage the maintenance of the present stock of controlled houses.  That may be the object of the Bill but one immediate consequence of this Bill is to reduce the stock of controlled houses available and, when that has been done at a time when there are 10,000 families known in Dublin city to be in urgent need of housing accommodation which they have not got, it is unforgivable.  As Deputy O'Higgins has pointed out, it is a time of scarcity, of demand and inflation, and, if we allow a large body of houses to become decontrolled in the way in which the Minister will allow under this Bill, then we will put these 10,000 unfortunate people in the position of being unable to rent any houses in the private sector because of the demands which landlords can make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will answer, no doubt, that the decontrol will apply only to houses where the existing tenant vacates the premises.  That is true, but what greater or moral right has a person, who is fortunate enough to be in a house at the moment and to have had that good fortune for the past 20 or 30 years, to have the protection of the law than one of the unfortunate 10,000 families; because the Government will not give the local authorities authority to build the houses urgently needed?  Surely these unfortunate 10,000 families looking for houses are entitled to get the same protection as people who, because they happened to be born before them, are tenants of a house for the past ten, 20, 30 or even 50 years?  I cannot comprehend the reason for this at all&mdash;to say that the existing tenant has a right to claim the protection of Parliament but that people whose housing needs are just <Col N="1890" /> as acute, whose housing misery is worse, are not entitled to any protection from Parliament.  That is the proposition we are asked to accept and bless in the Bill.  We of the Fine Gael Party find it entirely unacceptable. That is why Deputy O'Higgins has asked that the Dáil decline to give a Second Reading to the Bill on the grounds set out.</P>
    <P>The Minister is treating this matter much too lightly, this question of the obligation we have to ensure that people have houses made available to them at reasonable rents.  The Minister ignored that part of it in his introductory speech today.  He has also ignored in his introductory speech any reference to section 9 of this Bill, which is the section which seeks to amend section 29 of the 1960 Act, the section to which reference was made recently in the House when, on behalf of the Fine Gael Party, I introduced a Private Member's Bill seeking to have section 29 amended.  The Minister promised us that day that the matter would be dealt with very fully on this Bill.</P>
    <P>In the course of the Minister's remarks on the last day, discussing section 29 of the Principal Act and the Fine Gael amendment there to, he said that what the Fine Gael Party were seeking to do was to impose an obligation on the courts to find alternative accommodation for people who were to be dispossessed of houses by developers who wanted to knock them down.  The Minister knows that was never the intention of the Fine Gael amendment.  The Minister knows that no lawyer, or even a non-lawyer with reasonable intelligence, could read such a meaning into it.  What we are seeking to do, and what we will put down an amendment to this Bill to seek to achieve, is to impose an obligation on a developer who wants to demolish a perfectly good house and to put a family out of it to provide alternative accommodation for that family, similar in regard to accommodation, condition and rent to the house out of which the person is being put.  The Government would have us understand that existing tenants have rights which are antecedent and superior to the rights of anybody else seeking a house.  Yet that <Col N="1891" /> principle which they seem to regard as sacrosanct is being offended against in section 29 of the 1960 Act and again in the amendment which it is sought to achieve here in section 29.</P>
    <P>Until 1960, a developer could not put a person out of a controlled dwelling unless he was able to rehouse the person in similar circumstances; in other words, to tempt the person out of it.  I cannot see that there is anything wrong in that.  If a person wants to make more money in the future by knocking down houses to build offices, supermarkets or petrol pump stations, we should not stop him doing it as long as he does not inflict misery on people by so doing.  That is not progress; it is not progress to evict people from their houses, give them a paltry few hundred and say: &ldquo;There you are, that is what Parliament says we need do&rdquo;.  Yet, that is what has been happening ever since the 1960 legislation. But mind you, when the 1960 legislation was going through, there was then a reasonable prospect that people being evicted in those circumstances might get accommodation from a local authority.</P>
    <P>But that was six years ago.  At that time we still had some kind of a prospect of housing these people because there were houses available but now there is no possibility of any family of four people or less, who are evicted in those circumstances, being housed by Dublin Corporation for at least two or three years to come, if not more, and that is being optimistic about it.  Ever since the 1960 Act, we have had land grabbers, profiteers, land owners and property owners without conscience.  We have had foreign enterprises; we have had people whose antecedents in any country in the world could not be traced coming in here and evicting Irish families from their homes with no compensation being made available, other than a paltry few hundred pounds, insufficient to buy even a caravan, build a lean-to shed or a garage.</P>
    <P>The Minister, when we introduced a Bill to stop this social scandal last week, said he would meet it in section <Col N="1892" /> 9 of this Bill.  Under section 9 of this Bill what the Minister proposes is that in future, when the courts are fixing the compensation to be given to tenants who have been put out by developers, the courts are fixing by way of compensation a sum which will be sufficient to enable a tenant without incurring hardship to secure appropriate alternative accommodation.</P>
    <P>At the same time as the Minister is doing this, he and his colleagues in the Government are ensuring that alternative accommodation is not available to those people.  Alternative accommodation which would not impose hardship would be accommodation which would be similar and which was rent controlled, but there will be no vacant accommodation in future which will be rent controlled.  So the situation is that the courts are being asked to assess a figure by way of compensation in respect of something which is not available, and will not be available because of the very steps the Government are seeking to implement through this legislation.</P>
    <P>In case I am talking at a level at which some people may find it impossible to apprehend the seriousness of the problem, let me bring it down to an actual typical case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LorcanAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy suggest that if a person is evicted from one house and gets a new house, he should get it at the same rent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is perfectly reasonable. If we say here that people are entitled to live in controlled dwellings and if we say that existing tenants have certain rights and privileges, I do not see how they can be obliterated as soon as a wealthy person enters on the scene and says: &ldquo;I want you out.  You are affecting my profits.  I want to build an office block or supermarket, and because of that, you can get to hell&rdquo;&mdash;or to use the Persian phrase, Burrow Bejah Nam.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely those expressions are unparliamentary?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a philosophy which we in Fine Gael are not prepared <Col N="1893" /> to accept.  To get down to a concrete example.  In the suburbs of Dublin a number of families have received notice to quit from a developer who in recent times bought a large scheme of small two or three-bedroomed cottages.  This notice to quit has been issued by the person who proposes to demolish these cottages&mdash; some 30 or 40 in number&mdash;and to build a supermarket, a petrol station and a car park.  Some of these houses are to be demolished to provide accommodation for motor cars.  The remainder of the cottages are to be demolished to provide landscaping, a petrol station and a supermarket, in an area where there is already a superfluous number of retail outlets.</P>
      <P>The majority of these tenants comprise families of four people or less. The cottages are occupied mainly by elderly people who in most cases succeeded to the cottages when their parents died 40 or 50 years ago.  These unfortunate people are now in a situation in which the only compensation which will be awarded to them by the courts will be in the region of £300 or £400.  They are being benevolently treated&mdash;if I dare use the word&mdash;by this developer who, in order to avoid the delay of litigation, is offering them £600, provided they get out by a certain date.  If they accept the £600 they must be out within a month, and if they do not accept it, they will be awarded compensation of £300 or £400 by the courts.  These people are paying rents from 12/- to 15/- a week for these two or three-roomed cottages which have little or no modern amenities other than those which they have provided themselves.  Many of them have erected bathrooms and provided flush toilets and other amenities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For their purposes these houses are perfectly adequate.  They are situated in a community in which they hoped to be able to live out the rest of their days.  There is no use in saying we can compensate a person in those circumstances by giving him £300, £400 or £600.  That would not pay the additional rent they will be required to pay even for a year for accommodation with similar floorspace.  That kind of <Col N="1894" /> accommodation is next to impossible to get, and if we pass this legislation, it will be worse than next to impossible to get.  It will be impossible to get because these small cottages in the back lanes of Dublin and in the suburbs which are regarded by many people as adequate for their purposes will no longer be controlled under this legislation, and because of the colossal housing demand, there will be people who will be tempted to pay rents of £4, £5 or £6 for these cottages.</P>
    <P>At present a young married couple with one child or two children find it next to impossible to get accommodation in Dublin from private landlords because the private landlords will not have children in houses which are let in flats. Such young couples will be driven in desperation to offer rents for the small cottages which are left which will be far beyond their real capacity to pay, with the result that whatever prospect they ever had of gathering sufficient money for a deposit on a new house will be completely wiped out.  People who might some day have bought their own home will be unable to do so because they are paying so much in rent and they will be thrown in even greater numbers on to the waiting lists of the local authorities.</P>
    <P>I mention the case of these unfortunate people because I do not think there is any Deputy who when faced with the problem of such a young family&mdash;or of an elderly couple&mdash; would not have complete sympathy with them.  There is no Member of this House and no decent person in Ireland who would not have every sympathy for people placed in such circumstances.  The way we can help them is by refusing to give this Bill a Second Reading and by refusing to permit the Government to make a bad situation worse.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned in his introductory speech and in the White Paper that the main object of the Bill is to encourage the maintenance in proper repair of the present stock of controlled houses.  I do not differ from him in his desire to do what he proposes, or in his method of maintaining <Col N="1895" /> the stock of controlled dwellings.  I agree with him that the tenants have suffered as much as the landlords from the inadequate provision in the existing rent restriction code.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;I shall proceed. In the same volume, No. 224, at column 1612 the Minister for Transport and Power is quoted as saying:</P>
      <P>As the House knows, this question has been raised on a number of occasions.  On each occasion while I have been Minister I made it clear that the Government have, since 1957, helped the people by raising the social welfare benefits to the maximum degree.  They have been increased considerably and this motion I would regard as a very natural one in view of the fact that we are all seeking to improve the lot of people with low incomes.</P>
      <P>I cannot agree with the Minister, and I want to go on record as saying that, in view of the fact that the Minister's Party have gone around my constituency and other parts of the country and collected the pension books from old age pensioners who were in receipt of British pensions and who got increases as a result of increases that were paid across the water by the opposite number of the Minister for Social Welfare&mdash;in view of that the Minister for Transport and Power has a terrible &ldquo;neck&rdquo; when he says that they have, so to speak, leaned over backwards to try to improve the lot of social welfare recipients.</P>
      <P>I cannot agree with that statement and want to go on record as saying that.  Further, we have the Minister at column 1614 of the same volume saying:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that when you look at the whole problem it would be better for us to increase the social welfare benefits as quickly as we can <Col N="1897" /> in the course of the next few years. That, again, as everybody knows, depends on an increase in production, an increase in the prosperity of the nation.  The changes that have taken place since 1957 in the levels of social welfare benefits have been considerable and they are due to a growth in the State's national income and to a growth in industrial and agricultural production and all the other services from which we derive our wealth.</P>
    <P>I want to tell the Minister that not many people in the old age pension group or the social welfare group generally would agree with him because of the callous way in which these people have been treated for a long number of years.  We know that were it not for the fact that we have wonderful charitable organisations such as the St. Vincent de Paul Society and many others the plight of many of these people would be very much worse and that they would be unable to get money for transport to go to collect their old age pensions or blind pensions.  In many instances we are aware that people have to rely on friends or relatives to collect their pensions because they cannot afford the fare.  There is some satisfaction for old age pensioners in going in the bus or train and meeting old friends of former years and having a chat with them and in meeting them perhaps at the post office counter or wherever these benefits are paid out.  That helps to add years to their lives and it is a consolation to them to have the old age pension or blind pension in their own pockets to spend in any way they wish.</P>
    <P>I want to go on record as saying that great credit is due to many organisations such as the St. Vincent de Paul Society and others for the kind way in which they treat these people.  Bad as their situation is&mdash;and it is bad&mdash; in the country it is worse in the cities than in the rural areas.  Were it not for the help given by the charitable organisations, the problem of transport would be even worse than it is now, and it is very bad indeed.  I read in the <i>Evening Herald</i> this evening a report <Col N="1898" /> on the activities of the National Council for the Blind in Ireland.  It states that the last 20 sales enabled the Council to provide 2,320 radio sets for blind people.  That is very commendable work and the people responsible for it deserve the best thanks of the House and the nation as a whole.</P>
    <P>One would imagine from the Minister's statement on this motion by Deputy Larkin, which was supported by other Labour Deputies and by members of my Party, that he agreed with it.  All it was, of course, was the usual whitewashing and lip sympathy to which we are accustomed in the House.  However, when it comes to going a bit further, exploring the possibility of providing free transport for those old people, the Minister and his colleagues are either too lazy to yield an inch or make it quite clear that they will not do so.  We have another example of it in Merrion Street at this moment, with consequential serious results for the nation.</P>
    <P>From time to time I avail of public transport and am familiar with its operation not alone in this city but in the country.  During my contribution last week on this motion, I made the point that when the workers and the children have been transported in the early morning, the older section of the community then come out, between 10 and 11 a.m.  At that time there are many vacant seats in buses and trains and it is sad to think that we cannot extend to old age pensioners and blind pensioners the facility of travelling free on those vacant seats.  I know I am wasting my time appealing to the Minister to do something about it.</P>
    <P>He pointed out in his statement that there are 146,000 people in this category. Surely the Minister has enough commonsense to realise that thousands of these people are able to walk the short distances required to collect their pensions?  I know scores of them who have no more than 200 yards or at most a quarter mile to walk.  They would prefer to walk.  I am sure Deputy Larkin, who initiated the motion, did not have in mind able-bodied people who can and do walk.  Such people <Col N="1899" /> would not avail of this free transport. They would account for thousands and the Minister therefore threw out the figure of 146,000 as a smokescreen, as dust in the eyes of Deputies and of the general public.  He does not want to give in on this point and endeavoured to make us believe there would be a rush of those people into buses and trains touring the country free.</P>
    <P>Many old age pensioners are well able to jump on their bicycles or drive cars at the age of 70 years.  There is need, however, of free transport for pensioners who are badly able to walk and we ask the Minister to provide that CIE will issue free vouchers to them. The amount involved would be almost negligible.  Many people in this category are charitable and would not occupy a seat if their more needy neighbours required it.  As I have already pointed out, thousands of pensioners would not avail of such free transport.  Therefore, the Minister's attitude is nothing but bluff.  Let me tell him that at local level county councils in remote areas already issue vouchers for free travel to local clinics and this does not cause any great pressure on local authority funds.  Our thanks are due to people like ambulance drivers and others who help aged and needy people by way of free transport.</P>
    <P>This is a year in which we had many celebrations, commemorations and the unveiling of monuments.  I approve of it.  I admire the men who risked their lives in 1916, before it and later.  Many of them paid the supreme sacrifice.  The people we are now discussing lived through that period, lived through British rule in this country. Many of them engaged in building the railroads and assembling the buses and they are now in the age group when they need our help.  It is unbelievable that an Irish Minister can come into the House and refuse pointblank to afford this small facility to old age pensioners.  We must be the greatest hypocrites on God's earth.</P>

I cannot but comment on the fact that when we are here discussing what is no more than our fundamental duty to the aged and the blind of Ireland, there is nobody in the Fianna Fáil benches except the Minister who must be here anyway, and few elsewhere in the House.</P>

      <P>That was a breathing space.  I think, seriously, people will agree that what I am saying is true. The old people we know today in Ireland lived by a set of values and standards which are hard to find today. It is necessary in thinking about this motion that we should try to get into our minds a picture of those of whom we are talking: people who, in the main, never asked for much from this State, from those who went before the native rulers of this State, except a return for their labour; people who were made to carry the great burden of near slavery in their youth through lack of organisation, through the disregard and the contempt of authority; people who have had to live the hard way, the hardest of all possible ways, and who have come to the twilight of their years, many of them still carrying in their bodies the troubles and the illnesses incurred as a result of the inhumanities inflicted upon them by an employing breed of another day.</P>
      <P>These are the people we are talking about, the people who, compared with the present generation, were paragons of conduct and of behaviour.  Many of them, of course, had their faults but the broad picture is that it is hard to find their equals.  Their equals are scarce and I doubt if they are to be found.</P>

      <P>Ní bheidh, gan aon amhras, agus is mór an trua é.  What are we asking here?  Are we asking the country to bankrupt itself?  Are we asking that there should be an enormous strain put on the revenue?  Are <Col N="1902" /> we asking something that would need a Dr. Schacht or somebody of his ability to deal with in terms of raising the necessary finance?  We are not.  In fact, what we are asking is a very minimal thing.  The cost of what we are asking in this motion, I suggest to the House, would be negligible.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Hara has put his finger upon a very important aspect of this motion.  The Minister, in his intervention, said that there are 146,000 people receiving the old age pension&mdash;both the non-contributory and contributory classes, I take it&mdash;and that once provided with the right to free travel, they would invade the transport system of the country and that nobody would get sitting down because every bus would be packed out with old age pensioners, which, of course, is a ridiculous idea. As those of us who use buses know&mdash; at least I do on occasion use buses, although they are not all that much cheaper than using a car nowadays in this city or county&mdash;this idea in the Minister's mind is due to the lack of knowledge of how the people really live.</P>
      <P>As has been pointed out, the number of old age pensioners and blind who could be expected to use the transport system would be only a small proportion of that 146,000, and they would be using the system, it is reasonable to anticipate, at a time when the main burden would have disappeared; in other words, when the workers would be at work and the school children would be gone to school.  The odd old or blind person who would want to use the bus or train would be using it at a time when buses or trains would be running half empty.  Therefore, there is no substance or reality in talk about the cost of this proposal.</P>
      <P>The Minister also suggested that the better way to approach this problem was to increase social welfare allowances. We know the rate at which social welfare allowances have been increased and the method by which old age pensions have been increased. Has it not been our annual shame that we have been able to find only 2/6 or 5/- for the old age pensioner every year?</P>

      <P>I have never been in a position to do anything, yet.  The Deputy will not be an old age pensioner when I will have the opportunity. He will have many years of virility, I hope, left.  For so young a man he betrays an amazingly long memory.  It seems to me he should be more forward-looking.  The young Deputies will achieve nothing by this harking back.  That was the kind of thing that I had to listen to 20 years ago when I came in here.  They were still fighting in the ditches although it was 25 years after.  They were still shooting at one another &mdash; metaphorically, of course&mdash;when I came in some 20 years ago.  Now that has gone.  They are all friends.  That is a good thing for the country.  Let us not have from this new crop of Fianna Fáil Deputies, who will be here only for a short time, as is obvious from what is happening in the country, this harking back to the past.  I suggest to them that as young Deputies they might look forward and think about their duty to the aged and about what can be done for them and what should be done for them.</P>
      <P>Invariably, money is the obstacle when one proposes an improvement in the lot of any section of the community. There are many things for which money can be found with the greatest facility.  One invariably discovers that if the pressure is great enough and if the number of votes is sufficiently large, money will be found but if the number of votes involved is not very large the question of justice does not influence the disposal of money or the deployment of the State's finances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everybody will make sympathetic speeches up and down the country about the aged but here is a very simple proposal which does not entail expenditure except a very small scale but which is met with excuses from the Minister as to why it should be rejected.  The Minister professes sympathy. We have had new Deputies rushing in from their tea.  I suppose we will have tea and sympathy now.  The <Col N="1904" /> Minister professes sympathy with the aged.  He has mentioned charity also. There is the old simile &mdash; as cold as charity.  Charity is no good.  Charity without good works will not be enough to save us&mdash;or am I quoting correctly?</P>

      <P>Deputy Richie Ryan, at column 1612 of the Dáil Debates of 19th October, said, among other things, that he was in favour of the motion.  I say that in fairness to him. He also said something which throws a little sharp light into his mind and shows the sympathy of thought to which I have referred as existing between him and certain members of the Government Party:</P>
      <P>CIE may quite rightly say they test everything by what advantage they get out of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What a horrible attitude to bring to the question of vouchers for free travel for aged persons and the blind, that CIE are entitled to ask: &ldquo;What will <Col N="1905" /> we get out of this?&rdquo;.  This attitude has been expressed by the Minister in a more general and sophisticated way in regard to the running of CIE. I am not going to dilate on his whole policy now for the reason that the Chair would not allow me but the Minister's whole policy has been based upon the idea of CIE making a profit, with no regard to CIE as a public service, and to which CIE has had no regard in the past.  I am drawing a parallel, pointing to the similarity of thought that exists between certain elements in the Government Party and certain elements on the Front Bench of Fine Gael.</P>
    <P>The Minister also referred to a concession which he said is operated by CIE in favour of blind persons whereby blind persons can travel at single fare plus one-third for a round journey. There is an Irish word which could describe that as only an Irish word could.  It is the word &ldquo;gaisce&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I try to be as gaisciúil as it is possible to be but in the real sense of the word.  I try to do good by stealth, as far as possible, unlike many others.  The point I want to make is that this is a contemptible concession.  To make any claim here for it as being meritorious on the part of CIE is a piece of impertinence.  For a Minister to say that it is a concession that blind persons can travel at single fare plus one-third for a round journey shows a shameless attitude towards this whole problem.  The Minister has suggested we should wait until the social welfare payments go up and by that means enable the old aged and blind to pay bus and train fares as they <Col N="1906" /> require.  No reference is made by him to the fact that bus and train fares continue to rise.</P>
      <P>Suggestions were made of the difficulty of evolving a system whereby the classes I refer to might be afforded free travel.  There is no difficulty at all. There are thousands of people in the country who travel free of charge by CIE at the moment.  Thousands of them do not choose to travel by CIE but would prefer to travel by car.  I refer to the employees of CIE.  I do not see why whatever means is employed to provide those facilities for the workers of CIE&mdash;from the top to the bottom&mdash; could not be extended to make free travel available to the blind and the aged.</P>
      <P>We base our claim for this on ordinary common decency and justice. There can be no argument about cost. I know semi-State bodies are at present sending out letters to private citizens asking them for loans.  I have a couple of them in my pocket, where the ESB is looking for loans from private citizens who want to instal electricity.  The ESB is saying: &ldquo;You pay for the whole job and maybe we will refund you the money when the financial situation eases.&rdquo; I do not know if my colleague has seen any of those letters?</P>

Still, here is a case where social good and social justice can be done without imposing any strain other than a negligible strain upon the Exchequer and the Minister puts up all kinds of sympathy and excuses as an answer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>When moving the motion, I expressed on behalf of my Party our appreciation of the willingness of the Minister and members of Fine Gael to consent to taking this motion out of order.  I am afraid that is the only thing for which I can give the Minister any credit.  His whole approach has been a great disappointment to the old aged and blind people.  His contribution to the debate did not show any great sense of humanity or of understanding for the problems of these people.  He did himself less than justice by endeavouring to turn the question into one of whether or not there was a case to be made for an improvement in social <Col N="1908" /> welfare payments.  I do not propose to follow the Minister on that line. I do not think any Deputy would differ from him in regard to the need for an improvement in social welfare payments. I have no doubt that you, Sir, will rule me out of order if I start discussing social welfare on this motion, but was the Minister really applying himself to the problem before the House when he took the line he did?  The motion does not mean that, even if free travel were granted tomorrow, every one of the 146,000 old age and blind pensioners would avail of it.  Not all of them would need to travel to do their shopping in areas where they could shop to the best advantage.  Not all of them would need to visit relatives in hospitals and institutions every day.  Consequently, this figure of 146,000 has just been thrown out by the Minister to justify his opposition and that of his Party to the motion.</P>
      <P>What are we basically concerned with in this motion?  We are basically concerned to endeavour to secure for these people&mdash;and, as Deputy S. Dunne has said, practically all of them have given service to the community in one form or another&mdash;the opportunity of travelling without charge on CIE, whether by bus or by train.  Any Deputy familiar with the circumstances of old age pensioners will know that, at the moment, a considerable number of these people are in institutions.  A considerable proportion of them are living in areas from which they would seldom move away and, to say the least of it, they would infrequently require to travel by bus or by train.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the Minister seriously contend that there would be overcrowding on the buses in the city of Dublin if CIE gave this privilege?  Does he think that anyone normally paying a fare would not be able to get a seat in a bus or train?  Does the Minister think that the income of CIE will suffer?  Of course, it would not. However, it would mean that people who, because of their economic circumstances, are at present unable to make journeys which are necessary would be able to visit a friend or a <Col N="1909" /> relative in hospital and would be able to travel once or twice a week from the outskirts of the city to the areas where food is cheaper and would not be obliged, through economic circumstances, to remain where they are or to depend on the charity of others.</P>
    <P>The Minister and many of his colleagues are very fond of dilating in this House and elsewhere on their belief in private initiative, private enterprise, the sacred role of the individual to make a contribution to the progress of the nation.  In dealing with this motion, the Minister has not for one moment thought of the pensioners as individuals because if he had, he would not produce the type of statistic he used when arguing against it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasOHara" hpid="Mr. O'Hara Mr. O'Hara">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>If he were thinking as one usually thinks in regard to this matter, he would think of these people as individuals, as old men and old women who badly need this facility and would utilise his position as Minister to convey his views to CIE that these people are deserving of the facility.  They are old and many of them will very likely not be with us this day next year.  During the intervening period, at least let them have this facility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been said during this discussion that free transport facilities are available for certain people.  This House approves of special transport facilites for schoolchildren.  The people mainly affected by this motion are not retired senior civil servants, retired senior local authority officers, retired captains of industry, retired Ministers or anybody else: the people affected by this motion are the ordinary retired workers.  They are the people on whose behalf the motion was moved.  I doubt if a former Minister of this House who might be drawing a pension would bother going to CIE to look for a certificate for free transport if he wanted to visit a friend or a relative.  I doubt if former Chairmen of CIE or of other Government bodies, having reached pensionable age, contributory <Col N="1910" /> or non-contributory, would look for the facility to travel free to do their shopping.  I doubt if the senior people in industry, in commerce or in distribution, whether coming from the State, semi-State or private sector of the community, would be looking for the service.</P>
    <P>The people who would need the service and look for it are those who are required to exist on the miserable social services provided in this State. I speak for people to whom the expenditure of a shilling is a matter of serious importance and to whom the expenditure of three shilling on bus fares, going to and coming from town, is a matter of major financial importance. The level of social welfare is not the answer.  Even on the social welfare level the problem does not affect all people because they are not equally affected in so far as their need to utilise public transport is concerned.</P>
    <P>A motion of this nature is of itself to some extent confined.  I was surprised at the Minister's reference that the adoption of this motion might mean that it could be extended on another occasion to the disabled.  Offhand, I do not know the number of disabled in the country but, even if we accept the Minister's contention in relation to those who are disabled, I do not think that would create any very big problem.  I put it to the Members of this House that they should view this motion in the light of their own knowledge and experience of the needs of these people.  For too many of us it seems to be sufficient to award a sum by way of social welfare benefit and then forget all about the recipients. I wonder&mdash;Deputy S. Dunne referred to this&mdash;how many of us would be here tonight, would this House be functioning at all, were it not for the services in the past of the many thousands in relation to whom we are not even prepared, through the Minister for Transport and Power, to inform CIE that it is our view as public representatives that the facility asked for should be made available.</P>
    <P>Judging by the reports in the public press members of the Minister's Party <Col N="1911" /> are not entirely at one with him in this matter.  The gentlemen who sit behind the Minister have not participated in this debate and have not supported in this House the plea made on behalf of these people.  The position seems a little different outside.  Within the past day or so, members of the Minister's Party have gone on record as passing a resolution&mdash;the constituency meeting was presided over by the Minister for Justice&mdash;in favour of old age pensioners being provided with free transport facilities by CIE.  The report of that meeting is in the <i>Irish Times,</i> page 9, of 24th October.</P>
    <P>Perhaps it is not within our competence to convince the Minister for Transport and Power here, and the Deputies who support him, but I wonder will his colleagues who represent Dublin North East, the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Industry and Commerce, heed this resolution passed at a meeting of their constituents?  Or will they offer up a little prayer of thanksgiving that the debate on this motion will conclude before they have an opportunity of indicating here in the House whether they are in favour of the views expressed by some of the people they represent?  I should imagine there will be as great a silence on this occasion as there has been on other occasions in the past.</P>
    <P>I do not accept the contention that this facility would prove impossible of operation.  I have no doubt whatsoever that, if this motion were passed by the House and the Minister indicated in firm language&mdash;he can be very firm on occasion&mdash;to CIE that he expected the principles enshrined in this motion to be given effect to without delay, CIE would have no problem in making the necessary administrative arrangements.</P>
    <P>Very often in this House lipservice is paid to earlier generations, to the people who fought and to the people who struggled and worked, the people who bent their youthful energies and adult years to hard, laborious toil, very often ill-rewarded; lipservice is paid to the contribution they made to the development of this State.  The test of <Col N="1912" /> whether we are really sincere in this lipservice is our attitude when the opportunity comes to reward these people.  Do we take that opportunity? Or do we continue merely to pay lipservice? This House now has an opportunity to do something small for some of these people.  It is not a very costly thing.  The finances of the State will not be endangered.  The balance of payments will not be upset.  It will not result in anyone parading in front of or behind Leinster House.  It will not bankrupt CIE.  All it will do, if the motion is adopted, is convey to the country and to CIE that it is the view of the Members of this House that old age pensioners and blind pensioners who need travel facilities should have them provided free of charge.  As I say, it would not have any effect on the balance of payments nor would the estimates for running the country be upset even if the total cost fell on CIE, if there were any cost, or even if it were to be met by a special Vote or by some assistance from the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>The main effect would be that old people who face serious economic difficulties, and who cannot face the difficulty, especially in winter, of trudging four, five or six miles in inclement weather to visit relatives, consequently deprive their relatives of a visit and through no fault of their own are themselves deprived of this contact with their own family, would have this small facility made available to them.  I see old people going around the city and other Deputies will see them in the towns and villages, and they are very quiet people who do not need very much from life except a warm home, decent clothing and a little food and tobacco, perhaps an occasional drink, but what they do require is the society of their friends and most of all continuous contact with their relatives. Above all, they require that they be able to visit their immediate relatives if they are sick or if they are in hospital dying.  Surely we in this House should no longer avoid making it possible for these people to visit their friends and relatives without sacrifice and to make it possible for them to go into the cheaper market places to buy their <Col N="1913" /> small requirements of food to keep body and soul together.  This is all they need.</P>
    <P>May I say that not too many months ago the President was attending parades in various parts of the country and many of the people who were standing there at those parades were people of <Col N="1914" /> mature years?  Many of the people who paid tribute to those who served this country are themselves in the old age pension classification.  Surely we should avail of this opportunity to help them by passing this motion and I would ask the House to adopt it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £19,606,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1967, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, and of certain other Services administered by that Office, and for payment of a Grant in Aid.</P>
      <P>The net Estimate of £19,606,000 for my Department is shown in the Estimates volume as £859,000 greater than last year's.  Of that increase, £125,000 is in the grant-in-aid to Radio Telefís Éireann for licence revenue, and accordingly the net increase for the service directly provided by my Department would appear to be £734,000.  The actual increase is, in fact, rather less, as an additional £187,000 was provided towards to end of the year in the general Supplementary Estimate for Increases in Remuneration at a time when it was too late to carry out the corresponding charge in the Estimates volume.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1916" /> The subheads with substantial variations from the amounts shown for last year are:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The increase of £450,000 in Salaries, Wages and Allowances is mainly to meet the cost of pay revisions resulting from those claims which my predecessor mentioned in March of last year as not then settled.  There is also provision for additional staff for telephone traffic and postal business in the cities.  The subhead does not, of course, include anything for the 10th round increases, which have either recently been granted or are under negotiation.</P>
    <P>The increase of £87,000 in Travelling and Incidental Expenses is mainly due to higher subsistence rates and to more travelling by engineering staff.</P>
    <P>The reduction of £134,000 for the Conveyance of Mails is the result of revised financial arrangements recently concluded for the conveyance of mails without any disimprovement of services.</P>
    <P>The increase of £63,000 in Postal and General Stores is mainly for the expansion of the postal motor fleet.</P>
    <P>The decrease of £1,211,000 in engineering Stores and Equipment is due to a number of factors.  About £650,000 less is being provided for the purchase of stores.  For reasons mentioned later the amount of stores used last year fell considerably below expectations, and this year's programme will be met in part from stores carried over from last year's purchases.  The allocation for contract works is also down by approximately £650,000.  In part this is because last year, as my predecessor explained at the time, we had to cover extensive contract works at the automatic telex exchange and at the new Central Sorting Office.  Last year we had also to make an exceptionally large provision for extensions to some of the existing automatic telephone exchanges.</P>
    <P>The increase of £589,000 in Telephone Capital Repayments is the result of growth in the capital investment in the telephone service.</P>
    <P>The decrease of £894,000 in Appropriations in Aid arises mainly from <Col N="1917" /> the reduction in the recoveries expected from Telephone Capital funds.</P>
    <P>Letter traffic in 1965 was about one per cent higher than in the previous year.  Christmas postings reached a new record about four per cent above 1964.  The volume of air post continued to increase steeply, first class mail being up by nine per cent and second class mail by 23 per cent.</P>
    <P>Inland parcel traffic fell six per cent below the 1964 level.  Foreign parcel posting, on the other hand, rose by 13 per cent.</P>
    <P>The mails services were directly affected by the CIE transport strike in June, 1965.  The letter services were well maintained by the setting up of an emergency road network using Departmental vehicles.  The operation of the parcel service was, however, seriously hampered by the lack of suitable transport.  Eventually the service had to be suspended, except for local deliveries, shortly before the dispute was settled.  The strike in the Dublin deep sea docks in January last affected deliveries of some incoming American and foreign mails.  The British seamen's strike in May/June last delayed parcel mails to and from Britain and foreign surface mails normally routed through Britain.  The services were kept in operation despite the difficulties.</P>
    <P>The foreign post rates for letters and postcards to Europe and corresponding surface rates to overseas countries were reduced from 1st January last.  This change and other less important ones were effected in implementation of the Universal Postal Union Convention of Vienna, 1964, which was signed by the representatives of 122 countries including Ireland.</P>
    <P>Changes made in the financial arrangements for long haul conveyance of mail have resulted in considerable savings which are reflected in the lower provision under Subhead D to which I have already referred.</P>
    <P>The great bulk of postal expenditure under other headings consists of staff costs.  The service is, in fact, a typical labour intensive service: it employs a very large labour force and comparatively little capital.  Even small increases <Col N="1918" /> in staff costs may result in substantial increases in total postal expenditure. A per cent wage increase, for instance, costs the postal service about £60,000 a year.  The possibilities of absorbing even modest wage increases are therefore extremely limited.</P>
    <P>The survey referred to in my predecessor's statement on the Estimate for 1965-66 has shown that there is considerable scope for motorising rural delivery services.  During 1965, 122 extra postmen's routes were motorised. Although motorisation cannot offer spectacular savings&mdash;at least while delivery is made on a door-to-door basis&mdash;it does provide the only prospect, short of retrenchment of services, of reducing the heavy losses on rural delivery.  In this regard the broad position on most rural posts is that the total postage on items delivered does not cover even the wages of the postman.</P>
    <P>Amalgamation of posts on motorisation led to a reduction of 63 rural posts which was partially offset by the creation of 26 new full-time posts in cities and larger towns.  These were required mainly to serve new housing estates.</P>
    <P>A new sub-post office was opened in the Industrial Estate at Shannon. Thirteen sub-post offices with an insignificant volume of business were closed on the occurrence of vacancies.</P>
    <P>The general closing time for counter business at sub-post offices was, on the recommendation of the Commission of Inquiry into the Sub-Office System, advanced from 6.30 p.m. to 5.30 p.m. Exceptionally, there is 6.0 p.m. closing on Fridays.  The same closing hours have recently been introduced at all Departmentally staffed post offices outside Dublin city except Cork, Limerick, and a few of the other large offices where the closing time is 6.0 p.m. throughout the week.  The position at the Departmentally staffed Dublin offices is still under consideration.</P>
    <P>The new Dublin Central Sorting Office at Sheriff Street is due to be completed early next year.  We can then start on the operation of centralising it in the new building work which is at <Col N="1919" /> present being carried out in five separate premises.  This operation will have to be carried out in stages.  The availability of suitable accommodation and facilities will enable certain mail distribution work now being performed under contract to be taken over by the Department.</P>
    <P>Modern mail handling machinery, including semi-automatic parcel and packet sorting machines and conveying equipment of various kinds, is being installed.  Automatic letter sorting machines will not be provided in the new premises initially but accommodation has been earmarked for them. The development of mechanisation in the field of letter sorting even in the most highly industralised countries has been rather slow, mainly because letter traffic consists of items which differ widely in size, shape, weight and consistency. It now appears that most of the technical difficulties are in sight of being resolved.  In anticipation of the successful development and extensive use of such machines, the Universal Postal Union has adopted a resolution on the standardisation of sizes of envelopes needed to facilitate mechanisation.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the time required to prepare the way for eventual mechanisation it is not too early to join with other countries in taking certain measures recommended in the UPU resolution to which I have referred and it is proposed to do so after consultation with manufacturers and other interests concerned.</P>
    <P>Thanks to the co-operation of the public, the use of district numbers on letters addressed to places in the Dublin numbered districts continues to grow.  Over 70 per cent of the letters delivered now bear the district numbers.</P>
    <P>Special postage stamps were issued in 1965 to commemorate the centenary of the International Telecommunication Union, the centenary of the birth of William Butler Yeats and to mark 1965 as International Co-Operation year.  We also joined with other member countries of the European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications <Col N="1920" /> Administrations in producing a further &ldquo;Europa&rdquo; issue in 1965.</P>
    <P>So far as the programme for 1966 is concerned, the set of eight stamps in commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the Easter Rising, 1916, was placed on sale as from 12th April last.  Our most recent issues have been one in honour of Roger Casement and another in the Europa series.  The 1966 programme will be completed on 8th November by the issue of a stamp commemorating the 750th Anniversary of the founding of Ballintubber Abbey.</P>
    <P>Recommendations for the proposed new series of permanent postage stamps have been received from the Stamp Design Advisory Committee and are at present being considered.</P>
    <P>An arrangement has been made with the United Nations for the sale of United Nations postage stamps. Supplies are stocked at the Philatelic Section, GPO, Dublin 1.</P>
    <P>The total number of telegrams handled continued to decline, but the drop of 6 per cent to 1,384,000 in 1965 was somewhat less than in the previous year.  The decrease in the number of internal telegrams and telegrams to and from Great Britain and Northern Ireland was again partly offset by an increase of about 23,000 in incoming and outgoing foreign telegrams.  The trend has continued for many years, and foreign telegrams now account for 25 per cent of the total number of telegrams handled as compared with only 8 per cent ten years ago.</P>
    <P>Despite the overall decrease in telegraph traffic, revenue from telegrams increased by about £20,000 in 1965-66 largely because this was the first full year of operation of the increased charges introduced in 1964.</P>
    <P>During the year, Norway was included in the Gentex service which provides for direct transmission of telegrams to and from certain continental countries.  Direct connection by automatic switching is now available between this country and six continental countries in all, that is Belgium, France, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Norway.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1921" /> Two direct telegraph circuits by submarine cable are now also available to the United States; they are used both for telegrams and telex calls.</P>
    <P>I mentioned last year that the continuing decline in telegraph traffic makes it possible to cease teleprinter working at certain offices which are connected to the teleprinter automatic switching, TAS, system.  Of the 22 TAS offices which were working last year, one office was closed recently and another will be closed shortly. When a TAS office is closed, telegrams are diverted to a neighbouring office which can more economically handle the traffic.</P>
    <P>The demand for telex has continued to grow.  Since the conversion to automatic working in October, 1964, the number of subscribers has nearly doubled.  The present figure is 376 and there is a waiting list of 135.</P>
    <P>The telex exchange was completely full at the end of July, but a new extension which is almost completed has made it possible to recommence connection of new subscribers.  This extension will increase the capacity of the exchange to about 900 and a further extension is under consideration.</P>
    <P>Every effort is being made to reduce the number in the waiting list and to get back to the position where service can be provided within a month or two.  To this end additional engineering staff are being trained on telex work and it is hoped to make a progressive speed up in the connection rate as the staff gain experience. Even so, because of the size of the waiting list, it is likely that those applying now will in general have to wait at least six months for service. In some engineering districts where the demand for telex is light, it may be possible to provide service in a shorter period but in certain areas circuits are not readily available and the delay in providing service may be substantially more than six months.</P>
    <P>Telex service is now available to 105 countries.  During 1965 traffic internally and to Great Britain increased by 33? per cent.  Outgoing foreign calls increased by 64 per cent. <Col N="1922" /> The increase in the number of calls is due in part to the fact that in the automatic service subscribers can make short calls at very low rates to Great Britain and several European countries. Net telex receipts in 1965-66 were about £164,000, an increase of almost 38 per cent on the previous year.</P>
    <P>Expansion of the telephone service was maintained at a generally satisfactory rate during the financial year 1965-66.  The traffic handled totalled over 217 million calls which represented an increase of almost 19 million on the previous year.  There were 194 million local calls, of which 86 per cent were automatic, and 23 million trunk calls of which 23 per cent were automatic.  The proportion of automatic calls was 80 per cent overall; in other words, 4 calls out of every 5, local and trunk, were dialled direct.</P>
    <P>The improvement and extension of the trunk network and exchange system were continued during the year. This work is essential to secure an efficient standard of service and to lay the basis for further expansion.  It is necessary to devote a considerable proportion of our total resources to these features of development and for the present this will continue to set a limit to what can be done in the connection of new subscribers.</P>
    <P>In the case of the trunk network nearly 1,400 additional circuits were brought into service on some 240 routes.  A further 420 circuits have been provided in the first quarter of the current financial year.  Most of these circuits are in underground or aerial cable or in radio links, so that the quality and reliability of the service was improved on many routes which had up to then been dependent on open wire systems.  Major underground trunking schemes have been completed between Cork-Bandon, Limerick-Kilmallock, Limerick-Tipperary and Dublin-Drogheda, a Cork-Youghal coaxial cable has been brought close to completion and the coaxial cable laid between Carlow-Athy-Portlaoise was brought into full service.  In addition about 45 aerial cable schemes were completed.</P>
    <P>In the service to Britain 48 additional <Col N="1923" /> circuits were established and since March last a further 20 have been added.  The addition of a further 100 is planned during the next 12 months.  The number of trans-Atlantic channels to North America was increased from four to six, the additional circuits in this case being provided via the Satellite, Early Bird.  The satellite route is giving an excellent service and is an example of the great progress being made in telecommunications today.</P>
    <P>Good progress has been made also with the replacement of manual exchanges by automatic installations. During 1965-66 25 exchanges were converted to automatic working, including such important ones as Arklow, Athy, Carlow, Ennis, Tullamore and Wicklow. So far in the current financial year 34 additional exchanges have been converted, including those at Ballinasloe, Mallow, Mountmellick, Portarlington and Tipperary.  The total installed capacity of these new exchanges amounts to 8,000 lines which will cater for growth for several years ahead, and there is in all cases adequate space available for future expansion as required.</P>
    <P>New exchanges were opened in Dublin at Blanchardstown and Finglas to replace existing ones which owing to rapid development had become inadequate for traffic needs in these areas, and at Phibsboro to cater for growing requirements in this area of the city.  In Cork a new exchange was opened at Wellington Road to serve the north side of the city.</P>
    <P>Twenty existing automatic exchanges were extended by some 8,000 lines and additional capacity was provided at over 100 manual exchanges.</P>
    <P>Six small manual and two small automatic exchanges were opened in new areas to cater for development.</P>
    <P>Concerning the connection of new subscribers, the number of installations totalled 13,500.  This figures would have been substantially higher but for the effects of storms and floods towards the end of the year.  The extensive damage caused to plant in many parts <Col N="1924" /> of the country in November and December necessitated the diversion of a lot of our installation staff to repair work.  The position was also aggravated by labour difficulties.  Notwithstanding these various obstacles the waiting list was reduced from 14,260 at 31st March, 1965, to 13,300 at 31st March this year.  It now stands at approximately 13,200, of which 2,700 are in course of installation.</P>
    <P>Moreover, there has been a substantial change in the composition of the list.  Progress was made in clearing older applications which had been deferred repeatedly because they required very extensive construction work.  The bulk of these have been attended to, and the work involved was out of proportion to the number of connections made.</P>
    <P>The telephone service felt the effects of labour unrest in industry generally. Strikes and threatened strikes produced quite abnormal pressure on the telephone system, causing at times sharp deterioration in the standard of service, as well as delaying the installation of the additional exchange equipment which had been ordered to enable peak traffic to be carried.</P>
    <P>The impact of all these factors showed the service in an unfavourable light at times, and some justifiable complaint resulted.  I have no wish to endeavour to minimise the seriousness of the inconvenience caused to telephone users in these circumstances but it is only fair to say that everything possible was done within the limits of our resources to cater for the exceptional surges of traffic.</P>
    <P>I know that it may not be a great comfort to people experiencing inconvenience or having cause for dissatisfaction with the telephone service to be told that Ireland is not the only country with these difficulties.  Nevertheless I feel bound to say that it would be wrong to think that such deficiencies as exist in our telephone service are, internationally speaking, unique or exceptional. Those with experience of telephone service in other European countries or who read the foreign press know that waiting lists for telephones <Col N="1925" /> and just complaints about the service are not a peculiarly Irish disease.  The reasons for the difficulties existing in other administrations are much the same as here, the vast capital expenditure required to meet the explosive increase in the demand for telephone facilities, and the lengthy period required to effect significant improvements.</P>
    <P>These are the greatest problems in providing a satisfactory telephone service. Concerning the capital requirement it should suffice to say that although we spent £23½ millions in the last five years as against £7¾ millions in the previous five, it was obviously not enough.  In regard to the time aspect the position is that, despite every possible short cut, major extensions to equipment take several years to arrange.  Very often new buildings have to be provided and the acquisition of sites, erection of buildings, securing delivery of equipment and having it installed all contain elements of uncertainty as regards date of completion which can be affected by innumerable factors.</P>
    <P>The long-term planning constantly proceeding is not, of course, confined to equipment.  It is also necessary to build up the force of skilled men engaged in engineering work.  Our technicians undergo academic and field training over a period of four years. The intake of trainees for the skilled force has been raised progressively over a period of years so that we now have 400 youths being trained to provide for the future growth and maintenance of the service as compared with 87 six years ago.  The benefits of this increase in intake will not be fully felt until the training is completed and the men are assigned to full duty. Their advent to the skilled ranks will be most welcome, especially on the maintenance side as the growing size and complexity of the system necessitates a continuing increase in skilled maintenance staff.  When it is remembered that there are over 160,000 exchange lines, 1,100 exchanges, 10,000 trunk circuits and 1,300 kiosks a fair idea can be obtained of the scale of the maintenance job to be done.</P>
    <P>Turning to the future, it is intended <Col N="1926" /> to continue in the current financial year with the work of developing the trunk and exchange network in order to equip it to cater for increased growth.  A new co-axial cable which has been laid between Sligo and Letterkenny will be in full service by next summer.  Contracts have been placed for major cable schemes between Athlone-Ballina, Cork-Bantry-Skibbereen, Dundalk-Castleblaney-Monaghan, Cavan-Mullingar, and Arklow-Gorey-Enniscorthy.  These schemes should be completed in about three years, but some advance circuits will be available before then. In conjunction with these schemes, extensive development has been or will be undertaken on branch spurs off the main routes and when the work is done service from these areas will be greatly improved.</P>
    <P>Tenders are under consideration for a new radio link route to supplement the southern co-axial cable serving Cork, Limerick, and Waterford.  This is a very important scheme which will have the additional advantage of making available alternative routing for traffic in the event of failure in or damage to the underground co-axial cable.</P>
    <P>Agreement in principle has been reached with the British Post Office for the provision of a new cross-Channel route by means of a radio link through Northern Ireland.  The new route will have a capacity of 960 circuits.  It will make possible the introduction of subscriber dialling to Britain and further afield as well as to the Six Counties.</P>
    <P>In regard to the exchange automatisation programme, we have in hands orders for a large number of exchanges which will engage our resources of staff and capital for a period ahead, and these will be pressed forward with all possible speed.  The foundations for a fully satisfactory service are being laid and it is my intention to build on them until the country has the first class telephone system that it needs.</P>
    <P>Concerning the installation of new telephones, I am hopeful that we will be able to effect a further reduction <Col N="1927" /> in the waiting list during the current financial year and I intend to continue the policy of providing service for applicants who have been a long time waiting even though installation of their lines involves and abnormal volume of work.</P>
    <P>Deposits in the Post Office Savings Bank amounted to £24.2 million during 1965 and withdrawals to £24.4 million. At 31st December, 1965, the total balance due to depositors, including interest, was approximately £109.9 million as compared with £107.5 million at the end of the previous year.</P>
    <P>Deposits and withdrawals by the Trustee Savings Banks during the year amounted to £1 million and £1.2 million respectively, and the total amount, including interest, to the credit of the Trustee Banks at the end of the year, was £19.4 million, an increase of £0.5 million over the previous year.</P>
    <P>Sales of Savings Certificates for 1965 amounted to £5,408,000 and repayments, including interest, amounted to £4,351,000.  The net accretion for the year was £1,057,000.  A new Seventh issue of Savings Certificates was placed on sale as from 19th March last.  The compound interest rate over the eight years to maturity of the new certificates averages 5¼ per cent per annum.  As the interest is exempt from income tax, this gives the equivalent of 8 per cent per annum gross to a holder who is liable for tax at a standard rate of 7s.</P>
    <P>The volume of funds handled by the Department's remittance and agency services continues to increase.  The total value of money orders and postal orders issued during 1965 was nearly £28 million, this being £300,000 more than in the previous year.  Social Welfare and other agency service payments went up substantially from £39 million to nearly £42 million.</P>
    <P>During the year a new post office and telephone exchange at Youghal and a new district sorting office at Harmonstown, Dublin, were completed. A telephone exchange building and engineering centre was provided at Kilkenny and telephone exchange buildings <Col N="1928" /> were erected at Tipperary and Wellington Road, Cork.  Major extensions to existing exchange buildings were carried out at various centres elsewhere and 54 new rural automatic exchanges were built.</P>
    <P>Construction of the new trunk exchange in Dame Court, Dublin, was finished recently and an improvement scheme at Greystones post office, County Wicklow, has also been completed.</P>
    <P>Works in progress include a new post office and engineering centre at Carlow, new automatic telephone exchange buildings at Gorey and Swords, an automanual telephone exchange building at Tralee, extensions to the Mullingar and Walkinstown telephone exchanges and the erection of 45 rural automatic exchanges.  As I have already mentioned, the new Central Sorting Office for Dublin is nearly completed.</P>
    <P>The number of staff provided for in the current year's Estimate is 18,923, an increase of 254 on last year's figure. The increase is due mainly to the continued growth of the telephone service, necessitating a greater number of staff, particularly telephonists, to deal with the extra traffic.</P>
    <P>Staff costs in the Post Office, as elsewhere, continue to increase each year but every effort is made to offset these increases by the adoption of more efficient and economical methods.  As was mentioned on a number of occasions before, the Department has its own full-time Organisations and Methods Staff and substantial economies have been achieved as a result of their activities over the years.</P>
    <P>During the year a firm of industrial consultants was commissioned to carry our an examination of the organisation, grading and methods of work at sub-professional level in the Department's Engineering Branch.  This examination has been in progress for some months, but it is extensive in scope and will take some time to complete.  It is not possible therefore at this stage to say what the outcome of it will be.  During the past year also, firms of industrial consultants were invited to carry our <Col N="1929" /> preliminary surveys of clerical procedures in Headquarters offices to assess what scope there might be for extending the use of automatic data processing equipment.  The results of the preliminary surveys undertaken have been encouraging and it is expected that one of the firms concerned will be commissioned shortly to carry out the full-scale examination necessary to enable maximum savings to be realised.</P>
    <P>Within the past two years, five-day week working has been introduced for many grades in the Department. Claims for grades which have not yet a five-day week are at present under consideration by the Department's conciliation council.</P>
    <P>As Deputies know, the report of the Commission of Inquiry into Certain Aspects of the Sub-Post Office System was published last year and my decisions on the recommendations of the Commission announced.  Various matters relating to these recommendations are under discussion at the Sub-Postmasters' Conciliation Council.</P>
    <P>The Department did not, I regret, escape its share of labour troubles during the past year.  I do not propose, however, to rake over old fires by commenting further on these now and I would like to take this opportunity of extending publicly to the staff in general my thanks for the work done throughout the year.</P>
    <P>Deputies are aware that we are in membership of the international organisations covering the postal and telecommunications fields and that the Department participates actively in the work of these bodies.  The contributions which we have been able to make towards solving problems of common interest have been generously recognised by international conferences in selecting Irish officials to fill important roles at these meetings. When the plenipotentiary conference of the International Telecommunications Union was held in the autumn of last year, Ireland was elected for the first time to the Administrative Council &mdash;the governing body of the Union&mdash; and an official of the Department was <Col N="1930" /> elected Vice-President of the Council.</P>
    <P>The services of officials of the Department have been sought also in other international activities and, at present, six officers selected by the Universal Postal Union and the International Telecommunications Union are serving in Afghanistan, Ceylon, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, and Liberia assisting with and advising on certain postal and telecommunications problems. In addition, six United Nations scholarships holders from middle Eastern countries and South Korea came here this year to study various aspects of Post Office services.</P>
    <P>The Commercial Accounts for 1964-65, have been laid on the table of the House.  A summary of the results for that year and for the four preceeding years is given in Appendix C to the Estimate.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, the Commercial Accounts present the position of the Department as a trading concern. They are compiled in accordance with commercial practice to show the expenditure incurred and the income earned during the year of account, such charges as interest and depreciation being included in the expenditure. A balance sheet and statement of assets gives details of the Department's very large capital investments, mainly in telephone plant.  The accounts are audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
    <P>It is to these accounts we look in determining financial policy, including the fixing of charges.  The basic principle of that policy is that the Post Office should pay its way, taking one year with another.  That means at the very least that the Department must earn a surplus in good years to meet the losses in bad years and to provide a reserve against contingencies.  If the Post Office were not to pay its way, the loss would have to be made good by taxpayers generally.</P>
    <P>There was an over-all loss on the Department's services in 1964-65 of £67,000 approximately, compared with a loss of £165,000 approximately in the previous year.  In both years losses on the postal and telegraph services were <Col N="1931" /> partially offset by a surplus on the telephone service.  Final figures for last year are not yet available but the indications are that there will be a small surplus, probably of the order of £300,000 on a total expenditure of nearly £19½ millions.  I would expect the result this year to be approximately the same if costs do not rise substantially above their present level.</P>
    <P>From the long-term aspect, the position is that about 60 per cent of the Department's expenditure is on wages, salaries and related payments and such costs generally are continuing to rise.  Other developments are also making for higher costs.  The expansion of the sub-structure of the telecommunications network&mdash;exchanges, trunk circuits, etc.&mdash;requires the investment of large quantities of capital on which interest has to be paid and provision made for depreciation.  Until that sub-structure can be fully developed the investment may not bring in adequate additional revenue.  On the postal side, the expansion of cities and towns necessitates more postmen and delivery offices for the outlying areas and it is difficult to make corresponding savings in the areas where population is declining.  It will be realised that the Department's financial position is likely to be a cause of continuing concern.</P>
    <P>The grant to Radio Telefís Éireann, calculated in the usual manner, is provided for in Subhead K.  The increase of £125,000 over the 1965-66 provision is because of the expected growth in revenue from combined licences as more people get television sets.  In this connection Deputies will remember that the Broadcasting Authority (Amendment) Bill, 1965, which was debated in this House in February, provided that the Authority should continue to receive the full net proceeds of broadcasting licence revenue for each of the five years ending 31st March, 1970.  The Bill was passed by the Seanad without amendment and is now law.</P>
    <P>This Estimate is being taken a good deal later than usual.  Accordingly, unlike other years, Deputies have had <Col N="1932" /> the opportunity of reading Radio Telefís Éireann's annual report for the past financial year.  As the recent annual report is a mine of information on the happenings of the year 1965-66, I assume that Deputies will not expect me to say as much as usual about radio and television questions, particularly as my Second Reading speech on the Broadcasting Authority (Amendment) Bill went into details on financial matters.</P>
    <P>I would, however, like to refer briefly to two points mentioned in the annual report.  The first concerns the postponement of an adjustment of the rates for television advertisements because of the Government's price stabilisation policy.  In replying to the debate on the Second Reading of the Broadcasting Authority (Amendment) Bill on 1st February, 1966, I referred to the Government's intervention on this matter and said that it was something which would have to be re-examined. It has in fact, been re-considered and the Government recently agreed that the Authority could revise television advertising rates by reference to the increase in set-count since the last revision, on condition that Radio Telefís Éireann will not draw on the Exchequer for capital purposes in the financial year 1967-68.</P>
    <P>I understand that in accordance with that decision revised advertisement rates will be introduced as from 1st December next.  I might say that the Authority have not sought any Exchequer advances for capital purposes since February, 1964, and that no provision for such advances has been made in the current year.</P>
    <P>The second point I should like to mention is the extension in sound broadcasting hours with effect from 1st October, 1966.  From time to time the Authority pressed strongly for permission to introduce day-long radio broadcasting.  Last year I informed the authority that their proposals, which would have involved an increase in the radio licence fee, could not be accepted during the current period of economic difficulties and that I did not favour any new commitment which would have the effect of increasing the deficit <Col N="1933" /> on sound broadcasting.  Subsequently the Authority re-examined their proposals with maximum economy in view and decided to tackle the problem in two stages.</P>
    <P>During the first stage, broadcasting hours would be extended to fill the broadcasting gap between 10 a.m. and 1 p.m. Thus the gap between 3 p.m. and 5 p.m. would be left over for a later day.  I submitting its proposals for filling the morning gap the Authority stressed the desirability of increasing the hours of broadcasting concurrently with the coming into operation of the VHF transmitters. The new proposals were estimated to cost £25,000 nett per annum.  I was assured that this could be met out of the Authority's general revenue, and that the Authority would not seek any adjustment in the radio licence fee by reason of the extension.  In the circumstances I was glad to be able to give my consent to the increase in hours which I feel sure will be very welcome to the public.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, eight members of the Authority were reappointed for a further five years until 31st May, 1971, but the former Chairman, Mr. Eamonn Andrews did not wish to be considered for re-appointment and was replaced by Dr. C. S. Andrews.  More recently, the Government appointed Mr. Michael O'Callaghan to fill the vacancy caused by the death in tragic circumstances of Mr. E. B. MacManus who had been a member of the Authority since it was established on 1st June, 1960.  The Government have already placed on record their appreciation of the valuable work done by Mr. Andrews and I should like now to express its appreciation of Mr. MacManus's services during the initial difficult stages of the development of the Irish TV service.</P>
    <P>As I said in the Dáil recently in reply to a Parliamentary Question, it has been decided to request Radio Telefís Éireann to provide a multichannel television-aerial service in the Ballymun housing project in view of the special circumstances which apply there, and details of the scheme are at present being worked out.  The special <Col N="1934" /> circumstances are that reception of Telefís Éireann programmes on indoor aerials in the two-storey houses at Ballymun will not be satisfactory, because of adjacent high buildings, and that it will not be possible for residents to have individual outdoor aerials, because of the unique features of the building project.</P>
    <P>My predecessor mentioned last year that the Government had decided that the Council of Europe Agreement aimed against pirate broadcasting stations operating on board ships anchored outside national territories should be signed on behalf of Ireland, subject to ratification.  Each party to the Council of Europe Agreement undertakes to take appropriate steps to make punishable as offences, the establishment or operation of such broadcasting stations and acts of collaboration knowingly performed.  Fresh legislation will be necessary before the Agreement can be ratified.  I cannot say yet when it is likely to be introduced, but my Department will follow with great interest the parliamentary debates in Britain on the same subject.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the Vote be referred back for reconsideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When speaking last year on this Estimate, my Party moved to refer it back because of the delay in the installation <Col N="1936" /> of telephones.  The same reasons are present this year but regrettably there are many other reasons also, to which I shall come later.  First, I should like briefly to refer to one or two points which arise in connection with the Minister's speech.  I should like to congratulate the members of his Department on their recognition in an international way and on the recognition which has placed one official of the Department in an important post as vice-chairman of one of the international bodies. Lest I should forget it later, I want to say now that the criticisms which I shall level at the Department are not levelled at individuals there who do their duty well by the public but against the overall policy for which the Minister is responsible.  That is the reason for the criticism I shall make. The personnel of the Department and the other people in it have done their work well in very difficult conditions.</P>
    <P>To begin with the delay in the installation of telephones, I should say that the telephone service is the paying part of the Department and should be pushed forward by every means at the Minister's disposal.  The Minister said that on the 31st January, 1966, outstanding applications for telephones amounted to 12,667.  That was in answer to a Parliamentary question earlier.  This evening he has just told us that the latest figure is 13,200.  That reflects a degree of buoyancy on the part of our citizens who hopefully come looking for telephones but it does not reflect any credit on the Minister and his Department.</P>
    <P>The telephone service is starved of capital expenditure on telephones and has been for many years.  The Minister has not taken the optimistic view of the future taken in other branches of the Irish economy.  There is not much point in labouring the disadvantages which an inadequate telephone service entails for a country which like our own is trying by every means to increase its industrial and commercial ability.  That policy has been a very serious hindrance to us and I feel that if this part of the work of the Department <Col N="1937" /> were managed by an industrial concern, capital expenditure would have been made so that instead of having to wait for telephones we would have men calling on or ringing up subscribers asking them to lay in extensions to their telephones.  That could be done if matters like these were handled in a commercial fashion.  I do not propose, nor do my Party propose, that the telephone service should be handed over to a commercial concern. I merely make a comparison and point out what would be done if the service were managed by such a company.  I wish to point out that this should be handled by some sort of State enterprise.</P>
    <P>Before I go into this question further, I should like briefly to refer to some of the dissatisfaction expressed by Deputies from various parts of the country showing that this shortage of telephones is widespread.  I have a note that Deputy.  Sweetman in February last referred to the grave shortage in Maynooth.  In November last year, Deputy Gogan, from the Fianna Fáil benches, referred to outstanding applications in the Cabra area.  Deputy Fitzpatrick from Cavan asked questions about his area.  Deputy T. O'Donnell asked about the shortage in Limerick city and county and was told there were 595 on the waiting list.  Deputy Donegan asked about Dundalk and Drogheda and was told there were 80 and 84, respectively, waiting for telephones. Deputy Harte was told about the shortage in Donegal and Deputy Esmonde, not for the first time, was told that the waiting list in Wexford was 330.  Deputy Mullen was told there were more than 220 awaiting telephones in Finglas and other Deputies, including those from Dún Laoghaire, Rathdown and from County Dublin, were told about shortages in their areas. Deputy Gilhawley referred to the waiting list in Sligo and Deputy Government made inquiries about shortages in Carlow.</P>
    <P>I shall not go into the position in each constituency but from what I have said it is quite clear that there is widespread need for a better telephone service.  That is the picture as <Col N="1938" /> we see it and as the Minister and his officials must see it.  Far from the position having improved since last January, it has slipped back.  We in Fine Gael feel that because the Government have resisted all proposals to convert the telephone service into a State enterprise, we should try to get across to the public that it is a commercial enterprise and that as a commercial enterprise the profits made in it should encourage the Government to spend more by way of capital investment. It is treated as if it were part of the services administered by any other Department, as if revenue and expenditure were entirely unconnected. They are not entirely unconnected in the telephone service; they bear an exact relationship.  It must be realised by the Minister that the more money spent on the telephone service, in the installation of new telephones, the more he will get back.  This is an expanding thing and we urge that the telephone service should be separated from the other services administered by this Department.  We urge that it be converted into a State enterprise.</P>
    <P>In relation to other points, the fairest thing to say is that the information we have is not sufficient to enable us to determine exactly whether the needs of the public would be best met by the postal service being handled by a State enterprise.  It may be that the postal service would also benefit from such a change.  Certainly the telephone service would.  It would take us away from the idea that revenue and expenditure have little in common.  A telephone service is something which a modern State gives to its citizens and if the profit from it should be taken directly into the Exchequer as a gift to the Exchequer and not just taken in as part of receipts, like taxation receipts, the service must suffer.</P>
    <P>I should like at this point to quote from an interesting report which has just been published by the Research and Technological Survey team appointed by the Minister for Industry and Commerce in November, 1963, in association with OECD.  Volume No. 1 of the main Report is entitled. <Col N="1939" /><i>Science and Irish Economic Development.</i> I should like to read some of the remarks which this body, composed of very distinguished persons, said about public bodies and enterprises concerned with electronic equipment, radio television, Posts and Telegraphs and the Army Signal Corps.  I quote from page 121:</P>
    <P>The technological changes which could be introduced regarding electronic equipments, as indicated in Part 5, mainly require design with some research and rationalisation to replace imports, to make more intermediates and to raise exports.  To reduce restrictions on these technological changes, it might be preferable to establish the telecommunications part of Posts and Telegraphs as a separate public enterprise.</P>
    <P>Action proposed for consideration:</P>
    <P>Establish telecommunications as a public enterprise with freedom to encourage electronic equipment use, technical development and increased manufacture of components in Ireland and to encourage joint research and contract research.</P>
    <P>That part refers briefly to the valuable help which the telecommunications section of Posts and Telegraphs could give to the other parts of the public service.</P>
    <P>I should like to read some more of this very interesting publication.  Under the section dealing with the Postal Service, it says at pages 139 and 140:</P>
    <P>The level of technology is low in some post offices, particularly in many urban areas where the load factor is highest.  Queues are common. There are many different types of forms including duplicates to be handled.  Automatic franking for use by the public, apart from that used by some business offices, is non-existent and many of the post offices themselves are apparently sited without regard for vehicle parking or customer convenience.  There appears therefore to be an urgent need for research into the whole working of post offices with a view to rationalisation of procedures, modern equipment, new methods of speeding <Col N="1940" /> transactions, location of office and types of service to be automated. This may have to extend into standards of envelope shape for easier handling and franking, optimising postal routes and development of improved house post box systems and their location to save time and costs for postmen.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to this question of standardisation of types of envelopes which had been brought up at the Universal Postal Union, and we can see from this that it concerns our own Irish technologists in connection with the Post Office.  We know that many post offices are located in the wrong places.  That is not so easy to change. I do not want to blame the Post Office for things which happened many years ago, but I should like to see a realisation that a great deal of the premises and a great deal of the methods are in need of change&mdash;what the ancients used to call the &ldquo;divine discontent&rdquo;, and the &ldquo;divine discontent&rdquo; with a great deal of the conditions in the post office and telephone service would be a very healthy thing for us.</P>
    <P>The publication goes on to say:</P>
    <P>The Survey is aware that many of the foregoing considerations have been studied and are constantly taken into account by the postal authorities.  It is also known that surveys are made regarding the services provided and the siting of new offices... The postal system, however, which is one of the oldest operated by any government agency, uses technologies which have changed relatively little in most countries for the past 100 years.  It is now evident that the social and economic changes taking place demand technological changes in services of this type, and some new techniques in research, notably that of operational research, would have particular application in bringing about improvements.  New efforts therefore, using new techniques, both by the postal authorities and by sponsored research bodies appear worthy of serious consideration.</P>
    <P>We would be interested to hear from the Minister as to how far that is being done in his Department.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1941" /> There are a couple of paragraphs which I would claim the indulgence of the House to read concerning the telephone service, on the same page of this publication.  It says:</P>
    <P>The telephone service is undergoing severe stress in relation to economic expansion and it is barely meeting demand.</P>
    <P>That is a very nice way of putting it, and I said earlier, that is, before I had read it, that the expansion of Irish industry and of commerce generally which has been going on here for a long time has not been matched by postal expansion.</P>
    <P>Many weeks and sometimes months of delay occur in installing new phones and any long-term plan for the expansion of this service may need revision.  It is also likely that within the next 15 years a demand for centralised computer services linked possibly with teleprinter communication will occur, e.g. for industrial engineering design needs.  In many countries the telecommunications authority uses its large volume of business to foster design development, through research, of improved telecommunications equipment. Much of this may not be very expensive research provided one keeps outside of the satellite field. With expansion expected and taking place in the electrical engineering industry in Ireland, contract research from the Department of Posts and Telegraphs might be fostered with economic advantage.</P>
    <P>In general, however, a separation of the telecommunications services from Posts and Telegraphs, and possibly its establishment as a public enterprise, might help to foster a faster development of this service which could lead to new industrial products, possibly for export.</P>
    <P>There is more of that but I think possibly it is too technical to read out here.  However, as I have quoted, the publication says: &ldquo;With expansion expected and taking place in the electrical engineering industry in Ireland, contract research from the Department of Posts and Telegraphs might be <Col N="1942" /> fostered with economic advantage&rdquo;.  In that connection I notice the Minister said that in Ballymun the Department of Posts and Telegraphs themselves were putting in an overall radio and television system; in other words, piped television and radio, on account of the grouping of the buildings in that area. I should like to ask the Minister whether he has got other tenders from Irish companies.  There are a number of companies who could undertake that work and would very gladly tender for it.</P>

      <P>I like to see firms who are taxpayers in the country being entrusted with work of that sort by Departments of State because it is a great help to an Irish firm or to any firm, to be able to say that they have carried out work successfully for a Department or a section of a Department of their own country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think I have shown that there is a <i>prima facie</i> case for examining very closely the advisability of separating the postal service from the main body of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and that it is extremely likely that big savings would be made. Because of the very nature of government, something inherent in it&mdash;there is no use in beating the Minister <Col N="1943" /> with the weaknesses of government &mdash;a Government Department is not equipped to finance readily capital expenditure because there are so many demands on the Exchequer, demands which have more political significance on many occasions&mdash;and I do not necessarily mean that in any denigratory way; I mean it in the sense that there are demands on the Exchequer for payment of social services and so on and telephones might take a place behind them, the fact being that the more successful the telephone service, the more money would be made available for our ever-growing social services. At the same time, we in Fine Gael feel that a very close inquiry should be made into the postal services. I have not enough information to say, standing here, definitely that we are in favour of running the postal services as a State enterprise but I do say that I am in favour of very close examination being made as to the desirability of such a change taking place.</P>
    <P>In that connection, the Minister referred to the difficulties that occurred earlier in the year&mdash;labour difficulties and so on&mdash;and I myself had some experience of those difficulties&mdash;difficulties that occurred in the telephone service, in connection with night telephonists, and so on.  It would be a good thing if in that particular branch of the telephone service, the men were recruited on a permanent basis and if a career were opened up before those men.  It would lead to a more contented staff and a better service to the public.</P>
    <P>We in Fine Gael feel that a better service would be given to the public and at not that much extra cost to the Exchequer if the many postmen throughout the country who are in non-pensionable jobs were given a pension at the end of their days.</P>
    <P>There are other aspects of the telephone service and the Post Office on which I have some points, mainly small ones, to make.  For instance, in connection with the Savings Bank, greater privacy, whenever possible, would ensure that a man or women <Col N="1944" /> putting in or withdrawing money would not be under the close scrutiny of a friend or neighbour.  The installation of stamp vending machines would be a real boon.  I might say, just as a general remark, that firms from outside the country are very often appalled by the red tape that exists in connection with telephones generally.</P>
    <P>I want now to move on to a discussion of the broadcasting services generally, that is, a discussion of Radio Telefís Éireann.  This ought to be a very pleasant discussion and I ought to be able to talk about the delights of drama, the ecstasies of music, the interest of news and talks and the pleasure of entertainment but I am afraid that, instead of being able to make the pleasant remarks which it would be so nice to be able to make, I find that we are in a dark and gloomy atmosphere where politics is putting its heavy feet and scattering the nine muses and frightening their attendants. We should be able to speak of Radio Telefís Éireann in the highest terms of praise because we have very fine actors, very fine musicians and people who deliver the news and talks in a very fine way.  In fact, our difficulty in Ireland is to keep the top people we have, such is the high standard of our drama and of many aspects and branches of music, both classical music and lighter music.  We have very gifted people who appear before us in those two media.</P>
    <P>To say that the RTE Authority has been in hot water, that it has been in a state of difficulty, is a clear under-statement of the case as it is.  It does not give me any pleasure to say some of the things I feel it my duty to say in the course of the next part of my speech.  I did expect that the Minister would have made some reference to these difficulties.  One of the first difficulties we had was the resignation of Mr. Eamonn Andrews.  He was Chairman of the Authority.  He acted for a number of years in an exemplary fashion, bringing all the respect which his great name in the entertainment world carries with it.  He retired.  As far as I am concerned.  I do not know why he retired from that post.  No <Col N="1945" /> satisfactory explanation was ever given by the Minister.  As we would expect from a person of Mr. Eamonn Andrew's high character, he maintained a dignified silence.</P>
    <P>There were rumours, all sorts of rumours, concerning differences of policy.  I do not know what differences of policy there may have been, but we lost the benefit of a person who had an unexampled experience of radio and television, not only in Europe but in the United States.  We lost the benefit of his experience and advice, and no explanation has been given.  In this connection I cannot help thinking of the statement which was made in connection with law.  What is law but doing what is right and seeing that what is right is done?  There was a great jurist who said that not only must the Government do justice but it must appear to be done.  Certainly, with reference to the Minister and the Authority, justice does not always appear to be done.  That is understanding the position.</P>
    <P>The next shock we got was the dismissal of Mr. Tibor Paul who was musical director and first conductor of the orchestra.  Many of us have been concerned, in regard to the Authority, at this sort of clock of silence which seems to enshroud anything that is in the least controversial connected with it.  Many of us have tried to elicit information, but owing to the fact that it is not possible to get information concerning what is called the day-to-day administration of those bodies from the Minister, we cannot get it.  I would like to say to musical and other people that it is not from and lack of desire to bring the question forward but owing to the rules of our Parliament that we cannot do that.  I think it a pity that it cannot sometimes be done.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to this very burning question of the decision of the RTE Authority not to renew Mr. Tibor Paul's contract and the manner in which that information was conveyed to him.  Mr. Paul is a musician of international repute.  That is a word often loosely used, but in this connection we are dealing with somebody <Col N="1946" /> who is a very outstanding musician, a man who has been here for the past six years and who has done a great deal for the Radio Symphony Orchestra. He has helped to build up that orchestra to a very high position.  It gives very great pleasure to many people.  It is a very fine orchestra.  It is one that every Irish person can be proud of.  We can be certain that it is not just national pride when somebody says our symphony orchestra is a very fine one.  It is a fact that it is a very fine one and has been recognised as such by all musicians who have heard it.  We can well be proud of it.  Mr. Tibor Paul has played his part, a very big part, in bringing it up to the pitch of perfection it has reached at the moment.</P>
    <P>No reason was given as to why the contract of this musician was not being renewed.  That information was not conveyed to him in time.  In the classical concert music world, you can readily understand a musician lives at least 12 months ahead.  He is booked for concerts; he has to study scores. I suppose Tibor Paul does not have to study many scores now; he probably has already gone into them.  But programmes are made already for probably the winter of 1967-68.  One is always dealing at least 12 months in advance.  Therefore, to terminate Mr. Paul's contract roughly six months ahead of the time is not treatment which should be given to a musician. I was going to say &ldquo;to a first-class musician&rdquo;, but it should not be given to any musician because the orchestras have their programmes made long in advance.</P>
    <P>The first reason for dissatisfaction is that it was not a fair thing to do. The second is that insufficient notice was given and the third reason for dissatisfaction is that the news was premises of the Royal Dublin Society at Ballsbridge where he was about to conduct an orchestral concert of very great magnitude&mdash;well, all of them are: they are all big undertakings. He was about to conduct this concert when the letter was handed conveyed to this musician at the to him by the innocent bearer, one <Col N="1947" /> of the officials of the Royal Dublin Society.  The letter was marked &ldquo;Urgent and Personal&rdquo;.  He guessed what was in it and so he did not open it until after the concert.  The man collapsed and was taken to a nursing home and is still in that nursing home.  That is the effect a thing like that can have on an artist.  We people who live in a world where we are not tuned up to the pitch of musicians may find that difficult to understand but it is so, and I think that our Radio Authority and the Director General should realise that and should not have done it.  I could say a lot more about it. I feel that a very great injustice has been done to a man who deserves well of Irish musicians and of Ireland generally.</P>
    <P>There was a further matter in connection with the Orchestra and the Authority and the Director.  The Radio Éireann Symphony Orchestra was offered a contract in America by a very well known and important American agency, namely, Columbia Artists' Management, Incorporated.  That is not just a small concern; it is a very big concern which arranges appearances for musicians.  They offered the Radio Éireann Symphony Orchestra an engagement in America to take place in the autumn of 1967: that will show the House that my earlier statement that the musical world lives a year or a year and a half in advance was not an idle one.  That agency offered a tour of six weeks, 36 concerts, next October.  They would pay 9,450 dollars each week to the Orchestra.  They would pay 175 dollars a week for conductors' expenses. They would pay up to 15 dollars a man per day between the arrival of the company in the States and the first concert.  The outcome of all that means that the orchestra should be able to pay all its expenses in the United States out of the items guaranteed by Columbia.  The orchestra would have to pay its expenses across to America but that would not necessarily be very big in comparison with the money that would come in.  It would have meant an enormous amount of free advertising for Ireland, for our music&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Some of the music played by our orchestra would be Irish.  However, this would be appealing to a wider audience than an audience wanting just Irish music. There would be Irish music and the great classical compositions that are the birthright of all musicians in every country in the world.  One must remember that, to trained interested musicians, music is an international language, in effect.  That is a great thing.  An orchestra can go to any country in the world and it can, so to speak, be understood.  It can cross the language barriers in a way that no other dynamic cultural medium can: pictures, of course, do the same.  That would have been a very great thing for Ireland but unfortunately that was not even turned down.</P>
      <P>I have copies of telegrams sent by these people and finally, on 19th September, 1966, the last telegram came saying that a reply must be received&mdash;and it was not received: no answer was given.  In that way, a project which would have meant so much culturally, so much from an advertising point of view in the very best sense for this country, fell to the ground.  No explanation has been given as to why that was done.  It may have been&mdash;I hope it was&mdash;financial timidity but that explanation was never put forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might say, in connection with the actual treatment of Mr. Tibor Paul, that the Feis Cheoil held their annual general meeting recently.  That body is one of the oldest and most worthy musical organisations in the whole of Ireland and has done incomparable good for Irish music of all sorts.  In fact, by winning a prize at a Feis Cheoil, the late John Count McCormack was brought into prominence, and it was first realised that a great artist had appeared in our midst. The Feis Cheoil has done a great many things.  At their annual general meeting recently, a lady, who could not be accused in the slightest degree of political bias, described what has happened as barbaric and appalling, and the meeting endorsed here view; the meeting asked that two musicians <Col N="1949" /> be put on the Radio Telefís Authority. I now ask the Minister to consider that.</P>
    <P>These are some of the difficulties into which the Radio Telefís Authority have got themselves in connection with music and the orchestra.  I want to refer now to certain political difficulties. I shall not speak at any great length on this; I shall leave it to others.  We have had the picture of a Minister intervening with the Radio Telefís Authority in connection with the news. I cannot quote the actual words and, even if I could, I should not do so, but certainly a Minister made representations to an official of Radio Telefís Éireann and, as a result of those representations, the news was altered. We, in Fine Gael, feel very strongly about that.  We believe that not only should justice be done but it should be shown to be done.  Not only should Radio Telefís Éireann be as free as is humanly possible from Government interference but it should also, by its very actions, show that it jealously guards the degree of independence it has.  The Radio Telefís Éireann Authority does not exist as a tool of the Government.  I do not believe they mean to be that, but it is very wrong if they give that impression.  Above all, Ministers should be very careful that what they say to that Authority, or to any of the officials at Montrose, does not appear to be said with ministerial authority.</P>
    <P>We, in Fine Gael, have put down a motion asking the Taoiseach to accept three things: that no member of the Government, except the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, will have the right to intervene or interfere in the affairs of the RTA; that the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs may only exercise that right in writing; and that the Authority publish such directions. In the debate on the Bill setting up the Broadcasting Authority, we pressed very strongly for that.  It is a very serious thing that any Minister should put pressure on the Authority and its officials.  We are a small country and it is not easy to get away from the eye of the Government.  And the people are afraid of it.  Now that can work both ways.  The pendulum will swing. <Col N="1950" /> Nobody has power for all time and the day will come when Fianna Fáil will stand in these benches and will probably be very anxious to ensure that that rigid code of ethics is adhered to by whatever Government may be in power.  That is why we have tabled this motion to the Taoiseach.  That is why we want to make sure that what we desire is made abundantly clear on this Estimate.</P>
    <P>I will finish on a note of farce. Believe it or not, the Fianna Fáil Party have fallen out with the RTA: a headline says that &ldquo;Fianna Fáil Seeks Assurances on Telefís Éireann's `Division'.&rdquo;  The position is very difficult. The Body is in very considerable hot water and the Minister is responsible.</P>

      <P>The Radio Telefís Éireann Authority.  I am sorry if I have become a bit obscure but it is no wonder that I am obscure in discussing this sorry mess and muddle. What is the answer to it all?  The Minister should make various changes in the Authority.  He should put some musicians on it.  A great poet once said that &ldquo;The man that hath not music in his soul is fit for treason, stratagems and spoils&rdquo;.  It is high time sufficient people were on the Authority to prevent barbarities.  From the political point of view, it is vitally important that the Radio Telefís Éireann Authority should be absolutely free, should be shown to be absolutely free, and should act in a completely free and independent manner, with complete freedom from any form of governmental interference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>First, let me comment that the Estimate for the Department which is described as the Department of Posts and Telegraphs should, in my opinion, be an Estimate for a Department with a much wider, longer and more high-sounding title. After all, when we added Fisheries to the Department of Agriculture, we called it the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and it used to be called the Department of Lands and Fisheries.  The present Minister and his predecessors get credit just for looking <Col N="1951" /> after posts and telegraphs and if this were their only worry, they would be reasonably happy men but as the previous speaker mentioned, there are quite a number of rods in pickle for them in the other half of their responsibility, the half not mentioned except in the last two pages of the Minister's brief.</P>
      <P>First of all, Let me deal with the Department of Posts and Telegraphs itself.  I should like to refer to a number of matters affecting staff which I think should be brought to the Minister's notice here.  One of the most important things as far as any employee is concerned is the salary or wage he gets and the amount he can take home. For some extraordinary reason, the employees in the Department find that although their income tax assessment is based on an estimate of the previous year's income, the assessment for each year does not reach the people responsible for making the tax deductions until August or September, with the result that in the last few months of the financial year, quite a substantial slice in income tax is taken off their salaries.  This is a stupid arrangement and if there were any reasons for it, it could be accepted, but there is no reason for it because the assessment is made on the previous year's income.  Would it be too much to ask to have the deductions started on an estimate from 5th of April each year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My second point is in regard to a very old chestnut, postmen's uniforms. This has been discussed here for as long as I can remember.  I am aware that the trade union representing the postmen, the Post Office Workers' Union, has submitted to the Department a prototype uniform both in cut and type of material, but I understand the Department while they have made some attempt to copy the cut, have made no attempt to copy the material. Somebody got the crazy idea many years ago that the present type of uniform should be used.  Deputy Dillon used to refer to the dual purpose cow and this uniform apparently was to be a dual-purpose uniform, which could be used in the summer and in the winter.  However, we know that it is <Col N="1952" /> usefull neither in summer nor in winter. Postmen in most cases, especially in rural areas, are the public face of the Department; they wear the uniform which shows that they are employees of the Department and surely it is not too much to ask that they be given a decent, respectable uniform?  The difference in cost should not be very great.  I have seen some of the older people wearing uniforms which must have been issued to them when they were still small boys.  Perhaps the Minister might be able to do something about this.</P>
    <P>Recently I heard of a postman who was dismissed for not wearing his uniform.  However, he got another job, which was not difficult and which was better than a rural postman's job, but his reason for not wearing the uniform was that he hated to be seen out in it. His comment at the time was that he thought the original postman's uniform had been made for some model who must have been pretty badly made because all the uniforms appear to be badly made.  They appear to be too short on one side or too short on the other, and they never fit properly.  They are bulgy and patchy and should not be issued by a Department of State.</P>
    <P>Another point which I should like to raise is in regard to the Central Sorting Office which is being prepared in this city.  Could the Minister say when it will be available for staff?  I am sure he is aware that many people in the Department are wondering when it will be possible to have it available. There is no point in building it and then leaving it there and the sooner it becomes available the better.</P>
    <P>A question which I raised twice before is whether it is proposed to have a dust extractor in this sorting office?  The Minister does not need to be told that various types of dust can be raised in a place like this where various types of bags and mail are handled and it may not be the healthiest place in the world if there is no dust extractor.  My information is that it was intended to put in an extractor in the new building, but then, for economy reasons, it was taken out and then again it was decided to put <Col N="1953" /> it in again.  The last I heard was that it is not to be installed.  Surely the cost cannot be so high that it required a major decision as to whether or not it should be installed?  Surely it should be possible to have a decent type of dust extractor in a modern building? When the new sorting office is in operation, there will be a number of vacant offices in the city, including those in Parnell Street, Amiens Street and College Green, and would the Minister be able to say whether it is proposed to use any of them for the suggested social centre for post office staff?  This has been talked about for quite some time and there is no reason why a decision could not be arrived at in regard to this matter.  Now is the time to make it.</P>
    <P>In regard to the question of the working week, does the Minister see any prospect in the near future of introducing the five-day week for postmen and telephonists?  I understand that an agreement in principle was arrived at some time ago but that the thing has been held up because it was found that in a five-day week the hours which the girl telephonists would have to work would be too long.  Surely in 1966 we should not have to ask female employees to work extra long hours to get what is generally accepted in industry and outside it, a five-day working week?  Perhaps the Minister could give me some idea of what is happening in this regard.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Killarney telephone exchange, It was promised that proper facilities would be provided there but apparently nothing has been done and perhaps the Minister could find out if it is proposed to do anything there or if there is only the promise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>In Killarney?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. In regard to the Cahirciveen building, I understand that it is a very dangerous building with scaffolding propped up, and still the staff are working in it.  It is all right for the near-bankrupt employer who has no idea where the next shilling is to come from to do that but surely a Department of State should not expect <Col N="1954" /> staff to work in dangerous conditions?</P>
      <P>There are practically no facilities in the Kilmallock exchange and the rooms which staff are supposed to use for their short break are anything but adequate.  This is something into which the Minister might also inquire.</P>
      <P>In Dublin, most of the buildings used by post office staff need better ventilation, decoration and painting. Practically all of the buildings throughout the country which are owned by the Department, with a few exceptions, do not seem to have got a coat of paint for some time.  Córas Iompair Éireann were supposed to be broke but still they succeeded in painting and decorating their stations and all their property. They even did so in regard to stations they were closing down in a week's time.  Those stations were painted and plastered and made presentable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>According to the Minister's statement, he seems to have a few pounds over.  He might spend those few pounds in doing some of the things I am suggesting.  There apparently is a shortage of cleaning staff.  The offices, particularly in Dublin, are not kept as clean as they might be.  I do not know whether the Minister would agree with me or not but I imagine if staff were working in properly heated, properly decorated and clean offices the morale would be much higher than if they were asked to work in dingy, dark, dirty conditions which I understand is the present position.  The difference between doing things properly and having things done under the conditions I have described is a very small thing in LSD.  I am quite sure the Minister would not like this situation to continue.  I do not know if he is aware of it but that is why I am making him aware of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dockrell referred briefly to auxiliary postmen.  They are forgotten people as far as the Department of Posts and Telegraphs are concerned because you still have the position in which those people, no matter what hours they work or how long they are in the <Col N="1955" /> employment of the Department, finish up at the end of their days with their insurance cards handed to them, their last week's wages handed to them and they are let go.  The Department have no use for them.  This follows the pattern which the State seems to have built up over the years.  The low paid employees are not entitled to the same consideration as the higher paid employees anywhere in State employment. This is the position no matter what Department of State is concerned.  I argued this with different Ministers by way of Parliamentary question over the last number of years.</P>
    <P>This was referred to on every Estimate for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  Is there any reason why the Department of Posts and Telegraphs should not make some attempt to deal with auxiliary postmen in a Christian way?  Many of their colleagues are employed by local authorities and are also employed in local factories or anywhere else you like to name.  Those people are entitled to a pension and they are entitled to a gratuity but the Department of Posts and Telegraphs are not prepared to give either one or the other to their lowest paid employees.  Perhaps the Minister would mark his time in the Department by doing something for those auxiliary postmen.</P>
    <P>There is a peculiar system by which auxiliary postmen who work for 30 hours and over for a period of four years are paid sick pay.  They must have four years' employment as well as 30 hours per week in order to qualify for sick pay but if the hours drop under 30 they are immediately deprived of their sick pay and entitlement. Maybe the Minister could explain that to me.  It takes four years to build up but one day can knock it down.  I consider this needs some research. Perhaps the Minister might have a look at it.</P>
    <P>Then there is this question of motorisation.  Nobody wants to stand in the way of progress.  So far it has not been affecting the staff too much because the Department have attempted to regulate it in such a way <Col N="1956" /> that it is introduced when areas become vacant.  There is, of course, progress because sometimes an area which should be or could be used to combine with a vacant area for motorisation purposes has a man who is not able to drive and for that reason he has either to be removed or the motorisation of the area cannot take place. Would the Minister say if he proposes to do anything about this particular problem?  A new redundancy Bill has been introduced.  I wonder if this will affect this particular section of people? Perhaps the Minister does not know, but if he does I should like to have his comments on it.</P>
    <P>Brief reference has been made to telephonists.  I want particularly to talk about night and Sunday telephonists. The Department are building up a sticky problem for themselves here. There is the question of a compulsory ten hours rest which the Minister is probably aware of.  Very often in this service people are used because nobody can be got who will work.  If this is to be continued&mdash;it must be continued in my opinion otherwise the service breaks down&mdash;the compulsory ten hours rest cannot be operated.</P>
    <P>There may be another way out of this.  It applies, I understand, to certain of your drivers.  If there is a way out of this I do not know what it is.  If there must be a compulsory ten hours rest there would have to be a whole new system built up.  I would ask the Minister to have a look at this before it tumbles down on him.  We have the Christmas rush coming on and the Minister will find it extremely difficult to get the type of people he requires if he insists on the compulsory ten hours rest.</P>

If the regulations now laid down by the Department are strictly adhered to, that man cannot go on as a driver the next morning.  The Minister can check that and find out how he will get out of it.

      <P>I am afraid it has not been found so.  We have heard quite a lot in recent years&mdash;Deputy Dockrell just mentioned it here-regarding autonomy in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  The Minister steered clear of it.  Are we to take it that there is now no suggestion that the Department should become a separate body?  It was suggested by one of the Minister's predecessors.  It was spoken about quite a lot in this House and outside.</P>

      <P>When I finish my little speech, I will hand a document to the Deputy which he can read and it will answer a whole lot.</P>
      <P>There is the postal cheque system which means that people can deposit in the Post Office a sum as small as £5 and draw a cheque on it payable to themselves or pay an account on it. There is no interest on the deposit; there is no charge for the service rendered.  I assume the secret is that the amount of money lodged can be lodged at a high interest rate and thereby the Post Office make a profit on it.  It has been found to be a fool-proof system and has worked in a number of countries in Europe and has recently started in Britain.  At least they are trying to introduce the Gyro system.</P>

      <P>Those who are convinced against their will are few; it applies to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.</P>
      <P>I had in my hand while waiting to speak one of the account cards of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, and I looked at it and found on it: &ldquo;Printed in the USA&rdquo;.  I looked at the one I got a few weeks ago and I found that it, as well, is printed in the USA.  Is there any possibility of having these cards, which appear to be a perfectly simple type, printed in Ireland?  Is there any reason why we should continue this or had the previous Minister ordered such a great number that the present Minister who stopped the material for a making mailbags coming from Scotland&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister would consider bringing back the contract for producing those cards in this country?  This is such a small country that every little helps.</P>
      <P>I asked a question some time ago about the Savings Bank and the Minister was adamant at that time that there was no possibility whatever of increasing the rate.  I am glad he has since seen the light and has realised that people will not continue to invest in the Post Office when they can get a higher rate elsewhere.  I would advise him if he can to increase the amount still further.  It would encourage small savers, particularly to invest far more of their money in this country.</P>
      <P>There are one or two things in the Minister's opening address about which I am intrigued.  Perhaps he might explain these to me.  He says on page 6:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The survey referred to in the statement on the Estimate for 1965-66 has shown that there is considerable scope for motorising rural delivery services.  During 1965, 122 extra postmen's routes were motorised.  Although motorisation cannot offer spectacular savings&mdash;at least while delivery is made on a <Col N="1960" /> door-to-door basis&mdash;it does provide the only prospect...</P>
    <P>Does that suggest that there is in the Minister's mind the idea that the present systems of door-to-door delivery of letters is to be altered?  The suggestion is in his comment and perhaps he might explain if that is so.</P>
    <P>On page 12 he refers to the fact that:</P>
    <P>Good progress has been made also with the replacement of manual exchanges by automatic installations.</P>
    <P>We do know that people who look after the telephone service in this country must have the patience of Job. Otherwise, they would not be able to put up with the complaints and insults they get from the public.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to know if it is a fact that when the automatic exchanges are in installed while there is still some services of a manual nature. which must be given, has the staff been cut down to the stage where there have to be delays of ten to 15 minutes before a call is answered, particularly at night.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>People have asked about this, and the Minister might look at it and see if there is something wrong with it.</P>
      <P>The Minister also said:</P>
      <P>The intake of trainees for the skilled force has been raised progressively over a period of years so that we now have 400 youths being trained to provide for the future growth and maintenance of the service as compared with 87 six years ago.</P>
      <P>I would like to repeat a question I asked when this was first introduced. The idea is good, but would the Minister be careful to ensure that we do not have more people training than there are working at any particular time?  That has happened in other services and it would be too bad if it happened here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to hear that, because the Minister's predecessor was not so disposed when he was talking about it.</P>
      <P>On the Post Office side I have a query.  Some years ago an examination was held for auxiliary postmen who were offered positions as permanent postmen.  The Minister might complain that this is an old one, that he has heard it on a number of occasions. However, it is important enough to raise again.  One man in a rural town was informed that he had obtained seventh place in the examination.  He was a young married man who had been serving in the Post Office for a number of years.  He had good character and good health.  Some time after, he was notified that for some extraordinary reason he could not be appointed and from that day to this&mdash; that is four years ago&mdash;he has not been able to find out why he was not appointed.  There is some mysterious reason.  I am told it is the Appointments Commission who are responsible. The Minister's predecessor told me he could do nothing but he guaranteed to keep the man as an auxiliary so long as he was prepared to stay in the job.</P>
      <P>Why cannot a man who was employed as an auxiliary postman and who was doing his job well, up to the necessary standard, become a postman? He got the job but somebody at some stage made a complaint about him.  The Minister may not have heard this before.  It has been raised with his predecessor and I want to ask the Minister, if it is at all possible, to reconsider this man's case because he has been treated scandalously.  This is a young married man living among neighbours all of whom were told he had obtained seventh place but none of whom can be told why he has not got the appointment.  It appears as if there is something dark and gloomy in his past which has prevented him from getting it.  That is the sort of thing that is happening and the Minister should look at it on the first opportunity he gets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1962" /> The Minister, his private secretary, and officials, are aware of the case, as is Deputy Dillon, who first raised it in this House.  The man's name is James O'Brien of Monaghan post office.  It is a scandalous thing that it should be allowed to continue.</P>
    <P>On the other side of the Minister's responsibility, we come to the Radio Telefís Éireann programmes.  I do not get very much time to look at the programmes. I believe that the Radio Telefís Éireann people are doing a reasonably good job in most cases.  We all have complaints about things we do not like and we feel that things we do like should be on more often, but it is one of those things which none of us can be satisfied with.</P>
    <P>There are a number of pretty serious complaints which must be made about the service.  Let me start with, first of all, the news in Irish.  The news in Irish is given every night.  Could the Minister explain if there is any reason why it must be given at such a breakneck speed that those who have not such good Irish and who would like to follow it are unable to do so?  There might be a good reason for it.  Somebody said to me that it is given in Civil Service Irish which the ordinary Irish speaker would have extreme difficulty in understanding anyway.  Some of the readers are excellent.  Some of them read the news in such a way that anyone who has any knowledge of the language can follow it but there are a few who seem to think that they must get as much as possible into as short a time as possible.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  On Radio and Telefís Éireann there seems to be some kind of an arrangement whereby if an important function is being held and important statements are made by political leaders, the statement made by the Government Minister or whoever represents the Government is related usually in full; a few sentences of what the Fine Gael representative says is also related; but, in most cases, the fact that there was a Labour speaker present is not even mentioned. The most recent example is last night <Col N="1963" /> down in the south of Ireland.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dockrell was bemoaning the fact that the Radio Éireann Symphony Orchestra were not allowed to go to America in autumn, 1967.  I think they are pretty lucky because the Garda Band were offered an almost similar tour and they got the sack.  They were thrown out completely.  Perhaps the Symphony Orchestra and Tibor Paul have a lot to be grateful for that the same thing did not happen to them. As I suggested to the Minister for Justice, they may buy a few transistors out there and gramophone records. They may think that would be good enough for the people.  We could listen to recitals which have been recorded instead of paying for the real orchestra. I am not competent to speak on the same line as Deputy Dockrell on that but I think that a comment should be made.</P>
      <P>Last year there was a very popular programme of Irish and popular music on Telefís Éireann on Sunday afternoons. I do not want to do any advertising, lest somebody say that is the reason I raise it.  It was so popular it was decided to repeat it.  Instead of employing the same group to do another such programme, they repeated the original.  Now the fact that the group had changed and some of the people had gone away and got married did not seem to worry them at all. They just repeated it.</P>

      <P>On 12th October a question was asked here by Deputy Corish of the Taoiseach about the news item which had been interfered with on Telefís Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I shall read the Taoiseach's reply which is at columns 1045 and 1046 of the <Col N="1964" /> Official Report of 12th October.  In reply to Deputy Corish, the Taoiseach said:</P>
      <P>Radio Telefís Éireann was set up by legislation as an instrument of public policy and as such is responsible to the Government.  The Government have over-all responsibility for its conduct and especially the obligation to ensure that its programmes do not offend against the public interest or conflict with national policy as defined in legislation.</P>
      <P>To this extent the Government reject the view that Radio Telefís Éireann should be, either generally or in regard to its current affairs and news programmes, completely independent of Government supervision. As a public institution supported by public funds and operating under statute, it has the duty, while maintaining impartiality between political Parties, to present programmes which inform the public regarding current affais, to sustain public respect for the institutions of Government and, where appropriate, to asist public understanding of the policies enshrined in legislation enacted by the Oireachtas.  The Government will take such action by way of making representations or otherwise as may be necessary to ensure that Radio Telefís Éireann does not deviate from the due performance of this duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What, in effect, the Taoiseach said there was that the Government reserve to themselves the right to direct Radio Telefís Éireann as to what may or may not be put over the air.  Further on, the Taoiseach admitted that while a Minister had made representations and while he felt that the Government as such or individual members of the Government, to put it in his own words &ldquo;had the right to make representations&rdquo; and, by making representation, I assume he meant telling them to take off the programme or put it on, he later admitted that that responsibility lay with the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and, of course, he was right because section 31 (1) of <Col N="1965" /> the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960, says:</P>
    <P>The Minister may direct the Authority in writing to refrain from broadcasting any particular matter or matter of any particular class, and the Authority shall comply with the direction.</P>
    <P>Now there is a very big difference between the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs directing in writing that something may not be put on or should be put on and a Minister of State taking up his telephone, ringing up the Authority and telling them that he does not like a programme and they are to take it off.  If there is any doubt about what actually happened, we have the words of the great man himself.  Mr. Haughey admitted at column 1083 of the Official Report of 12th October:</P>
    <P>As regards Question No. 68, on the date in question I telephoned the Radio Telefís Éireann news division to protect about the manner in which a statement of mine and a contradictory statement from a farmers' organisation were presented in juxtaposition on the 9.45 p.m. television news bulletin.  In my statement, made in Dáil Éireann in reply to questions from Deputies, I specifically advised farmers to hold on to their cattle, where possible, until prices improved.  This advice was given by me on the basis of an objective appraisal of the situation and with the best interest of the farmers and of the nation in mind. It was accepted by the House.  For the RTE News Division to confront this advice with a contradiction from an organisation representing a section of farmers could, in my opinion, only serve to make perplexed farmers more perplexed.  I pointed this out to the News Division. I did not ask that the other statement be deleted from television or radio news bulletins.</P>
    <P>I asked him.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister for Agriculture claim that no outside body has the right to comment on radio or television <Col N="1966" /> on statements made by Ministers in this House?</P>
    <P>The Minister said:</P>
    <P>I made no such claim</P>
    <P>I leave it to the House to judge whether or not he made such a claim.  In fact if what the Minister for Agriculture succeeded in doing becames the norm, it would simply mean that in future on Budget Days nobody outside this House dare open his mouth, whether he liked or disliked the Budget, as far as the radio or television news items are concerned. It is a scandalous situation that a Minister or any group of Ministers, as the Taoiseach tried to claim, should have the right to say whether or not an item should go on.  Of course cracks were made from the Government benches that it was quite a simple matter, that any Deputy or person could make a telephone call to Telefís Éireann.  The Minister, I am sure, is quite aware of what would happen if an ordinary citizen dared to do so.  He would be darn lucky if he did get through.  He would probably be told to go and chase himself, that he had no business interfering with any programme; but if a Minister of State rings up, then some attenion must be given to what he says.  Whether or not this is an isolated matter was discussed on a number of occasions but I would like to point out that it is not, that, in fact, we had a previous situation.</P>
    <P>Everybody knows that the late Dr. Mackey was mainly responsible for getting the Casement story brought so far that Casement's remains were brought back to this country and arrangements were being made on the night of the funeral to have Dr. Mackey on Telefís Éireann to make a statement. He was warned by the Office of the Minister for External Affairs that if he went on, he was not to refer to the Casement Diaries, that, if he was not prepared to agree, he would not be allowed to go on.  It was bad enough for an official of External Affairs to give that instruction but it was subsequently repeated by an official from Telefís Éireann.  Despite the fact that Dr. Mackey reluctantly agreed to the terms, when that programme went on, Telefís Éireann succeeded, for four or <Col N="1967" /> five minutes while he was speaking, in cutting off the sound completely so that he was not heard even making the comments which he did make.  This is the type of thing we object to.</P>
    <P>We believe that Radio Telefís Éireann, provided they stay within the limits laid down by the legislation, should not be interfered with by a Minister or anybody else and that if there is a special reason why the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs feels that a particular item should not be allowed to go out, or that somebody should be prevented from appearing, then he should give the direction in writing and allow this House to discuss his decision because that is the only answer to it.  I am not blaming the present Minister, because I believe he is a decent man but it is the sort of thing we have happening under the present Government. They believe that they and they alone have the right to say and do what must be done in this country. They believe that they alone are the judges of public morality.  I do not think they are and a good many people in this country do not believe they are.  They will find that out when the time comes.  This sort of taking rights unto themselves and taking away the rights of citizens has got to be stopped and the only way it can be stopped is there in this House.</P>
    <P>When the Bill was being discussed here, the then Minister gave a number of assurances.  At column 1579 of the Dáil Debates, volume 180, there was a comment made by the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Hilliard, which read:</P>
    <P>It is true that the Authority will be an autonomous Authority and that the Minister will not have any interference whatsoever with the day-to-day programmes of that Authority...</P>
    <P>Surely that is definite enough for anybody? Apparently, in a very short time, that sort of thing has been forgotten.  Now the present Minister feels, and the Taoiseach feels, that there is no reason why, if anybody <Col N="1968" /> in the Government feels what is going over the air is not what he wants, he cannot ring up and say it should not go on, knowing darn well that Telefís Éireann would then take it off.</P>
    <P>There is another item which has caused a certain amount of uneasiness and again, Deputy Dockrell referred to it.  Perhaps I am more deeply involved here because I am a Party Whip.  I refer to the monthly television programmes called &ldquo;Division&rdquo; and the weekly programme called &ldquo;The Politicians&rdquo;.  I have no doubt in my mind as to the arrangements about the programme &ldquo;Division&rdquo;.  Telefís Éireann had the complete right to select whom they wanted on that programme. The only stipulation laid down was that they must inform the Party Whip if a member of a Party was being asked.  The individual then had the right to refuse or not and the Party Whips would have the decision as to whether or not they would allow the person to go on, as to whether or not they felt it would be in the interests of the Party to allow him to do so.  There was no suggestion at any time that there would be not be a discussion face to face, or that a politician and an ordinary individual would not go on the same programme.  Still, we had Fianna Fáil sulking like a child because of the fact that on the first programme the person who was going on was the Minister for Agriculture with somebody he apparently considered to be his arch enemy, the President of the NFA.  It is stupid in the extreme that a Government should adopt an attitude like that.  It is a question of &ldquo;If you do not play according to our rules, we will not play at all.&rdquo; Indeed it seems the Government have gone into their second childhood.  The position is that Telefís Éireann have gone on without the Fianna Fáil Party on that particular programme.</P>
    <P>I am just wondering how long will this last.  Will the Government pull something else out of the bag behind backs and force Telefís Éireann to cancel another programme?  All of us will be very interested to watch what happens within the next few <Col N="1969" /> weeks.  Anybody looking at the programme &ldquo;The Politicians&rdquo; the other night must have the view I took, that it took three of the Fianna Fáil Party, including a Minister, to try to outtalk a lady member of the Labour Party. The Government must not have a very high opinion of the abilities of their members, as they insisted they would not go on unless they had three representatives.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is coming on if he can count two and one.  The position is that there are three Fianna Fáil members, two Fine Gael members and one Labour member on that programme.  We continue to go on, on that basis.  The point I want to make is that this is stupid because Fianna Fáil will go on only when they have a majority on a programme, and they will not go on another programme where they are allowed only one person against people from outside the House.  They will not play.  If the game is not according to their rules, they will not play.</P>

      <P>We will leave the chairman out of it.  He is the person who is agreed upon, and that is it.  So far as the general programmes are concerned, and particularly the sporting programmes, a good job is being done. Quite a number of the programmes are very good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference has been made to the arrangements in connection with Ballymun. Perhaps the Minister would explain if he has now come to the conclusion that it should be possible to allow Irish citizens who pay licences to receive another station for which they do not pay any licence.  There has been an objection to that so far. Attempts have been made to cut out a number of unsightly aerials in our cities, towns and villages, by having what is described as piped television, but the Minister's predecessor turned his face completely against it and said it could not be allowed in any circumstances. That is bad enough, but the Minister must be aware that there have been complaints that Telefís Éireann have been successful in doing what is known in other countries as jamming foreign stations.  There is no reason why that should continue.  I complained about this to the Department on a number of occasions, particularly in regard to the town of Trim.  Is there any reason why the people of Trim <Col N="1971" /> who pay a licence to Telefís Éireann should be forced to look at Telefís Éireann all the time?  They cannot get BBC or UTV because of jamming by Telefís Éireann of other programmes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is a terribly simple fellow himself when it suits him, but this is one occasion on which that type of soft answer will not turn away the warth of the people affected.  I have already complained to the Department about this on a number of occasions but I found there was no use in continuing to do so.  Perhaps the Minister might be able to do something about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We heard a lot about the success that has been achieved in developing the telephone service.  The Post Office are doing a pretty good job outside the country, but it is too bad that for some extraordinary reason we still get complaints about a man who built a house six months ago getting a phone connected while his neighbour who has been waiting for six years still has not succeeded in getting one.  Even with the system whereby the Department ask for a down payment before the connection is made, we still get those complaints.  I asked the Minister about one or two of these cases and he gave <Col N="1972" /> me a fairly plausible reply which was probably accurate.</P>
    <P>He should see to it that people get a telephone connection according to where they appear on the order of priorities, but in the case of keymen in factories, doctors and such people, where the need for connection is urgent an exception should be made. It does appear from the complaints I get from time to time that some people are able to get a phone fairly quickly while others have to wait for long periods.  In this year it is not too much to ask that people who have been on a waiting list for four or five years should no longer have to wait. Deputy Dockrell made the point that this is one of the paying services and, that being so, any money which is required for this service should be obtained and spent.  A few years ago the Minister's predecessor was looking for £30 million to carry out urgent work over a matter of four or five years.  I notice in the Minister's statement that something around £27 million has been spent.  We seem to have a fairly good cross-Channel service, but I wonder would it be better if we tried to improve the service given to those who are seeking it in this country before we attempt to develop our cross-Channel service any further.</P>
    <P>Telegrams are becoming a thing of the past because it is so easy to phone a message rather than send a telegram. The last increase in the telegram charges sounded their deathknell because it is now too expensive to use the telegrame service.  If we could reach the stage where the 13,000 who are now awaiting the telephone service could be given that service, we would be coming near the end of the demand.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dockrell inferred that the administration of Telefís Éireann was fit for treason, stratagems and spoils.  Be that as it may, I refuse to believe that Telefís Éireann would deliberately jam outside programmes in the town of Trim. If Deputy Tully is right when he says outside programmes have been deliberately jammed, to my mind that would disclose a very serious state of affairs and I think it behoves the Minister to tell us exactly what the policy is in this matter.  I may be a bit naíve, of course: I probably am.</P>
      <P>This debate can range over a wide variety of topics.  I wish to refer to a small number only and I will not detain the House very long.  I notice that the Minister referred to the new closing time of 5.30 p.m. in sub-post offices in Dublin and said that was done on the recommendation of the Commission of Inquiry into the Sub-Post Office System.  I confess that I had not previously heard of this Commission and I wonder if business people were represented on it.  I doubt it very much because I have had some personal experience&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps they were unable to forsee the effects of it but one effect was a material deterioration of the postal service in the Dublin area for professional and business people who were in the habit, at the usual office closing time of five minutes to six, of posting packets.  I refer particularly to legal documents and the sort of thing that will not fit easily into letter boxes.  It seems that quite near this House, in the Baggot Street area, in which there are many business and <Col N="1974" /> professional offices, the post office closes at 5.30 p.m. and if something is posted in the outside letter box, it will be collected up to 8 or 9 or 10 O'clock but if it is a bulky packet of, say, legal documents it is not collected. I think that is because the collection heretofore had been at six o'clock, or about then, and now these suboffices are closed and the packets not collected. That is a material deterioration in postal services.</P>
      <P>We have heard several complaints, some of which gave rise to questions here, of letters being posted in England or parts of Ireland arriving in Dublin later than was customary in the past. That is not good business.  At a time when Ministers are urging higher productivity, we must improve the efficiency of the postal service, not retard it.  While I am all for shorter working hours, the five-day week and 5.30 p.m. closing, it is very important that essential services such as are provided by the Post Office should not have their efficiency retarded by improvements of the kind mentioned. This is a small point but well worth looking into.</P>
      <P>There are many parts of Dublin where, for one reason or another, there are considerable delays in getting new telephone connections.  The Minister has indicated that he is doing all he can to rectify that situation and that it takes time.  I know of one area about which I was in touch with the Minister recently&mdash;in passing, I want to thank the Minister for his unfailing courtesy to members of the House and for the courtesy of his staff when we find it necessary to make representations on small matters-and in which there are many applicants for telephones who have not yet been connected but who will be connected in the next six months or so.  This is a new residential scheme in the Sutton area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nowadays the telephone has become such an essential amenity that it is very important in these areas to provide a public kiosk to tide over the residents while there is no telephone in the area. I understand that even in the absence of underground cables, a kiosk can be connected by overhead cables, admittedly at some considerable expenses but a justifiable expenses.  The yardstick of <Col N="1975" /> the profitability of the kiosk related to its expected takings is not a fair one to apply at all times.  The telephone is so essential for communicating with priests, doctors, fire brigades, and so on and has become so much part of the daily life of everybody that it seems unsound to apply that commercial principle which I know is applied by the Minister in considering whether or not a telephone kiosk should be erected: is it going to pay its way? There are times when that criterion must and should be departed from.</P>
    <P>I do not go so far as to suggest that the case put to me recently and which I passed on to the Minister regarding the cliffs at Howth is completely valid.  Somebody said that there were so many tragedies there and the nearest telephone was almost a mile away that there should be a public kiosk for use in emergency.  Nevertheless, there is something in that point of view.  I re-echo the plea of Deputy Tully regarding the frustration and annoyance so many people experience when dialling the exchange or &ldquo;trunks&rdquo;.  I sometimes think it would be far better to get an engaged tone and not have to hold on indefinitely or perhaps hang up after five minutes waiting in despair and frustration.  This is something which causes immense <Col N="1976" /> annoyance and frustration and if it is a phenomenon due to inadequate staff, that can be readily rectified by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to refer at any length to the RTE Authority because it has been referred to already and will, I am sure, be referred to at considerable length later in the debate.  I was interested to see in the papers a few days ago that a distinguished cleric expressed his dismay at the increasing advertising of drink on television and its effects on young people.  This is something that had occurred to me more than once.  Television has a most potent influence on viewers, particularly on those with unformed or immature minds and anybody who takes a pint of stout, as I do, and visits Dublin's pubs cannot but be struck and indeed shocked by the trend which has manifested itself in recent years of increased drinking by young people.  I am convinced that, to some extent. the influence of television advertisements is responsible for that and I deplore it.</P>
    <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Wednesday, 26th October, 1966.</P>
