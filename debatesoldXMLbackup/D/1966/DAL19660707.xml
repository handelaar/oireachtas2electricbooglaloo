      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That Dáil Éireann hereby approves of the amendment of the Oireachtas (Members) Pensions Scheme, 1960, made under section 6 (A) of the Oireachtas (Allowances to Members) Act, 1938 by</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(1) the addition to sub-clause (4) of Clause 5 of the scheme of the following proviso: &lsquo;Provided that the foregoing provision of this <Col N="2188" /> sub-clause shall not apply in relation to any period of service in respect of which the member has paid the appropriate contribution under clause 4 of this Scheme&rsquo;, and</P>
    <P>(2) the deletion of sub-clause (7) of Clause 5 of the Scheme.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The purpose of the motion is, first, to apply to the Oireachtas Members Pensions Fund the principles set out in the Abatement Act which the House passed a couple of years ago; and, secondly, to apply also the principle that a person who pays a contribution to a fund of this nature is entitled to benefit by those contributions.  At the present time, even though a person who has held Ministerial or a Parliamentary Secretary's office and may have already qualified for a pension by the number of years he has served, he must, under the fund, continue to pay contributions as any other Deputy does, but gets no credit for these contributions as to years of service as a Deputy.  These are the two purposes of the motion.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Dáil at its rising this week for the Summer recess do adjourn until Tuesday, 27th September.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been usual at this time of the year either in connection with an Adjournment Debate or on the Estimate for the Department of the Taoiseach to give a survey of the more important matters bearing on the national economic situation.  Notwithstanding some unusual features in the Dáil procedures on this occasion, I intend to avail of the opportunity of giving such a general review.  This debate covers also two confidence motions which have appeared on the Order Paper by reason of the rather childish jockeying for political advantage and precedence in Dáil debates between the two Opposition Parties.  I hope they will not feel offended if I do not take them very seriously.  The important thing is that the Government should continue <Col N="2189" /> to have confidence in themselves and in their policies and should retain the support of a working majority in Dáil Éireann.  I hope to demonstrate that these conditions prevail.</P>
    <P>There are many Deputies who are, no doubt, familiar with all the relevant statistics relating to agricultural and industrial output, external trade, employment, prices and other matters of economic significance in recent years, and it is not necessary for me to recount them.  Some Deputies have, indeed, complained of getting too many reports and statistical returns, but this information, even if its significance is given different interpretations according to the Party affiliations of Deputies, needs to be fully understood by any Deputy who desires to grasp the nature of the problems with which the Government and the country are faced at this time or may have to face in the future.</P>
    <P>There are many features of our situation at this time which are justifiably a cause of concern, but there are many things also which are going right.  The matters which are right far exceed in number and importance those that are wrong.  Notwithstanding variations in our rate of progress, the country is still moving ahead.  Under our two Programmes for Economic Expansion, the country emerged from a period of prolonged economic stagnation, of uncertain aims and diminishing confidence, and has achieved significant progress.  If there is no desire to exaggerate and no advantage in exaggerating what has been accomplished, it should not be minimised either.</P>
    <P>Progress has not been uniform either from one year to another or one branch of economic activity to another.  As was not unexpected, various difficulties, some of which were foreseen and some unforeseen, have presented themselves, although in every single year, the rate of economic growth, even when it fell below that envisaged in the Programme, was substantially above the average experienced in earlier years.  We have still a long way to go, and many difficult and complicated problems to settle, before we can be certain of <Col N="2190" /> achieving our aims of full employment and a substantial reduction of emigration with reasonable price stability and, taking one year with another, a balance in our external payments, but we remain convinced that these objectives are attainable.</P>
    <P>The Second Programme was prepared, as Deputies will remember, on the assumption that the country would be fully within a free trade system, as a member of EEC, by 1970.  In its preparation, every effort was made to anticipate the effects of free trade on the growth of agricultural and industrial output, on external trade and on employment.  It was encouraging to be able to publish our conclusion that there were no insuperable barriers to the adaptation of the national economy to the requirements of free trade, in a way in which its continued growth could be not only assured but accelerated.</P>
    <P>This does not mean that there are no barriers.  On the contrary, it was recognised that very substantial changes would be necessary, particularly in the organisation and establishment of industry, and in all the services on which industry had to rely, and that getting these changes completed in time was going to require a very great national effort indeed, and would call for revolutionary alterations of outlook, on the part of industrial management in particular, but also within the leadership of our trade unions, and the formation of a new atmosphere in which dedication to efficiency and work would become an outstanding national characteristic. This work of adaptation and change is going on although it needs to be speeded up still further.  There are too many forces pulling the wrong way to secure the results we need.  The assumption of membership of EEC by 1970 is still valid, and the need for a very thorough overhall of the national economy is now reinforced by the commencement of operation of the Free Trade Agreement with Britain.</P>
    <P>We have been keeping in close touch with developments in EEC and in the relations between the EEC and other applicant countries, particularly Britain.  There is still a degree of uncertainty <Col N="2191" /> as to the extent and reality of the changes in attitudes relating to British membership which have been hinted at in newspaper comments, but sufficient grounds exist for the expectation that developments are likely to occur.  The important thing for us to keep in mind is that when they happen they may come very quickly.  It is very probable that, if formal negotiations for British membership should be resumed, they will not take nearly as long as in the 1961-62 period, and could well conclude in a very short time.</P>
    <P>We are keeping in the closest possible touch with this position.  Although we have no reason to think there is any lessening of understanding about our position in EEC circles, or anything useful which we could do to further our interests at this time and until the main problem affecting British membership has been settled, it is our intention, during the course of the Dáil Recess, to arrange for a Ministerial delegation to Brussels to explore the situation thoroughly.</P>
    <P>The relationship between this situation and our national development policies needs no emphasis.  It has to be reiterated that free trade, whether in the context of EEC membership or the British Agreement, means an intensification of competition in our home market and that it is only when all our producers have brought about the changes which will enable them to meet this competition that they can undertake with confidence the tasks involved in expanding exports, with real assurance of success, by their combined efforts, in building up the volume of trade, which will contribute to balancing our external payments.  As we have frequently stated, it would be very unsafe to rely on any expectation that the period for dismantling our tariffs, negotiated in the British Agreement, can be carried over into EEC.</P>
    <P>Membership of EEC, any more than the British Agreement, will not solve all our problems.  It will be solely up to ourselves to use the opportunities that will be presented to us.  Although, <Col N="2192" /> unlike some other countries in Western Europe, we have not attained full employment, we can note that in other respects the members of EEC have encountered much the same problems as we have, including the tendency of prices to keep on rising by reason of pressure on costs not offset by improvements in productivity.</P>
    <P>Because of the very real progress which has been made in expanding total national output, the country is much better off than it used to be, although it is not as well off as we would like it to be or as it can become if we tackle our problems systematically and successfully.  I have said that the rise in prosperity has not been uniform in all areas, or experienced equally in all social categories, and this is a matter for concern.  No doubt, there will always be some disparities in a free economy, but it is and must remain the aim of policy to rectify them as they appear.  In so far as this involves action by the Government, it means action through the Budget, for the redistribution of income in favour of farmers, or social welfare classes, or for the benefit of western regions, or in some other way, which represents a burden on the whole community which they must be willing to bear, with understanding of the need for it, if not always cheerfully.</P>
    <P>The social aims underlying our economic policy, which have been restated on various occasions, are to raise up the living standards of all sections in line with increasing national income, and to bring about the gradual elimination of all undue disparities. The word &ldquo;gradual&rdquo; must be stressed in this context, because this is the way in which a free society must work and to attempt to impose a more rapid rate of change, by authoritarian methods, could very well disrupt and defeat the whole development campaign. It is also essential that the claims of any one section are not pressed so unduly as to prejudice the prospects of equivalent benefits for others.  This is a constant problem in every free democracy and we have our full share of it.</P>
    <P>In the effort to raise living standards <Col N="2193" /> and to eliminate undue disparities, action is necesstary on a very wide front.  It is not simply a matter of farm price supports, or wage increases, or the expansion of social welfare arrangements.  Particularly in the area of education and training, so far as workers are concerned and in the improvement of farm structures, so far as farmers are concerned, there is a great deal which has yet to be done.  We are all of us upset by the realisation that some workers and some farmers have incomes so far below the national average as to be anomalous, and even if it is correct that this income represents the economic value of their work and their production, and notwithstanding that it is supplemented by such public services as children's allowances, the answer, or a large part of the answer, to the problem must be to increase their earning capacity, by training in new skills, or, in the case of farmers, by expanding the productive capacity of their holdings in area and fertility.  Achieving these social aims of raising the living standards of all social groups and diminishing disparities between them must therefore involve action embracing all the Departments of Government and a comprehensive Government policy in which all aspects are covered and which can be applied uniformly and consistently.</P>
    <P>The particular feature of our Irish situation which is paralleled in all other western European countries is the continuing contraction of the numbers occupied in agriculture notwithstanding the simultaneous expansion of agricultural output.  This contraction is one of the most potent factors sustaining the rate of emigration.  Emigration, although well below the level of ten years ago, has not declined as much as was envisaged in the Second Programme.  Although employment in non-agricultural occupations has since 1960 risen faster than the numbers employed in agriculture declined, the margin is still much too narrow.  This is one reason why we are now seeking to develop arrangements which will provide for training for new occupations and for the relocation in areas of <Col N="2194" /> expanding employment of those whom agricultural work no longer attracts or whom agriculture no longer needs for the purpose of sustaining the increase in output.  This is a major social problem and it would be reckless to promise a quick or easy solution.  It must be and be seen to be one of the main purposes of national endeavour in the years ahead of us.</P>
    <P>The regional development programmes which are now being worked out are part of this operation and are intended to facilitate us in achieving the further aim of maintaining a fairly uniform distribution of population and of economic activities in all areas of the country.  Regional policies such as we envisage cannot be executed without cost but we would regard them as a profitable investment because, apart from the social content, they will also facilitate the fuller utilisation of the nation's productive capacity.</P>
    <P>The progress of the economy of any modern country is linked with science and its technical applications.  There has been in recent years a veritable explosion of scientific knowledge which is having widespread economic consequences in every country.  In this respect, however, small countries are inevitably handicapped.  This is a handicap we have to live with and we must try to make up for our limited resources by the fullest and most economical use of the resources which are available and particularly by our willingness to concentrate them on the development of educational and technical training arrangements so that our main assets, the intelligence and adaptability of our people, are fully utilised.</P>
    <P>The recent National Industrial and Economic Council comment on the earlier OECD Report on Investment in Education emphasises the need for a very considerable expansion of financial outlay on educational development which, as the NIEC pointed out, must mean either giving this form of development priority in the allocation of public funds over other expenditures however desirable or willingness to accept further taxation to make it possible.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2195" /> The decision to give educational development the priority it deserves is the more practicable of these alternatives because, in regard to taxation, we must also avoid placing so heavy a burden on present production as to restrict its further expansion.  There is no question, however, but that the capacity of the country to go ahead in the competitive conditions of the modern world will depend to a very great extent on our success in raising up the levels of skill in our industrial, professional and agricultural labour forces and applying the fruits of scientific discoveries in our industry and agriculture.</P>
    <P>To an ever-increasing degree the policy of the Government will be directed to this end and we will have to endure the political criticisms which it may evoke from the unthinking as other desirable developments are necessarily slowed down to enable this essential educational programme to be fulfilled.  The extent that the educational programme may require either the postponement or the slowing-down of developments in other areas or the imposition of further taxation will, of course, depend on the rate of economic growth that can be realised.  Economic development policy is the key to all national problems.  Everything turns on it, including our capacity as a small nation in a highly competitive world to survive at all as an independent economic entity.</P>
    <P>Economic policy underlies all our plans and everything which delays or obstructs the achieving of economic aims is a blow to the achievement of national aims in every direction.</P>
    <P>The possibility of maintaining the rate of economic growth envisaged in the Second Programme depends on many contingencies but of constant and particular importance is the achievement of a proper balance between the growth of physical production and monetary demands, which we have not yet achieved, and on the continuing expansion of exports based on increasing competitiveness, which is <Col N="2196" /> not yet sufficiently appreciated in many quarters.</P>
    <P>The average annual rate of growth achieved between 1960 and 1965 was four per cent.  This was a respectable achievement by any standard of comparison and a quite spectacular achievement compared with the record of our earlier years.  Nevertheless, we have to try to improve on it.  Earlier this year a prospect of a 3¾ per cent growth rate in 1966 was published in the progress Report for 1965.  I think we must now face the probability that it may not be realised because of industrial stoppages at home and the effect of the British seamen's strike. Our growth rate in this year is more likely to be somewhere between 2½ and 3 per cent, say, 2¾ per cent.  If this proves to be correct and taking into account the 2½ per cent rate of economic growth achieved in 1965, we would need to expand our production in every sector to give an average annual rate of 5.4 per cent in the remaining years of the decade if the Second Programme target for 1970 is to be attained.  This would be something which we have accomplished only in one previous year&mdash;1960.  It is, nevertheless, a not impossible target to set ourselves but we are unlikely to reach it unless we are willing to forgo the luxury of interrupting the growth of production for the purpose of trade disputes or other agitations.</P>
    <P>All the present indications are, however, that the temporary difficulties which emerged in 1965 and which interrupted the smooth growth of the economy have been left behind and the prospects for the immediate future are hopeful.  There has been a notable improvement in the balance of payments situation.  The import excess for the first five months of 1966 was £20¾ million less than in the same period in 1965.  Exports were £9.3 million or nearly 12 per cent greater than in the first five months of 1965.  This improvement in trade occurred even though exports of live cattle have so far not made any substantial contribution to it.  A further increase in exports can be expected with the entry into force of the Free Trade Area <Col N="2197" /> Agreement with Britain, the ending of the shipping strike and the prospect of the removal of the British surcharge later in the year.  Coinciding with the improvement in the trading position, there has been a marked rise in the external assets of the banking system and departmental funds.  These were almost £21 million greater in April, 1966, than at the same date last year.</P>
    <P>Industrial production has been sluggish enough in the earlier months of the year and statistics for the March quarter, 1966, show the volume of output in transportable goods and manufacturing industries did not greatly exceed the level for the same period of last year, an increase of only one and a half per cent being recorded.  However, there is reason to believe that the industrial sector will considerably improve upon this performance later in the year.</P>
    <P>All the indications are that the action which was taken by the Government, to deal with the situation, has arrested, and brought under control, the unfavourable trends which, if not rectified, could have proved very harmful to our economic prospects.  We intend to maintain such measures as are required to stop demand from outrunning available resources.  Of course, forecasting is never an easy business, and past experience has shown that care has to be exercised when the question comes up of modifying the emphasis in economic management policy.  Nevertheless, general economic conditions would now appear to favour a gradual release of more resources for productive purposes.  The effect of this will be felt mainly in the private sector, but the Government are also considering the feasibility of releasing in some degree the limitations on the capital programme which were unavoidable earlier in the year and indeed which may still be so.</P>
    <P>This expansion of output required to realise our development target has to be achieved in conditions which will give some assurance of price stability, of balancing our external payments, and of being able to maintain the high rate of capital commitment which is involved. Unless all these conditions are <Col N="2198" /> realised, we cannot succeed.  The greatest danger lies in excessive demand for higher monetary incomes, and this is why this aspect of our affairs is stressed so frequently in Ministerial speeches.  It is this which can cause private consumption expenditure to rise above the level that can be supported by national production, involving an inflation of imports and which, by forcing prices upwards, can result in a situation in which competitive export sales cannot be maintained, much less increased.  We cannot go on running an excessive deficit on our external trade with the rest of the world: the world will not allow us to do it.  Nor can we rely on a growing inflow of capital from abroad to cover up the consequences of any disorder in our internal economic arrangements. These are precisely the circumstances in which capital investment is inhibited.</P>
    <P>This has been a year of sizeable taxation increases and of two Finance Acts to ensure the raising of sufficient revenue to enable the Government's commitments on current account to be met within a balanced Budget.  If we should be forced by the level of personal incomes rising faster than resources into a situation in which the curtailment of the growth of public spending, whether on capital or current account became unavoidable, we would not only have to abandon our hopes in the areas of education, health, and social welfare, but also to accept that the overall growth rate envisaged for the national economy as a whole would be completely unrealisable.  We do not have scope for cutting public spending without grave and immediate economic and social consequences.</P>
    <P>I do not want to cover ground already trodden over in our recent financial debates but no review of our national situation which did not embrace this constant financial problem would be realistic.  Our public spending, whether on current or capital account, as a percentage of total national income, is still very much below that which other European countries maintain, and this restricts us in our efforts to catch up with them, both in regard to the level of our <Col N="2199" /> economic activities, and in our personal living standards.  We should not lightly consider the possibility of a drastic cut in the public services.  We must therefore be willing to accept that excessive growth in private incomes and private consumption should be avoided or restrained by taxation so that greater provision can be made for public activity and particularly for investment in new production possibilities and in houses, hospitals, roads and schools.  The standard of living of our people in the future will depend on the extent to which we are prepared to accept restraint now and to concur in taxation to maintain the standard of public services and the facilities on which future economic growth and social progress depends.</P>
    <P>These considerations emphasise the growing importance in the fulfilment of economic and social policies of what, for want of a better term, is called Incomes Policy, which must aim at a fair improvement of the living standards of all social groups, while keeping the over-all expansion of money incomes, and of consumption expenditure, within reasonable bounds, by means which impose the minimum sacrifices for any particular class.  We have never failed to recognise that the Government must play a leading role in bringing this about.  It would be a very considerable contribution to national economic progress, and to financial stability, if we could envisage a stabilisation of tax rates over some period of years, keeping the growth of public spending within the limits of revenue buoyancy.  It will be the aim of the Government to achieve this, but it would not be sensible to make this such a rigid objective of policy as to impose an impossible degree of restraint on the realisation of improvements and extensions of public services, such as education and health, for which public opinion is constantly pressing.</P>
    <P>The rate of economic growth which we have programmed and which we need, requires for its realisation an even faster rate of growth of investment in productive capacity both public and private, than we have yet <Col N="2200" /> achieved.  An ever-expanding growth of investment is essential to solve our economic problems.  This must come about through private initiative and in large measure be achieved by the reinvestment of business profits.  In circumstances where private saving is already insufficient for public investment needs, and where the capital market is tight, this seems to be the only feasible course.  While to some members of the Dáil, profit is a dirty word, we have either to forgo our development prospects or accept that business firms must be permitted and facilitated to achieve reasonable profits subject to the requirements of dividend limitations and the obligation of increased reinvestment.  Despite what I have said earlier in this connection, the scope for increasing public expenditure, in some desirable directions, by reducing it in others, is very restricted. Not even a draconian policy of curtailment would release a sufficient volume of resources to make a significant contribution, although reorganisation of methods and changes in the management of administration could perhaps enable some economies to be made.</P>
    <P>It must not be forgotten that the bulk of Government spending represents income for many people and has to be judged in the light of social needs and our conceptions of social justice and social progress.  Subsidies on production, in agriculture and industry, may be open to theoretical objections, and social welfare payments may yield no direct economic gains, but few will propose their curtailment in our present circumstances and the consequences of curtailment would be widespread.</P>
    <P>If it would be feasible to define a plan for public spending both on current and capital accounts for a number of years and to stick to it, it would be helpful in determining the Budget problem we may have to face in the future, but again only at the risk of introducing a degree of rigidity into the management of our public finances that would be very restrictive in its effect.  At this time, it is clear that the limiting factor in respect of the capital programme is our capacity to <Col N="2201" /> raise capital funds at home and abroad for its fulfilment.</P>
    <P>Public financial policy is the central area of Government policy, but what is possible in this area depends not only on public needs and demands, in respect of the services to be provided, but also on the economic development forecasts, which can never be completely accurate.  There is a constant need to avoid policies which involve an ever-mounting charge on public revenue, which are always fairly easy to start but involve an ever-increasing limitation on the Government's freedom of action in other spheres in future years.  Notwithstanding all our present problems and those which we will inevitably encounter in the future whether arising from internal or external circumstances, there is nothing fundamentally wrong in our country's situation and we can be confident that national progress can be maintained in every sector of activity provided that understanding grows of the nature of our problems and of the magnitude of the opportunities which are open to us and that there exists in all the organs of Government, in business management and the trade unions, the capacity and the desire to give to the cause of national progress the priority over other considerations which is the distinctive characteristic of a democracy and the condition essential to its successful working.</P>
    <P>In the Dáil, we have had our debates and controversies, the clash of Party interests and personal incompatibilities, but somehow the work gets done if not as expeditiously as we would wish nevertheless at a fairly uniform output. Because of the volume of business, particularly Estimates left over from this session, and because of the legislation in preparation, it is necessary to ask the Dáil to re-assemble earlier in the Autumn than is customary.  I know that Deputies of all Parties need a fairly long adjournment at this time to enable them to renew contacts with their constituencies and to perform all the work of public representatives which is not related to Dáil business.  I hope that we will be able to organise our affairs in future years so as to <Col N="2202" /> permit of summer adjournments of normal length.  Nevertheless, I hope all Deputies will be able to make some use of the recess to secure a period of relaxation which will ensure that they will all return on September 27th in good health and in good humour.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say, at the outset, that the Labour Party decided to table their motion of no confidence before the Presidential election.  They also decided that this motion would be tabled on the morning of the count because, in accordance with our approach to the Presidential election, we decided that no act of ours, such as a motion of no confidence, should be thrown into the arena of the Presidential election as we believed it should not be a political test.  However, I say this in retort to the smart alec remarks the Taoiseach is prone to make about the jockeying between this Party and the other Opposition Party.</P>
      <P>Listening to the Taoiseach this morning, in what one would describe as a detached State of the Nation speech, one would imagine he was talking about some other country and that he had not very much responsibility for many of the difficulties or all of the difficulties which he listed during his half-hour speech.  We have heard this type of speech from the Taoiseach before.  As a matter of fact, after the result of the Presidential election, he felt constrained to issue a report of what was described as the Government's policy aims.  These may be aims but one of the great difficulties about the Fianna Fail Party is that they seem to assume, when they set targets or aims for themselves, that they will be realised without making the maximum effort to see that they are realised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think this motion is warranted in present circumstances.  We felt bound to table it in view of the undoubted deterioration of the economy over the past 18 months, and particularly on account at the apparent lack of concern of the Government and their failure to acknowledge the danger signals.  We are asking, therefore, that Dáil Éireann pass a vote of no <Col N="2203" /> confidence in this Government.  If the country had an opportunity in two or three weeks, I have no doubt that they, too, would pass a vote of no confidence in the Fianna Fáil Party.  As far as the support of the country is concerned, they have not had this confidence either in this Dáil or in the previous Dáil because in this Dáil they are dependent for their support on Independents or the absence of certain Deputies.  In the previous Dáil, they were dependent for their support on three or four Independents, as well.  But, as a minority Government, I believe they should be much more alert to the danger signs and much more active in taking corrective measures.  One could understand, but not excuse, their complacency if they had a majority of ten, 12 or 14, as they had in other years.</P>
    <P>In a situation in which they are, in fact, a minority Government, one would imagine that, even in an effort of self-preservation, they would have been more active and less complacent over the past 18 months or two years. There is ample evidence that the Government have lost control.  It cannot be said that they did not get a chance from the Labour Party and, I suppose, from the rest of the Opposition in the undoubted difficulties with which they have had to contend over that period.  No undue advantage was taken of that situation, as was the case in 1956, when the then Government were subjected to all kinds of barrages of criticism from the Fianna Fáil Party who took every opportunity to gain political advantage from the difficulties, small or large, which the Government of that day had to face.</P>
    <P>It must be admitted that, in the period I have mentioned, we advocated certain corrective measures.  It is also true that the Government adopted some of the suggestions made from these benches and from the Labour Party but unfortunately too late.  I was quite amused the other day to hear the Minister for Finance refer to the speeches from this side of the House as somewhat treasonable.  He talked about the publicity in the foreign press <Col N="2204" /> for critical Opposition speeches.  We are all as careful to guard the good reputation of this House as any member in it or as any Party in it but it is going a little bit too far, I think, to allege that it is treasonable or that it does damage to this country outside if, on a Budget debate or on any general debate, we criticise where we believe criticism is justified.</P>
    <P>We believe that this motion is warranted. We believe it is our duty to place the responsibility on this Fianna Fáil Government and to get more adequate replies to the matters mentioned in our motion of no confidence than have been given by the Taoiseach in his speech here this morning.  We were the first to admit that factors outside the control of the Government have an effect on the economy.  It is true that the British surcharge, introduced in November, 1964, has had its effect but this is not a complete alibi. I heard the Taoiseach talk this morning about the seamen's strike.  He made some reference to industrial unrest.  We can see that all these have an effect, and must have an effect, on the state of the economy, but they are puny compared with the inactivity of the Government and their reluctance to do things they have been asked to do and which I believe they are afraid to do. One could not describe the Fianna Fáil Party as a Party of either private enterprise or public enterprise.  They have always tried to balance delicately on the seesaw with public enterprise on one side and private enterprise on the other.  The Government will have to make a decision that there will be greater emphasis on public enterprise, having regard to the size of the country and to the financial resources available here.  The Government have proved shortsighted in the past 18 months; or, if not, I say they are guilty of putting Party before country in their failure to take what might appear to be unpopular decisions prior to elections.</P>
    <P>Mark you, the fortunes of this country have been guided or influenced to a very large extent by the incidence of elections, whether general elections, local elections or Presidential elections. Prior to these elections, or in anticipation <Col N="2205" /> of them, we have false impressions of the state of the economy being created, not alone by members of the Government but by the Taoiseach himself.  The notable example of that was in February, 1965, the bad year of 1965.  That was the year the Taoiseach knew a general election would take place.  At the time of the by-election in mid-Cork, it must have been abundantly clear to everybody, as I am sure it was to members of the Government, that they would lose this election and that would necessitate the holding of a general election because of the depletion in the numbers in the Government Party.  There were other examples in by-elections where things were done merely to gain favour with the electorate, if not in a certain area, certainly in a certain constituency.</P>
    <P>The cowardice of the Government and their reluctance to face the public is exemplified surely, and demonstrated, in their action, through the Minister for Local Government, in postponing the local elections this year, the excuse being that we had had a general election last year, a Presidential election this year and it would, therefore, be inconvenient and expensive for them and local authorities to hold the local elections this year.  We have a situation, therefore, in which the Fianna Fáil Government and Party will not even allow their local representatives to face the people.</P>
    <P>The year 1965 was a bad year.  In February of that year, the Taoiseach spoke here and I would advise him now to look back at that speech again. If he wants the reference, I will give it to him; it is volume 214, column 586 of the Official Report.  He talked about the continuing economic progress and boasted about national production going up in 1964, forecasting a further increase in 1965; he described in glowing terms national income and expenditure on day-to-day consumption, giving the impression that 1965 was going to be the best year we had since the First and Second Programmes for Economic Expansion were introduced. As a matter of fact, he did not give this as his own opinion.  In that volume and at that column, he said:</P>
    <P>Discussions with our leading industrialists <Col N="2206" /> have justified forecasts of a corresponding rate of growth in industrial output and industrial exports during this year.</P>
    <P>This was before the mid-Cork by-election and prior to the general election last year.  If we could shut out 1965, close the book, so to speak, and say: &ldquo;Well, this is finished; let us start anew,&rdquo; that would be all right; and, if we could regard 1966 as a clean sheet in the book, maybe that would be all right as well.  But, despite what the Taoiseach said here this morning, all the indications are that the prospects for 1966 are not as encouraging as he appears to think they are.</P>
    <P>It is true that the balance of payments position has improved.  Whilst the deficit in 1965 rose to £42 million, for the year ended May, 1966, it was something like £20 million.  This is an improvement.  This is a good sign.  But I think the Taoiseach should ask himself again if this will continue and if the Free Trade Agreement with Britain is going to be the wonderful arrangement that was boasted of here on 4th January of this year.  As far as I can gather, the improvement in respect of the export of cattle may mean a mere £2 million this year, or rather for the rest of the year.  Now £2 million is a pretty big sum, but, as far as the balance of payments is concerned, this extra £2 million will not be as effective as many people think. It is true also that the British surcharge is to go on some date in November.  As to what real effects this will have on our balance of payments anybody can hazard his own guess.</P>
    <P>There is, of course, another reason for this improvement and it is not one from which we can take any great consolation.  Part of the improvement in our balance of payments position is due to the fact that there has been a slowing-down in the importation of raw materials because there is relative stagnation in industry when one thinks in terms of the years 1962, 1963 and 1964.  In any case this balance of payments is not necessarily an indication that the economy has improved in certain respects or that it will improve <Col N="2207" /> greatly for the rest of the year.  The decrease in imports of itself is not, in my opinion, enough.  The answer in all this is greater production and greater exports.  By merely cutting down our imports to redress the other position is not sufficient from the point of view of the general economy of the country.</P>
    <P>Mark you, the Taoiseach estimated this morning&mdash;he glossed over it, rather&mdash;that production has not shown all that improvement even in the first part of this year.  Gross national product last year increased by 2½ per cent compared with the target set in the Second Programme for Economic Expansion of four per cent for 1963 and four per cent for 1964.  This is merely the average or the target set by the Second Programme for Economic Expansion but the indications for 1966, as far as I can gather, are not good. Production in manufacturing industries for 1965 showed an increase of 3½ per cent in the full year, but for the last quarter of that year, the increase was only two per cent and for the first quarter of 1966 there was an increase of only 1½ per cent as compared with the same period in 1965.  Therefore, as far as production in manufacturing industry is concerned, the increase is not being sustained and certainly not at the rate visualised in the Second Programme for Economic Expansion.</P>
    <P>If we analyse the main industrial groups, we will see that the signs are not encouraging either.  It is true that in clothing and furniture there was quite an improvement in the first quarter of 1966, but in building materials, in metal and engineering and other manufactures&mdash;textiles, drink and tobacco&mdash;there is not an increase but a reduction, a decrease in production in respect of these particular industries.  This serious slow-down in production is reflected in the employment position.</P>
    <P>One of the great boasts for the Second Programme for Economic Expansion was not alone greater production in industry and agriculture and better and fuller lives but the prospect of full employment.  If our society is to live, the target must be full employment <Col N="2208" /> and it is not enough for the Taoiseach or anybody else in this House to pay mere lip service to the idea of full employment; we must try to achieve it, and achieve it quickly. It would not be unfair criticism, I think, to say that of all the countries in Western Europe, this country, as far as employment is concerned, has by far the worst record.</P>
    <P>I know there are many people who think in terms of always having a pool or reservoir of unemployed, but, if we are to continue to have this reservoir or pool of unemployed, the changes which the Taoiseach outlined here this morning will not be effected because, if changes are to be made in industry, in industrial relations and in trade union law, the best time and best atmosphere in which to make such changes is a time of full employment. The present situation means that workers have a sense of insecurity, even those who are now working.  The cause of much of the unrest at present is the fact that there is this insecurity because there is an insufficient number of jobs and because there is a danger that if a man is to be sacked, there is somebody in that pool of unemployed ready to jump in.  Not alone are we far from full employment&mdash;and I say this more in sorrow than in anger&mdash;but we are far from the targets of the Second Programme.</P>
    <P>In this matter, the Government have an overall responsibility which I do not think they can shed.  They can be accused of inactivity as far as the provision of jobs is concerned.  When speaking this morning, the Taoiseach did not refer to the fact that there were 7,000 fewer at work in 1965 as compared with 1964.  I have heard the Taoiseach and his predecessor say on occasions that the greatest test of the success or failure of a Government is their employment record.  If this Government were to be judged on their employment record, they certainly would stand condemned by this House and the nation.  The Taoiseach asks us why we should put down a motion of no confidence.  We would be justified alone by the fact that the total number employed fell last year for the first time since 1961, and the NIEC have <Col N="2209" /> forecast that this year there will be a further drop of 4,000 jobs.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the Department of Finance are doing in the reexamination of the targets for the Second Programme.  If we are to stick to the targets outlined when it was published in 1960, it means that up to 1970 this country requires 23,000 new jobs per year to absorb all those who would be available for work and to try to restrain our people from emigrating. As far as the provision of new jobs is concerned, the performance of the Government has been dismal.  They may say what they like about the responsibility of private enterprise or somebody else to provide jobs: the Government have an overall responsibility and they have failed dismally. We have plenty of words about the provision of jobs, plenty of speeches as to when we might get them.  But what is needed in present circumstances is action and not mere words, not something like what the Taoiseach produced for his Party as a result of the Presidential election, not the mere words we see in the Second Programme. It does not seem to me from the pronouncements of Government Ministers that we are going to get the action that will prevent the decrease in employment forecast by the NIEC in a recent report.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Hillery, now the Minister for Labour, kindly sent me a copy of a speech he made in the National Stadium on Thursday, 23rd June.  He talked about Government responsibility in the promotion of the economy and the provision of employment and said:</P>
    <P>The Government's responsibility, therefore, in industrial development has been accepted by successive Governments to be this: encouragement and aid to private enterprise and participation by the State in direct activities only where private enterprise has failed.</P>
    <P>As far as the provision of jobs is concerned, as far as keeping Irish workers in Ireland is concerned, as far as the establishment of industry is concerned, private enterprise in this country has <Col N="2210" /> failed.  The Minister says that the State will step in only where private enterprise has failed.  It must have failed or else thousands would not be emigrating each year.  It must have failed if the unemployment figures show an increase of 5,000 each week of this year over similar weeks last year and the year before.  When are our Government going to take the initiative? I have heard the Taoiseach on various occasions, when asked to tax wealth, saying there is no big wealth in this country.  Does that not demonstrate that, if such people are not here to establish industry and create jobs, it is the responsibility of the Government to do it?</P>
    <P>The Minister in another part of his speech announced:</P>
    <P>I have recently on the recommendation of the Industrial Development Authority set up an Industrial Promotional Panel to assist the Authority in securing new industries.  The panel will consist of a number of leading Irish industrialists, especially those with considerable foreign business contacts, and a number of manufacturers from abroad who have established factories here.</P>
    <P>This may be the beginning of something the Labour Party have been advocating for the past ten or 15 years. This is the sort of thing on which we want to see action, although it does not meet our full demands in respect of the establishment of industry.  I trust this is not merely the establishment of another panel in an effort to appear to satisfy people that something is being done.  The Government should take the initiative.  They have all the information.  They know what our needs are, what is consumed here, where our markets are&mdash;or at least they should know.  They should take a greater part in the establishment of industry when private enterprise has either failed or refused to do so.  I trust we will not have this business of hardworking members of chambers of commerce going abroad trying to interest foreigners in the establishment of industries in their home areas.  This job is too big for that.  It is an urgent job <Col N="2211" /> which only a State agency can do.  If this is a mere pious resolution setting up a &ldquo;phoney&rdquo; committee, it will not bring the results we so urgently need.</P>
    <P>I do not want to reiterate the figures that have been quoted <i>ad nauseam</i> during Budget debates.  Is the Taoiseach concerned, and what is he doing, about this unusual rise in unemployment in 1966?  The figures show that unemployment benefit recipients are this year consistently reaching each week a figure 5,000 higher than any similar week for the past two years.  In unemployment, the hardest hit appears to be those engaged in the building industry. Figures supplied by the Taoiseach's Department show that in mid-May, in a situation where houses are badly needed, there were 4,620 idle in the building industry.  This represented 1,349 more than in 1965.  Yet the Minister for Local Government and other Ministers have the neck to tell us there is no slowing-down and no cut-back in housing and that the same number are employed.</P>
    <P>The figures belie that.  There is indeed a slowing-down.  One need only look at one's own constituency, one's own town, to know there is a slowing-down, to know that people are clamouring for houses.  The local authorities built 913 houses for the first four months of 1966, compared with&mdash;and even this was little enough&mdash;1,129 for the first four months of 1965.  In regard to grant and loan type houses under SDA, there was again a reduction of 345 for the first five months of this year compared with 1965.  Even there the record was not too spectacular because in these five months only 1,734 houses were built.</P>
    <P>I do not want to appear to be too pessimistic but all the indications from the Minister for Local Government, as far as housing is concerned, make me pessimistic.  It appears to us that the position is going to get worse this year.  Mark you, the NIEC stressed the importance of the building industry as a source of employment.  When we have regard to the thousands who used to be engaged in the building industry, some <Col N="2212" /> of whom still are, we must regard this industry as a very important source of employment indeed.  However, we are inclined to forget those ancillary industries such as those which manufacture different appliances and different building materials.  These are going to suffer and have suffered because of the slow-down. It seems that we are making no impression at all on the housing problem. The Minister for Local Government produced a White Paper on Housing in November, 1964 and to my mind this White Paper, and the statistics it contained, was the greatest condemnation of the Fianna Fáil Government because it showed a vast under-estimation of the number of houses needed.  It also showed up to then&mdash;whether there has been any improvement since I do not know&mdash; a colossal ignorance of the problem in the cities and towns and rural areas.  It showed that there are 50,000 unfit houses, 63,000 overcrowded houses and, in regard to the need, it showed that with other factors about 120,000 new houses were required.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach in his address to the Fianna Fáil Deputies described the various objectives of the Party and referred to housing but this must have rung very hollow in the ears of the thousands who are condemned to live for years in overcrowded rooms and slums, and to those newly-weds who have no prospect of being housed for many years in the city of Dublin. It is a scandalous reflection on this country and on all Governments to say that there are so many condemned to live in rooms in Dublin and who have no prospect of getting houses of their own for some years to come. We wonder what special steps the Government are taking to provide these houses.  The existence of the credit squeeze was denied for months and months but has now been admitted as a fact.  It has been responsible to some extent, but not entirely, for the situation in which we find ourselves in regard to housing.  Up to 1965 we were told that all the money that was needed was available.  At that time the Minister for Local Government sent a circular to local authorities asking them to submit any sort of amenity <Col N="2213" /> scheme they could think up and the money would be forthcoming.  There was plenty of money apparently for this, that and the other thing, apart from housing.  They had plenty of money for housing and sewerage.  This was the situation then but towards the second part of 1965 it was discovered that the money was not forthcoming. The peculiar thing was that the credit squeeze, like many of our other difficulties, did not emerge until after the general election.  The Minister for Local Government still protested that there was plenty of money but it was not forthcoming.  Every time he was questioned about issuing money for houses, the excuse was not that they had not got the money but some other excuse in regard to planning or a change of plans.  Eventually after questioning by Members on this side of the House, he was forced to admit that they just did not have the money.</P>
    <P>I said that as far as the building of houses was concerned, there was not going to be an improvement.  As a matter of fact, unless the Government do something, there will be a deterioration in the position.  As was pointed out last night, the local authority allocation for housing will merely cover their commitments up to December, 1965.  Most of them find that they cannot undertake any commitments to assist private building this year.  Not alone can they not get money through the Minister for Local Government, or the Minister for Finance, but it appears that even if the banks were open, they would not be inclined to give them credit accommodation. These local authorities are unable to meet their grant and loan commitments to those to whom they had promised grants and loans to build houses for themselves.</P>
    <P>Another serious factor is that unemployment in the building trade is forcing workers to go to England. Mark you, we have had this experience before, particularly in regard to the building trade.  The vast majority of these workers are content to work in Ireland, but if they are forced to leave, by reason of not having employment here, and they go to Britain, the likelihood is that many of them <Col N="2214" /> will be lost to this country, and if and when the Government succeed in obtaining money to build houses, the probability will be that we will not have the workers here.  It is a paradoxical situation.  We have 4,000 workers unemployed who should be engaged on building houses but we have no money, and if they emigrate and we then get the money, we will not have these workers.  As far as housing is concerned, the Government should keep their priorities right and ensure, even in this crisis, that money will be allocated so that the operatives can be retained here.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is an unfair criticism to say that as far as credit was concerned, there was mismanagement and the matter was allowed to get out of control.  The Government were fooled because during the halcyon years from 1961 to 1964 they did not appear to realise that the big increase in capital inflow was going to cease.  This capital inflow was unusual and came in for various purposes, for the establishment of industry, for the purchase of land and other things, and the Government should have realised that it was not going to last forever.  When they discovered this, they had to crack down hard on credit because they had allowed it to expand too much in 1964.</P>
    <P>During that period, it was evident that the Government had no priorities so far as the allocation of credit was concerned.  Credit was available at that time for all sorts of speculative ventures. If the Government had that credit, as they had, it should have been devoted, not necessarily in this order, to housing, industry and agriculture. One wonders if the Government have any control at all over credit or if they propose to take control of it.  It is a daft situation that, for example, in recent years office blocks were being taken down and new ones constructed, different building projects engaged in which were not really necessary, and this valuable credit being allocated to such ventures, and to discover a year or two afterwards that there is no money to build houses.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach should tell us in his reply if there is to be an easing of the <Col N="2215" /> credit squeeze.  If the situation is as he says it is, there is justification for such an easing.  People are entitled to this vital social amenity of housing.  Long-term promises to these people are no good.  Those who have been living in bad houses for years want a house this year or, at least, the prospect of getting it soon.  If we are to meet our commitments of providing 20,000 or 25,000 per year, we shall have to get on with the job now.  If credit is to be allocated, it is important that it should go to industry, but the top priority should be housing, water, sewerage, schools and the different social amenities to which our people are entitled.</P>
    <P>As I have said, 1965 was a bad year and has been recognised as such.  We advocated that our Government should do certain things which they refused to do.  I believe that if the Price Control Bill which they introduced this time last year had been introduced earlier on, we might not have had the difficulties in which we now find ourselves.  We had been advocating this for a very long time, but, like many of the things which are advocated from this side of the House, it was implemented by the Government too late.  I believe that, because of the lack of price control throughout 1964 and 1965, we have had this industrial unrest.  I do not say it was entirely responsible for the industrial unrest but it certainly was a big contributory factor.</P>
    <P>There has been relative stability in prices in recent times.  Due in the main, I suppose, to the Budget proposals, we find that compared with May of 1965, the Consumer Price Index has gone up by five points.  We in the Labour Party are not satisfied that the Minister has an effective staff to ensure that the proposals he made in his October order with regard to price control can be operated.  I warn the Taoiseach now that there is need for greater vigilance in the matter of prices and price increases in this situation where the £1 increase is being paid or will be paid to a majority of Irish workers.  This is the time for exploitation of that situation.  We never yet got from the Minister for Industry and Commerce an indication <Col N="2216" /> as to what type of staff he has, as to what sort of spot check is made in order to ensure that prices do not increase.  As I say, with workers receiving the £1 per week increase, there will be an effort to take more than should be taken by way of price increases.</P>
    <P>If an election were held now, the country would certainly show no confidence in the Government.  People can make their own interpretation of the results of the Presidential election, which is a favourite game these days. We are asking that Dáil Éireann approve of this motion.  We condemn the Government for their inactivity. We condemn the Government for their attitude of drift because undoubtedly that is what it was, particularly in 1965.  We condemn them because of their complacency in waiting and hoping that something would turn up.</P>
    <P>The Free Trade Agreement which was boosted so much last January seems to have lost all its glamour. There is no great boast for it now. I remember in January, 1965, it was going to meet the farmers' problems; it was going to be a bonanza for the agricultural community.  I see no spectacular rise in cattle exports and no spectacular increase in the price of cattle, and I wonder if the fears which the Labour Party expressed on that occasion were justified.</P>
    <P>Again, the Taoiseach spoke about the expectation of our going into EEC by 1970.  The Taoiseach is a most optimistic man as far as the EEC is concerned.  It seems to be a sort of phobia with him.  We are all agreed, and the Taoiseach agrees, that if Britain does not go in, we do not go in.  The indications are at the present time that Britain is not going in.  They have another four years to reach what the Taoiseach says is the deadline for us.  The indications, as far as I can see, particularly in view of the conversations in London yesterday, are that the French will not allow them in until they subscribe entirely to the Treaty of Rome, and Britain says the Treaty of Rome will have to be changed before she goes in. However, the Taoiseach is a brave and courageous man when he thinks about <Col N="2217" /> the EEC, and if 1970 is his target, that is all right, but I do not think it is going to be achieved.</P>
    <P>We condemn the Government for failing to plan the economy so that all our resources are utilised to the full.  The most important resource we have is manpower and we think very little of it.  We think very little of it not alone to the extent of not providing jobs for them but of not even giving them adequate social welfare benefits.  We condemn the Government for giving merely lip service to the idea of economic planning while doing nothing about it and for paying the same sort of lip service to the sanctity of private enterprise.  I believe, and I have said this many times before, that there should be greater concentration on economic planning and on public enterprise.  Private enterprise cannot do the job entirely in this country.  They can do their own job &mdash;they do it pretty well for themselves &mdash;but there is a limit to what they can do, and in our country public enterprise can meet the situation much better than it is doing at the present time.</P>
    <P>Little did we think at the time of the introduction of the Second Programme that in the sixth of the ten-year programme, we would have an unemployment rate of 6.6 per cent, that we would have fewer at work than we had when the Programme was first announced and that we would have a crisis in housing and no prospect of improvement.  Little did we think that in the sixth year of the Second Programme for Economic Expansion, it would be necessary for a Government to bring in two Budgets, following the Budget of last year which was a complete failure.  Little did we think that this second Budget would be introduced a short three months after the first one, which again leads us to believe that most of the things which Fianna Fáil do are done for the Party and not for the country.</P>
    <P>We condemn the Government because there has been a slowing-down in production.  It is not sufficient for the Taoiseach to state the facts as far as production is concerned.  It is his duty to show how it can be increased.  It is <Col N="2218" /> his duty and that of his Government to ensure that production will be increased. Little did we think that, five and a half years after the introduction of the Second Programme, many of our people would be so poorly paid, that, despite all the talk about the monetary demands and the excessive demands of the trade union movement, in 1966 there would be 150,000 people in this country with less than £10 per week.  The Government, we believe, should not have the confidence of Dáil Éireann as we believe they have not the confidence of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The motions in my name and in the name of Deputy Corish reflect the clear indication given in the recent Presidential election that in such a short space of time no Government have so rapidly lost public confidence as the present Government.  It is appropriate at this stage that we should review the basis on which the present Government were elected, the policy which they alleged they could implement and the claims made for that policy, that it was designed to create more employment, provide more houses and improve the health services.</P>
      <P>If we examine the results of the past 12 or 14 months, we find that today there are fewer people employed than ever before, that in fact the numbers in employment are between 40,000 and 50,000 less than ten years ago, and that in the first four months of this year for which figures are available, the average numbers in receipt of unemployment benefit show a rise of over 4,000 per week over the first four months of last year.  The health services are static while the cost of living continues to rise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Probably in respect of houses the failure of the Government is more indicated that in any other sphere. Without taking into account houses constructed in recent years, the numbers for the first five months of this year of State-aided schemes show a very substantial drop.  The figures for the first five months of 1965 show that there were 3,282 State-aided housing schemes.  For the first five months of this year, the number had <Col N="2219" /> dropped to 2,892.  If we take the number of houses reconstructed, the figure for the first five months of 1965 was 3,643 and for the first five months of this year 3,352.</P>
    <P>For new houses built with State assistance, the figures are only available for the first three months of this year.  For the first three months of last year, the number was 2,700 odd and this year that figure has dropped to 2,200.  These figures reflect what every Deputy and every member of a local authority throughout the country know to be a fact, that housing, whether by local authorities or by persons availing of the Small Dwellings Acts, shows a very substantial decline.  The position has been reached in virtually every local authority where the shortage of funds has meant that houses which should be built are not being undertaken. In most local authorities, the situation has developed that so far as Small Dwellings Acts activities are concerned, the funds available are only sufficient to cover applications submitted before last December.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Local Government has repeatedly used the argument that because the same amount of money has been provided this year as was provided last year, there has been no decline in building.  The figures now published in the Economic Series of the middle of June show what everybody knows to be the fact, that there has been a noticeable decline in houses built and houses reconstructed under every heading, by local authorities and under the Small Dwellings Acts.</P>
    <P>I want in this debate to direct attention to the very serious situation which affects particularly the urban areas but also the rural areas.  In Dublin, the situation is one of acute hardship for a great many families, for thousands of families in need of accommodation. Quite recently there was published a most misleading report which indicated that the problem was on the way to solution.  I believe the Dáil and the country are entitled to an explanation of the delay in completing the Ballymun scheme.  The weather is not a justification for this delay because this <Col N="2220" /> winter was no worse than last winter. The weather affects all building and construction alike.  When are the public going to be told the full story of whether it would be cheaper and quicker to build by the ordinary accepted methods than by the present methods employed at Ballymun?  The Government must be aware of the concern at the delay in completing that scheme and at the lack of any progress in the handing over of whatever houses are completed to Dublin Corporation for occupation.</P>
    <P>Every local authority feels a shortage of funds for housing, for the payment of loans under the Small Dwellings Acts.  There is a shortage of funds to pay supplementary grants and for both water and sewerage schemes.  In my own constituency of Dún Laoghaire, there are at present 350 applicants regarded as being in urgent need of houses.  The only scheme at present under construction is one of 26 houses.  There is not another scheme in prospect within the next 12 months. Sites were acquired as far back as ten years ago which would have accommodated another 200 to 300 houses. Additional sites have since been acquired and there is absolutely no prospect of a new scheme being commenced, as I have said, within 12 months.  Is that not a deplorable state of affairs?  What I have said in respect of this local authority applies, to a greater or lesser extent, to every other local authority.  The situation, of course, is worse in the large cities and towns, places like Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford, but it is bad even in the rural areas.  In the Rathdown portion of my constituency, one housing scheme is at present being completed and there is no prospect of any other in the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>The time has arrived to inquire what action the Government propose to take to ease the present credit restrictions. It is not enough to say, as the Taoiseach said, that things are improving.  There must be a positive easing of the credit situation and it must not be confined to Government borrowing.  The figures for the internal supply of money and the domestic creation of credit published <Col N="2221" /> in the Central Bank Bulletin for May of this year show that the domestic credit creation for Government, including local authorities, rose between December, 1964, and March, 1966, by over £42 million but that the domestic creation of credit for other categories, the private sector, dropped by £10.1 million and last year, in the period ending July, the increase in the domestic credit over the previous year was £28.4 million but £28 million of it was hogged by the Government and by the local authorities.  This year the extra credit being made available has been taken entirely by the Government and by the local authorities, leaving nothing of the increase for the private sector.</P>
    <P>I believe the time has come when the Central Bank should give a definite indication to the commercial banks to ease the present credit squeeze.  If the position continues as it has continued during the early months of this year, with a drop in housing construction, a drop in construction generally, a decline in the numbers employed as well as in output, it will be aggravated because of the continued difficulty in securing funds for these purposes.</P>
    <P>This year, the Government have very substantially increased the tax burden. The Taoiseach adverted to the fact that if the present capital programme is to be maintained, it involves not merely taxation but also the availability of capital at home and abroad.  The situation has been reached in the past 12 or 14 months in which there are fewer people in employment, in which the growth rate anticipated in the Second Programme was not achieved last year and will not be achieved or maintained this year, in which fewer houses are being constructed, costs are rising on every section and it is difficult to obtain at home or abroad the money required to maintain the capital programme.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach adverted to the fact that a great many of the anticipated targets in the Second Programme would be difficult of achievement.  I want again to ask when will the Second Programme be revised on a realistic basis.  The Second Programme anticipated <Col N="2222" /> a rise in the number employed. Up to the present there are fewer employed than when the Programme started.  The Second Programme anticipated a rise in output last year and this year's figures show that that increase in the growth rate has not been achieved.  The Taoiseach, in his survey this morning, said that, if the target was to be achieved, the growth rate for the next four years up to 1970 would have to be over five per cent. With a single quite exceptional exception, a growth rate of five per cent was never achieved and it is quite unrealistic to expect or anticipate that it could be maintained for a protracted period.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that the targets in the Second Programme require to be revised on a realistic basis.  In respect of employment, output, housing and every other single heading that one can enumerate, the targets have not been achieved and the prospects of achieving them in the remaining years of this decade are entirely unlikely.</P>
    <P>One of the factors adverted to by the NIEC in their Report on the economic situation was that many of the present difficulties were due to an excessive expansion of monetary demands of which a major cause was the rapid rise in investment over the period which was described in the NIEC Reports as being largely determined by Government policy, a deterioration in the relative competitiveness of Irish production, excessive credit creation, much of it for unproductive purposes, which as the NIEC Report said, facilitated the excessive increase in demand and the creation of the development of an environment in which price increases could be easily passed on.</P>
    <P>Responsibility for all these results lies with the Government.  The Government have not adhered to the targets or guidelines laid down in the Second Programme and have failed to exercise control and, as stated by Deputy Corish and as has been repeated on a number of occasions, have, for political purposes, allowed an exceptionally rapid expansion, to such an extent that the capital programme can now be maintained only with great difficulty.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2223" /> That situation has been further aggravated by the decision in the recent Budget to introduce the wholesale tax.  This wholesale tax will now affect a number of commodities which have already borne the turnover tax. It has been estimated that in the building industry which is at present experiencing great difficulty, the increase in costs as a result of the wholesale tax will add between three to four per cent on the price of houses this year.  It is true that cement is exempt but a number of other building materials are caught by the tax. Building costs in this country continue to rise steeply.  It is obvious that this increase in costs will make it even more difficult for Small Dwellings Acts loan applicants to purchase houses and will increase the difficulty for local authorities in getting houses built.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach adverted to trade prospects and indicated that it was proposed to send a ministerial delegation to Brussels during the Recess.  I should like to get some clear indication from the Government of the state our application to join the EEC is in at the present time.  So far as one can gather, the application is static.  This is not the first exploratory mission, either at Government or official level, that has gone to Brussels and in the present atmosphere in which it is not obvious what is going to happen to the British application, the avowed intention of becoming members of EEC by 1970 seems to have little reality behind it.  The time has come when we should be given a clear indication of what action it is proposed to take in respect of our application and whether a joint approach on the basis of a number of applicant countries is to be made and, if so, whether it is proposed that this country should participate in it.</P>
    <P>Some reference was made in recent debates, and no later than last night, to Government policy in respect of health and education.  The Taoiseach in his review today said it was necessary to spend more on education if we were <Col N="2224" /> to provide the facilities and opportunities necessary for those seeking educational vacancies in future, The Supply Estimates, certainly up to three years ago, showed that compared with 30 or 35 years ago, we were spending a lower percentage on education than we did then.  It is true that relative expenditure had increased but the percentage of the Supply Estimates spent on education had dropped.  Any increase since in the Supply Estimates in respect of education has not made good that drop.  This was commented on in the Lynch Report and the figures which I saw some time ago showed that the drop was quite considerable compared with 30 years ago.  We then spent 19 per cent of the Supply Estimates on education and in recent years the percentage dropped to as low as 13. It is true that expenditure in other spheres had increased but instead of the tendency being in the direction of an increase in the proportion of Supply Estimates devoted to education, we had a drop.</P>
    <P>Apart from the aspect of expenditure, there is the whole question of the approach to our needs in respect of technical and vocational training involved in the question of the re-training which will be necessary in the light of the Trade Agreement and the possible effects of redundancy in industry. In that regard it is difficult to understand why the decision of the Government to cut tariffs by five per cent which was involved in the Trade Agreement from 1st July, was followed by an announcement that it is proposed to cut tariffs by a further ten per cent from 1st September.  If we take a typical tariff of 50 per cent, it follows that between June and September this year, there will be a reduction of 15 per cent.  Why should exporters to this country get the first benefit rather than offering some help to Irish industry and business to compete on export markets? Under the recent Trade Agreement, it is true that the prospects of exporting to Britain are improved but the effective reduction between June and September of 15 per cent, a very severe drop in such a short period, must off-set any prospective advantage which the Trade Agreement would provide.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2225" /> The present situation in which industry and trade have to compete with the cut in respect of these tariffs, and will have to compete with the further cut on 1st September, has been aggravated by the severe contraction of credit and the difficulty created by the continued bank strike.  Over and above that, this year the review undertaken in respect of last year by the OECD shows that the industrial unrest in this country placed us in the unenviable position that we have the worst record in Europe for industrial disputes and the number of man-hours lost through disruption in the continuity of work by these disputes.  I hope the establishment of the new Department of Labour and the appointment of the new Minister will at least prove fruitful for the economy. It is regrettable that the present industrial unrest which has affected so many sections of the economy in recent months has undoubtedly militated against the economic programme which is necessary if we are to overcome the decline in output and the failure to reach the growth rate which was planned in the Second Programme.</P>
    <P>The present situation is one in which responsible opinion must be concerned at the way so many major disputes have affected the economy and the prospects of attaining the growth rate desired and also the capacity of the country to compete effectively and efficiently in export markets.  I believe the present situation of the capital programme is largely the result of the haphazard way in which the programme was arrived at.  I have repeatedly advocated, and all the evidence indicated, that there is an inescapable obligation on the Government to plan the capital programme in such a way that it will be possible of achievement over a foreseen period in respect of major capital undertakings.</P>
    <P>This aspect of the failure of the Government to plan the capital programme was commented on by the NIEC report which criticised the haphazard and unco-ordinated nature of much public investment and the lack of any machinery for supervision <Col N="2226" /> and inspection.  It pointed out that these investments were largely determined by Government policy and that inflationary pressure could only be avoided by control components of total demand and recommended to the Government that with that end in view, capital projects should be ranked in order of national importance.  This was clearly intended as a basis for decisions to prevent a repetition of the rejection by the Government of the targets laid down in the Second Programme.</P>
    <P>That has been emphasised and endorsed by circumstances in which every type of public capital expenditure has found it difficult to maintain its momentum and in which not only have the Government and local authorities experienced the problem, but farmers and traders applying to the Agricultural Credit Corporation or business people applying for credit either to the Industrial Credit Company or the commercial banks, have been finding it more and more difficult to get sufficient money to carry out the programme and plans in hands.</P>
    <P>I believe, therefore, the time has arrived when this whole capital programme and the targets laid down in the Second Programme for Economic Expansion should be reviewed on a realistic basis.  The whole record of the Government in respect of every aspect of national economic policy covered by the Second Programme indicates failure&mdash;failure to increase employment; failure to keep unemployment down; failure to build an adequate number of houses; failure to provide a better health service; failure to provide increased opportunities in education and increased opportunities for those who wish to avail of these places.</P>
    <P>Over and above that, the Government have an obligation to deal with the very pressing claims of pensioners. No section of the community has been so affected by the rise in the cost of living, by the increase in the cost of essentials, as pensioners.  In 1964, an interdepartmental committee reported on pensions and on the changes which should be made.  Since then, with the exception of a few paltry increases, <Col N="2227" /> no action has been taken to implement that report.  I want to stress the very serious situation which affects so many retired personnel.  When that report was published, it contained a recommendation that the pension increases should be revised on a basis similar to that which operated in a number of countries.  At paragraph 20 of the Report of the Committee on Post-Retirement Adjustments in Public Service Pensions, we read:</P>
    <P>Having considered all the arguments submitted to us and all the relevant data, we are of opinion that it is fair and reasonable to increase pensions to an extent sufficient to offset increases in the Consumer Price Index that have occurred from the dates of the general rounds of pay increases to which pensions are currently related, to the date of the most recent general pay increase, and we recommend accordingly.</P>
    <P>When that recommendation was made, the cost of living stood at 165; it is now 185.  With the exception of very minor increases, nothing has been done to implement that recommendation.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Government are aware of the acute difficulties which affect pensioners, particularly those who are retired for a number of years.  Some pensioners who retired more recently have possible prospects of some form of alternative employment. Because of the recent date of their retirement, they are possibly physically and mentally capable of getting some type of employment that will supplement their pension.  The longer a person is retired, the less likely it is that employment can be obtained and, in any event, it applies only to a very limited number.  This recommendation, which was made after an exhaustive examination by the interdepartmental Committee, involves a decision that this country keep in line with what is now the generally accepted practice of many European countries, and a number of countries outside Europe, that pensions, instead of being based on pay at retirement, are adjusted to take account of the cost of <Col N="2228" /> living changes and raised on the basis of the appropriate cost of living increases in the same way as pay is increased to cover those at present working.  I believe there is a duty on the House and on the country to see to it that justice is done to pensioners in respect of the revised arrangements which should be operated. Over and above that, a recommendation was made in respect of the health services which we have advocated for a number of years in respect of income tax.</P>
    <P>That recommendation was contained in the Second Report of the Commission on Income Taxation.  I know now, from a statement by the Minister for Finance, that it is proposed to establish a committee to inquire into this.  It is a favourite device of any Government in difficulty and who want to avoid taking a decision to establish a committee to report on it, and the bigger the committee, the less prospect there is of getting a report or agreement on the terms of the report.</P>
    <P>This recommendation, which is contained in the Seventh Report of the Commission on Income Taxation is clear and simple.  At paragraph 96, page 31, of the Seventh Report, we read:</P>
    <P>We recommend that a taxpayer who incurs expense on himself, or on any dependant, arising out of disability or illness, which is serious and likely to be permanent should be allowed the vouched expenses in excess of £50 p.a. per person and up to a maximum of £300 p.a. per person.</P>
    <P>I believe that recommendation, which was made after a very full examination and on the basis of information supplied to the Commission, does not require to be further examined by any interdepartmental committee and should be implemented forthwith.</P>
    <P>This debate, coming at the end of a series of economic debates, merely emphasises the inability of the Government to implement the undertakings given during the last election.  As I mentioned at the beginning, no Government, in such a short space of time, have been so emphatically repudiated <Col N="2229" /> on the effect of their policies as has occurred in recent weeks.  In the recent election, it was obvious that the people had decided that the failure of the Government to implement their policy warranted a clear condemnation and a clear expression of no confidence.  I believe the Government have endeavoured to avoid, by every device open to them, an expression by the people of their opinion in that regard. They sought to avoid the local elections and introduced legislation to postpone them.  They endeavoured to confuse the issue during the Presidential election even to the extent of suggesting that there should be no contest.</P>
    <P>I believe the present situation has resulted because this Government are continually looking back.  They are looking backward to such an extent that the momentum that should characterise and influence Government action and policies has ceased to exist. The Government and the country are static, if not moving backwards.  The recent ministerial changes are devised to create the illusion that there is movement in some direction, if not forward, then at least from side to side.  The present lack of confidence stems from the failure of the Government to give a lead economically, socially and in any sphere of government or national policy.  The attempt to avoid a verdict by the people can only postpone the inexorable expression of the people's opinion which cannot be averted and we offer this motion to the House so that the House may express a clear view against the inactivity of the Government in dealing with ordinary problems affecting so many sections of the community.</P>

      <P>We have tabled a motion that the Dáil has no confidence in this Administration.  It is perfectly obvious to anybody who has contacts with the mass of the ordinary people that the people have, indeed, no confidence in this Government.  That is demonstrably true.  If this Government were to put their popularity to the test, they would be turfed out of office. One of the evidences of that, one of the most valid evidences that can be found of lack of support for any Government, is to be seen on an examination of the figures in their recent Presidential election.  No matter what the major Parties may claim, or disclaim, about the Presidential election, the facts are that the Government had as a candidate a semi-mythical figure, one who it might be said has almost entered into the sub-god section of our Celtic mythology.  I do not say that with any intent of disrespect: it is so.  It would have appeared, I am sure it did appear, to the particular Field Marshal of the Rearguard in charge of this operation to be almost an impossibility than An t-Uachtarán could be brought within 100 miles of defeat.</P>
      <P>Any outside observer, looking at the situation, and with any knowledge of the country, looking back over the years, of the personal political record of the President when he was Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party could not but have said: &ldquo;Well, good gracious, when he carried in such a collection as he did successfully from 1927 to Leinster House, handicapped as he was by incompetence and embarrassment on many occasions in the persons of his following, surely he cannot possibly miss in this&rdquo;.  Yet we had a result which, I am sure, startled not alone the successful candidate but the unsuccessful candidate as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What did it show?  In my view, it showed beyond all question of doubt one thing: the people were seizing on the opportunity to protest against the policies and activities, or inactivities, of this Government.  I do not say that in any sense at all of denigration of the <Col N="2232" /> great effort put into that campaign by Deputy Tom O'Higgins, who deserves considerable credit for conducting what must have been a very tiring and, indeed, very difficult business, and one which would appal any reasonable, rational man.  However, quite apart from the personalities of it, it is accepted now by all I think, if not openly, certainly in their secret hearts, that the Presidential election was an expression by the people of their dissatisfaction with the Fianna Fáil Government and of their anxiety for a change.  There was an element, not as great as is suggested, of youthful exercise of the franchise which was not present in previous elections; this youthful element seemed almost unanimous against the Administration, though it was not, as I say, as great as some would like to suggest; but it was nevertheless present.</P>
    <P>The main thing was that the country had long felt that this Government in their expressions of policy and in the activities of certain of their Ministers had lost contact and sympathy with the people and any apparent desire to meet the wishes of the people.  The Taoiseach last week, when he saw signs of possible critical references to the Minister for Transport and Power, reached down into his very well-stocked political armoury for the old weapon with which one can attempt to beat most accusations and said&mdash;before anything was said at all about Deputy Childers &mdash;that anything that was going to be said about him would be character assassination.  That brings me now to the very interesting subject of Fianna Fáil equations.  It is fitting, I think, that one should look at them because the founder of this organisation, now so obviously on the wane, was, I believe, a mathematician.</P>
    <P>It has often occurred to me that anything said by the Opposition in criticism of the Government is equal to one thing&mdash;destructive criticism&mdash;anything that is not adulation or adoration of the powers that be.  On the other hand, constructive criticism is completely and absolutely adoration of the Cabinet. No doubt if indulged in by the backbenchers of Fianna Fáil, it may in time pay them in a certain way.  If one <Col N="2233" /> seeks to expose incompetence in the Government or bring to the notice of the Dáil the insolence of office&mdash;and insolence of office is nowhere more clearly exemplified than in the person and in the attitude of the Minister for Transport and Power&mdash;that is character assassination, if you do not mind.  If a Deputy feels impelled to express on behalf of citizens their feelings as to the Government's lassitude, carelessness and cynicism, why, this is irresponsibility. This is another Fianna Fáil equation.  The national interest equals the welfare and glorification of Fianna Fáil.  These little exercises have been repeated so often in this House that they have come to be accepted by the more ingenuous members of Fianna Fáil as having some validity, whereas, of course, they are completely false.</P>
    <P>I have expressed the opinion before that the Taoiseach's Thesbian qualities, his abilities as an actor, are of a very high order and are probably lost on the limited stage we have here; but he certainly has used them to put across on the people of this country the pretence that this Government are all things to all men.  He has lost no opportunity of fostering that illusion on every occasion open to him.  We recently had the example, which disgusted the nation, of the special treatment accorded to the Chairman of CIE on the occasion of his retirement. Some Deputies may say&mdash;and they are not all confined to the Government side &mdash;that this was a great public servant who received no more than his due, that his services to the country were of such a nature that he had earned this £8,000 odd he was given to pay his fare out to Donnybrook to take up his job with Radio/Telefís Éireann. If we put that in its proper perspective, we will see more closely why the people are so disgusted with the action of the Government.</P>
    <P>I have the case of a man who spent, not ten, not 12, not 15 years, but 30 years in the service of this State. This man was in the service of this State when the Chairman of CIE was engaged, along with the Taoiseach, in a determined effort to destroy this State at its very foundation.  But we will let bygones be bygones and start <Col N="2234" /> all over again.  This man had 30 years' service as a civil servant, but those years were what are known as unestablished years.  To the casual observer&mdash; indeed to the close student of this kind of thing&mdash;there is no discernible difference between an established year and a temporary year of service except the whim of the people in authority in the particular Department in which the particular civil servant is working. This man had to go at 65.  He was not offered any alternative employment. He was told that as far as the State was concerned, it had no further use for him.</P>
    <P>As I said, he had served 30 years. How many years service were counted for pensionable purposes?  Exactly half, 15 years.  I would invite the Dáil to guess at what his pension was.  His pension was £1 6s per week after 30 years' service.  This man was out in O'Connell Street in the week the anniversary of which we have just celebrated.  His golden handshake, along with the £1 6s pension, in comparison with that given to the Chairman of CIE for a handful of years' service, was a gold medal because he was in the GPO 50 years ago.  Whenever he finds himself in need of the price of a loaf&mdash;we will leave out the question of a pint because he could not think in terms of a pint on 26/- a week and the little he gets for his presence in the GPO&mdash;whenever he feels he needs something special, he can look at that medal and I am sure he wonders what to do with it.</P>
    <P>Here you have the case of a man with 30 years' service to the State, apart from his share in laying the foundations of the State, treated in this shabby fashion.  On the other hand, you have this ridiculous proposition that we are supposed to sit here dumb about the Chairman of CIE, who after possibly a dozen years of public service and less than that in CIE, went into CIE charged with the job of making it an economic proposition left it owing twice as much as when he found it.  We must accept that this public servant should get a present of over £8,000 and walk into another job at a <Col N="2235" /> nominal salary of £1,000, while on the other hand, scores, if not hundreds, if not thousands of the people I have described suffer under the lash of economic hardship, loneliness and the unwantedness of old age.</P>
    <P>This, I would suggest, is the major sin on the soul of our modern Irish society, the manner in which we cast out our old people from society even as the animals do, only with less consideration. Every year we have the beggarly dollar given to the old people through the Budget.  People who have some way of living are relieved in one way or another; the wealthy are not interfered with except by being asked to pay taxes which they should be asked to pay, but they represent a voting bloc with which it would be dangerous to tamper.  But the old people are thrown out of society, tossed aside with what can only be described as a lousy dollar every year.</P>
    <P>Indeed, the State from its policies towards the aged&mdash;and I am referring now to people in receipt of non-contributory old age pensions&mdash;not alone does not take steps to discourage death but would seem secretly to wish that this embarrassment of the aged and the lonely&mdash;who have been described on occasion, by Deputy Dillon principally, with such eloquence and so little effect&mdash;should be removed.  It is the great untouched problem of our time, this neglect of the aged.  In so far as we have looked at it at all, we have shown every evidence of very little advance from the animal stage, in which those who are beyond their best are flung into the wilderness to live as long as they can, which usually is not very long, at the mercy of the elements and the elements in our society can be just as savage as the elements of the jungle.</P>
    <P>This euphemism about free enterprise should not mislead anybody. There is no such thing as free enterprise. If you are born into the world with money, you start off with a great advantage.  You start with one lap of the course already done in the race of life, as against the person born with nothing, because money will buy you education and it will buy you skill.  If <Col N="2236" /> you do not have money, you may just be one in ten thousand who will rise above it all; you may be like a Sweepstake winner.  You have the same chance.  This expression of free society or free enterprise is just another way of saying that the strongest will feast off the weakest, the weakest will do what the strongest say.  Inequality, they would have us believe, is part not alone of the law of the land but the law of God, because some people suggest that the poor we will always have with us, forgetting that in that sense what Scripture means is not the poor in pocket but the poor in spirit, in mind and in intellect, who undoubtedly will always be with us.</P>
    <P>The welfare State is what the Labour Party stand for and although it has been denigrated and assaulted by the forces of vested interests, and the very term has come to be used by some ignorant people as a term of reprobation, we can look at our neighbour, which indeed now is our sister island since we have re-enacted or reinforced the Act of Union, and there see what the first charge upon the public assistance authorities is.  A person there, whether or not he is the loneliest man in the world, and no matter what his colour, race or creed may be, will have his rent paid and if he is sick, he will be taken to hospital without having to fill in a form for a medical card, or without being asked what county he came from.  It does not matter if he never met the English equivalent of a TD or a county councillor, because he will be treated the same as everybody else.  Under the welfare State the best is available to him.</P>
    <P>Let me say at this point how sorry I am to see the departure from the Department of Health of Deputy Donogh O'Malley, who did so much to create the conditions of a welfare State in health and who if he had been left there, would have brought about that situation, but upon whom the dead hand of conservatism has now been placed.  It may be that we shall see his successor being equally good.  As far as I am concerned, this is part of our no confidence motion.  Deputy <Col N="2237" /> O'Malley by his public statements about the class of people I have been talking about, the old and the sick, earned for himself, apart from politics at all, an admiration and affection which it will be hard for anybody else to earn because these people believed in him and believed he was going to do the things he said he would do, improve things for the aged and the sick.  He did bring about those improvements in the time available to him.</P>
    <P>Those people will be saddened by his departure but no more saddened than I am, or any honest man in this House, who knows that it is a step backwards.  Here we had a glimmering of progressiveness, a man with not alone imagination but courage to say what he wanted to say and to have done what he wanted to see done.  It seems to be always the fate of men of that kind in this country that they will be obstructed, denigrated and, if possible, destroyed.  That is my interpretation of what has happened to the Minister for Health.</P>
    <P>Contrary to the speculations which appear in today's papers regarding the Irish language, I think this whole dialogue about the Irish language will be seen, in the heel of the hunt, to have little relevance to the problems of living of the people.  The question of the Irish language is important: it must be important.  Tá an tUachtarán ag caint in a taobh ar feadh na blianta. I am very fond of Irish myself.  I learnt it through the dispensation of a former Minister for Justice, now Senator Gerald Boland, who secured for me a scholarship in an institution where I was enabled to study it for some years.  The love of it and the study of it should be fostered in every way possible.</P>
    <P>I object as much as anyone to compulsory Irish.  It is a fringe subject.  It does not affect the lives of the mass of the people in the sense that the Department of Health does.  A sick man is not interested in languages, except possibly one language, and it is not Irish.  A person who cannot pay a specialist's fees will not feel too much like opening <i>Buntús Gaeilge</i> before he gets the money to pay the fees.  That is <Col N="2238" /> the great tragedy of what has happened yesterday, the departure from the Department of Health of the one man who had the qualities and the ability to push through what we want to see, that is, a guarantee to everybody in accordance with what the Creator said &mdash;and what has been said by all great thinkers and prophets down through the centuries, but particularly what the Creator said: &ldquo;Whatsoever you do unto these my least brethren, you do unto Me.&rdquo;  It is the Christian ideal to which we give lip service.  We have not seen it yet in this country.  I in my foolish youth used to think we would see it in a matter of years if only people would open their eyes.  However, I sometimes lose hope that we will ever see that ideal of society made effective.  It must come sooner or later but, as Moleskin Joe used to say: &ldquo;There is a good time coming.&rdquo;  But we will not live to see it.</P>
    <P>I should like to move on from that, because the thought of the neglect of our sick people and our aged people is a very depressing one.  It is one of the reasons upon which we ground the motion of no confidence in this Government.  We do not feel that the aged or the sick are being dealt with fairly.  In so far as the aged are concerned, every year they get 5/-.  It is impossible to find words to describe what I think of the mentality of a Minister who is content to throw this 5/- in the general direction of the old age pensioners every year.  We shall change that as time goes on.</P>
    <P>I am sorry the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government is going because I have a few words to say concerning the fall down of the Government in the matter of the provision of water and sewerage services.  Water and sewerage services, we are told in the pastorals which issue from the Custom House from time to time, are prerequisities to the building of cottages even in the most remote areas, whereas in other years it was possible in County Dublin, parts of which are as rural as parts of County Clare, incredible though it may seem, to secure the building of cottages for people badly in need of <Col N="2239" /> them in such areas, particularly during the great blossoming of building which occurred during the first inter-Party Government, when there were more houses built in three years than ever were built before or have been built since or, I venture to say, ever will be built again in such a comparable period.</P>
    <P>It was possible then for us to get houses built in pairs or singly in the rural areas of County Dublin which did not have water laid on or sewerage pipes connected, and we could house many people by doing this, people who have been used to living in these areas where water and sewerage were not an accepted amenity any more than they are in most of the rural areas of Ireland.  Dry sanitation, which is not a desirable thing, has been accepted by any of us who spend any time in rural Ireland.  Standards have advanced in the direction of septic tanks, and that is all to the good, but ten or 15 years ago we could get houses built in County Dublin for people who badly needed them, without such services.  The Custom House now ordains that no cottage shall be built in a rural area without these services, if not actually laid on, within reach.</P>
    <P>The building of individual cottages in rural areas, which is the one thing which might have some effect in keeping people in rural areas, is now condemned by the Department, and the Department's pronouncements counsel local authorities to group cottages in villages, further denuding the countryside, as it were, going further along the road towards urbanisation and towards that undesirable end of centralisation which has made our economy and our population such a lopsided thing.  In the county and city of Dublin, we have almost one-third of the population of Ireland. This must be regarded as being scarcely very desirable and on journeys through the countryside, one can see for oneself the sparseness of the population.</P>
    <P>What prospect have we in north county Dublin of getting water and <Col N="2240" /> sewerage?  The vast engineering projects which brought forth Boulder Dam, the Tennessee Valley Authority, the harnessing of the mighty Colorado are mere trifles compared with the vast complex with which we have grown from youth to middle age and which is known as the North Dublin Regional Water Scheme.  It seems to me that tomatoes will grow red on the banks of the Upper Nile, that the Aswan Dam will be overflowing, that the temples of Abu Simbel will be silted over before the people of Garristown, Oldtown and Ballyboughal will turn on taps in their houses.</P>
    <P>Oldtown is a place well known to me and to my learned colleague, Deputy Burke, which has been seeking houses for as long as I can remember.  The only time they got houses there was in the much denigrated time of the inter-Party Government. There were 16 years of Fianna Fáil Government before that but they got no houses.  There were three years of inter-Party Government and some houses were built.  In the second period of inter-Party Government, some few further houses were built but never has a house been built since in Oldtown.  I am told that much of the lack of progress has been ascribed by the chairman of the local cumann to the fact that Oldtown never had a visit from the Taoiseach at that time and that things would have been different if he had gone to Oldtown and seen the situation for himself.  Nevertheless, the only time that houses were provided in Oldtown was during the period of the inter-Party Government.</P>
    <P>There are a considerable number of people in this little rural area and there must be hundreds of villages like it all over the country.  There is no water near it; there is no sewerage near it. There are a number of people who cannot build their own houses because of their economic conditions, farm workers, road workers and workers in other industries which do not pay sufficient to enable them to save enough to pay the exorbitant prices which builders are asking nowadays. Therefore they have to rely on the county council to provide accommodation <Col N="2241" /> for them.  There is a housing committee in Oldtown.  To my knowledge, it has been there for the past five years and probably before that.  This committee set about trying to house themselves.</P>
    <P>They held meetings and invited councillors along and finally were delighted when a local landowner indicated that he was prepared to provide a site for the building of houses for those who needed them.  This news was received with great satisfaction.  Then there entered again the county council and the county council engineers who, after examination of the soil, decided that it was impossible to construct a septic tank in this area.  The soil had been sent for analysis and it appeared that at a certain depth the ground was porous, and that seepage was possible below so many feet.  Therefore housing was ruled out.</P>
    <P>Then we inquired about the North County Dublin Regional Water Scheme, the opening of which was marked at the Spa Hotel in Lucan by the presentation of a beautiful piece of Georgian silver to the Minister for Local Government.  It is the only thing we seem to have got out of it so far. That was years ago.  I was at the function and one could hear the pressure of the water in the taps at Jordanstown and down by Reynoldstown, where the great chaser of that name came from. I could visualise every family in these villages with piped water in their homes at long last.  That function was so long ago that I have forgotten when it happened and we are still waiting for the extension of that scheme to North County Dublin.</P>
    <P>However, as surely as we have the local elections next year, if we do not have a general election before that&mdash; and those of the Taoiseach's Party who hastened to rejoice at his recent assurance of the longevity of this House should remember that we are coming back here in September and that their joy may have been too previous, because we have heard the Taoiseach give this assurance before and it has not worked out that way&mdash; as surely as the Taoiseach's assurance will be found to have no foundation in fact <Col N="2242" /> and this House will not go the full distance, my esteemed and learned colleague in county Dublin will be heard outside the chapel gates at the next election telling the people of North County Dublin of the imminence of the North County Dublin Regional Water Scheme.</P>
    <P>Once again another generation will walk away after Mass feeling certain that they will see the minimal amenities of civilisation brought to their new houses.  I wonder are they too going to grow much older, less ingenuous and more disillusioned to find that this scheme has entered more or less into the realms of a fairy tale.  It is becoming a fairy tale that people now talk about, and think they may see any minute but never really see.  It is more or less in the same <i>genre</i> as the drainage of the Shannon.  Those of us who went to Leitrim-Roscommon a couple of years ago, when the Taoiseach was initiating inflation, will remember how large the question of the drainage of the Shannon loomed in the election.  I remember a Sunday morning when the papers were full of the prophecies that were now, at long last, to be fulfilled. That was just a few days before polling day.  The Shannon was to be drained. There was obvious poverty in certain parts of Leitrim.  It struck me as being the most impoverished part of Ireland. There was economic poverty and a lack of youth.  At Mass, the people did not seem to be enjoying the affluence that is talked about elsewhere. Small children and old people predominated. The people whom one would expect to see, young married men and women, were in England.</P>
    <P>I recall the time when the drainage of the Shannon was the carrot that was held out for the electors.  It did not work, of course, because, happily, the widow of the late Deputy Burke was returned, and a very excellent Deputy she is.  I am sure it was the best possible result that there could have been for the people of the area, politics apart.</P>
    <P>The North County Dublin Regional Water Scheme, like the drainage of the Shannon, is part of the fairytales of Ireland.  It calls very heavily on our <Col N="2243" /> Celtic credulity to believe in its existence. I would not believe it, despite the many Parliamentary Questions that there have been about it, were it not for the little piece of Georgian silver which I saw being presented to the Minister for Local Government and which sits, I am sure, among the mugs and jugs on the dresser in Donegal.</P>

      <P>The dresser&mdash;not the sideboard&mdash;not yet.  It bears on it evidence that there was, in fact, at one stage, a North County Dublin Regional Water Scheme.  I make no joke when I say that, in October, 1947, nearly 20 years ago, I listened to Deputy P.J. Burke, on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party, telling the people in Swords that the North County Dublin Regional Water Scheme was on its way.  It has not yet arrived.  People in the whole of North County Dublin are prevented from building, from draining their land, from having sanitation, from having a water supply.  They are not allowed to build because the Department of Local Government will not permit the traditional type of rural cottage to be built without sanitation. The North County Dublin Regional Water Scheme is something which, apparently, exists only in imagination. One cannot get any answer as to when it will service the areas in question.  It will be some time in the sweet bye-an-bye. There is all kinds of interference by engineers, architects, quantity surveyors and the devil knows what.  I am sure that Sherman went through Georgia much quicker than the pipe-layers are going through North County Dublin.  If one believed half of the excuses that are put up, it would appear that it is a tougher assignment to lay a pipe from Ballygoleen Reservoir outside Blanchardstown to Swords than it was to float Mulberry across the Channel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be a wonderful thing if Deputy Burke could finally retire.  He has already completed 21 years and the masterpiece has been presented.  It would be a wonderful thing if by the time the second 21 years expire some evidence could be seen of this North <Col N="2244" /> County Dublin Regional Water Scheme.</P>
    <P>CIE was given into the hands of the chairman some years ago with instructions to make it an economic proposition. It will be admitted that he set about the task with all the ruthlessness of a Rockefeller in the pursuit of gold and on the same principles&mdash;chopping branchlines left, right and centre, without regard to the hardships caused to people in the rural areas, imposing exorbitant increases in bus fares on the people of my constituency&mdash;Ballyfermot, Walkinstown, Dundrum, the county of Dublin generally, Balbriggan, Swords, Malahide, and so on. CIE remains a constipated body, in spite of the prolonged dosages of a well-known purgative.</P>
    <P>Telefís Éireann is about to be similarly physicked, despite every evidence of an end to public tolerance of this spurious nostrum.  CIE will be left by the much-enriched Chairman, ten years older and deeper in debt than when he found it.  As I understand it, CIE was about £1 million in the red when taken over by this alleged wonderman and he will leave it with £2 million liabilities around its neck.  He will leave a morass of labour relations which it will take all of Deputy Hillery's endeavours and possibly the assistance of many other people, to bring into any kind of reasoned relationship. The tenure of office of the Chairman, who was presented with this sum of £8,500 and this pension of £65 a week and a part-time job at £1,000 a year, will be marked by the fact that he caused three major strikes in the transport industry and estranged the workers and the unions as effectively as others who went before him in the commercial life of this city, whom I will not mention.  Yet, the Government lacking any sense of proportion in the circumstances, as we all know, insisted on giving him another job as well as enriching him for his endeavour in CIE.</P>
    <P>Up to now Telefís Éireann, despite all we have heard, seems to me to have run fairly satisfactorily.  We do not, of course, know what went on at Board level and we are not really <Col N="2245" /> interested, except in so far as it affects the end result and the welfare of those employed there, but it seems to have done an effective job.  I dread to think what may happen now when this so-called expert gets to work on it.  There is no doubt that he is an iron man. One does not like to be too personal about people who are not in the House.  Indeed, it would be a great pleasure if he were here.  Some system should be devised by the Government whereby these secret forces such as Dr. Andrews who wield more power practically than any Minister, should have seats in the House where they could be questioned and answer for what they are doing and where we could talk to them directly.  The same applies to senior civil servants or any civil servant because of the proposition that they are not in a position to defend themselves.  That is the silliest thing of all.  If one dares to say a word of criticism against a civil servant in any Department, he can defend himself very effectively, almost to the extent of putting you out of the House if you have any dealings with his Department.  Criticising people who are absent is something we do not like; we like, in fairness, to have people present when we are &ldquo;abusing&rdquo; or attacking&mdash;that is the right word&mdash; them justifiably or criticising them.  I hope the reporter will put &ldquo;abusing&rdquo; in inverted commas because it is not meant in the usual way.</P>
    <P>I spoke earlier about the importance of this motion which is one of no confidence in the Government and of our justification for it.  The justification is that in the absence of any kind of system for taking open polls or mass observations we must depend on what people in our constituencies tell us to get an idea of how they feel about the Government of the day.  There can be no doubt that in terms of popularity the Government have struck a record low.  One of the greatest insurances for political longevity that members of Fianna Fáil have is their reluctance to face the people.  I have said many times before that while I personally, unlike the Taoiseach, enjoy elections as I would enjoy castor oil, there are times when one must accept <Col N="2246" /> that, regardless of the consequences and the very great strain imposed on candidates, especially those seeking to return to the House, one must make the sacrifice in the public interest, face the situation and try to bring about a general election so that the people may register what they feel.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that they feel this Government should be out.  Every day the Government continue to hold on to office they are in fact denying the people's rights in the exercise of the franchise.  The prospect of an election is something I cannot enjoy but this situation, as we see it, must be faced.  Politics largely consists of facing up to a series of unpleasant situations, of which, probably, the worst of all is a general election.  The Government, by holding on as they are doing and propose to do, will continue to lose support because their policies have been proved fallacious. We have the great pretence of these Programmes for Economic Expansion. I claim to have been the first in the House to attack the intrinsic falseness of these things.  These booklets were produced and read by very few Members, something which I can understand because we get so much stuff through our letter boxes that it would be physically impossible to read more than half or, possibly, a quarter of it.  One year I kept all that arrived and weighed it, and it weighed a quarter of a ton.</P>

      <P>I do not know who sends me &ldquo;Farm Research News&rdquo; every week but I recognise the envelope because the keys of the typewriter used have not been cleaned for God knows how long.  This periodical does not get a very close scrutiny.  I went around this House with it under my arm and conducted a little poll of my own among Deputies. And I found one Deputy who claimed, not with very much confidence or assurance, that he had read it a couple of months ago.  This man is a farmer.  I could find nobody else. I was thinking about this particular <Col N="2247" /> Member that he was the type who would imagine that if he did not say something like that, he would lose votes.  He told me he had read it; I do not think he had.</P>
      <P>Apart from that, this is something that might be looked into because there is room for economy there.  A load of stuff is produced and printed and not read.  I often wonder how much money is spent upon unnecessary reports.  I am not advocating that such money should be saved at the expense of employment but I do think that something more interesting might be produced.  If they want us to read, then by all means send us something we can read and keep the printers in employment at the same time.  I am all for something which could be taken up at night, before going to sleep, which would help one to secure some ease, after a troubled day here, from the burden of responsibility which we carry&mdash;the burden of guilt for the country's condition.</P>
      <P>Let me come back to the programmes for economic expansion, moryah, as we say.  When the First Programme for Economic Expansion came, I think I was possibly the only member in the House who was enough of a vulgarian to bring up the subject at all but I was the first to point out that this was all nonsense&mdash;a booklet containing a number of wishful opinions, wrapped up in Civil Service language, with every polysyllabic cliché that could be dug out of the files of the Civil Service.  This whole mass of verbiage had been manufactured deliberately to wrap up simple economic facts in order to baffle and bemuse the electorate.  Here we had this First Programme for Economic Expansion.  I do not believe&mdash;I am certain&mdash;that this document, or the subsequent document, resulted in the production of £1 more worth of goods or in any worker working any bit harder or an hour longer or in any manager or director going five minutes later to his lounge bar in the evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think these so-called economic programmes have had no real effect whatsoever but they gave a <i>raison</i><Col N="2248" /><i>d'étre</i> to every politician at every chapel gate whose mind came to a full stop when he had to reach out and talk about something, for God's sake. He talked about the Second Programme for Economic Expansion and the unfortunate natives, looking at him, said: &ldquo;Would it not have been wonderful if we had gone beyond the 7th standard?  What a pity we did not get the chance.&rdquo;  It is another example of the Fianna Fáil Party still further baffling and bewildering the people.</P>
    <P>I have heard speakers from the main Opposition Party contributing to this nonsense and accepting that there is some validity in it.  Even they have been misled by it.  They have let themselves be led astray by these so-called programmes.  We do not hear much about them now.  Latterly, they have gone out of fashion.  They have gone off what might be called the political best seller lists where the prices are paid in votes.</P>
    <P>What might have happened during the life of the First Programme was due to the careful expertise, planning, foresight, responsibility, energy and what-have-you of the Cabinet.  If one suggested that what we were enjoying at one period of the existence of this Government, which coincided with part of the life of the First Programme, as it was known, was due to European conditions completely outside our control, that we were getting the overspill of European prosperity into England and over to us, such a suggestion would be brushed aside.  But now, of course, we have been in difficulties and as things have not been so good with us, this is due to European conditions; this is not due to the Government but to forces outside the control of the Government.  When things are good, it is one up for the Government but when things are bad, then somebody else is to blame.</P>
    <P>On the 1st of this month, we had a re-enactment, in fact, of the Act of Union.  Was it for this that all that blood was shed?  When Patrick Sarsfield died, and Edward Fitzgerald and Wolfe Tone, was that all nothing but the delirium of the brain?  This so-called Free Trade Area Agreement was a cynical exercise, to say the least of it. <Col N="2249" /> It was a complete reversal of the policy of Griffith, not that I ever thought Griffith's policy would stand up to very close examination in the sense of the complete self-sufficiency of the country. The ordinary people had been led to believe that the independence of the nation was most important and superseded all other considerations&mdash; national independence, &ldquo;break the connection with England&rdquo;, the never failing source of all our evil: I remember that; I am not very old but I remember it right up to relatively recent years.  There are many people in this House who secured election on the basis of that kind of slogan.  &ldquo;Burn everything British except their coal.&rdquo;&ldquo;Partition.&rdquo;  Oh dear.  Deputies will note that the Minister for Agriculture is clapping.  There is the cynicism, you see; he does not care.</P>
    <P>I saw people die for their concern over Partition.  I saw their red blood flowing down the stones of the Curragh of Kildare in my time for their concern over Partition and because they wanted to see what the founder of the Government Party said should be a 32-county sovereign independent indefeasible Republic.  With my own eyes, I saw young men of 20 years of age murdered for that.  I did not read about it: I saw it.  They believed in this with all their heart and with all their mind&mdash; and what was all the fighting about? What was all the fratricidal strife about?  Why did people break friendships, never renewed, and go to their graves carrying hatred in their hearts one for another?  Was it all for this cynical exercise on 1st July of this year?</P>
    <P>It is not all that funny, not to me, anyway, but then I am probably a sentimentalist.  I am not a pragmatist. I am inclined to the view that sentiment is part of the make-up of this whole Celtic nation of ours, and always will be, and I am inclined to the view that this ultra-pragmatism with which we are being dosed is seen by the people now for what it is&mdash;no more than a veiled cynicism.  We cannot make figures in a ledger out of people and we cannot change overnight traditions and emotions which have dominated <Col N="2250" /> people's political thinking for a century and a half, or for the best part of two centuries.  You think you can do it, but you cannot. Admittedly, there is a disgust amongst certain elements, particularly the young people, with the vulgarisation of patriotism which has gone on and to which the Government have contributed in no small degree. Commercialisation: vulgarisation: exploitation of the people, and all that&mdash; there is a disgust with that, a disgust equated with cynicism, but the people are still patriotic and there are people who still feel very deeply about this country.</P>
    <P>In 1964 we had a White Paper produced called &ldquo;Housing: Progress and Prospects&rdquo;.  The housing situation in 1964 was undoubtedly very bad, particularly in Dublin and in my constituency of County Dublin.  This was so because there was a continual drift from the rural areas to Dublin in progress all the time and, instead of slackening in any degree, it seems to be increasing all the time.  The numbers are swelling.  The numbers who are leaving rural Ireland to come and live and work in Dublin are all the time increasing.  This means that the housing problem, the problem of the local authorities in the area, is the greatest in the country, is unique, and is not comparable with that which obtains anywhere else.  Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford have a housing problem of their own, I am sure, but on a considerably smaller scale than that which obtains in Dublin city and county.</P>
    <P>In 1964, after what must be assumed to have been considerable thought and study, and inevitable delay, there was produced by the Minister for Local Government this White Paper called &ldquo;Housing: Progress and Prospects&rdquo;. That was in November, 1964.  It was no more than an examination of the history of housebuilding in the country up to that time.  It also analysed in some degree the problem as it existed then.  So far as a solution to the problem is concerned, there were a couple of paragraphs of a general nature, which did not really represent any advance in the powers of local <Col N="2251" /> authorities beyond those which already existed.</P>
    <P>But there was one thing: there was a great to-do about this White Paper. If I do not make a mistake, it was one of the occasions upon which the Minister for Local Government was seen on television, telling us all about it.  I am not suggesting that he is not photogenic, but I am suggesting that this White Paper can be put on the same library shelf with the other two masterpieces&mdash;the First and Second Programmes for Economic Expansion &mdash;as examples of what might be called &ldquo;stamp auction politics&rdquo;, of how far you can go in the matter of political pretence, or chancing your arm, to use a colloquialism, and still do nothing, of how far you can appear to be in earnest and all the time be laughing up your sleeve.  This was another example of that.  It will have a curiosity or collector's value in time to come, although productions of this kind by the Government are so great and so frequent that in process of time the market is bound to become depressed. The market is flooded.</P>
    <P>Policies! They have policies for everything.  But of action, none.  That is for tomorrow.  Talk for today and action for tomorrow.  Of course, we all know tomorrow never comes.  In this White Paper there is reference to the National Building Agency, the National Building Agency which is engaged upon constructing a monument to itself at Ballymun.  We were told, when it was brought into existence, that it was really going to be the answer to everything.  Not alone was the agency constituted of the best brains the country could produce but it had youth and energy, and the devil knows what else, to enable it to tackle this problem of housing.  The unions were got together, the craft unions.  There might be danger, it was said, with the craft unions.  They were conservative groups and they might cause delay.  Do we not all know that the unions are responsible for everything?  There they are putting one brick on top of another with a trowel when they could be building houses in factories, which was what the National Building Agency was going to do.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2252" /> The unions were brought in and, surprisingly enough, the unions proved very co-operative, naturally enough, because the unions are founded on very co-operative people.  But they have been made the whipping-boys by those who do not like trade unions but who try to conceal the fact because it is not politically popular nowadays to say so. Those days are gone.  But the unions are made whipping-boys in other ways. People blame all our troubles on trade unions.  But, in this instance, we had the unions agreeing to system building, which is, I suppose, a form of prefabrication, and the National Building Agency announced that matters would be set under way, and so did the Minister, for the building of a complete new scheme at Ballymun on the northern outskirts of Dublin near the airport, which would in great degree remedy the housing problem as it affected the residents of this city, people living in dangerous rat-infested tenements, some of which were falling down and killing the little children playing in the streets.  The National Building Agency went to the tapes and, so far, after the passage of two years, they do not seem to have got one inch beyond the tapes.  We have not yet got a single house in Ballymun.</P>
    <P>The situation has been exacerbated by the passage of time.  There are many more people than there were then on the housing list.  Conditions were worsened by the fact that the Corporation in the intervening years, while condemning these old Georgian houses and compelling people to leave them, did not provide alternative accommodation for them if they were single people.  At one stage accommodation was not even being provided for married couples.  If I do not make a mistake, no accommodation was provided for married couples unless they had at least one child.  All of these people were put out of their tenement rooms which, bad and all as they were, at least provided shelter.  They had nowhere to go.  Families were dispossessed in this fashion.  Families coming back from England; families coming up from the country to Dublin, which is the Mecca of the nation and has been for many years, although that is <Col N="2253" /> socially undesirable&mdash;all these families were put into dormitories in Griffith Barracks.</P>
    <P>I do not have to tell mature persons the kind of atmosphere you will find when you have a number of families in a situation like that with no means of ensuring privacy as between one and another.  It is hell let loose.  That is what it is.  If all the other things were idyllic, if the floor were rugs from wall to wall, if they had all the comforts of living but were still forced to live one on top of the other, it is the worst possible thing that could happen.  We know from experience that that is the real problem of the subtenancy of Corporation houses too.</P>
    <P>All this has been occurring since the publication of this pretence at a White Paper.  The Minister for Local Government and the Government have failed utterly to grasp this nettle of housing.  Far from improving the situation, the White Paper and the steps taken by the Government have worsened it, if anything.  In their effort to level Georgian Dublin and to prevent the occupation of the old tenements, Dublin Corporation have knocked down houses which could have been used to house people waiting for Corporation houses for at least another few years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to speak on behalf of all the people in my constituency, indeed, on behalf of the people of Dublin generally, who are waiting for houses.  As I said to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, it is easy to be cynical and to laugh about this if you like.  But I am not laughing about it.  I do not think it is funny.  I had a letter this morning, one of many.  Everybody gets them. I do not claim, as some people here do, to own every applicant for a house: I merely share them.</P>
      <P>I had a letter from a woman whose husband is working in the city.  They have three children.  They live in a caravan near the airport.  There is no hope of their getting a house in Dublin County for years.  Dublin County Council has not built houses out there for years.  Dublin County Council had the opportunity of building houses but did not build them.  Now they are held up by the Department although they have plans.  The prospect of building houses in this area is at least two years away.  What are you going to say to people like that, with three little babies in a single apartment caravan, smothered with the fumes from an oil stove and dreading the winter with nowhere to go?  How can you explain to them that the 1964 White Paper provided this, that and the other, that the county council did not do this, or that the Minister is not doing that, that they are living outside the Corporation area and the Corporation cannot house them in Ballymun, although they are living in Ballymun?  How can you describe the position to an unfortunate woman who is driven half-crazy in those conditions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What are you going to say if you, like me, go amongst these people every Sunday morning of your life, meeting people who are Corporation subtenants? If they come to you and unburden the problems which they have to face as subtenants in Corporation houses, and reveal the agonies <Col N="2256" /> through which they are going in overcrowded houses, living ten in a room &mdash;and tens and 12s and 13s are quite common in hundreds of those fourroomed Corporation houses&mdash;with no hope of being housed this year, what are you going to say to them?  Anybody who has had this experience will agree with me that you come away depressed, depressed with the country and with the fact that this should be allowed to happen with nothing being done about it.</P>
    <P>I am certain in my own soul that in the Department of Local Government there is an attitude of mind which does not care a damn about this Dublin problem.  The Dublin problem from time immemorial, from the time of the foundation of the State, has never had proper consideration in the Department of Local Government.  The Department of Local Government has always been dominated by a rural outlook except for the few short years when it was under the administration of Tim Murphy, God be good to him, who did wonderful work there.  I am not saying that because he was Labour. He was that kind of man and it did not matter what Party he belonged to. He dominated that Department but I have never seen any Minister since who dominated it.  You have that mentality there; yet you have in Dublin almost one-third of the country's population and a multitude of problems, and you have the Department of Local Government, which is charged with housing the people, dominated by a rural concept which holds that the important thing is to make provision for the rural areas.  Even that is not very good so far as Dublin County is concerned.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister for Local Government, or anyone who is interested, to come with me on any Sunday morning to Ballyfermot and to sit with me for one hour in my little hut listening to the people and I dare anybody with any sense of feeling to come back to this House and not be as moved by the situation as I am and by the suffering of people living as subtenants in this area.  I challenge anybody to say that he would not be fired with enthusiasm to do something about it&mdash;like in Ballymun.  The only notable <Col N="2257" /> thing about Ballymun was the collapse of Deputy Burke into a hole.  Indeed, I am very sorry about that because I would not at all wish that anything like that should befall my very esteemed and courteous, not to say gracious, colleague&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Was the Deputy present at the time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately not, because I would have been the first to rush to his side, I assure you.  Indeed, I heard about it so late that I have not had the time to discuss it with him.  I would like to get the details. I will have to consult the witnesses as well.  They say that there are 100 houses out there in Ballyfermot, somewhere in that swamp, but you cannot get into them.  That is what Deputy Dowling said to me: the houses are there but you cannot get into them.  What good is that?</P>
      <P>I am told by officials of the Corporation that even if this year's programme is completed, it will not make any great difference to the housing list. This is absolutely scandalous.  There is no excuse at all for a situation in which so many people are suffering for so long a time.  Ask any of them what confidence they have in the Government. Ask the man whom I met last Sunday, who has three children and who has had to move from his mother's house to his mother-in-law's house, to his brother-in-law's house, back to his mother's house and who is now back in his mother-in-law's house, with his three children, and all in the space of six weeks&mdash;ask him what confidence he has in the Government's administration, or their housing policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Do not imagine that this is unusual. Those members of the Government Party who deal with this&mdash;there are not many, only two or three, and several Labour people&mdash;will know that I am speaking the truth and that it applies to hundreds of cases and indeed to thousands of smaller cases. The National Building Agency has been, as I said on another occasion, a flop.  The country should be given an opportunity of saying what it thinks of this Agency.  No doubt, Sir, <Col N="2258" /> when you saw the returns in the Presidential election for Dublin city and county, you were impressed by the fact that there had been a tremendous reversal in the voting pattern and beyond question, you asked yourself why this was.  I will try to explain why it was.</P>
    <P>I am sure you would not be surprised if I told you that, in fact, it had little or nothing to do with the Presidential election.  This reversal had to do strictly with the policy of the Government.  The opportunity was seized by the people to emphasise their dissatisfaction with what is happening and especially their dissatisfaction with the housing position.  I understand the number on the housing list in Dublin city alone is in the neighbourhood of 8,000 to 10,000.  The number of houses being provided, according to the last count, was 20 or 30 per month. How long will it take to reach families consisting of only three people, that is, a man, his wife and one child?  Let it not be thought that these people are not as much entitled to a house as others with larger families.  The degree of discomfort and personal suffering which is being endured is just as intense for small families as for larger families.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers) Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
      <P>Because of replacement of over-age wagons by new wagons and a change from timber to steel in the construction of wagons, there has been a reduction in wagon repair work at Limerick.  This has resulted in redundancy of 19 employees in the Limerick workshops and the Board estimate that about 30 more employees will become redundant between now and 1970.</P>
      <P>The capital cost of the improvements in the wagon works, which were officially opened by me on 21st June, 1963, was £93,000.  The modernisation and improvement of the workshops was undertaken in the knowledge that the present redundancy would arise in due course.  The Board have assured me that the resulting economies have fully justified the expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The redundancy has been fully discussed by CIE with the trade unions concerned.  Arrangements have now been agreed with the unions for the transfer of some of the redundant staff to alternative employment and on the conditions applicable to staff whose employment will be terminated.  The redundant employees do not qualify for statutory redundancy compensation under the Transport Act, 1964, but an ex-gratia lump sum payment of one week's pay for each year of service up to a maximum of 40 years' service will be paid to redundant regular employees.  They will also be paid the surrender value of their endowment assurance policy under the Board's staff welfare scheme.  Employees who are over 55 years of age and who have a minimum of 20 years' <Col N="2260" /> service with the Board will receive a proportionate pension.  Those not qualifying for a pension will receive a refund of their pension fund contributions.</P>
    <P>I have no knowledge of any guarantee of constant employment having been given to the employees in the Board's workshops at Limerick.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. T. O'Donnell Mr. T. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister say why this change of policy, that is, the utilisation of steel rather than timber in the construction of wagons, was not envisaged three years ago before this costly expenditure of £100,000 was incurred in modernising the workshops?  Surely it was possible to envisage this change three years ago?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The capital expenditure of £93,000 will be fully remunerated, and was related to the improvement of the workshops, whether or not steel or timber wagons were to be used.  It was envisaged that there would have to be a rationalisation of the whole operation of the wagon works.  That was made perfectly evident, and there was a reduction of staff during the period before the capital expenditure was undertaken. A considerable reduction of staff took place as a result of the rationalisation of the methods of operation in the workshops.  There is nothing new in it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave nothing of the kind.  I actually looked at the speech I made at the time, and there is no reference to it whatever.  I was aware of the fact that this was part of a general improvement and rationalisation scheme in relation to the very heavy cost of the whole repair system of CIE, and it related also to the rationalisation of the number of wagons in use.  The number of wagons in use when the 1958 Act was passed, was far in excess of what was required. Therefore, it would have been quite absurd for me to make a promise of that kind.  I was also aware of the fact that the Committee on Internal Transport, the Dr. Beddy Committee, pointed out that the utilisation of <Col N="2261" /> wagons and coaches per 1,000 ton miles or per 1,000 passenger miles was grossly in excess of what should be considered the norm for the operations of CIE.  There was bound to be a rationalisation of the whole system.</P>

      <P>The contract was placed by the Dublin Port and Docks Board in 1951.  I am informed by the Board that the original contract price was £892,641, that the final cost was £1,464,565 and that the increase was mainly attributable to</P>
      <P>(a) Exceptional foundation difficulties encountered by the contractors which could not have been foreseen, and</P>
      <P>(b) Rising building costs for which the contract had provided.</P>
      <P>The original contract period was 143 working weeks, commencing in April, 1951, but due mainly to the foundation difficulties referred to, the dock was not completed until the summer of 1957.</P>

      <P>Under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, the Corporation have power to include in their development plan objectives for the preservation of buildings of artistic, architectural or historical interest.  In the period prior to the making of the plan, they can declare by resolution that the preservation of such buildings is an objective which they propose to include in their plan and if such a resolution is passed such buildings may not be demolished or altered without their permission.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that the Committee of the North Infirmary have been seeking accommodation to build a home for sisters and probationer nurses adjacent to the hospital for over 30 years and, in spite of the fact that protests have been made to prevent them acquiring the site of Skiddy's Home, no interested persons have forwarded any suggestion as to where they may find an alternative site?  Furthermore, is the Minister aware that the North Infirmary are not yet in possession of the lease of these premises, that the sum required is £2,000 and that nobody seems sufficiently interested to raise that amount of money to preserve this Home as an amenity for the city of Cork and that <Col N="2272" /> expert opinion has been given that the state of the building makes it impossible to preserve it for more than a couple of years as it is toppling from old age?</P>

      <P>There are residence conditions for the receipt of British family allowances which vary as between British subjects born in the United Kingdom, British subjects born abroad and aliens.  As a concession, persons born in this country are treated in the same way as British subjects born in the United Kingdom for the purpose of qualifying for family allowances, and this means that in common with such persons they must have not less than 26 weeks residence in Great Britain during the twelve months preceding the date of claim.  The condition may be satisfied by either parent, but no such condition applies to the children provided the claim is being made by a parent. There is no lapse in payment of allowances where the father has preceded his family by six months or more and I understand that this is generally the case.  In the circumstances, there would appear to be no strong case for taking action on the lines suggested by the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will appreciate that serious hardship can be caused to families where the husband, wife and children all go <Col N="2280" /> together, particularly where there may be a period of unemployment after arriving in Great Britain.  Even though the number of cases may be small, would the Minister not have negotiations with the British authorities to see if a scheme could be devised to cover them?  It certainly would not break the Exchequer in either country but it would be of great assistance to people who most need assistance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears to me that if their own rule is that you must have 26 weeks residence before you qualify no strong case could be made for our people getting any better concession than the British population have got for themselves.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <P>Disability, marriage and maternity benefit are paid by cheque sent by post to the claimant's home or delivered to him there or at the local agency of the Department or dispensary or other agreed place. Widows', orphans', old age and blind pensions are paid by means of pension orders encashable at the post office nominated by the pensioner. Unemployment benefit and assistance are paid in cash at the local office of the Department to those residing within six miles; otherwise, payment <Col N="2281" /> is made by order encashable at a post office designated by the claimant; certain islanders are paid by postal order. Children's allowances are paid by means of orders encashable at post offices or credited to a bank account.</P>
      <P>Attendance of the recipient for payment of disability, marriage or maternity benefit is not obligatory.  For any of the other payments his attendance at the place of payment is ordinarily required but it may be dispensed with for good cause such as illness.</P>

If he does not wish to avail of these free spectacles he may choose a type with a better class of frame which is supplied at a fixed price or he may choose a more expensive type of frame the price of which is not controlled; in either case the Department contributes 23/6 towards the cost.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of any long delays at present which could be attributed to the Land Commission. In the case of lands purchased for cash, the purchase money or outstanding balance is paid over on possession of the lands being given to the Land Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When replying to the debate on the Estimate for my Department last May, I dealt with the matter of streamlining procedures generally in the Land Commission with special reference to the procedure for examination of title and allocation of purchase moneys of lands acquired for land bonds: columns 2223-6 of the Official Report dated 25th May, 1966, are relevant.  In outlining the various measures taken in recent times to cut out delays in this sector, I mentioned particularly the Land Purchase Acts Rules, 1964, which have considerably simplified the procedure in relation to title clearance, and sections 15 and 16 of the Land Act, 1965, which provide additional machinery for expediting the allocation of purchase moneys by the delegation of decision functions to Examiners of the Land Commission <Col N="2287" /> and by the authorisation to accept a shorter root of title.  I am satisfied that the measures taken, coupled with the strengthening of the staff of the Examiners Branch, have led to a marked improvement in this matter, and I am confident that this improvement will be maintained provided the full co-operation of all parties concerned is forthcoming.  Again, I am happy to repeat what I said in my reply to the Estimate debate, that the <i>Irish Law Times</i>, which is the official organ of the legal profession, appreciates the various measures taken to cut out delays and to facilitate the more expeditions closing of sales.</P>

      <P>A Prices Advisory Committee investigated potato prices, excluding prices paid to farmers which are outside the scope of the Prices Acts, towards the end of last year. They found that there was ample competition at all levels.  They concluded that the prices charged for potatoes were fair and reasonable and that the methods of marketing potatoes did not contribute unnecessarily to the cost to the consumer.  I accepted the Committee's findings.</P>
      <P>I do not contemplate action on the lines mentioned by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 46 and 47 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the Irish Congress of Trade Unions was informed as stated by the Deputy.  Although the Trade Union Bill, 1966, and the Industrial Relations Bill, 1966, were introduced recently the texts will not be available for some time yet.  As it is intended to take these two Bills and the Bill to which the Deputy refers at the same time, it was decided to withhold the text of the third Bill until the texts of the other two Bills are available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister must be aware that one of the Bills which has already been introduced is in direct contradiction of one of the sections in the other Bill, which has not been introduced; in view of the fact that a definite guarantee was given by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Dr. Hillery, in writing that the three Bills would be introduced together, would the Minister not try to have this Bill introduced as soon as possible?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister is aware that the reason it has not been introduced is that the Government are attempting to get through the House a Bill which contains a section in direct contradiction of what they themselves said they were going to put into the amending Trade Union Bill, and would he have a look at that aspect of it?  I have a copy of both and I know what I am talking about; the Fitzpatrick judgment was to be repealed and it is not, in fact, repealed. That is a breach of the guarantee given <Col N="2295" /> by the Minister.  It is a disgraceful act on the part of the Government.</P>

      <P>I am at all times prepared to send a representative of my Department to consult with parents on problems related to the amalgamation of schools or the building of central schools.</P>
      <P>In regard to the particular case referred to by the Deputy, the position is that there are 33 pupils on the roll of Clooneenmore national school and that within two miles of it at Rathlee there is a four-roomed school with at present a staff of only three teachers. There can be no doubt but that the educational interests of the children from the Clooneenmore area would best be served by having them provided for in the school at Rathlee to which they would be taken by transport provided at State expense.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not consider that such a step is required.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that many schools have in fact been unable to borrow through private channels and that, even apart from the current credit restrictions, many institutions have difficulty in obtaining the necessary financial accommodation? Would the Minister not consider the establishment of a State fund for educational capital purposes like the Local Loans Fund which would help these institutions to go ahead with urgently needed building requirements?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>No, As I said, I do not think this is necessary.  Some of the schools have been successful, even in the circumstances of credit restrictions. As I have said, with the easing of credit generally, I think the normal borrowing arrangements will be adequate to meet the situation.</P>

Some of them have actually done the work, while others have not as yet.  There is no indication whatever that because the money has not yet been paid out, people are not availing of the loans.

      <P>The question of the date on which building work commenced is one for the manager of the particular school. My Department does not require to be advised in the matter.</P>
      <P>I am not aware of any case in which a school authority has obtained a temporary loan to meet the cost of building.  Should an application for assistance in connection with such a loan be received by my Department, it will be sympathetically considered.</P>

      <P>Discussion on the housing problem, which has been grossly neglected by the Government, brings one inevitably to the question of the rents being charged for local authority houses.  I was dismayed, and the tenants of Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council houses were appalled, at the recent announcement about the possibility of exorbitant increases in rents for the houses in which they reside.  This has been counselled by the Minister for Local Government to the managers in Dublin and throughout the country, and indeed has been put into effect in respect of persons transferring from one house to another in Dublin Corporation administrative area.  We have in Dublin city and county a new manager and I look forward to many years of very efficient administration by him.  However, the beginning he has made has been somewhat inauspicious and no little public commotion has been occasioned by the announcement of his intention to review rents upwards, on the instruction of the Minister for Local Government.  Tenants and those desperately seeking houses from Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council have been distressed to learn that in some cases these rents may reach £6 a week.  Imagine such a figure being charged for a local authority house anywhere, especially when one considers the kind of tenancy agreement which has to be entered into by those who take up the occupancy of corporation and county council houses.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister certainly has a responsibility and I assume the Cabinet has a collective responsibility.  The Party who now <Col N="2309" /> constitutes the Government made a big thing about the collective responsibility of the Cabinet.  The new maximum figure mentioned for these rents is £6 a week.  As a background to that, you have the corporation tenant who is uniquely divested of his rights in so far as tenancy is concerned. A tenant of Dublin Corporation, and perhaps of the county council, can be put out of his house, according to his tenancy agreement, and can be evicted, without the corporation having to give any reason whatever.  All that the corporation need do to recover possession from any tenant in any corporation scheme is to go to court and ask for it and the court under the law must order the tenant's eviction.  Therefore the corporation tenant is a person without rights in so far as tenancies generally are concerned. Yet the Government propose that the already high rents of these houses, which are around £2 a week, inclusive of rates, shall be substantially increased.  This proposal by the Minister for Local Government will be resisted by the tenants with all the power at their disposal.  I want to impress, so far as it is possible at this remove, upon the City Manager, that he is hastening towards a disastrous position&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>Far from it, indeed, although a certain dexterity in shifting is essential in this House.  I want to say to the Government that they are advancing towards a disastrous position from every point of view.  The tenants will resist this.  Already throughout the suburban and city housing schemes they have been <Col N="2310" /> showing signs of concern and worry about this matter and they have come together in large numbers legally to express their objections to any such move.  Indeed, if an attempt is made to put this into effect the social consequences could be calamitous because the increase of rents on such a wide scale&mdash;Dublin Corporation housing estates consist of almost 20,000 houses &mdash;must inevitably lead to inflationary effects because inevitably the workers who occupy these houses must seek further wage increases.  Any step the Government deliberately take which results in giving an impetus to this move is socially wrong and harmful to the whole economic fabric.</P>
      <P>If ever we are to reach economic stability and if the new Minister for Labour, Deputy Dr. Hillery, is to have any success in the very arduous task of discovering a <i>via media</i> between the two warring sects with which he will have to contend, the Government will have a duty at least to prevent any of their Ministers from encouraging activity by the local authority which must inevitably lead to further demands for wage increases, because that is the logical and inevitable result of any move to increase rents.  The Labour Party stands solidly against this from the point of view of its gravity and in so far as it represents an added imposition upon an already hard-pressed working population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As an instance of that, recently I circulated in this House a sample budget of a Dublin workingclass family which anybody could see erred on the side of conservatism, in which it was proved that this family would have just the bare necessaries upon which to exist, taking the average wage of a Dublin worker at £12 per week, plus children's allowances in respect of three children.  Averaging the whole thing out, one discovers from this document which I circulated that, even living at the level of self-denial of the most rigorous kind, such a worker must inevitably find himself in debt. That budget did not provide for any luxuries such as the pint, which many do not regard as a luxury and which, certainly, I do not regard as a luxury for the working man.  It excluded that, <Col N="2311" /> and it also excluded washing machines, which are very often thrust upon workingclass households by highpressure salesmen, and various things of that nature.  It showed clearly that the average worker in this city and county, living on a very tight budget, is unable to meet his financial responsibilities.</P>
    <P>In that situation, we have Dublin Corporation, at the instance of the Minister for Local Government, saying they are going to increase house rents from £2 to £6.  This would be criminal and it must be stopped.  This is one of the reasons why we have put down this motion of no confidence in the Government. I am sure this is news to some members of the Government, although this circular was issued by the Department several months ago. I am willing to bet quite a number of members of the Government are not aware of what has happened.  Of course that is only symptomatic of the lassitude for which this Government have become notorious in the past few years.</P>
    <P>Similarly, the slipshod methods of determining what our housing needs are call for condemnation.  In 1964 when the White Paper on housing was produced, Dublin Corporation had over 10,000 applications from families needing houses.  However, by some process of analysis known to and understood only by officialdom, it was determined that the effective housing list was something like half that number. It does not matter that there were 10,000 families in need of housing. The effective housing list, which meant the number of families living in completely intolerable conditions, was about half that number.  It is this conservative approach to housing which has been present in the very stones of the Custom House over the past several years which has us as we are today, certainly in Dublin city and county and, I would say, in the rest of the country as well.</P>
    <P>Today there is utter frustration in regard to housing.  For the young man and woman or for any family seeking a house, the outlook is hopeless, and I am continually being told by them: <Col N="2312" />&ldquo;We will be left with no alternative but to clear out and go to England.&rdquo; When I say to them, as I have done on hundreds of occasions, that they will have the same problem about housing there, they will say: &ldquo;My brother or sister is over there and they do not have to wait as long for a council house in England as we have to wait here.  We do not want to leave Ireland.  We do not like the prospect of raising our children in England because of the obvious dangers, but there are obvious advantages, too.  We can get education for our children at a far more reasonable price than we can get it here.  In some cases it is free education, which we have not got here.  We can get free medical service at all levels, whereas here there is a means test so far as medical service are concerned.&rdquo;  No matter how one discourages them, they have these things in mind, and it is hard to blame them.</P>
    <P>It is impossible to refrain from the strongest condemnation of the Government who permit this situation to drift in the manner in which it is drifting. If there were no other counts&mdash;and goodness knows, there are many other counts&mdash;on which to convict the Government for neglect, this one would suffice, and it should be sufficient to run any body of men with any decency out of office.  It is very easy to permit one-self to be lulled into a sense of euphoric &ldquo;all is well with the world&rdquo; in this House, and indeed in the corridors where exist delusions of power.  But in the houses of the people it is a different matter, where they come face to face daily with the harsh realities of life and how to make the £1 stretch to cover what it takes 25/- to buy.</P>
    <P>We have had many examples, in this year particularly, of the Government dancing out of reach of local authorities who want money for houses. Schemes have been put up by county councils and by corporations which require money from central funds to enable the local authorities to build, and Question Time here for all of this year has unfailingly shown cases where local authorities of one kind or another have been put on the long finger by the Government and have not been <Col N="2313" /> able to build because the money has not been forthcoming.  This has not been actually stated by the Government but everybody knows that the Government have so maladministered the affairs of the country that the Exchequer is practically on its knees. There is nothing in it.</P>
    <P>I recall the references of my learned and esteemed colleague, Deputy Burke, to the last inter-Party Government and even yet one seldom hears him deliver his homily outside any parish church but he will produce the bag of cement which, he says, was all that was there when Fianna Fáil came back to office in 1957.  That bag of cement has stood him in good stead and it seems to be still as good as ever.  There is not even a bag of cement now.  There is absolutely no money for essential services of this kind.  How has this happened?</P>
    <P>It can have happened only because of the lack of capacity of those in charge to plan properly and to foresee income and expenditure.  There is no other way of looking at it.  It is like people running a business.  If they do not run it properly, they will run it into the ground and they will end up by talking to Mr. Justice Budd. Unfortunately, there is no justice before whom this administration can be brought to account for their stewardship.  The only justices in this case are the people and wild horses would not drag this Government before the people just now.</P>
    <P>This is resulting in the development of a completely cynical view of policies among the electorate, something which is fundamentally bad.  People are coming to the conclusion that political Parties are composed of groups of adventurers who get into power by promising anything that comes into their heads, by slick advertisements in the Madison Avenue style, and once they are in power, that is all that matters.  It does not matter what they do as long as they stay in power and the end of political activity and promise is to secure a seat in Dáil Éireann. This is bad, because one is aware that there are earnest and sincere men in all Parties in this House, just as there <Col N="2314" /> are the opposite.  Certainly the present Government have not given evidence sufficient to convince the people that they were in earnest in the things they promised and in the things they said.</P>
    <P>I want to leave the question of funds for housing with this remark, that the position of the Government in this matter underlines what I have been saying with regard to deceit and concealment.  There has been no open expression by the Government of the fact that the money is not there.  They have been telling the people that everything will be all right in the sweet bye-and-bye.  Recently the Minister for Finance made a speech in which he said that things would improve.  Let us hope there will be an improvement in spite of the Government's ineptitude and that there will be a de-restriction of bank credit.  This is a fundamental question with the Labour Party.  We believe that the banks, because of their all embracing activities&mdash;they control every aspect of the nation's economic life&mdash;should be controlled by the Government for the people and by the people.</P>

      <P>The act of playing to the gallery is not paying off.  Those that loveth the danger perish therein and the Minister should watch that. It is something that he should take to heart.  I am not concerned about the number of people in the Gallery which is apparently all that concerns the Minister.  I do not consider myself to be a performer in that sense as the Minister apparently considers himself to be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned with the position of <Col N="2315" /> the banks in relation to the community. The position at the moment is that the banks are closed and we have no sign that the Government have exercised themselves unduly to secure a settlement of a dispute which is causing such dislocation in the commercial life of the country.  It is as if the Government did not care about the bank strike and are letting it run on to come to whatever conclusion it may. The Labour Party believe that, not alone in this matter of the bank strike, but in the matter of bank policy generally, in the matter of the Central Bank, the Government should be vitally concerned because credit governs housing and every other activity in which we engage.</P>
    <P>There has been restriction of credit in the past couple of years, a deflationary measure, through the influence of Government statements, made more often than not at luncheons or banquets and seldom made in the House.  Restriction of credit, influenced by such Government statements, has driven many worthy men to the wall and out of business and has driven many employees out of the country.  In this connection, also, the Government merit the proposition in our motion of no confidence.</P>
    <P>There is another matter which also falls to be dealt with by the Minister for Local Government.  I refer to the absolute inactivity on his part, on the part of his Government and on the part of local authorities, whom he is anxious enough to influence, apparently, in order to get higher rents, in relation to the provision of such amenities as adequate playing fields in places such as Ballyfermot, recreation or assembly halls in built-up areas and swimming pools.  These matters may seem not to be very important but take the great Dublin suburb of Ballyfermot with a population of 40,000, which is nearly twice the population of Waterford, as has been mentioned; that area has not got a hall in which people can meet; it has not got a swimming pool. There are playing fields for Gaelic enthusiasts but not for those who may play other games.  The Minister and the Government are just as responsible <Col N="2316" /> as Dublin Corporation, of which Deputy Moore is a member, for the inactivity which has characterised Dublin Corporation and whatever committees of the corporation deal with matters of this kind.</P>

      <P>As a member of the John Fitzgerald Kennedy Memorial Committee, I want to ask what the Government are doing about the erection of the John F. Kennedy Hall.  This Committee was constituted some years ago by Dáil Éireann, unanimously.  Its members are drawn from all Parties.  A great deal of work has been done of a preparatory nature.  There is no question that we have an obligation to honour our great compatriot, as I think we are entitled to call him, because of his race.  Because of his tremendous stature in the world, he has made us proud.  We undertook to commemorate him in what we considered to be the most fitting way, namely, by erecting a hall dedicated to music which could also be used for purposes of assembly.  Such a hall is very badly needed in this city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The site was chosen; plans were prepared; members of the Committee went to considerable trouble to acquaint themselves with what was desirable in the way of amenities to be associated with the hall.  At the moment, we are not at all clear as to <Col N="2317" /> what the Government's real intentions are in this matter.  The people are entitled to know what will be done in this connection.  The building of the hall will take a considerable time.  In a major city such as ours, it is a sad commentary on our lack of artistic appreciation that we have not had long before now a hall suitable for the enjoyment of music.  One is tempted to include this as just one more item which induces an absolute lack of confidence in this Government and in the manner in which they have been behaving.</P>
    <P>The administration of justice requires a completely new approach. It requires the urgent attention of the Government.  Recently, I put down a Parliamentary Question asking for the views of the Minister for Justice in relation to the manner in which district justices through the country were ignoring public opinion and the public good in their punishment, or, to put it properly, lack of punishment, of persons charged and convicted of offences against the person, gang assaults and assaults of that nature. Happily, we have not as a country more than our share of this type of crime.  Examination has shown that possibly there is a lesser incidence of this kind of thing in this country than in most other countries but such as there is of it and such as falls to be dealt with by the courts is not dealt with as it should be.  It would appear that there is a laxity at certain levels of the Judiciary in the administration of the law.</P>

Are we not encompassed round and trammelled sufficiently by rules, orders and regulations without being obstructed in expressing on behalf of the people&mdash; not our own opinions&mdash;the people's opinion as to the lax administration of laws by the district justices?  It seems very wrong when it is quite possible for anybody who does not want to reveal his identity to write to the newspapers anonymously and discuss this very matter while we, who were elected by the people to come here, are not permitted to discuss it in the way we would wish. One would almost want to be a constitutional lawyer to know when he can, with full authority and in accordance with Standing Orders, legitimately raise a matter here.  This is very unfortunate because the primary function of Parliament is to enable those appointed to come here to air the grievances of the people.

      <P>That is something I was about to come to, the question of the amount of money and the manner of its disbursement.  It may very well be that district justices are not paid enough but this should not show itself in the facts to which I have referred. Perhaps district justices are paid too much; I do not know, but I would certainly think, as I have said, that we are being gagged by regulations progressively in this House as the years go by.  This is a matter on which I feel very strongly.  I may get the answer that if you feel that way, put down a motion.  You put down a motion but when does it come up for discussion? When everybody has forgotten about the original cause of contention.  You may not even be here.  You may have been taken from your place by an irate electorate or by Providence.  To put down a motion is no answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I always understood that this Adjournment Debate was the time when one could really travel the whole scene of national activity and express one's views thereon on behalf of one's constituents.  It was in that sense I was approaching what I regarded as a very important matter, the activities of district justices regarding the implementation of the law as it relates to persons guilty of offences against other individuals, assaults and gangs and so on.  The public are amazed on opening their evening newspapers at what is permitted to pass as if it were a light misdemeanour, when, in fact, serious violations of the law are tolerated by <Col N="2320" /> district justices who do not see it as their duty even to support the Garda who have a difficult job to do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall move to another Department.  I am glad the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs is here because I wish him to be present to hear what I have to say.  I think his Department is completely and utterly unnecessary.  A worthy man himself, I should like to hear the justification some time for the expenditure of money on this Department. It is one of the Departments which could very well be run by a civil servant.  It is true it is a money-making Department but that is not the final test of whether or not it should warrant a Cabinet portfolio. I do not think it should.  This dates from the days when the State was being founded and the Provisional Government and the early Free State Government were being formed. Somebody thought that since they had a Postmaster General in England, we should have a Minister for Posts and Telegraphs here.  That is how it happened.</P>
      <P>A man of the Minister's talents is wasted in the GPO, in my view.  He should be in some other Department where he could use his energies to greater effect.  In this I am expanding the view expressed yesterday by the Leader of the Labour Party who said there were some Ministers who had less to do than Deputies, and that is a fact.  I know Deputies&mdash;I am not including myself, although I have enough to do, but ten or 12 hours daily gets me through it every day&mdash; from rural areas of different Parties who are producing letters and documentation that would frighten the most confirmed bureaucrat.  On one occasion one of them remarked to me that he had left his letters on the table of the room for a few minutes and he would have to go back and turn them over in case they would heat.</P>

      <P>That is the position. What I have said has been said without any intention of being personal to Deputy Brennan.  If he seeks to respond to it, he can do so in any way he wishes.</P>
      <P>I am not satisfied that our pretensions in the matter of external affairs would bear close examination.  Our Minister for External Affairs is seldom or ever here and one is quite likely, on inquiring about his whereabouts, to learn that he is lecturing Russia and the United States in the UNO.  If they take much notice of our Minister, they must be very impressionable. This pretence of being a mighty nation of international importance has little relevance to how my constituents in County Dublin are going to get a living or a better living in their own country.  Much, if not all, of the activities of the Minister for External Affairs in UNO and elsewhere are completely over the heads of the ordinary people.  Even those of the people who take an interest in it see little or no point in this continual rushing to and from Washington, as if the great powers were waiting there breathlessly for what we have to say about their problems.  A sense of proportion is called for.  We are as important as any nation in the world, of course, but let us not develop delusions of grandeur because that seems to be the direction in which this Government are going.  It is all part and symptomatic of Government ineptitude in so far as these policies are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder if I am in order in referring to speed limits?  This is a matter which affects the Department of Justice.  The Minister for Justice is a member of the Government.  I am relating all these matters to the Government in this way because of the principle of Cabinet responsibility. Speed limits may be thought a matter of minor importance but let me tell the House&mdash;admittedly, an attenuated House&mdash;that they are a matter of great importance.  Motor cars are to be found all over the place: the roads are thick with them.  Speed limits become <Col N="2322" /> very important to people living in villages and towns.  I challenge anybody to go out in my constituency of County Dublin on a summer Sunday and cross the main Dublin-Drogheda road at, say, 3 o'clock in the afternoon. Either he will wait for hours or he will have to go to a pedestrian crossing in Swords.</P>
    <P>There are people living in labourers' cottages outside Swords and little children are running around playing and cars are going by there.  I am talking now of Feltrim which is on the seaboard side of Swords as you approach Swords from the city. Motors are flashing by there as if it were Le Mans&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>That is closed.  So bad is the situation there that many people have made representations about it to the Minister for Local Government.  This comes under the Department of Local Government and the Minister for Justice comes into it in so far as the Garda have a function in determining where and when speed limits are established.  The need for speed limits there and at Blanchardstown and, indeed, all around the county area has been brought to the attention of the Minister.  All Deputies, I am sure, who drive cars around the city will have an appreciation of what this problem is like and the danger that the public are in continually through this tremendous urge for speed, this hurry to the cemetery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I asked the Minister for Local Government to introduce speed limits.  At various times he told us that speed limits will be reviewed as part of a general review.  Speed limits have been instituted in one or two cases but, in the majority of cases where applications were made for speed limits, decisions have not yet been taken, although in some cases, as in the case of Feltrim, the request was made a very long time ago.  The situation there is so bad that the people along the road put up their own speed limit signs.  They were compelled to remove them when it was pointed out by the authorities that, should any accident occur as a result of these signs being <Col N="2323" /> there, it could have serious consequences for the people.</P>
    <P>We learned to our amazement that, before a speed limit can be instituted, a decision must be taken by three people&mdash;three civil servants, I assume &mdash;and that nowhere in Ireland can a speed limit be instituted without examination and sanction by these three people.  We may look forward for the rest of our lifetime, if the administrative situation is not changed by the Government, to a gradual examination of every road and by-road in Ireland to see if a speed limit is necessary.  We shall be dead and gone, and those who come after us will be dead and gone, before that work is finished&mdash;three people to do that tremendous job.  This shows the Government's complete unconcern in dealing with the problem of traffic which is one of the major problems of our time.</P>
    <P>I happened to be in three large cities in one day&mdash;Strasbourg, Paris and London&mdash;and in each case I observed the same thing happening as happens in Dublin, that is, a policeman going around taking the numbers of cars parked illegally in the centre of the city.  The problem of traffic is worldwide. It is no small local matter&mdash; and speed limits come into it.  One can say with justice, I think, that we can judge the Government's efficiency or otherwise by their ability to deal with what should be dealt with and what could be dealt with in a very simple way.  The way in which this administration deals with this problem is to appoint three people to look after the whole country.  That is scandalous.</P>
    <P>As we are on the subject of traffic, let me say a word about bus fares. I do not know how many times I have put down questions to the Minister for Transport and power concerning the administration of CIE. There have been occasions when I was compelled, deliberately, to break the rules of order which is something I am loth to do as I have too much respect for this House to enjoy that kind of activity.  I have been compelled, on occasion, in other years to ignore the rules of order so as to draw attention to this relinquishing of <Col N="2324" /> responsibility by the Minister for Transport and Power&mdash;the Minister for Transport and Power without responsibility.  On those occasions, I was trying in particular to raise the question of bus fares.</P>
    <P>I do not consider that when bus fares are increased it is simply a matter of administration by CIE: they are a positive contribution to the cost of living.  They are a positive influence on an increase in the cost of living and must, therefore, be put in their proper context as part of general Government policy.  It should be possible and it must be possible for us to discuss this question of bus fares in that context of general Government policy.  We have no confidence in this Government because of the manner in which they have handled the question of increases in bus fares.  It is to be thought that the Dublin working people constitute a bottomless well so far as revenue for CIE is concerned and that, for all time, it will be possible&mdash;whenever difficulties arise regarding expenditure in CIE&mdash;to put up the bus fares again?</P>
    <P>Very soon bus stops in this city will be separated by a matter of a few yards.  They will be not very much nearer than at the present time.  All these devices designed to extract money from the pockets of the Dublin workers have been pursued relentlessly by CIE, not alone with the consent of the Minister and the Government but with a policy of absolute silence on the part of the Government and the Ministers.  We have had the Minister for Transport and Power, sitting like a pouting diva, refusing to say anything about CIE, refusing to discuss what he calls the administration of CIE, making of CIE a kind of sacred cow.</P>
    <P>We believe this policy has been totally wrong and that is one of the reasons which prompted us to put down this motion of no confidence.  I am glad the Minister for Transport and Power is here because I think CIE is the outstanding example of Government incompetence.  It was handed over to a public servant.  I understand that at the time it was handed over, it had liabilities to the <Col N="2325" /> tune of £1 million and the instructions were, and the news was, that CIE was going to be made an economic proposition.  God knows, the axe was applied relentlessly.  Branch lines were chopped right, left and centre: so were the workers.  If they were not absolutely essential they were got rid of, some of them with pensions of 21/- a week after up to 40 years service.</P>
    <P>At the end of it all, after his association with CIE, the Chairman will leave the organisation more in debt than he found it.  His reward is not the reward of the operatives on the shop floor or of the men who did the real work over the years, some of them employees of the old railways. His reward is the munificent sum of over £8,000, a pension of £65 a week, and a spare-time job at £1,000 a year.</P>
    <P>If the Minister for Transport and Power had been here this morning, he would have heard me giving details of the case of a servant of the State with 30 years service who, when he came to 65, was booted out and, of that 30 years, he got 15 years service counted for pension purposes&mdash;15, half the actual number of years served.  He got a lump sum of £160 at 65, after 30 years service, and a pension of 26/-a week.  This was a few months ago. He got his golden handshake too; he got a gold medal because he was one of the handful who were in the GPO. A gold medal.</P>
    <P>These occurrences, these comparisons I make, show the complete lack of proportion on the part of this Government in the circumstances of today, a complete disregard of the hardships of the people.  We have this flaunting of wealth&mdash;it is no more than that&mdash;in front of the people, this arrogant flaunting which says, in effect; &ldquo;We do not care about you.  We are going to do this, and it is immaterial what you say&rdquo;.  Although the entire population is disgusted with the performance, it makes no difference to the Minister for Transport and Power; he seeks to defend him.</P>
    <P>There are many other matters to which I could refer but I hesitate to occupy the time of the House for an <Col N="2326" /> unduly long period.  I would like to have an opportunity at some time to do justice to the complaints, which are many and varied, of my constituents concerning the malfeasance of this group in temporary occupation of Government Buildings.  I will draw my remarks for the nonce for this session to a close by saying that we ask the support of every well-intentioned Deputy for the Labour Party motion of no confidence before the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are discussing with the motion a motion in the name of Deputy Cosgrave that Dáil Éireann has no confidence in the present Government.  One would have expected, after the result of the Presidential election, and in the light of the extremely difficult circumstances in which the country finds itself, that we would have had here today a Cabinet prepared to defend their term of office against the best and the worst that can be charged against them by those who put down this motion of no confidence and those who put down a similar motion in the name of the Labour Party.  No speaker on the Government side has entered the debate, except the Taoiseach, and his contribution was weak in the extreme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why is this?  Is it bred from the belief that they cannot reply and their best hope is that there will be a natural improvement in the economy, which could not be worse than it is, and getting certain people home for the summer and away from this House so that the opportunity will be there for Minister to make statements but no similar opportunity for the Opposition to find as much publicity for their replies?  Or is it the well-known Fianna Fáil arrogance that seems to break out every time the Party are seven or eight consecutive years in power? I do not know which it is.  Perhaps it is a combination of both, but I would suggest that, whichever it is, then it shows evidence of a beaten Government and a Government who have failed to achieve the objectives the people expected them to achieve. I refrain deliberately from saying the objectives they set out before the people, because, apart from their publication of the Second Programme for Economic Expansion, which is <Col N="2327" /> nothing more than a set of targets it was hoped would be achieved, we have had nothing but slogans in two elections.  Their policy was put before the people almost in terms of seeking a blank cheque from the people.</P>
    <P>Let us cast our minds back to 1961 when the entire policy of the Fianna Fáil Party at that time in the election, in which they were successful, was &ldquo;Wives, put your husbands back to work&rdquo; and &ldquo;Let's get cracking&rdquo;. In 1965, without any attempt on their part to tell the people what they wanted to do, we had the one slogan: &ldquo;Let Lemass lead on&rdquo;&mdash;everything was all right in the country.  Housing was being carried on.  There was plenty of money for saving.  We had the timing of the wage increase.  We had this before the election.  After the election we had the difficulties.  We had the restriction of credit.  We had all the unfortunate consequences visited on the people.</P>
    <P>It is wise to refer, I think, first of all to one of the most serious defects of the present Government, that is, in respect of housing.  The inter-Party Government of 1954-57 were blamed by Fianna Fáil because they built too many houses.  There was a credit squeeze in 1957 resulting from the Suez crisis and the Korean War.  The way to cure that was quite simple. The biggest single expense of Government that can be halted is housing. There is no difficulty at all about seeing to it that the building of houses stops.  All we have to do is to see to it that planning and sanction for sites is delayed and that the Department of Local Government act as a stopping block in regard to the building of houses.  This was not done.  The inter-Party Government in 1957, before the present Government assumed office, built twice as many houses in that year as Fianna Fáil built in any year since.  Arriving at a situation in which their arrogance led them to believe there was no need for priorities, Fianna Fáil loosened up a little and up to the time of the credit squeeze 12 months ago, were in the process of increasing house building. They have now stopped it completely.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2328" /> From a detailed examination of different local authorities, both in my own county and bordering it, and having listened to the reports of my colleagues in Dublin city, the situation is quite clear.  The large housing schemes now being completed will see the end of local authority building for as long as 12 to 24 months.  If the Minister for Finance saw fit last Saturday night to suggest that the credit squeeze was eased and that things would become easier in the private sector and the Government sector of the economy, that was because the harsh remedy had been applied.  People living in one room with five or six children and those living in Griffith Barracks because they cannot get even one room have no hope of a house in the next 24 months from this Government of failure.</P>
    <P>Remember that we also had a situation in which I was told by the Government there was plenty of money for swimming pools, in which I was interested, and a situation in which industrial grants were given to all and sundry.  For instance, they were given to a project which was to employ 1,700 people making executive aircraft in a factory on the Naas Road. We have £1,319,000 invested in that by way of grants, not by loans.  Instead of employing 1,700 people, the number is nearer to 17.  Remember that the Civil Service has been expanded.  There was no effort on the part of the Government to introduce new methods and techniques into the Civil Service and to ensure that more work and more efficiency are got from each person in a Government office.  That has never been mentioned since 1957.</P>
    <P>Of course, all this means bad housekeeping.  When you have bad housekeeping, particularly bad housekeeping on the capital side of the Budget, it is not very long until it overflows into the current side of the Budget.  Then you have to increase taxation to such an extent as to make it unbearable for the community, particularly the poor.  That is what has happened under this Government.  In 1963 we had the turnover tax.  Let <Col N="2329" /> us examine a few facets of that in the light of what has occurred since. Remember the then Minister for Finance said it was physically impossible to have a selective wholesale tax.  He said he did not care on what you put the tax so long as you paid 2½ per cent on retail sales.  If you wanted to put it on tea and not on sugar, he could not care less so long as you put 2½ per cent on all your sales.</P>
    <P>What was the result of that?  I am in the retail trade.  The retail trade is not its own master, more so now since the advent of large supermarkets. The turnover tax was used to overturn completely the retail price structure.  Those articles which the people selling in the large supermarkets wanted increased in price were increased and those they did not wish to increase were kept at a lower level.  Those increased were the things that mattered to the poorer people.  There was no suggestion that bread, butter, tea and sugar should not be involved in the turnover tax. If it suited the man behind the counter, he put the increase on the necessaries of life and did not put it on smoked salmon.  If he had more profit on the luxuries, he could put the 2½ per cent on the necessaries. The Minister for Finance at the time said he could not care less.</P>
    <P>The Minister said another important thing: that you could not have a selective wholesale tax.  Now a different Minister for Finance from the same Party has produced a selective wholesale tax.  We have been debating it here over the past few weeks and I do not intend to repeat what has been said. They now make a complete <i>volte face</i> and find it is possible to have a wholesale selective tax and not interfere with the turnover tax.  All that has overflowed into the cost of living and into the current Budget.  Let us remember the expediency with which the present Government met their responsibilities. After the turnover tax, they had to face two by-elections in Kildare and Cork. The Taoiseach laughed at the Fine Gael suggestion of a prices and incomes policy.  He said it was completely impracticable.  He had to find some <Col N="2330" /> way out of defeat in Kildare and Cork. The method was simple.  The employers were stuck at eight per cent and the unions were stuck at 14 per cent.  He went in and settled it at 12 per cent for 2½ years.</P>
    <P>Whether 12 per cent was right or wrong, Deputy Dowling, who is smiling now, and Deputy James Tully, who knows his business as a trade union operator, will agree that 2½ years was wrong because prices must follow costs inside nine to 12 months.  If we are to be fair to the decent working people and given them an increase in wages to compensate for the increase in the cost of living, that increase must be spaced on the basis of a period of nine to 12 months, in the realisation that with creeping inflation, which is always with us, they will be either back where they started or worse off within 12 months. The Taoiseach settled it and Kildare and Cork were won.</P>
    <P>Something that has not been mentioned in the House of late must also be remembered.  That was that a Minister of State resigned on the basis that the Taoiseach's action had increased the income of one section of the community while another section, the farming community, lagged behind.  The Minister who resigned was the Minister for Agriculture.  He resigned because he felt the people he represented were not getting a fair &ldquo;do&rdquo; and that their share of the national cake was being reduced to such proportions that it was impossible for them to live.  What occurred between the by-elections of 1951 and 1965 in the constituency of Cavan whence that Minister came to find his disagreement with the Cabinet and to resign?  In 1961, Fianna Fáil received 13,690 votes out of 27,819 in Cavan County.  In 1965, that figure was reduced to 11,903 votes. That is what happened when the political king of Cavan suggested that the Taoiseach was a political fixer.  We have to decide whether those 2,000 people in Cavan believed that, when they withdrew their allegiance from Fianna Fáil, because the valid poll was almost exactly the same.  If they did not vote for Fianna Fáil, they voted for somebody else and therefore <Col N="2331" /> let us accept without doubt that the action of this Minister of State was accepted in his own constituency as a proper one and as a severe criticism of the behaviour of the Taoiseach and the Government.</P>
    <P>What is the great necessity in Ireland today?  The necessity today, if we are to be able to finance all the things we need, and that matter, is an expanding agriculture which will pay for the raw materials of our industry. We must preserve our balance of payments. We can let it go wrong for a year because of our assets, but we must start correcting it in the second year. Of every £100 of agricultural goods exported, it is quite possible that £90 worth is a real export and from it comes the money to pay for the raw materials of our industry.  When a Minister of State found that he was with a craven Government and resigned, his constituents realised the truth.  What is the truth and what are the results?  I would like to quote very briefly some figures from the Progress Report for 1965 of the Second Programme for Economic Expansion. I should first like to give the position in relation to agricultural production and on page 12, in paragraph 13, you will find that in 1965 agricultural production was down in comparison with 1964 by one per cent.  We all know that if we look at these things on the basis of an expanding economy, we would like to see something in the order of five to seven per cent of an increase in agricultural production.  As far as weather was concerned, 1965 was not a bad year.  The Government's figure of 3.7 per cent increase in agricultural production in each year during this period has been corrected to 2.9 per cent.  It is completely inadequate and they have deserted agriculture. Nevertheless, the actual result was that they were 3.9 per cent below their target because they had a reduction of one per cent in 1965 compared with 1964.</P>
    <P>Let us now turn to page 111 of the same Report where we find the figure for agricultural exports.  Agricultural exports for 1964 were to the value of <Col N="2332" /> £115.5 million and in 1965, they were £108.8 million, or a reduction of £6.7 million.  Thus are the Government charged and thus are the Government's figures and targets completely and absolutely exposed as failures.  Let us remember as well that if you turn to page 98 of the Progress Report, you will find that total employment in 1965 compared with 1964 was down by 7,000 people; yet the Taoiseach, when he was out of office in 1956, was talking about over 100,000 new jobs in 1966 and says that there should be 30,000 new jobs as from 1965 to 1970.  The Government's defence is that they are spending more money than ever before.  If they are spending more money than ever before, then they are guilty of bad housekeeping and of not getting results.  There is only one way in which that can then be decided, one way in which it can be tested, that is, by putting it before the people.</P>
    <P>Why is it that the Government have not got these results?  They have not got them because they insisted, and the Taoiseach insisted, that there was no need for priorities, that there was plenty of money for all.  I am sure we are sophisticated enough in this House to know that there was a heavy inflow of foreign capital over the past six or seven years.  We were aware that the greatest single stoppage to that inflow of capital was caused by the Government's decision to have all bank deposits of over £1,000 open to examination. Up to that time and afterwards the Government insisted that there was no need for priorities: there was plenty of money for the swimming pools I wanted for my constituency and plenty of money to do all the things they have done.  There was plenty of money to lend to young boys and girls who wanted to build houses for themselves and plenty of money to provide cash for local authorities to do the essential things and also to help the poor old age pensioners.</P>
    <P>This was the situation in which we were living, a land flowing with milk and honey.  Three weeks ago we Deputies and Senators and Ministers &mdash;I suppose I should have mentioned them first&mdash;occupied a building that <Col N="2333" /> cost £500,000, a building within 100 feet of where I am standing.  At the same time, there are 40 families living in Griffith Barracks whose fathers get in to see them once a day.  The parents have not even one room in which to house themselves and their five or six children.  Which was the priority? Is that not the great condemnation of the Government, that they should have no priorities?</P>
    <P>I used go to Griffith Barracks to sit on the Joint Labour Committee for the provender milling industry in the Labour Court.  Deputy Tully went there also.  I went as an employer's member and he went as representative for the trade union, and I am sure he will agree with me that the accommodation there was quite adequate. Now, however, we go to another £500,000 edifice down along the canal. And there are 40 families living in dormitories whence, we came.  Is this right or is it wrong?  Were there proper priorities set down at the Cabinet table or not?  I say there were not and I defy anyone to rise from the far side&mdash;although there is an extreme scarcity of Deputies there&mdash;to prove that there were priorities in relation to Government capital expenditure.</P>
    <P>What did we do at the same time? We allowed the Minister for Agriculture to go to Ballsbridge and there rent, not a complete block of offices but one floor of a block of offices for An Bord Iascaigh Mhara for £14,000 a year for 21 years, and guarantee when he went in that he would spend £10,000 on its decoration.  He tried to defend that situation in reply to a Parliamentary Question by me.  This is at the same time as I have had to tell boys and girls in Drogheda town that it will be 15 months before they will get the loan for the houses they are building, and when the greatest monuments to the Government's failure can be seen on every hill in every parish in the constituency, where the building of houses had to stop because there was no money to proceed.  Where are our priorities?  We have invested £1,319,000 in Potez Limited on the Naas Road, where there are 20 or 30 people making aeroplane wings, and not a wing left the building since they started to make them.</P>

However, if I could rehouse those people who are in Griffith Barracks&mdash;and there are only 40 of them&mdash;by selling a jet, I would sell one.  I am not in favour of selling them.

      <P>I have had this before from no less a person than Senator Farrell from County Louth.  I said at a meeting that I disagreed with him, and he replied: &ldquo;You approved of the plans.&rdquo;  Certainly, anybody can approve of the plans.  You approved of the priorities.  While we stroll around on plush carpets, the unfortunate people in Griffith Barracks are without houses.  The Deputy cannot talk his way out of that.  I suggest he should keep out of the debate, as his colleagues are doing.  He is making a great mistake by coming in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2335" /> Every year we in the Louth County Council desire to provide sewerage for some villages in the county that have not got it.  We knew we could not expect the Local Loans Fund to provide loans to do the job all at once, and we reached the stage when, perhaps, only six or seven installations were left.  Naturally they were the most difficult ones, the ones that could not be done as easily as the ones that were done.  We decided to employ consultants, and we were worried because if you employ one consultant for one big job, he takes about five years to do it.  We employed three consultants and we have now got our plans for the last six or seven villages in Louth that need sewerage.  We received the bill for the consultants' fees which amounted to £20,000.  Our allocation for sewerage in Louth this year is £10,000, and we instructed the county manager to write to our consultants and say: &ldquo;Thank you very much for the plans. You have done a great job.  We cannot do anything about them.  We are sending you half the fees this year and you will please wait until next year for the other half&rdquo;.  I would prefer not to be strolling on my plush carpet so that more money would be available to the Louth County Council to provide these necessary sewerage installations.</P>
    <P>This is the Government who said there was no need for priorities.  This is the Government who a few months ago gave as much as £900 a year of an increase to senior civil servants, and produced within six weeks the figure to which they felt staff under £1,200 a year were entitled, and that figure was three per cent; then in another six weeks they had to back down because the Labour Court had produced the figure of £1 a week. This is the Government who produced the slogan &ldquo;Let Lemass Lead On.&rdquo;  Where is he leading us?  He produced the three per cent at the time of the first Budget as something which could not be contradicted.  Of course, his mathematics were ridiculous. He based the three per cent on the expectation that there would be <Col N="2336" /> a three per cent increase in gross national product.  It was unrelated to what we could afford to pay.  Again, in another six weeks he produced the selective wholesale tax which he suggested was impossible in 1963.</P>
    <P>Then when things were going really badly, the Minister for Industry and Commerce produced the Prices Stabilisation Bill.  When that became an Act inside a few months, it resulted in a loss in one company of £458,000 which had a profit the previous year of £150,000, and in another company, the best employer in this country, it resulted in a loss of the order of £600,000.</P>
    <P>At the same time, it is clear the increase in revenue that was hoped for has not materialised.  It has not materialised because the Government, in their extremity, have taken so much money from the available capital coming forward that there is no capital for the private sector to increase and expand its activities.  Worse still, the private sector has had, on many occasions, to cut down on its activities, and the figures for employment, when they come out, will without doubt show a decrease.  Figures for unemployment were given here this morning by Deputy Cosgrave, but the figures for employment take a good while longer to produce.  When they are produced, I venture to say that, while we had 7,000 fewer people at work last year than the year before, that figure will be still greater this year.</P>
    <P>The figures are clear.  Last year the Government took £31 million of the new money coming forward through the commercial banking system.  This year, before they get into trouble at all, before there are any Supplementaries, they say they are going to take £28 million and there is no place that can be got except back from the banks' customers.  This I believe to be the greatest single reason why there is no activity in our economy today, why the private sector is not in fact producing the elasticity that was expected and why the results hoped for have been completely disappointing.</P>
    <P>This was not enough for the Government. <Col N="2337" /> They went to Germany to borrow £8 million at 7½ per cent or thereabouts, and they went to the Bank of Nova Scotia to borrow £5 million at about the same rate of interest.  We are told by the Minister for Finance that before the end of the present financial year, he will have to borrow from external sources another £5 million.  I do not doubt it.  I believe that with the rising costs that inevitably occur, that £5 million of capital money will be greatly increased before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>I would like to point to one particular facet of these loans from Germany and Nova Scotia: they are for ten years. If you borrow in a national loan of long term, the amount to service that debt which must be charged to the current Budget is relatively small, but if you have to pay off 7½ per cent and pay back the principal in ten years, the amount that you have to write into the current Budget to service that is probably three times the amount you would have to write in if you borrowed it through a national loan.  That means that the people have to be taxed to the very hilt to pay for that.  The selective wholesale tax is, we are told, to produce £5 million per annum.  I believe that in a full year it will produce far more and what is going to happen is exactly what happened in relation to the turnover tax, that although there was little addition to the price of the particular articles, we all found that there was less money in our pockets. The general increase was more severe in its application than it would have been if we had put 6d on the cigarettes and 6d on the beer, high as that might have appeared at the time.</P>
    <P>Let us remember that this short-term borrowing to which the Government have had to have recourse is a very serious matter for the country. It will increase the cost of living.  An unduly large amount has to be written into the current Budget for its repayment and it proves the failure of the Government to do their housekeeping properly.  Last week I asked a question of the Minister for Finance. It was Question No. 34 on the Order Paper of 23rd June.  The record is:</P>
    <P>Mr. Donegan asked the Minister <Col N="2338" /> for Industry and Commerce how the expansion in the private sector of industry and commerce indicated in the Second Programme for Economic Expansion can be achieved this year while new bank credit is unavailable.</P>
    <P>You will get an adaptation grant of 25 per cent for industry.  That leaves you with 75 per cent which must be found from investors, private sources or from the banks.  The Minister said:</P>
    <P>I have had no complaints that expansion in the private sector of industry and commerce is being prevented by inability to obtain bank credit.</P>
    <P>That is the greatest nonsense we have ever heard from a member of the Government.  Does everybody not know that bank credit is restricted, that the ordinary businessman who may have had an overdraft even before expansion had a letter on his table from his bank asking that the overdraft be either radically reduced or wiped out altogether?  Does everybody not know that the restriction on bank credit is designed to reduce consumer spending?</P>
    <P>The Minister, in his innocence, suggests to me that people should publicly complain of the fact that there is restriction of bank credit.  Who ever heard of a businessman or industrialist going out and publicly telling of his difficulties?  If he did, every traveller to whom he owed money would be at his door next morning asking to have his account cleared up.  These things do not happen out in the open.  These things happen behind closed doors and result in 15 men being sacked in one industry, perhaps one in another and perhaps a hundred men disemployed in some other industry.  These are the things in respect of which the Government have shown complete ineptitude.  These are the things for which we are entitled to criticise them and for which we will continue to criticise them.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance said last Saturday night that credit restrictions should ease off.  We as a Party have talked about this and our view is that they should ease, that if the Government had the ability and if anybody <Col N="2339" /> would still believe them, particularly the bank directors, it should be possible for them to set up and operate a plan whereby over the next few years, the economy of this country would come slowly right and whereby restrictions on bank credit would be eased and so save many of our people from unemployment and emigration. We believe it is the duty of the Government to put such a plan to the banks but we see no evidence that they are examining the present critical situation in that way.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach used to be known as a fast man on the draw, as a good politician, as a slick operator.  I have never seen anything so dreadful or so completely cynical as his performance over the past six months.  It was so bad that it appeared to most of the people of this country as if he were ill.  They were constantly asking if it was true that the Taoiseach was sick.  That is the truth.  The Taoiseach gave no leadership and has given none during the period of this credit squeeze.  He was hopeless, inept, and impossible.</P>
    <P>What is wanted now is someone who will get down to it with the financial institutions and present them with a plan for national recovery. Even if you had to tell the people that you could only build two-thirds of the houses needed every year for the next three years and then that you would resume building at full force, it would be better to let them know the truth.  At the present time the people believe the worst and worse than that is the fact that we do not know what the worst is.  We do not know whether the Government have reached the bottom, but we do know that if they go any lower, a lot of their passengers will drown.</P>
    <P>While we propose to the Government that they should get down to it with the financial institutions, we are well aware that the backlog of payments that have to be met from Government sources is such that it will be two or three years before things will be on an even keel again.  All this arises because of the lack of efficiency by the Government.  The full impact of the stoppage in building has not yet <Col N="2340" /> been seen.  No new building works are being sanctioned by the Government. If they are sanctioned, we cannot enter into a final tender for them until the Minister for Local Government tells us to do so and he is not telling us to do anything of the kind.  When certain housing schemes at present in progress are finished, there is going to be a complete stoppage in building for 12 or 18 months and this is entirely the fault of the Government.</P>
    <P>The same is true of building in the private sector.  If the allocation to local authorities were doubled next year, it would not catch up with the backlog of payments that have to be made.  At best, the Government have two to three years of difficulty to ride.  That makes it twice as important that they should produce a plan and tell the people what the worst is and when things will be better, or else they should go to the country and discover whether or not the people want to have them or to have somebody else.</P>
    <P>Let us examine whether the people want them or want somebody else. In the 1961 election, Fianna Fáil polled 512,072 votes and Fine Gael polled 374,106 votes.  That left Fianna Fáil with a majority of 138,966 votes over their nearest rival.  In 1965, Fianna Fáil polled 597,414 votes; Fine Gael polled 427,981 votes.  That left Fianna Fáil with a majority over their nearest rival of 169,433 votes.</P>
    <P>In the Presidential election this year, Fianna Fáil polled 558,818 votes; Fine Gael polled 548,240 votes. The majority for Fianna Fáil was 10,758 votes.  A swing of one-half of one per cent removes that majority and produces a majority for Fine Gael.</P>

They are entitled to give their preferences where they like and Deputy Clohessy should not come in here and put his oar in and annoy people.  We think deeply before we speak.  I am sure Deputy Clohessy would wish to hear what &ldquo;<i>Pravda</i>&rdquo; said the day after the Presidential election.  He will be pleased, of course, to hear that I do buy the <i>Irish Press</i> occasionally.  This was one of the days.  Let us consider what the leading article said.  Not surprisingly, the leading article is headed &ldquo;The Result&rdquo;.  I quote:</P>
      <P>To the very many Irish men and women at home and abroad who have always honoured Eamon de Valera as the most distinguished spokesman of our people for the last half-century the outcome of this presidential election comes as a shock.  The slender majority accorded the President on this occasion will be construed by opponents as a devastating reverse and by his supporters as a victory which only he could win in the many adverse circumstances of the battle.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed, it did.  I continue the quotation:</P>
      <P>Fine Gael campaigned in the election not on the personal merits of the candidates but on the record of the Government.  The result must be interpreted as a partial success for these tactics.  Whether the Government can be fairly blamed for the widespread industrial unrest and other current difficulties in the country does not matter: they were indicted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, the efforts of <Col N="2342" /> the Fianna Fáil party to present Mr. de Valera to the country on the basis of his great national record and international stature, without attempting to defend the record of the government or apportion the blame for the economic situation, were also successful, but only just. It is clear that a candidate of lesser stature who could not command the same loyalty and faithfulness from the majority of the electorate could not have succeeded in such unprecedented circumstances.  Against desperate odds, the Legion of the Rearguard carried the day for their Chief.</P>
    <P>The public dissatisfaction in recent weeks in the realm of industrial relations and the difficulties encountered in promoting a rational approach to an incomes policy in place of the industrial free-for-all created a widespread mood of dissatisfaction. Fine Gael spokesmen both initiated and promoted a transfer of this mood from its appropriate arena of political activity and injected it into the presidential election. That they have succeeded cannot be doubted.</P>

      <P>The <i>Irish Press</i> of Friday, June 3rd, the leading article. I shall have it sent to the Deputy if he likes.  I should like to discuss another matter now.  I have suggested that the policies of the Government, because they fell down on priorities, failed.  I think I have succeeded in proving that by figures that can be read in my speech.  Deputies opposite may not agree but I am entitled to my belief that I have proved this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been said that the Government should come out and tell the people how bad things are and what is planned to remedy them and try to get the banks, trade unions, the employers and the employees, the farmers and the general body of the people behind them to raise the country from the rut into which they have put it.  I suggest an alternative.  I do not think it was believed until the Presidential election that any Party could mount a political campaign with the expenditure and intensity associated with Fianna Fáil.  Fine Gael have proved beyond doubt that, first, they can raise the finance freely within the country to pay for printing and other costs; secondly, that they have the people to man the campaign; and thirdly, that in the Presidential election their <Col N="2344" /> campaign was better than any Fianna Fáil ever mounted and they came within a cat's whisker of victory at a time when they were opposing a man who, I agree, has reached a height of national appreciation greater perhaps than that of any other living man, now that the late William T. Cosgrave has gone, God rest him.  When we could meet them with the President as their candidate and come within a half of one per cent of beating them and mount a better campaign than they did, I suggest that we are the alternative Government.</P>
    <P>The Government now have the choice of either producing an answer for their mistakes and producing for the people of Ireland a way out of the dilemma the country is in or going to the country which they have so long avoided and meeting the people.  If they meet the people, we shall mount a campaign better than the last one and we shall beat them and we shall be the next Government.</P>

      <P>I am speaking of a Party who were beaten by 52,000 votes in the last general election and who changed that into a 10,000 majority. They have the people behind them. I do not worry what any paper says. The figures are there for any Deputy to read and judge.  It is on that result that those gentlemen opposite started crowing because they were beaten by 10,000 votes instead of beating us by 52,000.</P>

      <Col N="2346" /> I am not a bit worried about what happened in Dublin.  I am well aware of what has happened to nationality in Dublin city and county.  We were beaten by 18,000 votes in the city and county of Dublin in the last general election.  We were beaten this time in the city and county of Dublin by 41,000 votes but the rest of the country gave us 51,000 to beat that.  I do not give two hoots about Dublin.  The only pity is that the Germans did not do a decent job when they came in there.</P>

      <P>What were you discussing there for the last half hour when the Minister for dirty milk was talking, the gentleman who said that every farmer's wife in his county has dirty milk in cans?  Let us look at facts as they are.  Let us judge facts as they are.  Those are the facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we first came into Government here, we set out to implement the policy laid down for us by our comrades who gave their lives for it. Step by step, we carried out that policy, and hard steps they were.  We had to turn this country from being one inhabited by hewers of wood and <Col N="2347" /> drawers of water for Britain into an industrial nation giving employment to our boys and girls.  We did that. Industry after industry tells its own story and proves that the work can be done.  If there is any constituency in which the work is not being done, then it is the fault of the Deputies representing it and they can take that, every one of them.</P>
    <P>I came into a constituency where there was no employment.  Up to 1933 the total amount of work given in the town of Cobh was three weeks' work to half a dozen men every year smashing up the machinery in Rushbrooke for the scrapheap and there was an auction there each year when the scrap was sold.  With the help of the Fianna Fáil Government, that industry was set in motion.  It went bankrupt twice.  On each occasion, the Fianna Fáil Government stepped in and provided the cash to bring it back on its feet again.  That was done first of all by Deputy Seán MacEntee, at a time when Deputy Seán Lemass was ill, and on a second occasion by Deputy Seán Lemass himself.  Today, there is full and constant employment in that industry at Irish Steel Holdings, Limited, for 650 men.</P>
    <P>Let us examine the industry about which those gentlemen opposite went to the country.  There was a little slip in an election address issued by Deputy Fitzpatrick which stated that it was their financial policy to close down Rushbrooke, the Verolme Dockyard. There are anything between 800 and 1,000 young men employed in that dockyard at present.  If those gentlemen over there were sitting on this side of the House, they would state they had a mandate from the country to close it down and they would: they had it in their election address. Those are facts.</P>
    <P>When we took over in 1932, all that was in that dockyard was a caretaker minding the door.  When the war came on, even the machinery in it had been sold for scrap.  I saw one unfortunate ship that was holed during the war having to go up to Passage docks and, outside of Passage, the hole <Col N="2348" /> was filled with cement to enable the ship to get out of this country.  Not alone did they close down the industries but they did their damnedest to ensure that never again would they start off.  They sold every bit of machinery that was in them.  When we took over, Rushbrooke Dockyard was in the hands of two gentlemen, David Frame and Thompson of Carlow, who used to auction the scrap and frames.  All the machinery in the dockyard was sold out and we had to improvise machinery there to enable ships to be repaired during the war so as to provide food for this nation.</P>
    <P>Because they have faith in this nation and in the advancement of this country, foreign people come and start industries here and those people on the benches opposite immediately start off and try to wreck them.  They did that and they did their damnedest. We had a rotten debate in the House on the Verolme Dockyard before the election and every form of sabotage to close down that dockyard was availed of.  The records of this House are there for anyone who wishes to read them.  Read them and learn. Then they talk about the unemployed and unemployment.  They have done that.</P>
    <P>In my town of Midleton, there were 20 men working three days a week in the flour mills.  In 1932, when we were first taking over as a Government, Messrs.  Ranks bought in, assisted by ex-Deputy McGilligan.  I would say that, between the election and the appointment of a Taoiseach, I was faced with Messrs.  Ranks coming down to Midleton and endeavouring to remove the machinery out of Midleton mills up to Cork.  I had to go to the Hallinan family, whose grandfather started that mill there, in that connection.  I had to threaten to throw a force of men into the mill until the Government and the Minister for Industry and Commerce were appointed and their policy made known, and I did it.  The mill was there and held there through that. That was all the employment that was given in that town when we took over.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2349" /> The late William Dwyer started two factories there and today these factories are giving employment to 500 people.  We started a little factory, too, out of nothing there four years ago.  That was started by the farmers and last year we paid £45,000 in wages out of that factory and over £70,000 to the farmers.  We are now expanding and, please God, in the next 12 months, instead of the 100 employed now, there will be over 250 in jobs there.  That is advance. That is progress.</P>
    <P>Take then the town of Youghal.  I often canvassed it and, on one occasion here, I read the statement of the late Deputy Gorman, God rest his soul, on the position in the town of Youghal.  It was lamentable.  For three months of the year you had the visitors and for the other nine months, the whole town was closed up.  Today you have Dwyer's factory, the carpet factory, the furniture factory.  There is not a man or girl idle in the town today.  I could go right through my constituency.  I know it and I am proud of it.  My constituents, despite all the manoeuvring, showed appreciation of what has been done in the Presidential election and their gratitude for the employment that Fianna Fáil provided for them.  The only pity is that Cork city did not do the same.  These are the facts.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Corish on one matter and I could not emphasise it enough.  I refer to the priority that there should be in expenditure.  There should be two joint priorities, providing (1) further employment for our people and (2) housing for them.  I hear a great deal of noise and shouting about housing, but I am very happy about housing.  I am happy to know that houses are wanted because that means there are people in employment now who, thank God, because they have constant employment, can look to a future.  If they are young lads, they are looking around for a nice girl with the intention of getting married, and they want homes.  The priorities should not be theatres or the Cork Opera House.  The priority should be the provision of houses for our people. I never felt more disgusted than I did <Col N="2350" /> when I heard three Parties here, one after the other, giving their blessing to the expenditure of £500,000 on two amusement houses.</P>

You have to watch where the money we have is going.  As I say, I was disgusted with the three Parties in this House joining together, with the benediction of Deputy Dillon, to give £500,000 to two centres of amusement, one in Dublin and the other in Cork, while our people are crying out for decent homes.</P>

If anyone wants the reference, I will give it to him.

      <P>I am giving the facts. There was practically no industrial employment in this country and we had to start out and create that employment.  We had to create confidence so that people would come in and bring in money with them to start further industries to give employment to more people.  We did that, and we did it for a very definite reason.  We did it because the comrades who were with us from 1916 to 1921 were not the &ldquo;toffy&rdquo; people of this country, not the people living on ground rents, not the aristocrats.  They were the ordinary workers, be they farmers, farm labourers or industrial workers.  Thank God, those of us of the old guard have never forgotten that.  We have a duty to them.  If the Taoiseach, when bringing in the ninth round, gave a little too much to the ordinary workers &mdash;as is alleged by the people opposite who shouted from the housetops during the Presidential election that it was the cause of all our labour unrest &mdash;his heart was there and I am proud of it.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>It has, surely.  Every penny that leaves this country makes this country poorer.  By my efforts and the efforts of my comrades in Cobh, we took from those ground rent landlords a lump sum to date of £183,000.  Surely that is a nice bit of finance?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not going to be forgotten, be sure of that.  However, this, to my mind, is the manner in which we can go ahead.  Every additional industry that is started, especially those connected with the agricultural industry, will show results and will give employment, and constant employment in the future.  For example, take the case I have already mentioned, East Cork Foods.  It started in a small way with £30,000 collected from the farmers of East Cork and it was helped by a man whom I am proud to call a friend, even though like every other friend, we have to fight him at times.  He is a man who has proved his worth.  He could do like Deputy Lindsay is doing, sit there quietly and say: &ldquo;I have a nice job and I am all right.&rdquo;  He did not do that.  He endeavoured to find out how we could find further employment for our young men and women.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He visited the Continent and discovered that processed foods were the coming thing.  Today, over 2,000 people are employed in food processing between Carlow, Mallow, Thurles and Tuam, and not forgetting Skibbereen and Midleton, people who would be in a foreign country looking for employment were it not for <Col N="2355" /> the work of Lt.-General Costello.  This little industry to which I have referred employed 100 people last year and we paid out £45,000 in wages. I admit that there was periodic employment there because the factory had to go idle for portion of the year.  Now, however, we have found a cure and nobody will be laid off this year and we will have 215 people employed in it.  We will spend £250,000 expanding that industry and there will be no bother about the money.</P>
    <P>That is what I want Deputies to do in their own constituencies and not be coming in here moaning and groaning.  I had to go to Deputy Lindsay's constituency to provide a month's or six months' work for the unfortunate people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am endeavouring to point out that this country is progressing. I would say that 15 years ago, if anyone will go back 15 years nowadays, there was very little demand for houses.  Nobody was looking for extra houses.  I remember in 1947 when I started putting through the first non-municipal scheme outside the borough boundary of Cobh, a scheme of six houses, I thought we would not get tenants for them.  We did, and they were followed by eight more and then by a further 24 and by a further 24. After that, there were 18 more and a further 18 were followed by 52.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>There would be little use building those houses if you had not got Irish Steel and the other industries there to keep the people working. There is little use building houses for unemployed people because they cannot pay for them.  The more anxiety I see about housing and the greater the demand is, the happier I am about the progress of the country and about employment in the country.  People would not be looking for houses unless there is constant employment.  I am not speaking in any Party spirit but I am urging that we should go ahead, not in one constituency, but in all of the constituencies, to find industries which will provide employment for our people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there is to be a priority in regard to money, let it be that it will not be spent on Abbey Theatres or opera houses but on homes for our people.  If there is money to the tune of £17 million odd lying around unclaimed, as we discovered yesterday, then the same legislation as was brought in to give that money to the Abbey Theatre and to the Cork Opera House could be brought in to ensure that it is spent on the two top priorities, industry and housing.  Instead of the <Col N="2357" /> money being used to glorify a yoke which turns out the Deputy Lindsays, in the King's Inns, instead of spending public money on things like that, it should be spent on providing further industries and on building houses.  In that way it would be far better spent.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the financial crisis which existed here during the past three months is on its way out and now we can continue with the advances we were making in providing employment for our people and keeping them happy.</P>
    <P>I have one other thing to say.  Since we are talking generally here, it is well that I say this.  I suggest, whatever labour court we have in this country for dealing with industrial unrest, the court should have power to make a decision and power to enforce that decision.  I would be quite happy to let the Trade Union Congress appoint a judge, but in heaven's name, let us not have the drain we have had here through strikes and industrial revolution.  Surely, as I pointed out in this House before, if all Parties in this House can come together and elect a Ceann Comhairle, it should not be any more difficult for the trade unions and employers' unions to come together and set up a court, give that court power, not power to recommend, but power to enforce the decisions come to.</P>
    <P>That would end the present unrest. It would, in my opinion, satisfy everybody. It would satisfy the worker because he would know he had a friendly court he could go to, a friendly place where he could plead his cause with satisfaction.  The employer, on the other hand, would know that he could expect justice there.  I see no reason why we could not have a court of that type.  I believe nine-tenths of the unrest in this country is caused by the fact that we have a Labour Court in this country which has not the power to make a decision and enforce it.  I say that frankly to all Parties in this House.  I think I am right.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal at stake today. The result of one of those strikes hits too many people.  I am not, never was, and never would be, against the worker <Col N="2358" /> getting a decent wage, a wage sufficient to enable him to keep his wife and family in comfort, any more than I would be against the agricultural community doing the same.  I am against a small number of men being able to drag the whole lot out of employment in one day or even in a couple of hours.</P>
    <P>When the ESB strike first took place, we were told in the public press that essential industries were being looked after.  At 8 o'clock on that first morning, when the ESB strike took place, I had to put an apron on, go out and milk the cows with the rest of them because the electric current went off.  You had the same thing all over the country. There is so much which depends on industry at the moment that unless there is some fair and honest means of having those matters rectified, we will have a continuing picture of strikes and labour unrest.</P>
    <P>I am happy to think, and to believe, that people have confidence in this country and that they will have continued confidence in it.  I hope, within the next few months, to prove to my friend, Deputy Barry, and the other Deputies in my constituency, that the people have that confidence and that people are prepared to come in here, invest their money here and give further employment to our people.  I am happy in that position and I am happier still in the knowledge that when the financial crisis came, this Government stuck to their guns, did their job, and weathered the storm.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>In tabling this motion, our Party had in mind the economic indicators of the present situation which did not, to our mind, inspire us with any confidence in the present Government.  It is for that reason that we tabled this motion.  The motion specifically refers to the lack of progress in creating new employment, reducing existing unemployment and emigration and also refers to the crisis in the provision of finance for housing. As a result of those clearly observable facts in our economy at the moment, we tabled our motion of no confidence in the present Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those are facts which have arisen largely because over the past year or two this situation has been building <Col N="2359" /> up.  What is more ominous to our mind, and what is really behind our decision in putting down this motion, is that we do not see any prospect in the Government's policies that the problems, to which the motion refers, will be overcome in the near future. This year, I suppose, has witnessed the greatest period of open industrial warfare, since the war years, affecting this country between employers and employees.  Our strike record this year has pushed us up to the top of the international league in the strike table.  The strike pattern this year has differed from previous outbursts of industrial disputes in that the major portion of the disputes occurring this year have been caused as a result of cash problems, the lack of the implementation of the £1 a week increase by employers generally.</P>
    <P>This Government have not throughout the current year been notable for their ability to grapple with the industrial unrest and the realities of the relations between employers and the unions.  This Government have to take responsibility for that situation.  The Leader of the Government, earlier this year, spoke of an advance approximating to three per cent which could be tolerated in our economy for wage increases.  The unions, it will be recalled, at their public conference this year, looking at the rise in the cost of living, the plight of their members at the end of the National Wage Agreement, the soaring cost of living, and looking also at the state of the economy in a responsible fashion, considered they would be absolutely right in looking for £1 a week increase. The Taoiseach, however, with his three per cent, dashed that idea.  He did not encourage the trade unions in their responsible claim for £1 increase. He was backed by the employers in this.</P>
    <P>This is the background of every dispute which has occurred this year. The Labour Court, very belatedly, some months after the trade unions had actually made the decision of looking for this £1 increase, supported the £1 ceiling of the unions.  This has now become the pattern of the negotiations: <Col N="2360" /> the £1 which would break the economy if it were conceded earlier this year can be conceded now.  This is after a spate of industrial disputes, after many people have been put out of work and many people have been losing their purchasing power over these disputes.  There is no strike now for more than £1 increase.</P>
    <P>This Government show signs of a great deal of fumbling in their approach to the problem, in their indecision and certainly show no clearminded approach to this problem.  First of all, they gave one figure; then they changed their minds and a neutral body comes in and gives another which apparently coincides with the trade unions.  Very late in the day the Government appear to acquiesce in this particular situation.  This is surely not the portrait of a Government who are determined, sure of themselves and know the facts about the economy and what it can bear.</P>
    <P>Figures have been mentioned during the day that spell out the areas of our concern and the failure of this Government's record in these areas.  We have mentioned the fall in employment; we have mentioned the increase in emigration; we have mentioned the fall in GNP.  There is a slight improvement in the balance of trade position, but, again, you can have absolute equilibrium in your terms of trade and this does not mean that economic activity is going ahead purposefully.</P>
    <P>The prices position does not give us any room for complacency.  There has been a big increase since last year and, of course, the position in housing which we referred to repeatedly today shows a sharp decline.  In fact, the records of the House during the past year show that we have been asking day in day out questions of the Minister for Local Government who must now be the master tactician of this Government for giving double-meaning answers in a situation in which it is only too clear to be seen no new houses have been built.</P>
    <P>The overall policy of this Government is entry into Europe.  That is the grand design of the Government <Col N="2361" /> apparently at the moment which the Taoiseach mentioned this morning.  I would like to examine the position of Irish industry which this Government propose to lead into Europe as it appears to be at the moment.  The most recent report available on the current position in Irish industry is that on arrangements for planning at industrial level brought out by the NIEC recently.  In fact, this close examination of official documents which are coming out in great numbers on the economy would appear to damn the record of the Government because one can see there how far we are falling short of the targets of the Second Programme.  They set down in black and white what the misgivings of these economists are in looking at the progress of the economy. The NIEC explained in their most recent report that we cannot consider economic planning in our situation apart from the progress of adaptation in Irish industry towards conditions of freer trade.  It does not make sense to talk about economic planning if the industry you are talking about is not itself adapting itself to meet a rather more hazardous future.  On this hazardous future, the report put out last week by the NIEC speaks in a very gloomy fashion about the amount of co-operation that has been forthcoming from Irish industry in the process of adaptation.</P>
    <P>When the adaptation councils were set up originally by the Committee on Industrial Organisation, they were to be bodies which would keep a sense of urgency alive in Irish industry, which would look at the problems industry would be facing in freer trade and would consider action and remedies in cases where they were called for.  The CIO considers that joint action by firms is absolutely essential if they are to survive in conditions of freer trade.  It looks at the small size of many of our firms and considers that co-operation and co-ordination are essential in tackling problems like specialisation of products and standardisation of product and that it would be necessary to examine new export outlets.</P>
    <P>Now, it is apparently the conclusion <Col N="2362" /> of the NIEC Report that very little of this type of activity has in fact gone on.  There have not been many examples of agreement on standardisation in firms in the one industry and there have not been examples of specialisation.  There have not been many agreements on improved design promoting awareness of the need for it in industrial circles.  There have not been any attempts at joint marketing of products and there have not been any agreements on joint purchasing, or the improvement of trainees and operatives generally by training schemes.</P>
    <P>Irish industry, therefore, does not appear to be too concerned in this regard, on the original basis of the CIO, and there do not appear to be anything like the adaptation councils envisaged.  They do not appear to be doing the work it was contemplated they would do.  Few of these adaptation councils have succeeded in co-ordinating the activities of individual firms in industry.  There appears to be an element of secrecy, each firm looking suspiciously at its competitor, even though they share the one market, and there appears to be little worrying about the future of the Free Trade Area and of the dangers involved for small industries in this respect.</P>
    <P>In the textile and clothing groups, for example, no discussions have taken place on prices, on reduction of tariffs or the methods to be taken to combat unemployment which might arise as a result of the dismantling of our tariffs.  Another thing contemplated three years ago when the Committee on Industrial Organisation gave its final report was that we should have established trade union advisory bodies of workers in each industry, that we should set up adaptation councils and that we should also have a trade union advisory body to represent workers' interests and should consult with the adaptation council for the particular industry.</P>
    <P>We see that meetings have taken place rarely between the trade unions advisory body and the adaptation councils.  This is an extraordinarily <Col N="2363" /> serious situation.  It apparently means there is a widening rift between the workers' interests in each industry and the free trade of the future.  There appears to be no consultation between adaptation councils in industry and little record of progress made.  Over this unfortunate state of affairs and over industry with its very rickety small-scale structure, this Government preside with a complacency bordering on a mania and have continental ambitions.  A Government with ambitions of entering into Europe, seeing the situation as it is and the little progress made in modernising Irish industry, cannot command the confidence of people who are worried about the future of this country.</P>
    <P>Admittedly, there have been difficulties in Irish industry.  There has been a lack of any kind of agreement or co-ordination between the business elements in Irish industry.  The only area in which there appears to have been any degree of collusion would appear to be in that obvious one. the determination of wage rates.  There is uniform agreement amongst firms about wage rates, but, among other things, there appears to be ignored co-ordination between one firm and another.</P>
    <P>We must ask a question then, when Government Ministers&mdash;and this Government in particular&mdash;are nailing their colours on the mast and talking about going into Europe.  We must ask them to come down from the top of this mountain and look at the realities of Irish industry, look at the possibilities before us, the problems which face us and the hardships which appear, on examination by this Party, to be in store for many of our working people as a result of this Government's complacency and their obession with Europe without doing their homework of modernising our industry, if we might go into Europe.  It is no secret that this Party's opposition to the Free Trade Area Agreement was based upon our awareness of the unprepared state of Irish industry. Nothing has happened in the interim which convinces us that Irish industry <Col N="2364" /> will prepare itself for conditions in the future.</P>
    <P>In the last CIO Report three years ago, there were&mdash;if Deputies recall&mdash; 22 industries surveyed.  It will be remembered that, at that time, we were living in monthly expectation of entry into Europe: at least an agreement on our eventual entry being concluded. They had, in surveying the 22 industries of that period, examined the jobs of over 87,000 people&mdash;58 per cent of the total employment in manufacturing industry had been examined by the different survey teams, and they came to the conclusion that there need only be redundancy of around a figure of 5,000 on entering the Common Market, if adaptation measures were taken. Since adaptation measures are not being taken, we must ask ourselves what the redundancy figures will be in these areas of industry.  There was a forecast figure, apparently, that, if adaptation measures were not carried out, we would have a redundancy figure of 20,000 by 1970 and, allied to that problem, we must see the record in employment as it is at the moment; the fall between this year and last.</P>
    <P>I got the impression this morning that the Taoiseach was talking about a different country.  He spoke in the weary tones of a university lecturer talking to a class of students who were inattentive and not really concerned about the problems of our country.  He spoke about the easing of our credit position and about the possibility of catching up on the targets envisaged in the Second Programme for Economic Expansion, the actual possibility of providing ourselves with 23,000 new jobs a year between now and 1970.  This is the Leader of a Government who asks for the confidence of the country.  I do not see any prospect for the success of Irish industry either in Deputy Corry's constituency&mdash;where wonderful things are happening&mdash;or elsewhere when we have to get 23,000 new jobs between now and 1970.  All the indications are there to show that employment is falling; it is falling in the building industry, an extremely important industry, with its connections with many other types of <Col N="2365" /> industry.  In fact, it is a barometer of the state of our economy at the moment.  That barometer certainly does not give us much room for confidence when it is falling in employment.</P>
    <P>There are no schemes, as we can see at the moment, for any agreement between different firms to buy raw materials together.  This was one of the recommendations mentioned in the CIO Report some years ago. It mentioned it particularly in the case of the furniture industry.  I see no sign from the furniture industry that it wishes to do this.  It mentioned joint buying of materials and other forms of agreement in the footwear industry, in the case of paper products, in the case of the carpet section of the wool industry.  In none of those areas do we see the kind of co-operation in the management of their economic affairs which was originally envisaged for these industries. One NIEC Report after another records their disappointment at the lack of progress on the industrial front in, at least, bringing in the measures they deemed necessary for conditions of freer trade.</P>
    <P>I do not see any sign of awareness or worry in sections of our industries controlled from outside to a great extent. A major part of the production of the chocolate industry, chemicals, electrical equipment and the wireless industry are controlled from outside this country and a big question mark hangs over those industries, as to whether they will continue after 1970, when we will be one trading <i>bloc</i> with Great Britain.  I do not see any sign of the chemical pulp mill which was considered necessary for the paper industry. There has been no talk about it, at any rate, in recent years.  Instead, in fact, we see the paper industry locked in a particularly bitter dispute which shows absolutely no sign of settlement and we see that that dispute is controlled by certain former employers.</P>
    <P>Again, the Government's answer to this industrial situation, which has been getting worse, is a reshuffle in the Cabinet and the appointment of a Minister for Labour.  I shall come to <Col N="2366" /> that in a few minutes but the fact is that the things thought necessary by experts, looking at Irish industry some years ago, have not been done and there does not appear to be much indication on the side of Irish industry that, in fact, they will be done in the years remaining.</P>
    <P>Our attitude has always been that, if Britain goes into Europe, then this country does not have much chance of staying outside.  Many people think that Britain will go into Europe.  There are certain forces within the British Labour Government which would go into Europe at the moment but there are many big conditions to be met before they do.  Meantime this Government, through their supernatural diplomatic standing, has decided that Britain is going into Europe and there is no doubt about it.  This was the only basis for their certainty that they will be accepted into Europe because, remember, our acceptance into Europe implies a larger degree of agriculture than is at present being reached in Europe.  We may not be a great competitor in the industrial field but our cattle and other agricultural products could prove an embarrassment to the Community's dilemma at the moment in agricultural policy.</P>
    <P>But there appears to be an appeasement of the Government's complacency in other areas; there appears to reign absolute certainty that we will be accepted into Europe in the present Government.  How much of this is public relations, I do not know, because there is one field in which this Government are unrivalled, that is, their command of public relations.  In the middle of a crisis in industrial relations for some weeks now, we have been flirting with a reshuffle of the Cabinet.  This, of course, is one of the oldest political ploys known&mdash;to fiddle around with names for some weeks and take people's attention away from the real problems facing the country.  It is a pity that we have commentators in the newspapers who concentrate on the rather trivial business of the choice of four new Ministers and their names; from a very restricted circle, there could not be much choice in names. It is rather a pity that such commentators <Col N="2367" /> fall for political ploy as to who will be the new incumbents of these offices.  This is the Government we are dealing with&mdash;a Government who deal in propaganda gimmicks.</P>
    <P>Now we have a Minister departing from the office in which he has promised good tidings by the end of next year.  The Minister for Health has blazed a trail of non-conformity through that Department.  He has shown himself to be the golden boy to the discontents in that Department. Now, before the results can be brought home, he is getting out of that Department. It is a great pity that in the present situation one man in the Cabinet who appeared to be doing a good job in the Department of Education is to be moved now into the Department of Industry and Commerce.  All these moves must cause the ordinary people some worry as to the dedication of the men who are doing these jobs when they are shifted on such a casual motive as Press publicity,</P>
    <P>Our look at all the official reports and the surveys made of Irish industry leave us extremely uneasy about our future, and more uneasy when we do not see the Government sharing the same unease.  The Government appear to be content to go around the country speaking about the inevitable challenge of the future and doing nothing else. That is not sufficient.  If industry does not appear to be taking the measures and the steps which the CIO considered necessary some years ago, the Government must step in.  In the interests of the community, there must be more Government participation even in the decisions of private firms.  For too long there has been an impression that the Government's economic activity in industry must be confined to the State bodies.  This Party are seriously considering the suggestion that the Government must take part in the decisions of boards of private enterprise.  We must take part in their decisions because if they do not make the proper decisions, our employment figures will be considerably worse in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>There has been some easing in the <Col N="2368" /> credit squeeze.  This is long overdue because the credit squeeze has afflicted large sections of business and that is not conducive to any kind of pick-up in the economy if it continues.  I referred earlier to the fumbling of the Government in the field of industrial relations.  It appears to me that they have not learned from their experience in the past because there are different rumours that they consider that their role in the sphere of industrial relations should lie in a revision of the existing industrial legislation.</P>
    <P>Speakers from this Party have consistently warned the Government about the dangers involved in this course. We have warned them about the difficulty in deciding legally the difference between an official strike and an unofficial strike.  We have warned them that so far as we can see they cannot achieve a legal short-cut to industrial peace.  We have said that there is no substitute for honest negotiations between employers and employees.  In our system the chief job of the Government is to see that economic growth goes forward.  On their reading of the situation they have taken a completely different attitude, and they now propose to weigh down the law against the free association of workers.  They propose to hedge in with many restrictions the use of the picket and the strike weapons.  Far from improving the situation, this might make it much worse.  We have repeatedly said that the records of countries that have tried a similar course prove that there is no escape from a high incidence of strikes and industrial disputes when such a course is adopted.</P>
    <P>This Government have always been noted for a lack of contact with and a lack of appreciation of trade union problems and trade union objectives. They have shown in their handling of the preparation of this new industrial legislation that they are just as much out of touch, because the consultations they are supposed to have had with the Congress of Trade Unions have not, in fact, been consultations in the real sense of the word.  Congress has been faced with a <i>fait accompli</i>.  The Government have gone to Congress and said: &ldquo;Here are <Col N="2369" /> our proposals for changes in the industrial law.  Look at them and tell us what you think of them.  They are our last word.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Government are embarking on a dangerous course if they proceed to rely exclusively on that type of consultation with the trade unions.  Where was the anxiety for a change in the trade union law?  The only anxiety that was felt by the trade unions in recent years about trade union law arose as a result of a High Court case about an education company. There was a decision that seriously restricted the trade unions from ensuring that there would be full trade union membership in that employment. As a result it appeared to the trade unions that in order to make certain that full organisation of members would be achieved&mdash;this power was seriously curtailed&mdash;the position should be cleared up in the law of the land. The Government seized the opportunity to introduce a global survey of industrial relations.  It has been four years in gestation, and the Minister has now been passing around a note to the trade unions saying: &ldquo;This is our final attitude on where the trade unions should fit into our society in the future.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We again issue a warning that things could be far worse.  There is no limit in industrial relations to how far we can go in disputes.  Parnell's words can apply in that area as well as to national freedom.  The system which has worked reasonably well in the past, apart from this year, might work reasonably well in the future, provided economic growth is resumed.  In the main, strikes arise as a result of conditions of work, dismissals, holidays and matters of interpretation between employer and employees.  The strikes we have seen this year, by and large, are concerned with the implication of the £1 a week increase.  The Leader of the Government has added his own quota to the confusion this year in the implementation of that £1 a week increase, because at the start of the year he gave a totally different figure of three per cent as being the absolute limit the economy could bear by way <Col N="2370" /> of wage increase.  Subsequently this was changed.</P>
    <P>In our contributions to this debate we have mentioned the rather crazy upsurge of price increases in recent months.  In the past month or two there have been increases in petrol, clothing and admission to dances, not that there is any need particularly to worry about admission to dances.  The fact is there have been tremendous increases in the cost of living.  This is the real dilemma of trade unions.  The £1 a week increase which should have been conceded without trouble, the £1 a week which was unpopular with the unions because many members felt that the actual increase in the cost of living and the cut in the standard of living demanded a far higher increase, the £1 a week which should have been conceded easily was not conceded easily.  It arose as an easy figure for negotiation only after months of bitter industrial dispute.</P>
    <P>The Leader of the Government did not improve the situation by his periodic ambiguous remarks.  Our position in this year might have been easier had the National Wage Agreement, ushered in with such great hopes, been given any chance of living.  Had the people of the country been given any hope that the new industrial era was here, had it been given any chance by the Government, we might not have had a crisis.  But the <i>laissez faire</i> attitude of the Government in allowing prices to take their own level wrecked the National Wage Agreement.  Rather late in the lifetime of the National Wage Agreement we supported the Government when they came in here for machinery on prices and we are proud to say our action on that occasion at least kept some prices down.</P>
    <P>However, this was too late in the day.  Many of us in this Party were becoming rather monotonous in our insistent calls for some policy on prices. One of the feelings which prompted us in tabling this motion of no confidence is that, overall, this is a Government ruling by propaganda, by distant prospects of prosperity, but which at the present time tightens our belts for us; <Col N="2371" /> in other words, a Government in power and using a hell of a number of clichés to remain in power.  One of the clichés with a different sound in the country has been the incomes policy.</P>
    <P>The Trade Union Congress will meet later in the month and a resolution on the programme will be to record their disappointment that the Government have done nothing about an incomes policy for incomes other than wages.  This Government have done nothing about a policy on dividends, concentrating purely on wages and salaries.  They should drop the pretence that they are chasing an incomes policy because they are not. Last year at a similar meeting the trade unions, asking the Government to bring in an incomes policy, drew attention to the necessity for bringing up the incomes of lower-paid workers and to the possibility of the Government, in that way, ensuring economic growth in the country.  This year, Congress will be recording no progress in that area.</P>
    <P>The possibility of controlling incomes has been tackled in other countries courageously and the unions here have put it on record that they are willing to participate in an effort to control and plan incomes.  During the next five years, the plan of the unions is a brave attempt, in face of Government inactivity, to aim at a pattern for our industrial future. At the moment we cannot see any lifting of the present economic clouds in the near future.  We cannot see the 23,000 new jobs the Taoiseach spoke of yesterday before 1970.  We cannot see, as has been so emphatically stressed by the Government, that we will be in Europe by 1970.  We cannot see Irish industry preparing to meet this situation.  Irish industry does not appear to be doing any of the things the adaptation councils were set up to do.</P>
    <P>The NIEC Report makes sad reading and the really sad reading must be for the employees who in recent months have been pulled around the country in election campaigns with <Col N="2372" /> promises of this, that and the other. It is because of our extreme uneasiness at the Government's inactivity and their frivolous actions that we have put down this motion.  As a Party, we have shown ourselves to be responsible; we have shown in relation to many of the measures the Government brought before us that we sought to achieve the good of the country by supporting them.  Long before the Presidential election was announced, we had decided to put this motion down and the election and its result had nothing to do with the motion.  This motion relates purely to the economic difficulties besetting the country, to the sad record of this Government in housing, in adaptation in industry.  We accuse the Government of not living up to their responsibilities, of flirting with their responsibilities, and we are not prepared to stand for that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>On the motion for the Adjournment, generally introduced by the Taoiseach, the whole range of Government policy, or lack of policy, comes under the observation of the House and must submit itself to the criticism of individual Members.  So far on behalf of the Government, the Taoiseach has spoken.  To support him he could have had 13 Ministers yesterday, today 14 Ministers and five or six Parliamentary Secretaries, with a very handsome quota of Corkmen, to open up in his defence.  So far in support of the Government, in support of their policies, all we have been asked to accept as an oratorical contribution has been the expectoration of malodorous political saliva from Deputy Corry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Corry never disappoints. He keeps to the low level to which he is accustomed, the level of personal insult and, above all, of seeking to establish what to the detriment of this country has long been the cherished aim of the Fianna Fáil Party, that when there is agricultural improvement or industrial progress due to individual or collective effort, they either collectively or at the level of individual Members in constituencies seek to claim credit for it.  That political philosophy <Col N="2373" /> has bedevilled our agricultural and industrial life for a long time.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry, in support of the Government, has proved one thing: he has proved that the aim of cashing in on whatever progress there might be through individual or collective private enterprise is still the aim of the Fianna Fáil Party, and particularly his.  He proved this to the hilt today in boasting about getting a factory for this, that and the other place in the various areas which have surprisingly returned him for many years. All he proved to me, at any rate, is that, as ever, he is nourishing his capacity to cash in on what is done by others and claim the credit for himself.  Permit me to say, by way of concluding my references to Deputy Corry's contribution, that I become more and more surprised when I think of the number of Cork Deputies supporting the Fianna Fáil Party who have to remain silent while this low level is thrust upon us in defence of the Taoiseach and the Government.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry, in a passing reference, felt obliged to cast aspersions on the labour content of the constituency I represent.  All I hope is that, when Deputy Cronin from a neighbouring constituency in County Cork goes to North Mayo again, as he has often done before, recruiting labour for the beet fields to supply the Mallow factory, these people will remember the aspersions cast upon them by Deputy Corry in this House today.  These are decent people.  These are specialists in this matter of beet growing and beet cultivation.  They learned it the hard way in the fields of British farmers, when the promises of Fianna Fáil perennially failed to keep them at home in the employment which was offered to them so often from the political platforms when their votes were being sought.</P>
    <P>I propose this evening to make the theme of my contribution on this debate the survival and revival of the West.  On the occasion of the last general election the Taoiseach came to my constituency and other constituencies in the west of Ireland and enunciated what he said was Fianna <Col N="2374" /> Fáil policy, and in the town of Ballina, on the Sunday prior to the election, supported by his candidates at that time, he said that the last major national problem confronting the country and the Government was the survival and revival of the West. By that, I take it he included the whole of the western coast from Donegal to west Cork.  He assured the people in my constituency at that time that the last major national problem&mdash;that was before the Presidential election when they had two other aims&mdash;was the survival of the West, and that it would occupy the Government at once on their return.</P>
    <P>He was supported in that view by the Minister for Agriculture who came to Belmullet and gave us a blueprint for prosperity which occupied virtually the whole of the front page of the <i>Western People</i> and, I am sure, of other Mayo and Galway newspapers.  In that blueprint everybody's woes and worries had been taken fully into consideration, on paper at any rate.  Their worries and their needs are still on that paper, and neither the Taoiseach nor the Minister for Agriculture has done anything significant to relieve the lot of the people there, to stem the flood of emigration or to provide adequate employment.</P>
    <P>Our population is decreasing.  More and more houses are becoming unoccupied. More and more land is becoming fallow through want of cultivation, through want of people to cultivate it.  While all this is going on, we hear of the wonderful workings of the Land Act that will change all that. Nothing that I can see has yet changed and nothing has happened to improve the lot of these people.  On the contrary, a very queer thing is happening in the west of Ireland at the moment and it is this.  The House will know, as indeed the country knows, that from that part of the country there has been, over very many years, an annual outflow of migratory workers.  That in itself at the beginning was not too bad a pattern, when it was seasonal, and when heads of families or the young men of families were not separated <Col N="2375" /> from their homesteads for too long.</P>
    <P>Each year these people came back, attended to their own particular sowing and came back again at harvest time and gathered it.  During that time, these men, and sometimes women, through their contributions pursuant to enactments brought in by the British Government of the day, earned for themselves contributory pensions at 65 years of age.  Then, having toiled for so long and having undergone the domestic difficulty of being separated from their families, they returned to settle down in the homestead, enjoying this pension from the British Government.</P>
    <P>Later on when they became entitled to incomes from our own Department of Social Welfare, the income from the British Government was taken into account as means.  Many times here I have pleaded with respective Ministers for Social Welfare not to take these incomes into account, on the simple argument that for 40 years and upwards this country has failed these people, and when, by their own efforts abroad, they make some provision for their old age in the land in which they cannot perpetually stay and earn a living all the year round, they find themselves punished by their own Government by having this taken into account.</P>
    <P>I think it was about last April when, through the negotiations between the Department of Social Welfare and the British Ministry of Pensions, the British decided to give pensioners in the Republic of Ireland the same rate of pension as those living in Great Britain. It was quite an achievement for our Department of Social Welfare to secure that.  But what happened?  Immediately upon the increase being given by the British, our social welfare officers scoured the country from Donegal to Cork taking up the Irish pension books, conducting further investigations and reducing the Irish pension by the amount by which the British pension was increased, and sometimes more, depending upon the particular evaluation by the social welfare officer.</P>
    <P>I do not think that is fair.  I do not <Col N="2376" /> think Deputies in the Fianna Fáil Party who come from the constituencies where this applies think it is fair either, but I want them to say so.  I do not want them to be tongue-tied behind a Minister who refuses to do anything about it.  It is their duty to speak, just as it is mine.  I am not doing it because I am in opposition; I am doing it because I am struck by the injustice and the unfairness of this method of assessment of means in these cases.  These are in areas which have been traditional supporters of this Government, areas where speakers seeking votes for the Government have trafficked in their innate patriotism. I hope that it is still not too late in the day for the Minister for Social Welfare and the members of this Government to change their attitude towards these people whose lot for so long has been so difficult and not to make it more difficult still for them in their old age in their own country.</P>
    <P>We were told, too, on the change in the system of assessment of means for unemployment assistance purposes, that the value of the produce of land would not be taken into account.  It is being taken into account and I have had occasion many times to take the matter up with the Department of Social Welfare when their officials are now insisting on returns from creameries being made available to them.  It was asserted by the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Social Welfare when this change was being made that these would not be taken into account.  In practice, the situation is quite different and I am sure that Deputy Calleary of my constituency has in his bag several letters of complaint of this kind but he will not come in here and say anything about them.</P>
    <P>Instead, he will engage in some hugger-mugger with the individuals concerned, making excuses for the Government, but he will not come out in the open and show that he is behind these people in their efforts to make life more comfortable for themselves.  From Donegal to West Cork, we had employment schemes under the headings of rural improvement, minor employment and bog <Col N="2377" /> development.  A change has also been effected there.  Bog development and minor employment schemes were the subject of free grants.  These have now been discontinued and all are incorporated under the general heading of rural improvement schemes where a substantial contribution by way of a percentage of the total cost has to be made by the people before any of this money can be sent.</P>
    <P>Not alone have these people not got that kind of money but it is necessary that the rutted, sandy roads into their farms, in many cases into their villages, should be kept in constant repair.  It is also necessary for the father of a growing family that there should be available to him the employment these schemes give.  The wages earned from that employment, however short the period, were the wages that were expended on paying what used to be the small rates, on buying in the Christmas stores and on providing clothing for the family.  Those were the only earnings available to supplement whatever profits these people made from the sale of their restricted agricultural produce.</P>
    <P>Not alone have these free schemes been cut and amalgamated but the total annual grant for them has been cut by half, thereby reducing further the volume of earnings and in consequence, reducing the ability of these people to provide the amenities to which they are entitled.  If we take just those few matters, it will be understood that this is the means which the Taoiseach and this Government are adopting in their effort to bring about the revival and the survival of the West. It does not matter how many brazen assertions are made or how many high hopes are held out for the future.</P>
    <P>Since I was a boy, I have listened to the great things that have been planned for the future of the West but nevertheless each year we are watching a declining population and more and more empty houses.  In our Gaeltacht areas in the past four years, the number of recipients of the £10 deontas for Irish-speaking children has been reduced by about 1,000, from about 9,000 to about 8,000.  That does not <Col N="2378" /> mean in itself that there is a decline in the number of Irish speakers but it does mean that the number of Irish speakers has declined through emigration and that the number of families in the Gaeltacht is not being maintained.</P>
    <P>We now have another situation which exemplifies what I am saying. We have the former Minister for Education, Deputy Colley, engaging in a bland campaign that schools were not being built because, on the one hand, he planned to build comprehensive schools, and on the other, because he was closing down the smaller schools.  The fact is that nothing was being done because the money was not there to do it, and Deputy Colley knew that.  He has now been enabled by the gimmick of the reshuffle in Government to be relieved of the obligations entered into by him with regard to the closing of the small schools and the building of comprehensive schools, the training of teachers and the replacement by Irish of English all over this country.  Now he has gone to Industry and Commerce. It is too soon to judge.</P>
    <P>From the realm of Health comes Deputy O'Malley who has promised more than any other Minister of this Government, with the exception of the Minister for Local Government, in his short time as Minister for Health.  He was photographed in many of the newspapers with the matron of this and that institution and with nurses here and there.  He promised the nurses shorter hours; he promised more hospitals and more pay for everybody. Apart from the appearance of these photographs in the papers, not another thing has happened.  Now he has gone into the realm of Education.</P>
    <P>Again, it is too soon to judge but permit me to say that we have our fears, not so much for educational planning but that education will now be made more and more the subject of political manoeuvring and that the Taoiseach and the Fianna Fáil Party are trying to find a way to do a rearguard action from one of the aims stated at the GPO prior to the Presidential election and, more recently, in <Col N="2379" /> Dublin Castle when the Fianna Fáil nominee, successful in the election, was being installed as President of the country.  We hope that the aim so stated by the President can be reconciled in the years to come with the speech of Deputy O'Malley in Trinity College not very long ago.</P>
    <P>Every Deputy's bag is full of letters seeking the payment of grants for houses from the Department of Local Government and the payment of supplementary grants from local authorities. This particularly applies in the case of Deputies from the congested areas.  The Department of Local Government, under the aegis of Deputy Blaney, say that there is no undue delay, but there is no payment.  Of course, the word &ldquo;delay&rdquo; prefaced by the word &ldquo;undue&rdquo; is a very relative term. One cannot be trucking in relative terms when people want money and are asking for the money to which they are entitled and to which they became entitled once sanction was given and the authorisation to pay was made on examination by the engineers.</P>
    <P>The provision of water schemes is falling far behind.  When we draw attention to the fact that towns are suffering by reason of no supply, or lack of adequate supply, or faulty supply because of an outdated system, we are told we must wait for the comprehensive regional water supply, all of which means, of course, that there is no money available for either the regional or the local schemes.  Such a situation obtains at this very moment in the town of Ballina.  I should like Deputy Calleary, who is the town engineer there and who calls himself the senior Deputy for the constituency of North Mayo, to come in here and make a plea for a water supply for the town which he claims to represent so strongly.  I am sure that if he does not do it here, he will do it elsewhere.  It is to be hoped that my public appeal, coupled with his private exhortation, will bring about the result which the people of the town of Ballina so badly need and so very much desire.</P>
    <P>I want to say a word or two in a <Col N="2380" /> general way about loans and credit restriction and their effects.  We were told recently either by the Taoiseach or the Minister for Finance, or both, that we were around the corner, that we were emerging from the slough of difficulty. These are phrases we have heard before.  There can be no doubt in anyone's mind that there is, and has been for a considerable time, a serious credit restriction, due to the fact that the banks have been told to cut down on loans for private enterprise so that the Government's needs can be accommodated. It must have come to a very bad pitch when banks, thus directed, have obviously failed to meet the Government's requirements.  The Govvernment have had to go to America for a loan, where it was refused, to Germany where a loan was procured at a considerable rate of interest.  In passing, let me say that they have got it from a country that I do not think had the luxury of a Second Programme for Economic Expansion.  Germany planned on the ashes of the last war and now we find them in a position to lend us £7 million, at appropriate interest.</P>
    <P>The Government got another loan from the Bank of Nova Scotia.  Where will it end?  The Minister for Finance told us that a further loan will be necessary.  This is only July.  This financial year runs until 31st March next.  If the revenue is not sufficiently buoyant in that time, the Government may have to look for much more than the Minister for Finance now considers necessary and we may, indeed, be faced with a third Budget.  Enough has been said about the Budget&mdash;the first one which came somewhat prematurely before the end of the last financial year, and then what is called the mini-Budget of recent times, a Budget which incorporates in it the idea of turnover tax at wholesale level which I understand from wholesalers will cause them considerably more expense in the administration of their affairs and a considerable volume of bookwork and the employment of people to do it.</P>
    <P>This Budget, of course, excludes some of the things for which definitions <Col N="2381" /> cannot be found, such as fur coats.  I always thought a definition could be found for a fur coat in the amount of money which was paid for it.  It should be possible for the Revenue Commissioners to classify a fur coat of whatever variety.  They are very good at classification.  They do things extremely well in that regard.  I do not accept for a moment that the Revenue Commissioners and their assistants are not able to find a definition for a fur coat.  During the Roscommon by-election the Minister for Justice said they were going to impose taxes on luxuries, including fur coats, cosmetics, and items of that kind.  Maybe we should not take it too seriously.  That was at a time before Deputy O'Malley was entrusted with the great responsibility of promising big for the Department of Health. Before that he had what was called by the Minister for Agriculture, at the request of the Taoiseach, a crash programme to drain the Shannon.  We have had a crash programme to drain the Shannon and the Shannon still flows high and over its banks.  We have had a crash programme for health by way of promise and out of the hot seat goes, as the <i>Irish Times</i> would say, young Mr. O'Malley.  Now he has moved into Education where we will have another crash programme, although in what direction the crash will take place, I would not care to venture a guess.</P>

      <P>Our national loans have reached an incredible sum and our national debt is around £720 million, the servicing of which costs over £50 million a year.  People who are encouraged to invest in national loans&mdash;and I say this generally&mdash;suffer a severe let-down as each year passes. Say a national loan is floated at five per cent and people put their money in at something like par.  The next year there is one at 5½ per cent, perhaps at 99 or 98, and down goes the previous one in value and, as each year passes, these loans go down in value as each succeeding one is offered with increased interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know some bodies that have invested in national loans to a considerable extent each time they come out as a matter of patriotic endeavour, and I applaud that endeavour, but one company that has been investing like that has told me that over the past four or five years they have lost nearly £45,000 through the depreciation that follows on increased offers.  That must be particularly difficult for people investing small earnings or money they have got if, for any reason, they have to cash their investments or sell them in an emergency.  This is something our finance experts should take into consideration and they should try to evolve some system whereby this resultant unfairness will not occur.  I am <Col N="2383" /> not blaming the Government for this. I am speaking generally on the point. All Governments have increased the interest payable on loans year by year but it is a trend that should be watched and about which we should take care.</P>
    <P>This Government have, for once, promised too much in the sense that we now have the beginning of a feeling among the people that they can no longer be trusted.  How that feeling of trust lasted so long is beyond comprehension. Promise is easy but performance is sometimes, though not always, difficult, but when you bring promise to the pitch of any kind of expediency, then performance becomes increasingly difficult and people are disillusioned, become pessimistic and worse still, cynical.  When they become cynical about their leaders or rulers, democracy is in peril.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has seen fit to attack the Press, the columnists and writers of newspaper articles generally.  From the Opposition point of view, that is a good sign, a sign that the Taoiseach is not happy with the situation.  When you are unhappy with your own situation, you attack others.  The predominant thing in all this&mdash;and I do not suppose the people will be silent about it until the historians come to write about it&mdash;is the strange fact that the Fianna Fáil Party claim a monopoly of patriotism at all times.  Nobody else has the right to express an opinion or think of doing something in any way different from what they say is the right way.  Each side in any discussion or argument has a point of view and it is very important that one side should admit the other has a point of view.  When we reach the stage of all being out of step but Johnny, we must look out for trouble.</P>
    <P>I think the Government, shuffle or no shuffle, will only be able to shuffle on from day to day, grasping expedient after expedient, because they have no plan, and no amount of committees, councils or commissions will solve their problem if they have not the capacity, the energy and ability to give directions from the top.  No amount of whitewashing by committees, councils or commissions can relieve the Government <Col N="2384" /> of their responsibility.  We hope the day is not too far distant when the people will be given an opportunity of relieving the Government, not of their responsibility&mdash;because they do not appear to have any&mdash;but of the opportunity to pursue a course of irresponsibility, without a plan, simply relying on expediency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is for the people to decide and fortunately they have decided.  Opposition speakers can recite a litany of difficulties through which the country is passing and can make capital out of that to slate the Government and it is all accepted, I assume, as part of the democratic process under which we work.  It is accepted by everybody that the country is and has been going through difficult times and that there is a period of financial stringency.  Many of those difficulties arose from reasons completely outside our control, such as the British levy and restrictions of credit in other countries.  If we are honest, however, we must admit that many of the difficulties we experience are caused by people in our own country.  I do not think it serves any useful purpose to try to apportion blame for the industrial unrest we have been experiencing in the recent past to employer or worker.  The system is probably wrong.  If the new Minister for Labour does nothing but persuade both sides of industry that a settlement must eventually be arrived at if the industry is to continue, and that it is much better to compromise and reach a settlement before strike action is taken and before a great deal of hardship is caused to individuals and often a great deal of damage is caused to the economy, then I think he will have done a good day's work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is easy to blame everything on the Government and to expect to get away with it but Deputies on the <Col N="2385" /> opposite side of the House who do that do not believe it themselves and we may be quite certain that the people outside do not believe it either.  Like most human beings, the Government make mistakes but they are certainly not making all the mistakes and they cannot be blamed for creating all the problems and difficulties that face us. Unfortunately, extravagant statements are commonplace in this Assembly.  We get used to hearing assertions that the country is &ldquo;bust&rdquo;, that the country is broke, that we have not the price of a wheelbarrow, and so on, which may make some performances in this House rival those to be seen at the Cork Opera House or at the Abbey Theatre.  Nevertheless, it does not do us much credit or serve any useful purpose.</P>
    <P>Like most people in public life, I have an interest in housing.  Because we cannot get all the money we now need, we are told that the country is broke.  In 1960-61, we spent £9½ million on housing; in 1962-63, £11 million; in 1963-64, a little more than £11 million; in 1964-65, £15 million; in 1965-66, £20 million and this year, £21.8 million.  I am not saying all that because I feel the money should not be spent&mdash;far from it&mdash;but obviously nobody can justly accuse the country of being broke while that kind of money is being put into housing.</P>
    <P>Practically every Department of State is getting more money now than it got in those years which Deputy Corish cited this morning as fairly good years&mdash;1962, 1963 and 1964.  I think you will find that much more money is being spent on various services now than was spent in those years because the people demand a higher standard of living, and rightly so. People demand better housing accommodation, better hospitalisation, better medical facilities, and so on, and it all costs money.  It is a fact that we have not got enough money for our needs and we are certainly far from being broke and we are certainly a very creditworthy nation.</P>
    <P>For a time, last night, I listened to one of the Labour Deputies who said he was speaking not only for his Party <Col N="2386" /> but on behalf of trade unionists and their fear of what may happen under the Free Trade Agreement with Britain.  He painted a very doleful picture of the future.  I do not for a moment admit that the Labour Party have any more right to speak for trade unionists than the members of my Party.  Generally speaking, we get at least as much support from trade unionists as any Party in the House and therefore I do not accept what he said.</P>
    <P>I do not find that trade unionists are in any way afraid of competition, when and if it comes, from across the water.  They are quite prepared to match their skill, if they get proper conditions and proper equipment, with anything that comes from across the water.  Instead of undermining the confidence of our workers and, through them, of our industrialists, we should do the opposite and point out that they have proved themselves, at home and abroad, as good workers as can be found in any country.  Given the proper conditions, they can face any competition.  I should consider it a poor reflection on us if what I say is not the truth.</P>
    <P>I do not indulge in personalities but I deplore the personal attacks on a Minister in this House during the past few weeks.  It is a peculiar thing that people who shout loudest for more State control of industry are also loudest in their criticism of Ministers in charge of those Departments.  Nobody in private industry would have to suffer what the Minister in charge of a State concern has to suffer from the members of this House.  There should be some other way of rectifying any faults, if faults there be, in that industry rather than have the disedifying scenes we witnessed.</P>

      <P>I should be very sympathetically inclined towards a solution of that kind.  No credit was given in my hearing during all that time to the taking over of the British and Irish Steampacket Company, Limited.  We were told about the losses it sustained but, during the recent seamen's strike in Britain, we should have been in a very bad way, infinitely worse off than we were, but for the foresight of that Department in acquiring that company.</P>
      <P>I hear many criticisms of the Verolme Dockyard and of the B and I Steampacket, Company Limited.  We cannot have it both ways.  The Verolme Dockyard and Irish Steel Holdings Limited, employ at least 800 men each. Is it not better to subsidise an industry to a certain extent and to keep the men in Ireland than to bemoan the fact that we are sending people on the emigrant ship, as Deputies opposite like to do?  I should be prepared to keep people at home and, if necessary, to subsidise the industry to a great extent to keep them employed in their own country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have heard about the good years. I am long enough in this House to know that, whether they are good years or bad years, we hear much the same criticism and much the same speeches from the opposite benches.  I regard that as a part of the system under which we work.  It is a good democratic pastime to use this House as a safety valve to get that sort of thing off one's chest.  I have no reason to worry about it.  If I had the gift of prophecy.  I would prophesy that Fianna Fáil will weather this storm. Already the clouds are beginning to break.  When we come in here after the next general election, Fianna Fáil having been returned to power once more, we will have the same people making the same speeches as they have made throughout the past ten years, alleging that Fianna Fáil have fooled the people and were returned under <Col N="2388" /> false pretences.  That is the poorest possible reflection on the intelligence of the Irish electorate because you cannot fool the people all the time.</P>
    <P>The fact is Fianna Fáil have had the confidence of the people on so many occasions because the people feel they can trust Fianna Fáil and, even if there is a difficult period, there is not the slightest doubt in the minds of the vast majority that Fianna Fáil will weather it and the country will climb to even greater heights, greater heights than it achieved up to a little over 12 months ago.  This motion of no confidence is a political gesture made at this time every year.  It is a motion nobody expects to see taken further than the precincts of this House.</P>

      <P>I was somewhat amused at the surprise expressed by Deputy Healy over the criticism levelled at the Government because of the economic state of the country. Surely the criticism levelled at the Government in office in 1956 was of the same character as that levelled at the Government today and, if that criticism was warranted then, it is equally warranted now.  The Opposition Parties and the people are entitled to criticise both the Government and the state of the economy.  The Government are there to govern and we, in the Labour Party, in tabling this motion of no confidence earnestly believe, and are confident in that belief, that we are expressing the viewpoint of the vast majority of the breadwinners, the housewives, the potential breadwinners, the boys and girls leaving school, the social welfare recipients, and all those other categories who are worried because the type of society they were promised has never been realised under a Fianna Fail Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We lay special emphasis on housing and all the statistics quoted here this evening by Deputy Healy are no consolation to the people of Mid-Cork and elsewhere who are living in appalling housing conditions.  Over the past few months, I have visited a number of houses.  It is a miracle that they have remained standing at all for the <Col N="2389" /> past three or four years.  It is doubtful if they will withstand the coming winter.  The inhabitants of these houses have been told by Cork County Council that there is no possibility whatever of having these houses replaced this year.  They are held up for one reason, and one reason only, lack of money and it is very hard to expect people living in the conditions in which these people are living to have confidence in a Government they regard as responsible for their situation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry was quite glad to find so many people needing houses. Indeed, that sentiment has been expressed by many Government speakers. They maintain this is a sign of prosperity. Some of those I know seeking houses are, in fact, not employed at all.  They are widows with large families, old people and social welfare recipients.  Their housing needs are not an indication of increased prosperity. What these people want to know now is when houses will be built for them.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, speaking here this morning, said:</P>
    <P>...the Government are also considering the feasibility of relaxing in some degree the limitations on the capital programme which were unavoidable earlier in the year....</P>
    <P>I do not know what exactly the Taoiseach intends to convey by that sentence.  I do not know if he means to convey that more money will now be made available, or made available before next winter, for the housebuilding programme so that houses will be provided for those who need them so badly.  That is what the people want to know and, until they are told, they will have no confidence in this Government.</P>
    <P>They also want to know when this promised health plan will be implemented. The promised plan raised their hopes considerably.  It is difficult to blame them if they are now becoming a little doubtful about the plan.  People are naturally inclined to ask from where will the money come.  They have become so used to having no money made available for promised projects <Col N="2390" /> that they are a bit doubtful about the health plan being put into operation. We hope they are wrong in that and that it will be put into operation earlier than any of us think.</P>
    <P>Rural Deputies, in particular, will agree that we have a big problem in relation to water and sewerage extensions. Those of us in county councils have throughout the past year or two tabled many motions for extensions of existing schemes.  Hopes were generally raised that regional water schemes would be supplied in different areas.  Local authorities have all been told this year that such schemes cannot be proceeded with.  In the southern area of Cork County Council, we find we are £51,000 short of what we need to meet the commitments we have undertaken and people want to know what the prospects are for the future.  Promises will not satisfy them; neither will the statement that we are over the worst, that we have turned the corner and that the economy will right itself if we all tighten our belts. They are growing more and more dubious of the ability of this Government to rescue the country from the morass in which it is.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach spoke today, too, about the decision of his Government to give priority to education.  What the parents of schoolchildren in my constituency will ask themselves, when they read that statement is: &ldquo;Will the dilapidated, unfit school to which my children are going now be replaced? We were told earlier this year that there was no prospect of replacement because the school does not appear on the Department's priority list.  Are the Government now going to relax the limitations on the capital programme and does that mean that there is some prospect of our school being built?&rdquo; That is what the people want to know. They do not want generalisations that everything will be all right in a year or two.  They want facts and they want them now.</P>
    <P>Is the Taoiseach's statement that education is to receive priority consistent with a circular which vocational committees received recently from the Department, asking them, for the first <Col N="2391" /> time ever, to balance their books this year?  They are asked to increase school fees, regardless of the fact that this may place education outside the financial competence of many parents. If they do not increase the fees, they are asked to cut back on educational equipment, regardless of the fact that this may be detrimental to technical education.  This is the first time we find education treated as an economic rather than a social issue.  It is rather extraordinary that, on the one hand, we have the Taoiseach stating that education will get priority and, on the other hand, the Department asking that fees be increased or equipment not installed. Up to this everybody has looked on education as a social issue. Now, vocational committees are being asked to pay their way, to balance their books, and, when schemes are sent for sanction, sanction is given with the proviso that the books are balanced.  I hope the Taoiseach's statement this morning is an indication that that kind of thinking will not continue in the field of education.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach spoke also of the Government's role in increasing the earning capacity of the people.  We have heard a great deal about investment in education and about the lack of technical training and the shortage of technicians.  Surely, if this situation is to be rectified, it cannot be reconciled with the circular issued to committees instructing them that fees must be increased or that equipment must not be installed if its installation is likely to cost the State more money?</P>
    <P>Our redundant workers and our boys and girls leaving school are asking at the moment what the Government are doing about them.  Many of our emigrants left this country convinced that their stay would be a short one.  They were led to believe by the Government that employment would be freely available for them all in their own country within a short time, but the employment position today is worse than it was when they left.  They and our boys and girls leaving school cannot be blamed for their lack of <Col N="2392" /> confidence in the Government.  We cannot have confidence in a Government who have so dismally failed to keep their promises in this regard.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish stated this morning that the Government must take positive steps to create new employment. That is a reason for our no confidence motion.  He stated that he believed private enterprise had failed this country and that the time had come for the State to take over.  That is our Policy as a Party.  The State must intervene if justice is to be done to the section of the community to which I have referred.  I was amused to hear Deputy Corry&mdash;maybe what he says is true but I am sure Deputy McAuliffe knows more about it than I do&mdash;say a few months ago that he had seen to it that there was full employment in his constituency.  He said the industries there were based, as they should be, on agricultural raw materials.  He said they had to import some labour from Galway and Mayo. I would suggest to Deputy Corry that if this is the position in East Cork, although I doubt it, he might influence his Government to come along to the neighbouring constituency of Mid-Cork and set up one or two or more of these industries there.  Some efforts have been made over the past few years to establish industries of this nature but unfortunately none has succeeded. I hope Deputy Corry will do in his spare time for Mid-Cork what he has accomplished in his own constituency.</P>
    <P>This morning the Taoiseach touched on the subject of an incomes policy. How can the ordinary man or woman, or indeed the ordinary Deputy, know what he means by an incomes policy or if he is sincere at all about his plan for it?  Speaking at Mullingar in the Spring of 1965 the Taoiseach said that this incomes policy could not be worked except in Communist countries.  Yet in October of the same year he said it could be worked by consultation and by agreement.  We would like to know more about it.  We agree an incomes policy is necessary. A minimum income is necessary but it is not enjoyed by a large number of <Col N="2393" /> our workers today.  We do not know what he has in mind in regard to this.</P>

      <P>During this year some workers have already got, and others will get, an increase of £1 per week in their wages.  Female workers will get only 15/-.  I feel very strongly on this but I do not suppose this is the place to pursue that at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EileenDesmond" hpid="Mrs. Desmond Mrs. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall come back to the question of the breadwinners who got £1 per week increase.  For some people living on the outskirts of Cork city this £1 has already been absorbed.  The parents there send their children to school on the buses to Cork city each day.  The bus fare cost a child 4d per trip prior to the increase. That meant ¼d per day.  That has now been doubled.  I do not know how CIE work it out but it is now 2/8d. That represents an increase of 6/8d per week per child.  For parents with three children, that works out at exactly £1 per week.  Therefore, the increase of £1 has been completely absorbed for vast numbers of these workers.  We are told prices have been controlled.  They have to some extent. However, we know that following increased taxation on petrol, road tax and transport over the past two months, prices will rise again.  The cost of household commodities and utensils will rise in the near future due to purchase tax.  We know that house prices will rise because of the increase in the cost of building materials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We hear a great deal from the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance about the need for a redistribution of the national wealth.  The people I am speaking of cannot be expected to take that seriously with the burden of taxation imposed on the essential items of food of the lowest paid worker. These people with three children living on the outskirts of Cork city cannot possibly cope with increased prices. Their last state will certainly be worse than their first.  So will the state of <Col N="2394" /> social welfare recipients.  We know social welfare is a tremendous drain on our economy, with a proportionately small working population.  At present there is a group of social welfare recipients who are expressing very unpatriotic sentiments.  Their Irish pensions have been reduced because their British pensions have been increased.  It is a pity that people should be forced to make the statements these people are understandably making.  The system of means test with regard to social welfare recipients must be relaxed if fair play is to be done.</P>
    <P>There has been a great deal of talk recently about the place of agriculture in the economy.  This is particularly so since the introduction of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement in which so much emphasis has been placed on agriculture.  That is only right.  As we stated at the time, industry will have some difficulty competing, and in some cases surviving, in terms of free trade.  If the effects are not felt this year, they will be felt next year and the years after.  Therefore, we are more than ever dependent on agriculture to tide us over the transitional period.</P>
    <P>There is one aspect of agriculture to which I should like to refer.  There is one effort I feel the Government have not made which would encourage farmers to increase production as they have been exhorted to do, that is, land drainage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="EileenDesmond" hpid="Mrs. Desmond Mrs. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Down in our county, ever since my arrival on Cork County Council, we have had a number of deputations of landowners living along the banks of our rivers. We have listened to and been impressed by the cases they made.  We have contacted the Board of Works and, strangely enough, we find their place in the priority list is exactly the same as several years ago.  They never seem to move up.  We requested that a deputation be received in connection with this in an effort to speed up the drainage of the land in which we are interested.  We are told, as always, by <Col N="2395" /> the Minister for Local Government when we request him to receive a deputation, that it could serve no useful purpose.  I do not know how these farmers who live along the river and who are expected to increase production, whose lands are under water year after year and who see no hope of their being drained in the foreseeable future, can be expected to have confidence in the Government, especially when the scheme to have their lands drained never seems to move up on the list.</P>
      <P>I do not see how the ESB workers can continue to have confidence in a Government which takes away the rights which they have always enjoyed, to withdraw their labour.  I do not know how any group of workers, knowing that this could be applied to them in the morning if the Government felt like it, could continue to have confidence in the type of Government we have, with so few of the targets in the Second Programme for Economic Expansion being reached and with no likelihood of the promises now being made being carried out in the foreseeable future.</P>
      <P>Day after day the Taoiseach and his Ministers refer to the type of society they are working for, without taking any of the necessary practical steps to make that society a reality.  With so much hardship being allowed to continue, and being allowed to increase for some of the lower-paid sections, we believe that the Government no longer enjoy the confidence of Dáil Éireann. We are certain they no longer enjoy the confidence of the people whom they continue to govern.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach recently, apparently in jest but, I suspect, substantially in earnest, jeered at a recent address which I gave to this House, because in reference to industrial relations, I stressed the importance of the fundamentals&mdash;the fundamentals in industrial relations being the human relationships which exist between employers and employees.  In the course of the Taoiseach's reply, he appeared to make little of the virtue of love, suggesting that I had gone so far <Col N="2396" /> as to say that God is love.  I am prepared to concede, as the Taoiseach has a sense of humour, that he was overstressing the points I made, but I do think it is important that we should appreciate the intrinsic value and virtue of love, love of one's God, of one's fellow man and love of one's nation.  The tragic thing in this country is that the exercise of patriotism has become very rare because the Fianna Fáil Party under the Taoiseach have indicated to the people that patriotism should never be exercised unless one is sure a temporal reward is available because of the exercise of it.</P>

      <P>So it is that people are not prepared to make the sacrifices which once they felt it easy to make. Now, before any task is done, they want to know the price, the reward, and they want to know what they are going to get out of it.  There are very few tasks that this Government perform for which there is not some ulterior motive, or which for them there is not a good, calculated chance that they are going to profit substantially out of it, if not politically, then personally.  All this&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>All this obliges me out of love of my fellow countrymen to make them aware of the dangerous trends and to make them aware of the fact that the Irish soul is being destroyed and damaged because of this new greed, the greed which is the philosophy of Fianna Fáil, because it is primarily the personal philosophy of the Taoiseach and most members of the Government.  They have polluted and soiled many streams of national activity, cultural, agricultural and industrial.  They have polluted them with their philosophy, greed for their personal gain.  Combined with this, they have approached the problems of the nation and the people with an outrageous arrogance which is greater than the imperialism which was once the burden of this country when the Union Jack flew here.  We now <Col N="2397" /> have a new imperialism under the badge of Fianna Fáil.</P>
      <P>There may be members who feel that I am stressing it too much but I feel that when we have a Government activated solely by their own greed for power, a Government who allow that philosophy to percolate down to the humblest people in the land, then we have become the slaves of a new tyranny, the tyranny of Fianna Fáil. As I said this tyranny and this philosophy are combined.  Last year I had to condemn the Taoiseach because he had personally addressed an appeal for subscriptions for the Fianna Fáil Party to many senior civil servants. That was for the last general election for which he sought funds for the Fianna Fáil Party and he asked that the subscriptions be sent to him personally and he undertook not to publish the list of names.  He did not, of course, undertake not to keep it.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of the recent electoral contest, the Presidential election, this piece of contemptible and deplorable arrogance was again repeated by the Taoiseach who sent out appeals for funds, not to industrialists alone, not to the rich and wealthy, not to the people of independent means, but once again to senior civil servants in their offices.  They were addressed not alone by their own names but also according to their rank and title in the State service.  Just what can we as an Opposition and as an essential political Party do to warn the people of the inevitable consequences of a trend of that kind?  How can we have independent civil servants, public servants with integrity, when they feel that the consequences of their declining to send a personal subscription to the Taoiseach will be to deprive themselves of a fair promotion according to their ability?  How can the most able civil servant who is entirely inspired by principles, not have regard to the fact that his own fortunes and the fortunes of his wife and family can be jeopardised unless he sends along a subscription to Seán Uasal Lemass?</P>

      <P>It might be said that we should press for the publication of the names of the people who subscribed to the Fianna Fáil Party but that is not necessary.  Instead, all one need do is stand at the gate of Dublin Castle whenever the Taoiseach throws a reception there.  Then you will see going along the ill-bred and ill-mannered people of so many Fianna Fáil cumainn and many of the people who have taken out their cheque books and sent funds to the Fianna Fáil Party.  At a recent jamboree, at which the Taoiseach was the nominal host, spending the taxpayers' money, there were three times as many people present as were present on a similar occasion in 1952.  There were twice as many people present as there were present in 1959.  One wonders where the extra thousands have come from since 1959?  People with some knowledge of the rank and file members of the Fianna Fáil Party saw there, in so far as it was possible to see anybody, because of the vast multitude that were shouldering one another in the place, 27 chairmen and 19 secretaries of Fianna Fáil cumainn and their spouses, five members of the headquarters staff of Fianna Fáil, two members of the employees of the Fianna Fáil Party, who were seen with shears cutting down the posters of Deputy Tom O'Higgins, who was the opponent of the Fianna Fáil candidate. Also seen and heard there was a <Col N="2399" /> gentleman who admitted that, although he hated their guts, he had subscribed £100 to their funds.</P>

Now we have a new brand of contemptible citizens.  We have the Castle-following crowd, those who want to be seen there, those people who have to be rewarded for the services given to the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
      <P>I was present earlier this year at my one and only jamboree of that kind because I have no particular appetite for such functions.  I went to the one which was thrown to commemorate and honour the survivors of 1916.  My heart went out to the unfortunate septuagenarians and octogenarians, people who quite obviously were seriously disabled in the autumn of their days, and people who were very feeble and unable to get a chair.  They were pushed and thrown everywhere between the many thousand members of the Fianna Fáil cumainn, who were being rewarded for their menial services, by being brought along, to be wined, dined and intoxicated at public expense.  What a contemptible way to honour those brave men who sacrificed so much that Ireland might be free.  Is it any wonder that many of them wondered if it was worth while when they had to witness such a contemptible performance to honour them after 50 years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This thing is very wrong.  It is entirely wrong that State functions of that kind should be graced by people who are in public service or, because of the rank they hold in the Fianna <Col N="2400" /> Fáil Party, have to be rewarded for the services they have given as officers of Fianna Fáil cumainn and comhairlí ceanntair, their directors and their various hierarchy.  That is entirely wrong.  If they want to do that, let them do it at the expense of the Fianna Fáil Party.  If the Fianna Fáil Presidential candidate wants to do that, let him do it at his own expense on the green lawn of Arus an Uachtaráin rather than in Dublin Castle at the expense of the taxpayers.</P>

      <P>Those things count as far as the Fianna Fáil Party are concerned. It is their helpers and subscribers who must be rewarded.  Those are the important people and not the survivors of our fight for freedom.  It is not those who on merit alone deserve to be there who are invited but those other people because of the jobs they hold.  A symbol of the sickness and the decay of this country stands at the foot of the lower yard in the Castle. There is a building there which was evacuated 15 years ago because it was dangerous and unfit to house people. We were told even five years ago that this building was to be demolished three years ago.  The paint on that particular building was peeling off like huge white horses on a stormy sea. Although the paint was peeling off that building, it was not doing people any particular harm.  Then, just before the jamboree, one had the rather amusing sight of gentlemen up on ladders with garden houses knocking off the peeling waves of decayed paint and plaster.  This was followed by putting on one coat of paint to impress, according to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, the distinguished guests attending the Presidential inauguration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The interesting thing is that the distinguished guests, as distinct from the not so distinguished members of the Fianna Fáil organisation, had no occasion to go into the Lower Castle Yard at all.  I was amused yesterday morning to read that one of our most <Col N="2401" /> skilled and able journalists suggested that remarks of mine about this referred to eminent clerics in the rank of members of the Fianna Fáil Party. Of course, one must be punctilious about this.  The two eminent clerics had no occasion to go, and did not go, into the Lower Castle Yard.  That was reserved for the lesser folk who drove their own cars and had to park them there.  The eminent people referred to, and the other distinguished guests at ambassadorial level, went in by the Upper Yard so they never saw the symbol of the decayed building in the Lower Castle Yard that has now had a fresh coat of paint put on it. This only impressed those who came along at the behest of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    <P>This is not being said lightly by me; it is not being said just to have a go at the Government.  I have not said all of this to hit back at the Taoiseach or anybody else.  I want to say that this underlines the rottenness of the moral fibre of this country which has been damaged almost beyond repair by the activities during the past decade of the Fianna Fáil Government, without going back any farther than that.  We think it essential that the people become aware of the horrid nature of those activities and being aware of them, that they will do something to put an end to what is happening.  We have the Castle crawthumper, the member of the Fianna Fáil Party who demands that he be rewarded for his services by an invitation to the Castle, and I feel that people will reject that type of activity.</P>
    <P>We in Dublin are proud of the fact that the people have at long last in Dublin become conscious of the arrogance of the Fianna Fáil Party.  We think that the recent tremendous vote against Fianna Fáil in Dublin is not only a condemnation of their economic policies, social policies, or lack of them, but is also a condemnation of their arrogance and lack of patriotism; but the people in Dublin for a long time seemed to be inadequately concerned about the fact that tens of thousands of their neighbours were not properly housed.  When I saw the vote which the Fianna Fáil Party <Col N="2402" /> secured in the last general election in Dublin, just a short 18 months ago, I was disappointed, not because of the insufficient number of votes which my Party achieved on that occasion, but because it seemed to indicate a frame of mind on the part of Dublin people who were well housed, who were fortunate, that they could not care less about the less fortunate amongst them. But, I do feel that the people of this country at long last realise that there are in Dublin 10,000 families who urgently require decent houses.  They have not got them and cannot get them and cannot hope to get them in the present housing output for at least ten years.</P>
    <P>This makes no allowance for all those as yet uncreated and unestablished families, unborn children, who will come into the housing market in the years ahead.  We regret the Government have not taken steps over the years to watch the marriage figures, to watch the figures for births.  Those figures are readily available to the Government through the Central Statistics Office.  They are collected through the registry of births, deaths and marriages and also through the workings of the Department of Social Welfare, and the work of this Department and the information collected shows that over the past decade the number of marriages has been increasing, the number of early marriages has been increasing and, consequently, the number of births is increasing and the increasing demand for housing is multiplied, but the Government have failed to make any provision whatsoever for any of those additional burdens which are inevitable and they certainly have not allowed for them in their White Paper on housing requirements.</P>
    <P>That is bad enough, but what is worse still is that they have not even yet bothered to tackle the problems which are so obvious.  There are 10,000 families in need of houses and we are told in this House and elsewhere that there are not 10,000 but only 5,000 families in Dublin who require to be urgently housed.  The situation is that of the 10,000 families, 5,000 are so <Col N="2403" /> critically in need of housing that the chief medical officer says there is a medical need for them to be rehoused, an urgent compelling medical need to have them rehoused.  One can appreciate how low he sets the standard when there has been no building, no basement room, no attic room, no room with insufficient light or full of dampness or with fungus on the wall, condemned as unfit for human habitation since June 1963.</P>
    <P>In Dublin, so considerable is the housing problem that the public authority, through the Department of Local Government and through the Government and the influences they exert on the local authority, do not want to acknowledge that the appalling housing situation is any worse than they are forced, by the number of applications, to accept.  But, prior to this stoppage of condemnation as being unfit for human habitation, Dublin had on average 300 houses annually condemned as unfit for human habitation because they were damp or because of an insufficiency of light, because of rotten floor boards, or because of the fact that they were generally just decayed.  But the only condemnation there has been in Dublin in the past three years is in respect of houses that were in danger of imminent collapse, that is to say, the walls were going to fall out or in, and there was danger of a catastrophe through the forces of the laws of gravity.</P>
    <P>The kind of appalling conditions that would lead a farmer to be prosecuted if he had those conditions for his animals are being tolerated in this city and throughout the country because the Government do not wish to accept that the housing conditions are any worse than the figures given. We have the tomfoolery which followed the Ballymun scheme.  We were promised houses there almost a year ago.  Then we were told that was excessive enthusiasm and the first house would not be available until last December when Dublin was to get a Christmas gift of 20 houses or more and a house per day in Ballymun thereafter.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2404" /> Now, Sir, we are in July and there is not as much as a square foot in Ballymun that has been handed over to be occupied by the 700 families of five and more in one room crying to be housed in Dublin, not to mention the thousands of families of four in one room and many other people who urgently need houses.</P>

We gave the project our blessing when it was first proposed because we felt that if instead of these buffooneries, there was to be some house building in the traditional way, it would at least relieve some hundreds of families.  But we are told by Deputy Moore that the houses are there and he expects us to thank them for that.  I hope the 700 families of five in one room tonight will be glad to hear from Deputy Moore that the houses are there for the past six months but they cannot be let into them. It is strange to say that people should be grateful because they have houses there for them but they will not be let into them.  That only makes matters worse.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is entirely wrong, and he knows it.  The figures for emigration of Dublin Corporation tenants were high in 1959-60 when yourselves were in power.  Today your greatest contribution towards the relief of the housing crisis in Dublin is not the provision of houses but the emigration of fathers, mothers and children who have no hope of getting houses and who are obliged, because of that, to go, even when they are in jobs, to fly from the misery of the appalling housing conditions, or bad health itself.  Their daily experience, as long as they live, has been not alone five in one room but sometimes 13, 15, 18 and, yes, 20 in a house which was only intended for five or six people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have built all around the perimeter of our city and these houses, as Deputies will know, are occupied by two, three, and even four families and, because they do not comply with the Fianna Fáil priority of statistics of five in the family of the applicant they have no prospect of being housed this year.  God knows <Col N="2407" /> when they will ever have a chance of being housed.  If you have any more children to comply with the Fianna Fáil requirements, you will be overcrowded. Mothers are suffering serious ill-health, physically and mentally, but all these things are not measurable according to the pitiable priorities we now have, that you must be able to establish five people per room in the family of the person applying.  Even when you can establish that, you will probably have a fourth or fifth child before you can even get a house.</P>
    <P>I have no wish to dwell upon the misfortunes of our fellow citizens but when I come up against the smug complacency of those who say that people should not complain&mdash;Fine Gael should not complain, Labour have no right to complain because there are houses there, but they will not be given out&mdash;I cannot refrain from doing so.  I think it is time to expose the callousness of people who speak in that way.  But, why?  Because they are full of defects.  Houses which were built six months ago cannot be given out because there are defects in them.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Paddy Burke fell into a hole but he was lucky enough to be dragged out.  This is simply not good enough.  We had about three years ago a great deal of clamouring and excitement, the kind of thing we will have again in view of recent <Col N="2408" /> changes in the Department of Education. But we will just test how valuable is the excitement you hear about today in the Department of Education. We were told that 66 per cent of the cost of providing new secondary schools was to be paid for by a benevolent Fianna Fáil administration. We learned this week, from that tremendous democratic weapon, that not as much as one brass farthing has been paid in respect of any new secondary school, not as much as a farthing has been paid.</P>
      <P>We found out today that it takes the Department of Education up to two years to process an application before any sanction is given, and the consequence of all this has been that a large number of secondary school authorities who proposed, out of their own resources in 1964, to build new secondary schools were tempted by the carrot which Fianna Fáil put before them to postpone the operation of their plans until they got sanction from the Government so that the Government would share the burden of repaying the capital they borrowed and upon which they had to pay interest.</P>
      <P>Now we see the purpose of this. When these promises were made in the summer of 1964, the Government knew then, as any person with reasonable understanding of economics knew then, that we were slipping down a slope towards a severe restriction in credit and they enticed all those secondary school authorities to postpone their building plans until they had gone into the Fianna Fáil web.  Once they got them there, they would not be allowed out of the web until credit restrictions made it impossible for them to get the loans they could have got in the summer of 1964, The result is that all over this city urgently needed secondary schools have not gone up in the past two years, which would have gone up if Fianna Fáil had not held out this carrot.  Although they held out this carrot, nobody has, as yet, got a nibbling of it, a smell of it, or even a sight of it, because nothing whatsoever has been paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those who, out of sheer desperation, decided to get loans to build, pending the availability of the Govearnment <Col N="2409" /> money, now find themselves with colossal bills of interest to pay and no assistance from the Government towards meeting them.  In the meantime the cost of building these schools has risen by ten to 15 per cent and the Government, with typical Fianna Fáil munificence and generosity, have insisted that not only should the classrooms which are urgently needed be built but that ancillary facilities which are not essential should also be built for children who will need secondary education during the next four or five years.  I believe that kind of activity is contemptible.</P>
    <P>Now the great promiser of all kinds of things has gone to the Department of Education.  Promises have been made by people who are inclined to be reckless and that is how they will be broken in the future.  We will know little by little but we know from past experience that very little will be achieved.  We have seen what is happening in matters of health.  During the past general election, under pressure from Fine Gael, the Taoiseach said something which gained the headlines of the newspapers, not only the <i>Irish Press.</i></P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said he hoped it would be possible to prepare a social programme on the lines of the economic programme and that he proposed to do so, if returned to power.  What has happened is that we got no programme so far as an extension of social assistance or social welfare is concerned&mdash;none whatsoever, although they are there for the past 18 months.  We did get this document in relation to the health services in which something like 40 per cent of the improvements which Fine Gael would give within months of being returned to power were promised in three or four years time.  Before the great promiser had any opportunity three or four years' time.  Before the his lack of performance, he was shifted to a safer stage.</P>
    <P>All this must be considered in the light of the tax situation which is now 50 per cent worse than what was <Col N="2410" /> forecast by the Government's prophets. The burden of taxation is now 50 per cent higher than it was supposed to be in this great programme, and although it is 50 per cent higher, our rate of expansion is less than half of what it was promised it would be. We are not to be put off.  The great optimist, the Taoiseach, says that because we held back at the beginning of the race, because we did not run as fast as we could or should have, we will have to put on an extra spurt in the closing stages.  That is all very well, but when we see that it is the intention of the same coach to remain in control until the end of the race, we cannot see any real prospect of improving our rate of growth over the next four years.  The result will be that while we are going further and further down the field, the rest of Europe which we had hoped to accompany across the tape at the end of the race will be several miles ahead of us.</P>
    <P>This simply is not good enough.  The nation cannot afford it.  Because of that, we in Fine Gael and our colleagues in the Labour Party are confident that, although the Fianna Fáil Party, aware of their dwindling political fortunes will not accept our motions of no confidence, once the people get an opportunity, they will say in as clear a voice as that in which it was said in Dublin, Cork and other urban centres recently, that they have no confidence in the present Administration.  One wonders why it is that there appears to be such a clash between the urban areas and the rural areas at present so far as political awareness is concerned.  The reason is probably perfectly simple.  It is that in many parts of rural Ireland the people are on subsistence level.  Their ambition and their prospects have been stultified through the maladministration of the Fianna Fáil Party.  They have never known better days and they have little to look forward to I suppose blessed is he whose ambition and whose hunger is not too great.  The result is that they are not as acutely aware of the failure of the Fianna Fáil Party as are the people in other parts of the country who respond immediately&mdash;&mdash;</P>

We are quite certain from recent events that the thought processes of these people are in operation again, that the light is shining, and that it is only a matter of time until the Irish conscience, the Irish mind, the Irish economy and outlook for the future will be purged of all the lassitude, indifference and greed which polluted it, and we can look forward to a better Ireland under the leadership of a man of intelligence, a man of ability, a man of new enthusiasms and new outlook, Deputy Cosgrave.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2413" /> The picture facing us in Dublin this year is not too pleasant.  The number of houses completed in the period from 1st April to 31st October last year was 644: this year the number is 449.  The number of men employed on housing, housing development work and allied occupations in Dublin city last year was 2,199: this year the number is 1,854.  Bear in mind also the fact that last year's figure represented a 50 per cent reduction on the employment in 1951.</P>
    <P>Bear in mind also that Deputy Larkin said that in this House on 6th December, 1956.  Earlier, Deputy Larkin had this to say about the Dublin Corporation's housing programme:</P>
    <P>The first step required the cutting out of the new contract for the Finglas area.  That has been approved by the Minister, but now we will have to tell the contractor: &ldquo;Sorry, we cannot continue with this contract now.&rdquo;  That involved a reduction of £61,000 in the estimate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">

    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Larkin went on:</P>
      <P>The next was in reference to the direct housing scheme for the Finglas area.  That scheme was not to be proceeded with either.  It was also suggested that there should be a gradual diminution in employment on direct housing schemes and a gradual laying-off of the workers concerned.</P>
      <P>So the position was not so good when the other gang were in office.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall tell about Ballymun, a scheme which Fine Gael and Labour try to decry.  When the scheme was introduced in the corporation, the Fine Gael and Labour members accepted it.  They said the scheme was a very good idea.  The <Col N="2414" /> Corporation were producing fewer houses at the time because the traditional methods and labour services available would not meet needs.  The Minister for Local Government sent members of the Corporation, including Fine Gael and Labour members, to the Continent.  They came back and Ballymun was begun.  It was indicated that the programme laid down would take a certain course.  Then there was a dock strike and the materials could not be landed at Dublin.</P>

      <P>They were returned to France.  When eventually they were landed in Dublin, some of the materials were found to have been damaged and as no workshop in the country would undertake to carry out the necessary repairs, they again had to be returned to France.  There was also the problem of the laying of the underground services&mdash;water, sewerage, electricity and so on.  That work had to be done in adverse conditions. At the time, Fine Gael and Labour members agreed that tremendous work was being done in the circumstances.</P>
      <P>However, I shall leave the housing situation.  I am quite sure they heard enough about the situation when they were in power to keep them going for a while.  One would think every house in Dublin had been built by Fine Gael and Labour.  In this House there is no lack of experts on topics such as housing.  There is, though, a terrible lack of honesty.  We have Deputy Ryan, a past master in dishonest dealing.</P>

      <P>These people are unable to take any kind of criticism whatever.  The only people allowed to criticise the Labour Party and the trade union movement are the paid officials.  Otherwise, nobody is supposed to say a bad word about them or to say anything that might bring about a betterment and an improvement of the trade unions.  Let us see what one of these paid trade unionists has to say about it.  In the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 9th June, 1966, under the heading of &ldquo;Union Official Warns of Pink Ginger-Groups&rdquo; Mr. John F. Carroll has this to say:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2417" /> We have got to be prepared to speak out and not allow ourselves, either at individual union level, or at national congress level to be steamrolled, unduly pressurised or hamstrung, because of sentiment, too liberal expressions of the right of the individual or fear of splinter groups being formed, or pink ginger-groups making their pressure felt.</P>
    <P>He went on to say:</P>
    <P>There can be no denying that the broad structure of the Irish trade union movement today is out of line with modern concepts and requirements.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">

    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I have the greatest admiration for this man.  If the Labour Party think anything about the workers or the country, they will attempt to put their own house in order first.  Quite recently there was a meeting in O'Connell Street organised by the Labour Party to discuss the housing situation in Dublin.  It was addressed by the vice-chairman of the Labour Party, Proinsias Mac Aonghusa and Members of this House spoke at that meeting.  The Chairman of the Housing Committee of Dublin Corporation was not invited to that meeting or, if he was invited, he did not go.  That was one of the Red-style rallies held in this city.  Twelve months ago we had one or two Deputies marching to Griffith Barracks and they seemed to have very original ideas.</P>

      <P>These people appeared before the television cameras and in the photographs in the yellow press and down at the corner of Abbey Street we had one of these less well-known agitators and disruptionists kicking people in the back because they would not clap.  When an attempt was made to protect one of these <Col N="2418" /> people, the vice-chairman of the Labour Party pointed and said: &ldquo;The police are taking the man away&rdquo;. These same people also took part in a march carrying banners which said &ldquo;We want homes&rdquo; and the man who carried that particular banner was not married.  The same people marched outside the gates of this House.  They interfered in other strikes too.  It is a pity that some of them could not be got to interevene with some of the people who are on strike here at the moment.</P>

It is the same type of mentality as wanted to retain the corrugated structure at Aston's Quay some years ago.

I am quite certain all these things will come in time.  Many progressive steps for the betterment of workers have been made under the Fianna Fáil Government.  On no occasion did the Fine Gael Party or the Labour Party, who shout so loudly about the rights of workers and about the conditions under which they are employed, bring about any easement of the situation.</P>

      <P>It was amazing to listen to Deputy Dowling speaking on the housing situation at the present moment.  One would get the impression that there was no slowing down in housing and that every effort was being made to improve housing conditions. We are tired listening to statements of that kind for a long number of years.  I was amazed at the time of the last general election in North-East Cork, the area where I have the honour of representing the people, when in the town of Mallow public speeches were delivered by the Taoiseach and by the candidates of the Fianna Fáil Party.  A large procession gathered outside the town, headed by four pipe bands who paraded to a platform in front of which was the slogan: &ldquo;Let Lemass Lead On.&rdquo;  They promised more houses for the people, more work, increased pay, better conditions&mdash;everything that could be promised was promised that night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Corry stated today there was no unemployment at the present moment.  I represent North-East Cork, the very same place as Deputy Corry, and I know the amount of unemployment there now.  I do admit that in some of the bigger towns, large industries were established but not by the Fianna Fáil Party.  I will give credit to anyone who provides employment in North-East Cork, and it was the late William Dwyer, who was a member of this House, who put the towns <Col N="2421" /> of Youghal and Midleton on their feet many years ago.  As a result of that, we have two towns in particular where no unemployment problem exists. However, throughout the remaining parts of North-East Cork, unemployment is just as rife today as ever it was.</P>
    <P>The Deputy stated that migrants had to be drafted in to do a certain amount of work this year.  Everybody knows it is customary in the large beet-growing areas of Cork County for people to come from Mayo and Galway for the beet harvest.  That is nothing new.  They have been there over a long number of years and are still coming down.</P>
    <P>Having regard to what has been said over a long period and the promises made to the people, the time is ripe for the Leader of the Government to decide to test the country. This Government have not lived up to the promises they made.  In 1932, at the Market Square in Kanturk, the former leader of Fianna Fáil said that if Fianna Fáil were returned to power their first job would be to bring down the price of the poor man's tobacco to the prewar level of 3rd an ounce. That statement was made by the man who now holds the highest post in this country.  It is interesting to note the price of tobacco at the present time.  That promise was, like many others, completely forgotten.</P>
    <P>We are told now that the country is not in any financial difficulty.  I have been a member of Cork County Council for 25 years.  Not once before in that period have we ever had to take a vote in the county council as to whether we would erect cottages in one town or village as against another place.  The Minister for Local Government has continually written letters directing local authorities to formulate plans and submit plans and specifications.  What happens when they are submitted?  There is delay. The plans are not returned to the local authorities because there is no money to meet the cost of the erection of the houses.  The only suggestion forthcoming from the Minister <Col N="2422" /> for Local Government during the past three months in regard to our financial position was that Cork County Council should sell any property they had.  What property do local authorities possess?</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcAuliffe" hpid="Mr. McAuliffe Mr. McAuliffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McAuliffe</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.  We have a considerable number of labourers' cottages but the Minister for Local Government has put an embargo on the sale of labourers' cottages to tenants.  That will have the effect of halting cottage purchase, a matter in which everyone here has been interested for a long number of years.</P>
      <P>In Cork county, our housing programme has come to a standstill.  In North Cork, which is equal in size to the entire county Limerick, we had a programme in October, 1965, to erect 39 houses.  We accepted tenders for 13 houses.  Tenders had been received but not approved in respect of the remainder. The result is that quite recently the manager informed the members that we could proceed only with the erection of the 13 houses and could make up our minds where they would be built.  Even at that, the manager pointed out that the amount of money available would not be sufficient to complete the 13 houses.</P>
      <P>I have listened to Deputy Healy here tonight talking about the amount of money now available for housing and the amount available roughly ten to 14 years ago.  Everybody knows that the cost of erecting a house is twice what it was in 1950 or 1951.  In 1948, the late Deputy T.J. Murphy was Minister for Local Government.  We decided on a large scheme of housing for Cork County.  The same applied probably to other counties.  In 1951-1952, we were in a position to hand over to 354 persons 354 new rural cottages in the North Cork rural district. In addition, we had large schemes of houses in Mallow, Fermoy, Midleton and Youghal, where the urban councils are operating.  That came about as the result of activity within the Government and, in particular, within the Department of Local Government.</P>

      <P>He did.  He went to Cork.  He was not satisfied even with the progress made by the officials of Cork County Council and employed a housing inspector to make quite sure that sites were selected and houses erected as speedily as possible.  At that time the Northern Committee of the Cork County Council needed only submit an application for the erection of a house to the Custom House and within a month or, at longest, six weeks, the matter was attended to.</P>
      <P>There are housing schemes in the Department of Local Government for a long time, in some cases a year or a year and a half, and we are now told that there is no scarcity of money, that we can go ahead with the job.  Surely the people are not fools?  Surely the Members of this House are not fools? Everybody in the country knows what the position is.  Throughout Cork county there is an outcry for improved housing.  There are people living in mudwall cabins and slums.  Our ambition is to provide the people with houses.  The Government have failed in their responsibility in this connection and, as a result, the Labour Party have moved this Motion of no Confidence, which is fully justified.  The people should be given the opportunity to decide the type of Government that is best for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have said enough about housing. I now come to the local sanitary services.  In this connection we are not in a position to do any extra work this year.  I had the honour of participating in a by-election in mid-Cork.  During the campaign I listened carefully and attentively to the Minister for Transport and Power speaking at Millstreet on 1st March, 1965.  Having listened to him, I was quite sure that the country was to be made a paradise for all time.  Every good thing was promised in regard to the housing of the people.  The interests of the agricultural community were to be safeguarded.  One got the impression that the Department of Transport and Power was the most important aspect of government, that <Col N="2424" /> the Minister had done a perfect job. One month later there was a general election, immediately after which the truth came to light.  Those who had been prophesying prosperity found that they were not in a financial position to create prosperity.  There was a by-election in mid-Cork.  The Government had failed in the by-election in Roscommon and made quite sure that they would offer everything possible to the electorate of mid-Cork in an effort to secure the return of their candidate.  There were promises of houses, retention of railways, provision of new schools.  All these were offered to the electorate of mid-Cork on the eve of the by-election.</P>

Be it known to this House that I never knew I was such an important man until the by-election for mid-Cork took place and I was director of elections.  They sent the Taoiseach down to Boherbue where I was bred, born and reared and he spoke at 3 o'clock on a Saturday afternoon and outlined the position of the country. His message was to go out and tell everybody that this was a land flowing with milk and honey and that there was no fear of anything but that Fianna Fáil might lose the election.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McAuliffe</NameTxt>
      <P>We embarked on a water scheme which covers the entire area of Newmarket, Cullen and Knocknagree. We engaged a consultant, and members who have experience on local authorities know the fees consultants charge, and he submitted plans and specifications.  The planning documents were sent to the Department and the Minister for Local Government had a good idea and wrote to us saying that we would have to re-examine the plans because there was a considerable amount of the locality in which this scheme was to operate already served by private pumps and minor water schemes.  Back came the plans of the consultant and despite the fact that this water scheme had been promised to the people of Mid-Cork in a by-election and in the general election that followed because it would serve the entire Mid-Cork area, nothing has been done because the Minister has not tuppence ha'penny to spend on any scheme.  I have been a member of the Northern Committee for upwards of 25 years and I know that the same applies as regards sewerage schemes.  Probably before the next general election, they will all be revised, and we shall have somebody coming along trying to resurrect things of the past for the purpose of fooling the people of the future.  I think, however, that business is rather overworked. Our people are more enlightened today than they were years ago.</P>
      <P>I was dealing with the Minister for Transport and Power.  When he spoke in Mallow and when the Taoiseach spoke to the electorate there, they did not tell the electorate, nor did Deputy Meaney or Deputy Crowley or Deputy Corry point out, that they would be closing down the railways and closing down the schools.  They concealed that from the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have now reached a stage when everybody knows that the Government have not sufficient money to run the country and as a result we <Col N="2426" /> are closing some of the schools and closing some of the railways.  They are cutting down on sewerage, water and housing schemes.  In addition, very little attention is paid to the weaker sections of the community and those in receipt of social welfare benefits.  It is a very strange thing that when you have an increase given to a specific section of social welfare recipients, the old age pensioners, they are not entitled to get these increases until a specified time.  It is no wonder that people are alarmed and starting to grumble and grouse about the Administration when they find the unfortunate old age pensioners, those receiving disablement allowances and widows' and orphans' pensions, must wait until next October to get their increase but the retiring Chairman of CIE got £8,000 and a £3,000 a year pension for life.</P>
    <P>The people are sick of this and as a result we in the Labour Party decided to submit this no confidence motion to the House.  No doubt it will have its effect in the country. Surely every Deputy is aware of the position.  I want to tell the personal representative of the Taoiseach who is present that we have a considerable number of disgruntled people because they know how things are going at present.  They know that down through the years they have been fooled by Fianna Fáil when they voted for Fianna Fáil.  The writing is on the wall for the Government and I believe that if the Taoiseach gave the people an opportunity to vote they would quickly make up their minds on what form of Government they want.</P>

      <P>So far as Deputy Dowling is concerned, he got what he sought&mdash;constructive, useful advice, not from the point of view of any particular political Party but from the point of view of the country as a whole.  I was particularly anxious to intervene at this stage because I was grateful to Deputy McAuliffe for dealing with the housing problem and I am particularly grateful to him for recalling the work of one of the most disinterested men I ever knew to sit in this House, the <Col N="2430" /> late Deputy Tim Murphy.  I do not think it exaggeration on my part to say that he is amongst that select company of persons who killed himself in the service of our people.  I remember the day he first fell ill at a meeting of the Government of which we were members together.  He fell ill through overwork and his obsession was the housing of the people.  I am happy to remember that that sense of obligation passed on to the late Deputy Michael Keyes and, in due course, to Deputy Pa O'Donnell.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs said today that we put Fianna Fáil out of office only once and never got back again.  Of course we got back again.  We got back in 1951 and that was the period&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In respect of the period of the first inter-Party Government, 1948-51, I look back with satisfaction and gratification on the fact that we took the tubercular out of houses where they were dying and built sanatoria to such good effect that half of the sanatoria we built are now standing empty today.  That was part of the work the late Deputy Tim Murphy did and the then Minister for Health, the former Deputy Dr. Browne, a disinterested public servant <Col N="2431" /> of our people.  But that is not the end of the story.</P>
      <P>When we returned to office in 1954, we found that the work to which we had put our hands to help our people had been allowed to falter and had been arrested by the Fianna Fáil Government but we put our hands to it again.  I do not call in evidence any Deputy sitting on this side of the House.  I call in evidence the present Taoiseach, Deputy Seán Lemass.  He had it to tell in my presence in this House, within the past 12 months, that when the Government of which he was a member returned to office in 1957, he, as Tánaiste and Minister for Industry and Commerce, sent for the Dublin City Manager to know what requisitions Dublin Corporation would make on the resources of labour and material for housing in the city of Dublin and the City Manager's reply to him was, in effect: &ldquo;Minister, we want no resources.  Our problem in Dublin is that we have too many houses.&rdquo;  That involved us in considerable financial difficulties but they were difficulties of which I am proud.</P>
      <P>I consider that a good Government of this country is a Government that gets itself into financial difficulties housing the people.  When I was Leader of the Fine Gael Party and an aspirant to the position of Taoiseach, I warned the people that if ever they elected me to that high office, I would put the finances of the country in jeopardy as often as necessary to house the people and that that would have a first charge upon the resources of this Party before skyscrapers were built, before any luxury offices were built to be leased by Government Departments for the accommodation of the bureaucrats of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not deny that if we were the Government of this country, there might not be skyscrapers built in this city but we would not have it to tell that no Christian or other family in the city of Dublin today living less than five in a room will even be considered for a house&mdash;because that is the result of the nine years Fianna Fáil have been in office since 1957. Let us put this clearly in issue.  If I <Col N="2432" /> had been Taoiseach, if Fine Gael had been the Government of this country, no skyscrapers would have been built until those families living five in one room had been housed in Christian decency.  Let us join issue on that. Should we have had the skyscrapers or should we have had houses for the people?  I said we should have houses for the people and those who did not like that could lump it so far as I was concerned and the plutocrats and the bureaucrats and all the other &ldquo;crats&rdquo; could sit wherever they sat for the past ten, 15 or 20 years&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;while I was providing houses for the people who are now living five in a room, with nowhere to go.  But do not imagine that that truly paints the picture.</P>
      <P>Do Deputies realise that since 1963 not one single residential unit in this country has been declared unfit for human habitation by Dublin Corporation? I know rooms in houses in this city which are rat warrens.  I know rooms in this city in which elderly people are dying of neglect, through damp and cold, because Dublin Corporation does not dare to declare their place of residence unfit for human habitation until the architect warns them that, if they do not so declare it, it is liable to fall down.</P>
      <P>Do you realise that at this moment, over and above the 700 families who have five people living in one room&mdash; and there are hundreds of families, in addition to them, who are four in one room and three in one room&mdash;there are hundreds of residents in this city who do not come within that category&mdash; elderly people, elderly married couples, elderly people living alone&mdash;who are living in accommodation that would have been, and should be, condemned as unfit for human habitation, but is not being condemned because, if it were, they would go on to the list of people in a preferential position, and Dublin Corporation has neither the money nor the means to house them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, let us put these two policies in issue.  I am proud of our effort.  I am proud of the fact that the day we went <Col N="2433" /> out of office we were straining our resources, and asking the people to bear substantial burdens to get the economy back on an even keel, because we had deliberately sailed straight into the teeth of a storm in order to house the people; and, when the winds grew adverse, and the storm began to blow, there were a great many people in the Fianna Fáil Party who said: &ldquo;Trim your sails; pull back; you are running into danger.&rdquo;  Bill Norton's answer, Michael Keyes's answer, John A. Costello's answer, Gerard Sweetman's answer, and Pa O'Donnell's answer was: &ldquo;We will ride it out until we put roofs over the people of this country and we will ask the people to bear whatever burden of inconvenience that may involve us in.&rdquo;  And we did it, and we so disposed the resources of this country.</P>
    <P>Having created an adverse balance of payments of close on £40 million a year in order to do it, within 12 months of the remedial measures we initiated, we presented this country, for the first time, outside the years of the war, since the State was founded, with a favourable balance of payments of £12 million.  That is the bequest we left to the incoming Fianna Fáil Government. Before I am finished talking in this House on this motion of censure, I am going to tell the story of how they used that.  I am going to tell the story of how they frittered it away; and I am going to tell it because it is part of the reason why the time has come to give them the answer that Deputy Dowling cried out for today: &ldquo;Tell us,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;what we ought to do?&rdquo;  The answer is: &ldquo;Go away.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We will give every single one of them, and we have more Ministers in the Government today than we have ever had before, the maximum number that the Constitution will permit, and I will bind this Party now to give the whole gang of you a life pension of your total salary, if you will do one thing: simply go away.  And it will be the best bargain the people of this country ever struck; and I am prepared to certify before the people value for their money they could not conceive or get.</P>

      <P>It is true to say, I think, that with all the asperity of our debate, which is a healthy thing, no one will doubt that we would all wish to see you all nonagenarians in your own good time, as no doubt you are hoping and praying I also may be.</P>

      <P>I agree that reflection on things past&mdash;<i>rechercher le temps perdu</i>&mdash;is perhaps an appropriate occupation for Marcel Proust, but not for Dáil Éireann; but, nevertheless, from <i>le temps perdu</i> there is much to be learned.  I see some of the younger members of the Fianna Fáil Party here who find it hard to believe that what I am saying is true.  I would urge them not to be too tragic about it.  It is all true.  It is the seamy side of the political life on which they are embarked.  But they have all got the remedy in their own hands, and they can use it in God's good time: when these younger chaps have found what frauds they have for leaders, there is always the honourable course to follow&mdash;cross the floor.</P>

      <P>Very aptly spoken, but luckily this country is in a formidable position and can build the dam to keep the deluge back.  I will take the risk. Here is one finger that will go into the hole in the dam which your absence may create, and there will be no irreparable deluge, and that is something we ought to rejoice in.  I once said to a distinguished fellow citizen that I thought the great difference&mdash;perhaps I had better not tell that story here. <Col N="2435" /> But there is a topic upon which I want to touch, and this also is for the instruction of the younger members of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>

      <P>The exact relevance of that escapes me at the moment and I am anxious not to pursue it further, lest I strain your admirable patience, but, more especially, because I want to place it on the record that the matter with which I wish to deal now is the American Loan Counterpart Fund.  It has been alleged by Fianna Fáil that we borrowed this money and spent it recklessly.</P>

      <P>Squandered it.  I want to make this clear now; not one single penny of the money received by way of grant or loan was spent by the Government of the Irish Republic. And, remember, it was we who declared that Republic.  Every penny of that money was spent by citizens, <Col N="2436" /> who used the currency we borrowed from the United States of America to finance essential transactions, to preserve the housing industry, to preserve the agricultural industry&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I will read every figure in it tomorrow and I will show that we left the incoming Fianna Fáil Government £24 million intact and Fianna Fáil spent it in one month.</P>
