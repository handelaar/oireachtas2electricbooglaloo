    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach the total number of people invited to attend on the GPO platform at the special ceremonies on Easter Sunday morning, the date on which invitations were issued, the basis of selection of those invited, the total number present, the number of those invited who refused to attend, and the number and names of those selected who did not receive invitations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, Sir, I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The invitation list for the platform party at the GPO, Dublin, for the ceremony on Easter Sunday morning covered approximately 1,000 persons. Apart from the President, the Taoiseach and the Lord Mayor of Dublin, they included members of the Government, Parliamentary Secretaries, the Council of State, former Ministers of State, surviving participants in the Easter Rising, 1916, and immediate relatives of the leaders executed in 1916.  The invitation cards were issued between the 1st and the 4th April but, <Col N="668" /> through oversight, they were sent only to the surviving participants.  A statement expressing regret for this oversight was issued by the Department of Defence through the Government Information Bureau and published on the 12th April.</P>
    <P>Over 50 per cent of the invitees attended.  No refusal was received.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish:</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I take it from the Taoiseach's reply that he did not receive an invitation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that a number of public representatives, including Deputies and ex-Ministers, received no invitations and, so far as I am aware, invitations were not issued to them because they were never received?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The invitations were, in fact, issued only to those who had participated in the Rising.  This was the oversight in respect of the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach not consider that in the circumstances in which elected public representatives were not invited to what should have been a national celebration some more formal expression of regret than his statement, worded in somewhat unusual language, issued on behalf of an anonymous Department, should have been made?  Normally, a Minister accepts responsibility.  In this case two conflicting statements were issued, one indicating that invitations had been issued, whereas, in fact, they had not, and that was subsequently altered by a statement that the Department regretted. There was no indication that the Government or the Minister responsible expressed regret.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish:</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does it not seem that the Taoiseach has shown tremendous contempt for the House and for the other Parties in not consulting with them or in not informing them long beforehand that they would be invited on the platform?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not perfectly clear now that the Taoiseach was grossly at fault when he refused last October to have representatives of the Opposition on this Committee and that if he had then acceded to the request that representatives of the Opposition be on the Committee, this could not have happened because they would have known who should have been invited?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman:</NameTxt>
      <P>Further, does the Taoiseach consider it proper that he as chairman of the Committee should wait until now to have an apology dragged out of him by question in the House, and is it not perfectly clear that <Col N="670" /> any person who wanted things to be done in the proper way would, immediately the mistake was discovered, have apologised there and then and not waited until today to have it drawn out of him?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have explained that certain people who should have been invited were not invited to this function.

      <P>The Leader of the Labour Party attended all the 1916 functions he could attend.  It is sad and regrettable that we could not be represented on the big occasion for 1916. All I can say about this matter is that it was a shocking mess up.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish:</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps he did not do so because he had in mind what the Taoiseach said some months ago about politicians not taking an active part in the ceremonies and assumed that members of Fianna Fáil would not be there either, that they would be left to the 1916 men.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs if he is aware that in certain cases Irish girls who emigrate to the United States to take up positions as domestic servants are being exploited through the excessive charges made to them by the agencies arranging for their employment; if any system of control exists over agencies operating in this country offering to find employment for Irish citizens abroad; if so, what system; and if he will have this whole matter of charges for the finding of employment abroad investigated with a view to preventing such exploitation in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of <Col N="682" /> complaints of this kind in recent years but if the Deputy has any concrete information which he will place at my disposal I shall have it investigated.</P>
      <P>The only system of control over employment agencies operating in this country is that provided for by section 85 of the Public Health Acts (Amendment) Act, 1907, which deals with the prevention of fraud and immorality in the operation of female domestic servants' registries.  The provisions of that section have been brought into force in Dublin and Cork.</P>
      <P>I am not satisfied of the necessity for investigating the fees charged by American employment agencies generally, but, as I have already indicated, I am ready to consider any evidence of exploitation put before me.</P>

      <P>I do not intervene in the question of contracts of a commercial character entered into by the service or by a State-sponsored company but in the case to which the Deputy refers, a licence under the Road Transport Act, 1932, would be a prerequisite.

        <i>(Cavan):</i> Is the Minister not aware that no such licence is necessary and that buses are operating all over the country on similar tours without any licence?  If a licence was necessary why did the Minister, or his Department, allow this bus to operate openly for the last three weeks from Shannon Airport to Kinvara without being questioned, without any approach from the guards, or any prosecution?  Further, is the Minister aware that the operators of this coach received a letter today directing them to cease using this coach and to use CIE coaches only and in the same letter Messrs Jackson's Garage Ltd are thanked for providing an excellent and courteous service?  Is the Minister aware that Messrs Jackson's Garage Ltd were providing better vehicles and a better service at a cheaper rate and that if the company concerned at Shannon had their way they would be only too anxious to continue to employ this bus service because it is giving a far better service than the Minister's badly run CIE?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will explain why the estimates for postal expenses of of Officers and Staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas have increased from £2,000 in 1965-66 to £11,000 in 1966-67 as stated in the current Book of Estimates.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch:</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputies are aware, the Post Office have, since 1st April, 1964, been charging other Departments and Offices for all services rendered.  In regard to the postal expenses of the officers and staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas, the provision of £2,000 made in the 1965-66 Estimate was decided on, after consultation with <Col N="690" /> the Post Office, in October, 1964 i.e. after the new arrangement had been in operation for only 6 months.  The provision was therefore somewhat conjectural.</P>
      <P>A more up-to-date survey since carried out by the Post Office just before the Estimate for 1966-67 was prepared suggested that the figure of £2,000 originally estimated for in 1965-66 would have to be revised to £5,000. Hence the Estimate for 1966-67 provided for this extra £3,000.  It also provided for £4,000 in respect of the estimated postal expenses of the Officers and Staff for that year itself.</P>
      <P>To this total of £7,000, there was added a further £4,000 by way of an estimated revised charge for official paid stationery supplied to the Office of the Houses of the Oireachtas for the use of Deputies and Senators under the free postal arrangements.  For accounting convenience, the value of the stock in hand was regarded as a liability of that Office, which of course is responsible for its custody.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 26 and 27 together.</P>
      <P>Upon full review of the existing system of customs control on the land frontier, I have come to the conclusion that it is not yet opportune to dispense with the stamping of papers for vehicles crossing the Border nor with the charge of 2/- in respect of attendance given outside approved hours at Customs Posts.  Within the general framework, however, I think there may be scope for certain modifications calculated to ease the position of persons resident close to the Border and making frequent crossings for business or other essential purposes.  To be effective, any such modifications would require the agreement of the British authorities and I am arranging to have the points in question taken up by the Revenue Commissioners with the Commissioners of Customs and Excise in London.</P>
      <P>The charge of 2/- for customs attendance outside approved hours is made under the Customs (Land Frontier) Regulations, 1924.</P>

      <P>While I thank the Minister for the interest he has taken in this matter in contacting the British authorities, I should like him to explain what function the British authorities have in regard to the collection of this 2/- or in having a book stamped for everyone passing through the Border?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch:</NameTxt>
      <P>I said that I thought <Col N="710" /> that within the general framework of the regulations governing the crossing of the Border there was scope for some modification.  Therefore, it is not unreasonable to expect I should consult with the British Customs and Excise authorities when I am thinking of modification of the general regulations.</P>

      <P>The Commissioners of Public Works have entered into a lease in respect of Ansley House with effect from 25th September, 1965.  It is not the practice to disclose the amount of the rent payable in an individual case such as this as the figure concerned is a confidential one as between landlord and tenant and the Deputy will appreciate that it would not be in the public interest to do so.</P>
      <P>The object of renting the building was to accommodate staffs whose existing premises are inadequate and unsuitable.</P>
      <P>The cost of making the entire building suitable for occupation, partitioning, lighting, fittings, furnishing, etc., is estimated at £80,000.  The four upper floors of the building are expected to be ready within the next two months for occupation by the Labour Court, An Cheard Comhairle, An Foras Tionscal and the Industrial Development Authority.  The final allocation of the space on the other two floors has not yet been settled but at least portion of it will be required for the proposed Manpower Division of the Department of Industry and Commerce.</P>

I do not, however, rule out the possibility of changes in the method of administering the Scheme and carrying out the works.</P>

This is most unfair and unjust.  Is the Parliamentary Secretary further aware that a survey was carried out in this particular area three months ago and that all the necessary information must be in his office?  Is <Col N="726" /> he aware that the pipe was sunk, the land having been dug with pick, spade and shovel, in 1911?

      <P>Does the Parliamentary Secretary mean to convey that unless it is an economic proposition, 20 small farmers will remain completely submerged for two or three years? Surely the Parliamentary Secretary realises that all that has to be done is to sink the same kind of shore that was sunk before with a two-foot pipe <Col N="727" /> instead of a 10-inch pipe.  If that is done all the water will be taken away immediately.  Does the Parliamentary Secretary intend to do anything to alleviate flooding for these unfortunate farmers who are called upon to pay rates and who cannot make proper use of their land, cannot get to the shops, cannot get the priest or the doctor without travelling a distance of ten miles?</P>

While, as Deputy Tully has just said, it is very difficult to follow the amendments without reference to the sections they amend, I understand from the Minister that the effect of the amendment is that the Minister or the Department cannot now compel the injured workman to accept his compensation by weekly payments rather than by lump sum.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland:</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  This was in connection with degrees of disablement under 20 per cent for which in the original Bill the only compensation was by way of lump sum.  Deputy Fitzpatrick argued that in cases where this disablement benefit was paid for a longer period than seven years, the person concerned was not being as favourably treated as others and I undertook to allow such a person to opt for a weekly payment.  But this does not apply to degrees of disablement above 20 per cent where the benefit is still as it was.  The compensation will be by way of weekly pension only.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully:</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you; that meets the point.  The reason for the amendment was to prevent a situation where a workman insured in this State would go outside the State on his employer's business, meet with an injury in his employment and, as the Bill was worded, would not be entitled to compensation. This brings him into the legislation and I am satisfied with it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 10, between lines 20 and 21, to insert a new subsection as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="747" />&ldquo;() The Minister shall, not later than one year from the coming into operation of this Act, make an order, a draft whereof shall have been first approved by each House of the Oireachtas, providing that where the beneficiary's pre-accident weekly rate of earnings is £10 or more, injury benefit shall be seventy-five per cent of the beneficiary's pre-accident weekly rate of earnings and for the appropriate modification of the employment contributions.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The aim of the amendment is to ensure that the flat rate of compensation payable to an injured workman, irrespective of the amount of his earnings, will not continue indefinitely.  The amendment seeks to make it obligatory on the Minister to bring in regulations within 12 months ensuring that in the case of an injured workman whose earnings exceed £10 per week, he would be paid 75 per cent of his pre-accident wages.  We think, and have always thought, that considerable hardship can be caused where a workman in receipt of a wage considerably more than £10 a week is to be confined to the same rate of compensation as a workman in receipt of less than £10 per week.</P>
    <P>Naturally, since the two people had different standards of living before the accident, if they are to be compensated by awarding each the same amount of weekly compensation, injustice and hardship may result.  The amendment is proposed to give the Minister power to vary the contribution at the same time as he brings in these regulations. It is difficult to see what objection he can have to the amendment because it is only natural and reasonable that a workman receiving a higher rate of pay should get a higher rate of compensation. I understand the intention of the Bill is to endeavour to place a workman to some extent in his pre-accident condition.  It is not intended that he should get 100 per cent of his wages and the amendment does not seek that but it seeks that a man receiving a higher rate of weekly pay than £10 should receive 75 per cent of his pre-accident wages.  The existing Workmen's <Col N="748" /> Compensation Acts up to a certain limit recognised the principle we are putting forward here.</P>
    <P>It is not necessary to labour the point any further: we made the case as strenuously as we could on Committee Stage but I should like to hear the Minister's reaction to this amendment which gives him power to make regulations implementing the amendment and to reimburse the fund for any additional expense which may be put upon it by varying the contribution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland:</NameTxt>
      <P>My reaction to the amendment is the same as it was on Committee Stage.  It is estimated that this proposal would cost about £150,000 a year extra and the contribution would have to be increased to provide for that.  It was not recommended by either section of the Commission that examined this matter and our social insurance system, so far at any rate, provides for flat rate benefits. I am not against the principle of wage-related benefits in theory but if they are to be introduced, it should be done on a global basis rather than do it here and not do it for social welfare benefits generally.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick's proposal is that there should be wage-related benefits for earnings in excess of £10 per week and contributions would have to be adjusted for people in that range of employment.  Another point I should like to make is that people in that range of earnings would include many in occupations in which the risk is relatively low.  As we have a flat rate system in the Bill, those employing such people have certain complaints that they are helping to finance the risks of other types of employment.  It would hardly be fair, then, to put a further impost on such employers to cover wage related benefits, without possibly going into the question of degrees of risk.  So, I am not prepared to accept the amendment but I do not preclude the possibility at some time in the future of bringing in the idea of wage relation generally in regard to social welfare benefits.  It seems to me a development that will come at some stage.</P>

      <P>However, I am disappointed that the Minister did not accept the amendment and thus commit himself to doing something tangible and positive to implement the proposition which he accepts as sound, namely, that compensation should be related to the rate of wages.

If that were a proposition to give an indefinite pension instead of a lump sum I would not have any fault to find with it but, as I understand it, it means that this comparatively paltry sum of £380, or whatever it is, is to be paid by instalments if the Minister so thinks fit.  If <Col N="750" /> the Minister is not prepared to accept my amendment and to delete paragraph (b) of subsection (7), I should like him to intimate to the House the type of case in which he thinks he would invoke the powers conferred upon him by this paragraph to order that the amount be paid by instalments.</P>
    <P>Very often, the amount, small as it is, may enable the injured workman to rehabilitate himself or to set himself up in some other way of earning an income, perhaps to buy a machine or vehicle or something that will enable him to earn a living.  If it were spread out into payments of a few shillings a week it is difficult to see what good it would do.  If the Minister says that he wants to protect the workman from himself from squandering the amount that he will get I do not think that argument holds water because the amount the workman would be getting is very small.  If the Minister takes power to order payment by instalment it may be done in cases where it would not be in the interests of the workman to do it.</P>

      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick said that he would not object to this if it were a provision for an indefinite pension.  Of course, I am making provision for altering this to allow a person to opt for a pension of indefinite duration in amendment No. 6.  That is being done.  The regulation provided for in this section may not be made at all but the type of circumstances in which I can visualise the power being desirable is in the case of children.  In the case of a child this gratuity would be payable to the guardian.  If the child were about to come of age within a short period it might or might not be desirable to retain some of the amount to pay to the worker when he did come of age.  I do not know whether circumstances will make it desirable to make this regulation or not but I think I should have the power to do it in case it appeared to be desirable.  It might be desirable to retain the bulk of the money to give to the individual himself when he came of age.  That is the type of circumstances I visualise arising.</P>

      <P>I am not a legal man and therefore, I do not get the niceties of this.  Surely existing legislation provides that payment such as this in the case of a minor would be paid into court and provision is made for portion of the money, where necessary, to be paid out?  If that is so, is there some other reason why this phraseology is used?  Personally I can see no reason for it.  It is not a new type of legislation.  It will be governed by common law, I assume.  I do not think that even the provision as stated in the Bill will alter that.  The only thing I would be afraid of is that it would be possible to allow the State, for some extraordinary reason, to say that the £300 odd which would be due to a man was not to be paid out at one time but was to be paid out over a period.  That is the only reading I can make of it.  Otherwise, the provision seems entirely unnecessary.  The Minister would be well advised either to take it out of the Bill altogether or to consider it before the Bill reaches the Seanad and to make arrangements to have it taken out.

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I am replying to an amendment which I moved and the Ceann Comhairle has ruled that I have the right of reply. The Minister, in resisting this amendment, has stated that the only case in which he thinks it would be necessary to invoke the powers given here would be to preserve some of the lump sum for a minor about to come of age.  I think Deputy Tully is correct when he says that under the existing law the money must be paid into court.  If it is paid to a guardian, that guardian cannot use it as he likes: it must be placed in trust for the minor. The amount is paid into court under a very inexpensive procedure and the judge is usually very careful and most jealous to see that the money is not paid out, unless he is satisfied that it is being paid out in the interests of the minor.</P>
      <P>Judges are very reluctant to pay out money to minors, unless they are satisfied, first, that it will be applied on behalf of the minor and, secondly, that the manner in which it is to be spent is in the minor's interest.  I do not know whether there is some clause in the Bill whereby a lump sum can be paid to a guardian to do what he likes with it.  If there is a provision in the Bill that a lump sum of £380 can be paid to a guardian to do what he likes with it and with no control over him, it is time steps were taken to remedy that state of affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister made his case on the basis that the lump sum could be paid to the guardian.  That guardian might be the father of a large family and that £380 could be applied to meet the wants of some of the other children who were not injured at all, or it might find its way into the bookie's shop or into the publichouse.  I hope that is not the law under this Bill. From considerable experience, I know that it is not safe to give a large sum of money, or a moderate sum of money such as £380, to a guardian and expect <Col N="753" /> that guardian to apply it solely in the interests of the injured person.  It is most unlikely that that will happen, perhaps through want or through stupidity, or for some other reason.  If the Minister believes that is the law or that it will be the law under this Bill, he should consider the matter carefully.  If he is not prepared to accept the amendment, he should consider the matter before it reaches the Seanad and should take steps to put it right.</P>

      <P>(i) the gratuity shall not be paid,</P>

    <P>(ii)  different amounts may be specified in relation to the different percentages under twenty per cent but, as respects each such amount, it shall be not less than the amount which bears to the disablement pension appropriate to a degree of disablement of twenty per cent (that is to say, 23s. 0d. or 15s. 6d., as may be appropriate) the same proportion as the percentage with respect to which it is specified bears to twenty per cent.&rdquo;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of this amendment is to ensure that disability pensions will not be less than the injury benefits.  I know that the Minister has certain views on this matter and that he stated them on Committee Stage but I would like to hear his views on it again.  As the Bill stands, a person could, while continuing to suffer the same percentage of disability, find that his compensation, which is what I will call it to cover <Col N="755" /> both categories of benefit and pension, could be substantially reduced.  If that is the case, I think it is unfair and that it would inflict a hardship on the injured workman.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland:</NameTxt>
      <P>To provide that a disablement pension can be increased until it is equal to the injury benefit is unlikely to be of any benefit to the vast majority of persons who would qualify for disablement pensions and also be unfit for work.  In the normal case such as that, the person concerned would have full rate disablement pension or something close to it.  The disablement pension would already be equal or very nearly equal to the rate of injury benefit.  Deputy Fitzpatrick's amendment, in the vast majority of cases, possibly in all cases, would work out to the disadvantage of the injured workman.  What we are providing here is that a workman who does not qualify because of contributions for disability benefit will not suffer because of that. He will get the unemployability supplement at the same rate as disability benefit.</P>
      <P>A person who is so seriously disabled as to qualify for the full benefit will get 115/- per week personal rate and 52/6d. per week unemployability supplement.  If the amendment was accepted the maximum he would get would be the 115/- injury benefit.  The amendment, which is to ensure that a theoretical type of case would get the full 115/- per week, would be to the disadvantage of the seriously disabled workman.  It is very unlikely that a person whose rate of disablement benefit is small would also be completely unfit for work and therefore I think this amendment would be a substantial disimprovement of the Bill and I would not be prepared to accept it.</P>

That should meet the case that was made because, as Deputy Fitzpatrick said, it is normally expected that it would be the unmarried workman who would have such dependent parents.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I join with Deputy Tully in thanking the Minister for the improvement his amendment will effect in this Bill.  It does really show the worth of a discussion in this House.  When the Bill was introduced, and indeed on Committee Stage, the parent of a deceased workman who was absolutely dependent on the deceased workman was not entitled to any benefit beyond a pension of £1-4-0 a week.  I put down an amendment for the purpose of drawing attention to that state of affairs.  Admittedly, I only asked that the 24/- be doubled to 48/- but nevertheless that amendment and the discussion which took place shocked this House.  The House was shocked to learn that such a parent was only going to be compensated in the year 1966 by a miserable 24/- per week.  The amendment is a great improvement on the Bill as originally drafted and goes a <Col N="757" /> long way towards meeting the points which have been made.  It does make it a condition of giving a pension that the parent, if he is a father, must be incapable of self-support by reason of some physical or mental infirmity and is likely to remain permanently so.  I would make the point that you could have the case of a parent who although not physically unfit to earn his living, and perhaps strictly not mentally incapable, might be the type who was a misfit and could not get employment.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister and his advisers when interpreting this Bill when it becomes an Act will regard such a person as being mentally incapable of earning his living because there is definitely this type of misfit who while he could not be regarded as physically unable to earn his living, or mentally unfit, might be socially unfit because of a groove into which he had got or because of his make-up.  I would suggest that such a case should be regarded as being mentally incapable of earning his living.</P>

I said on Committee Stage that there are people walking to the social welfare offices all over the country for as long as some of us can remember who are not physically unfit to work and who you could not say were mad but who are unemployable.  They are a social problem.  A person who is unemployable because of his general make-up should come under the definition of mental infirmity.  Under a strict interpretation, he would be excluded but I repeat that we could <Col N="758" /> name quite a few people who have been going to the labour exchanges for 20 years, who are not drunkards or criminals, and who could not be described as physically infirm or as being mad but who are unemployable.  Nobody would employ them perhaps because of the way they were brought up or because of their make-up, and I would strongly appeal to the Minister and his advisers that perhaps between now and when the Bill reaches the Seanad they would try to relax this mental infirmity stipulation a little so as to cover this type of hard luck case.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I move amendment no 16:</P>
      <P>In page 23, between lines 33 and 34, to insert a new subsection as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;() Notwithstanding anything contained in subsections (1) and (2) of this section or any regulations made under subsection (1), the Minister may extend the period prescribed for the giving of notice of an accident in any case in which it seems proper to do so.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment proposes to give discretion in regard to the giving of notice.  Under these regulations notice must be given to the insured person's employer or other prescribed person by the injured workman.  Any of us who have any experience of the operation of the workmen's compensation code which is being replaced by this measure know the amount of litigation caused by this very provision about giving notice.  I would say the great volume of case law which came from the Supreme Court on the Workmen's Compensation Act, 1934, hinged around this question of notice.</P>
      <P>This type of amendment should be dear to the Minister's heart.  It is with some reluctance I move it, but I do so in an effort to give some safety valve to the workman who may omit to give notice.  The amendment is phrased in the most reasonable terms.  It simply asks that in any case not covered by the regulations and in which the Minister considers the workman had reasonable cause for not giving notice, the Minister should have power to extend the time.  There is no appeal from anybody beyond the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The acceptance of the amendment might very well avoid the infliction of <Col N="761" /> hardship on many workmen who for one reason or another may have overlooked giving notice and may not be able to bring themselves within the regulation and the Bill.  If the Minister accepts the amendment, he will not be giving anything away.  He might be accepting some further responsibility, but he would have all the facts before him.  He would have the case made on behalf of the workman for failing to give notice.  I am sure the Minister would exercise his discretion to extend the time only in a case in which it would be proper to do so.</P>
    <P>I cannot think of any more reasonable request than this.  In the past workmen have been denied any compensation at all because they overlooked to give notice and they found themselves completely excluded from the benefits of the workmen's compensation code, amounting perhaps to £4. 10s. per week for the rest of their lives.  That is the sort of case in which I want the Minister to take authority to give relief.  I may be pushing an open door.  I hope I am.  I hope the Minister has already decided to accept this amendment.  It is difficult to see what case can be put up against it.</P>

Every month or perhaps twice a month, complaints come from members who for one reason or another did not avail of their rights to claim workmen's compensation and who because of this failure are left outside.</P>

    <P>It is bad enough when a commercial insurance company insist on their rights to refuse compensation because the law says they are entitled to do so, but in this case the State is involved.  There is something which has been brought forcibly to my notice on a number of occasions and I do not know whether the Minister is aware of it.  From time to time the Minister's Department, for which I have the highest respect, refuse to pay disability benefit to persons <Col N="762" /> who have become ill because they did not give notice in time.  I had the case recently of an old lady who never drew benefit in her life.  She was seriously ill in hospital for many months.  When she came back, she made application for disability benefit but was refused because she did not give notice in time.  She could only be paid benefit from the period in which she gave notice or seven days afterwards. Since that is the interpretation given by the Minister's Department to the existing social welfare legislation, it follows that a similar interpretation will almost certainly be given in cases where this new workmen's compensation code, which is to be administered by the same Department, comes for consideration by the same officials.</P>
    <P>The amendment moved by Deputy Fitzpatrick does not force the Minister to do anything, but gives him extra power in the event of something like this happening.  There is an appeal to him and if he is satisfied, he can allow the late serving of notice.  I think it is a good idea to have this included and I ask the Minister to accept it.</P>

      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick refers to the position under the workmen's compensation legislation in which workmen have been denied compensation for failure to give notice. I thought I made is clear there was no question of this happening under this Bill.  It is in the interest of everybody and in the interest of the worker in particular that notice should be given as soon as possible so that the facts can be established.  That is all it is intended to do here&mdash;to provide that notice should be given as soon as practicable.  This amendment proposes to give me power to extend the period prescribed for the giving of notice in any case in which it seems proper to do so.  However, it is not intended to <Col N="763" /> prescribe any fixed period for the giving of notice.  It is merely intended to provide that notice should be given as soon as possible.</P>

There might be no reason, on the face of it, why he should not give notice within a couple of days.  I was talking to a man yesterday who lost the sight of an eye in the course of his employment on 9th February last, and he is getting workmen's compensation at £4 10s. a week since that date.  However, he is a married man with five children and he would be entitled to about £4 10s. a week more from the Department of Social Welfare to bring his workmen's compensation payment up to the rate of disability benefit applicable to his case.  Because he was a hard-working man and never had any occasion to call on the Department of Social Welfare, he has been accepting since 9th February the £4 10s. workmen's compensation and has not applied to the Department of Social Welfare.  As I understand the regulations in the Department at the moment, that man might&mdash;I am not saying he will and I sincerely hope he will not&mdash; be deprived of about £4 10s. per week from 9th February.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> Yes.  The best evidence I can give of that is that he is getting £4 10s. per week from an insurance company who do not throw out compensation readily. If the Minister were to stand on his rights, I understand that man could be deprived of his social welfare from <Col N="766" /> 9th February to date.  The only reason that man has not applied for his social welfare supplement is ignorance.  I should like to know whether the Minister would regard ignorance as a good cause.  Subsection (2) of section 27 says: &ldquo;In a case of failure without good cause...regulations may provide for disqualification for receipt of occupational injuries benefit or any amount under section 26 of this Act for such period as may be determined in accordance with the regulations.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Unless I am particularly dull today, that section means two things: that the workman must report the accident within a specified time or within such time as is prescribed.  If he fails to do that without good cause, he will be disqualified under the proposed regulations from entitlement to benefit for the period during which he did not report the accident.  I warn the Minister that &ldquo;good cause&rdquo; is a very difficult phrase to interpret.  The Department are inclined to be guided by precedent, and precedents will be set up and will be acted upon by the Minister and his successors.  In the law courts, it has been well settled that ignorance is not an excuse for failing to do something, whether under the Landlord and Tenant Act for failing to give notice within two months of the expiration of tenancy, or under the workmen's compensation code.</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister to say whether he would regard ignorance as a good cause because it goes to the root of the whole matter in the case I came across yesterday, a case which clearly demonstrates the point I am making.  This married man with five children is getting £4 10s. per week when he is entitled to double that amount but, because he does not know he is entitled to it, he does not apply for it and he therefore loses it.  I am asking the Minister to take unto himself the power to deal with that sort of case, the power to grant relief in that sort of case, and I am very disappointed that the Minister has seen fit not to accept the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Dr. Hillery) Patrick J. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Dr. Hillery):</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>The object of the Bill is to confirm an Order which I have made under the Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1953, on the recommendation of the Fair Trade Commission, in regard to the supply and distribution of intoxicating liquor and non-alcoholic beverages.</P>
      <P>Deputies have already received copies of the Commission's report of their inquiry into this matter, but I propose to give here a summary of its contents.</P>
      <P>The inquiry related to restrictive trade practices affecting supply and distribution and involving, <i>inter alia</i>, arrangements, agreements or understandings between retailers, made at the instance of retail trade associations, which affect or are capable of affecting the retail prices of intoxicating liquor and soft drinks.  The inquiry was undertaken by the Commission at my request, when, shortly after the introduction of the Budget on 11th May, 1965, retail prices in the licensed trade throughout the country were increased by amounts equal to twice the amount of the increase in the duties on spirits and beer imposed by the Budget.</P>
      <P>The Commission gave consideration to all the relevant factors, including the structure of the retail trade, the gross profit margins in the trade, the activities of trade associations and the preparation of price lists and circulars.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="768" /> They also examined a number of financial accounts furnished by publicans both in Dublin and in rural areas.  They took into account the special importance of a fixed gross profit margin when it relates to a trade the value of the sales of which are enhanced by revenue duties of considerable magnitude.</P>
    <P>The Commission found that there was only one type of restrictive practice in the trade which fell within the terms of reference of the inquiry, that is, the one relating to the preparation and issue of price lists and circulars by retail associations of licensed traders. A remarkable feature of the trade is the number of associations which represent retail interests.  These have issued price lists or circulars in 17 counties.  To the knowledge of the Commission, 27 associations issue price lists or circulars periodically.  In their Report, the Commission describe the procedures employed by a number of associations in connection with the preparation of price lists and circulars (Chapter 13).  In Dublin, for example, it is the practice for the trade association to have the question of revised prices considered by its committee of management which consists of some 40 members of the Association.  There is normally a discussion about conditions generally in the trade and an attempt is made to assess the magnitude of increased costs and the appropriateness of making an increase in prices.  It is not the practice to have financial accounts of a cross section of members available for discussion.  The Association considers that the combined experience of the committee of management enables it to decide in an equitable and satisfactory manner what the new prices ought to be and, in this connection, the Association has constantly in mind the desirability of achieving a fixed percentage gross profit margin on turnover.  Usually, though not always, a general meeting of the members of the Association is subsequently convened, when the proposals of the committee are placed before it and a vote is taken after the proposals have been discussed.</P>
    <P>When new prices are decided upon <Col N="769" /> by trade associations, they may be notified to members by means of a price list or by the issue of a circular letter or, on occasion, by the insertion of an advertisement in the daily press.</P>
    <P>Two associations, namely, the Dublin Licensed Grocers' and Vintners' Association and County Sligo Licensed Vintners' Association take measures designed to secure compliance with their recommended prices.  These measures are described in Chapter 14 of the Report.  The Commission are satisfied that serious and systematic attention to &ldquo;price cutting&rdquo; in the Dublin area has been given by the committee of the Association, both members of the Association and non-members have been visited by the organiser and, on occasion, by some of the honorary officers of the committee in an endeavour to secure their agreement to charge the Association's recommended prices.  On one occasion the question of securing the co-operation of the trade union was considered. The Association also took specific measures in certain instances in which compliance with their recommended prices would have created a special problem for members.  In regard to arrangements between the Association and Messrs.  Guinness concerning retail houses owned by the latter, the Commission were not satisfied that there was not an element of moral pressure underlying the arrangements.</P>
    <P>In the case of County Sligo, officers of the Association may call on publicans with a view to explaining to them the economic reasons for the new prices proposed and that, if a member remains unconvinced, he may voluntarily withdraw from the Association.</P>
    <P>The Commission took evidence from brewers, distillers, and soft drink manufacturers, as well as from the licensed trade itself, in regard to the advantages or disadvantages of the issue of price lists by retail associations. Having considered the views of the different parties, most of which they reject, the Commission were of opinion that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the practice of issuing lists of recommended prices manifestly restricts price competition, since many <Col N="770" /> licensed vintners unquestioningly charge the recommended prices, and do not determine their own selling prices in the light of their own costs and their experience of the trade;</P>
    <P>(b)  a further restrictive element arises in relation to the enforcement of recommended prices by a number of associations because its objective is to ensure that particular traders charge higher prices than may be warranted in their cases;</P>
    <P>(c)  such interference with competition is unfair and operates against the public interest, because (i) the public are denied the benefits which ordinarily result from the free play of competitive forces, and (ii) retail prices are recommended on the basis of fixed percentage gross profit margins which are capable of yielding excessive profits, since the profit margins are related to selling prices of which taxation forms an important constituent;</P>
    <P>(d)  it is not compatible with the public interest that retail prices in the licensed trade should be influenced by the collective action of members of associations whose primary interest is their own welfare rather than the promotion of the public good.</P>
    <P>The Fair Trade Commission recommended:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  That the practice whereby associations representing the licensed trade issue lists of recommended prices should cease.</P>
    <P>The Commission do not see any reason why matters affecting costs or prices should not be discussed at meetings of such associations, but they do think that no recommendations should be made, pressure exercised, or guidance in any form given by retail organisations in regard to the prices to be charged for intoxicating liquor or soft drinks.</P>
    <P>(2)  That an Order should be made under the Restrictive Trade Practices Acts making it unlawful for retail trade associations or groups of licensed traders (a) to make any collective decisions, recommendations or proposals in regard to the selling prices to be adopted for intoxicating liquor or soft drinks, and (b) to prepare, publish, <Col N="771" /> issue or advertise retail price lists or circulars or other communications (whether oral or written) indicating or recommending alterations in retail prices by reference to existing lists or otherwise.</P>
    <P>I accepted the recommendations of the Commission and made the Restrictive Trade Practices (Intoxicating Liquor and Non-alcoholic Beverages) Order, 1965.  The Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1953, provides that an Order of this kind shall not have effect unless it is confirmed by an Act of the Oireachtas.  The Bill now before the Dáil is the confirming Bill which is necessary to give force of law to the Order as made.  With Bills of this kind, the arrangement is that the Order which it is proposed to confirm should not be subject to amendment by the Oireachtas but should be accepted or rejected as it stands.  The matters with which the Order deals have been the subject of a detailed public inquiry by the Fair Trade Commission and their report sets out the arguments in favour of accepting the provisions embodied in the Order.  I can, therefore, recommend this confirmation Bill to the Dáil without reservation.  Its enactment should result in the development of competition which should tend to produce more diversified prices at a generally lower level than under the present system, with consequent benefits to the public.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill confirming the Order made by the Minister some time ago is but part of the Government's legislation on prices.  It has to do with the fact that the Government have indicated that prices and incomes and wages, in which they were not very interested some little while ago, should be regarded as something that should not go up spectacularly but should have a very balanced increase at all times. The first thing one has to say about this Order is that the Government have a particular vested interest in drink prices arising from the fact that a very large slice of their revenue comes from indirect taxation on alcoholic beverages and, to a minor extent, on non-alcoholic beverages.  Any increase in price has an effect on the following Budget when <Col N="772" /> the Government are considering whether or not they have reached saturation point in taxation on drink and therefore they would wish to see increases in costs and prices sought by the trade and the breweries themselves kept to a minimum.</P>
      <P>There is a corollary to this legislation in the action taken by the Minister in relation to the breweries which, at the time, I described as resembling somebody with two club feet walking over a strawberry bed.  While the effort here has popular appeal, an appeal that might indicate that the Government and the Minister were considering people's welfare and how much they should be charged for drink, I would now say that it is also a rather unsuccessful and crude attempt at curtailing an increase in the price of drink. I know of no effect that this Order has had except that in any of the licensed premises I visited, there is no longer a price list displayed.  Usually the price list displayed was in fact the price list that came from the Liquor Association and it indicated to the customer the proper charge in the area. This had virtues, particularly in lounges where drink is served at tables. There have been instances of persons attending tables who did not rob their employers but who did something far worse, namely, taking a larger sum from the customer than they tendered to the man behind the counter.  I feel that this Order has had absolutely no effect on drink prices.</P>

      <P>Agreed.  If the Minister goes around the country, he will find that the price lists have been removed from public houses but that has had no effect at all, that I am aware of, on drink prices.  Let us be quite honest about it.  The Prices (Stabilisation) Order, which is quite a similar piece of legislation to this and has a very definite relation to it, has been, in relation to drink prices, a complete failure.  Personal service and standard service&mdash;the standard of accommodation and comfort and whether one <Col N="773" /> wants to drink a pint at a public bar, which one may well desire to do tonight, or to bring one's wife and to. drink something else in a lounge bar in the same establishment tomorrow night&mdash;all have effect on drink prices.</P>
      <P>The attempt to freeze drink prices, of which this legislation is part, has been an abject failure all over the country. There is no drinker today who does not know that increases in drink prices after the Budget have varied not only from town to town but from pub to pub and that the directions of the Prices (Stabilisation) Order, and this Order, have been entirely disobeyed and that the Government have sat and done nothing about it.  However, what the Government can do, after this Order becomes law&mdash;from today&mdash;is to see to it that these prices are not displayed.  Do the Government think for one moment that brother publicans in the same area and the same districts will not have discussions on prices?  It is quite clear that they will.  If, in future, there is not a written communication&mdash;well, many a deal was made by word of mouth.  If the Government's action is restricting the profits of breweries, which are so important to the economy of the country, and their attempt to restrict the prices of drink to a certain level after the Budget have completely failed, then we must face it that this is merely a piece of window-dressing and that there is no hope whatever that this Order, now confirmed today, will have any effect at all on drink prices.  The whole thing has been a sorry sham.  We can see the failure of that sham today when we see, for instance, that the Minister has had to change his mind about the future of wage increases.  This Order will have no effect and people will still charge the prices they feel they can get.  If competition ensures that they do not get them, then they will decrease the prices. That is how it is, how it has been and how it will be.  Neither price stabilisation nor this Order will have any effect. We have no objection to the passing of this legislation but it will be entirely ineffective.</P>

      <P>I do not think Deputy Donegan is right when he says legislation <Col N="774" /> such as this will have no effect on prices.  It is not the ultimate in what can be done to control prices but it is at least something that this Party have been asking the Government to do for a long time.  While it is irrelevant to this legislation, it is not unfair to say that industrial unrest has been contributed to by the complacency of the Government in the matter of prices and in their refusal to exercise price control until last July.  They were then converted to ideas promoted here&mdash;as I think the Minister must admit&mdash;by the Labour Party, in spite of protests by the Minister's predecessors, the Taoiseach and previous members of the Government, that price control was not a solution to our problem.  We agree it is not an absolute solution.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, a document was circulated to Deputies last November or December.  It was a report of the National Industrial Economic Council which, contrary to the Government view, expressed the belief that if an incomes policy were to operate, there would have to be permanent price control. Mark you, the Government accepted that report generally and at some time the Taoiseach or some Minister will be required to say exactly with what in that report they agree and to what in the report they will give the full force of legislation.  If they have any respect for NIEC, they must put these proposals into operation by means of Order or legislation.</P>
      <P>One of the first questions one should ask about this legislation is: why were these things singled out?  The Minister must start some place but this inquiry was held in, I think, May of last year. What amused or bemused many and annoyed many others is that while the prices of essential commodities had been, and were going up, the first commodity into which the Minister ordered an inquiry was drink.  There was no inquiry into foodstuffs&mdash;there was in the case of jam but this was the first important one.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish:</NameTxt>
      <P>While it is a fairly necessary commodity, it is not as important as food.  I suppose the Commission believed there was something in the fact that in the case of X, Y and Z or A, B and C the price of the bottle of stout and the &ldquo;half-one&rdquo; was the same.  That suggested a restrictive practice, that people had congregated and decided what the price of stout, whiskey and brandy would be.  The Minister should get around to some other commodities where I think it might be found there are also restrictive practices operating.  It is peculiar that in regard to a commodity on which tens of thousands of pounds in this country and millions all over the world are spent on advertising, there is no suggestion of a restrictive practice. I have never had any effective answer to the question of how the price of petrol from five, six or seven firms always happens to be the same.  It is true that in various garages in Dublin &mdash;you could possibly count them on the fingers of one hand&mdash;there are notices saying that petrol can be purchased for 3d. or 4d. per gallon less than the ordinary price but in 99.9 per cent of cases, the price of petrol is exactly the same all over the Dublin region and in the country districts. This is peculiar.  Surely they do not all have the very same costs?  They may make the same wages but surely the other costs cannot all work out exactly the same?  As far as restricted practices and price fixing are concerned, the Minister could ask the Fair Trade Commission to do a little more research, particularly in regard to commodities that could be classed as more necessary than liquor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know what the cost of living index figure for May will be but it is suggested that prices are again creeping up and therefore I ask the Minister to say something about the machinery <Col N="776" /> he now employs to check prices.  I know that if it were to be done 100 per cent, we should need an army of inspectors all over the country but I suggest that small increases are going on small commodities, perhaps not bread, not tea, butter or sugar, but any housewife knows of them.  I am sure the Minister's wife has often told him that the cost of living is continuing to rise. I am not talking of the overall index figure but of the cost of certain articles to which a halfpenny, penny or 2d. is tacked on.  The Minister should indicate what new staff, if any, he has employed to ensure that the prices legislation to which we gave approval last July will be fully effective.  Apart from those comments, I think there is no more to be said on this proposal.</P>

      <P>The control of prices philosophy emerges again from the two speeches made here.  Prior to last July, the philosophy behind price control was that giving adequate freedom of competition was the best method of control of prices.  Only in special circumstances would the Government think it fit to take definite measures, apart from allowing freedom of competition. If these special circumstances existed, it would be decided by the Government that the Minister for Industry and Commerce be given special powers.  Before this enactment, which was an amendment of the Prices Act, we worked on the basis that if competition were free, prices were best regulated in that way and the legislation was based on the making of competition free and the removal of any curbs on competition which might have emerged.  That is what the Fair Trade Commission was intended for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="777" /> It has been there since 1953 and its activities down through the years, quite unrelated to any recent decisions of the Government, have been addressed to a variety of articles.  They include groceries, motorcars, petrol, radios, television sets and many other things and there were public inquiries in all these cases.  So, it is not quite fair to say that the first inquiry by the Fair Trade Commission was into alcohol but it is true that the first inquiry by the Fair Trade Commission immediately prior to the Government decision that there were particularly difficult circumstances which required inquiries was into alcohol.  The first inquiries into commodities by the Fair Trade Commission were carried out many years ago and certainly were not into alcohol.  The matters which Deputy Corish felt had been ignored by the Government had previously been inquired into by the Fair Trade Commission.</P>

      <P>What happened at the time the increase was put on last May was that this was the only machinery open to me to deal with it.  In actual practice where the Commission found restrictive practices, I made an Order which I now want the Oireachtas to confirm, from the evidence gained at the inquiry, and I made another order, which does not need confirmation, in relation to the price of drink.  It was used before we had the amending legislation introduced last July.  But, in relation to the prices, which I am sure I am not in order in discussing but I think Deputy Corish would like me to answer him, the effective thing that was done in relation to prices since last July was the requirement of a three months' notice of any proposed increase.  That has been quite effective and each request or notification of an increase of price has been investigated by my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery:</NameTxt>
      <P>I did, and Deputies have criticised and said that we did nothing since.  Any manufacturer who proposes to put up his price has to go through this procedure to justify the increase.  This type of control is difficult, as Deputy Corish said, and I have had to be unreasonable with a good number of people but principles are beginning to show.  I have for example allowed increases in the cost of raw material which are outside the control of the manufacturer or increases in the <Col N="779" /> cost of imported material used to be passed on but I follow the principle of not allowing the manufacturer to increase his profit margin.  The Government have made clear their attitude to prices in the statement issued yesterday. I would say to Deputy Corish that I do not think it is just enough to say that we all have an increase in wages but that prices must stay as they are.  Prices must be related to wages as these naturally affect costs.</P>

We can improve our productivity if we try very hard and both sides of industry become very interested in this matter.  If we do not improve productivity, we will drive ourselves out of world markets and cause unemployment here.  Apart from any improvements we may get in productivity, if we give ourselves too much by way of wage increases it follows that prices must be affected.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to cater for the fact that occasionally a credit union finds it desirable to admit to membership a person other than a natural person.  That means a club or association or body corporate or incorporate, and so forth, which are based within the field of membership of credit unions and would normally qualify for membership in that connection; so, in order to remove any doubts on this point, it is considered desirable to change the word &ldquo;individuals&rdquo; to &ldquo;persons&rdquo;.  The latter word includes natural persons, partnerships and other groups, as I have stated.  I should add that group membership is recognised by section 20, subsection (3), which we will be coming to later on.  Finally, the word &ldquo;person&rdquo; is used elsewhere in the Bill and it seems desirable to use it here.</P>

    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to <Col N="781" /> cater for the fact that in certain areas&mdash; there was, in fact, a particular example of it&mdash;where the members of a particular credit union were drawn from different factories operating in the same area and most of them did not in fact reside in the area but outside of it and, furthermore, were not employed by a common employer, they would not, as they pointed out, come within the wording of the section as drafted and their credit union asked us to insert an appropriate amendment, which we agreed to do.</P>

      <P>This is an amendment to the main section, to delete the words &ldquo;for the purposes of this Act or for other provident and productive purposes&rdquo; and is really only a drafting amendment because the words &ldquo;for other provident and productive purposes&rdquo; might wrongly convey the impression that members' savings might be used for purposes outside the scope of the Act. This would be a wrong impression to convey.  The words &ldquo;for the purposes of the Act&rdquo; are not necessary since members' savings cannot be used for purposes outside the Act.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;(2)  A member of a credit union who ceases to have the common bond required of members of that credit union may retain membership therein and the credit union may continue to accept from that member money in respect of shares or deposits in the credit union and may make further loans to that member, <Col N="782" /> provided that his total indebtedness to the credit union does not exceed the sum of his shares and deposits in that credit union.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is in regard to membership and goes back to the basic principle that members must have a common bond. In drafting the Bill, it was considered logical that movement of a member from one place to another should involve that person in the loss of membership. However, the Credit Union League approached us in connection with that point and said that while the Bill as drafted is logical, it could operate very harshly against a person through a change in residence or for other such reason and it was suggested to us that this provision in the Bill should not be retained in its present rigorous form.  We understand that it is the normal practice for credit unions to have a slightly less rigorous procedure in regard to this than was contained in the original section of this Bill.  We accordingly agreed that they could continue to accept money in respect of shares on deposit and to make further loans, even though the member may have moved.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Having regard to the set up of a credit union and the coming together of a group of people to save for their own good purposes, we feel that bodies of this kind are quite competent to determine <Col N="783" /> their own membership at any given time and that full powers should be reposed in the annual general meeting of such a credit union to determine such membership.  We feel that it is unnecessary to bring the district court into the matter at all.  It is one of the basic constituents of a credit union that the control over membership should lie in the members themselves.</P>
    <P>The annual general meeting of a credit union would have before it the views of the committee and of the executive council and it is to be presumed that these would have full knowledge of the character, honesty and integrity of a person applying for membership.  That being so, the members of the union themselves would be the most competent people to determine who should be a member.  It would be in the best interests of the credit unions that any reference to the district court in this section should be set aside.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I find myself in disagreement with the amendment.  When we license, as we are licensing now, a bank or such other institution to carry on business, there are certain benefits that accrue from that business.  In the case of a credit union, those benefits will be enjoyed by the members, but, at the same time, the citizen has rights and in the event of a refusal to allow membership to a citizen, that citizen should have recourse to the law of the land.  I feel it is not right to leave as much power to an excellent organisation but one which could become an arbitrary organisation without the provisions of the original section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan:</NameTxt>
      <P>The principal objection to the amendment is the one outlined by Deputy Donegan.  Under the amendment if you have a dispute, one of the parties to that dispute is to be the final arbiter.  If a person is entitled to the benefit of membership, and these benefits are considerable, it is a very important matter to him whether or not he is admitted to membership. It seems only just that such a person should have an appeal against refusal outside the body which made the refusal in the first case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="784" /> The report of the Committee on Co-operative Societies recommended that clearly-defined eligibility for membership should be stated in the rules and they went on to state that a society should endeavour to ascertain a person's eligibility for membership.  The report also suggested that an appeal against refusal should lie either to the courts or to the Registrar of Friendly Societies.  I agree with that point of view.  Here we are giving a person so refused the right to go to the lowest court and the procedure involved will not be expensive.  All the person has to do is to state in writing the grounds of his appeal and he has a neutral person to adjudicate on the matter. It seems fundamentally wrong that where there is disagreement between two people, one of the parties to the dispute should have the final right to arbitrate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully:</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a point I would like to make on this matter.  It would be an impossible situation if the committee of a credit union felt that there were people whom they did not want in the union and they were told that they must take those people in, even though the people locally knew&mdash;and indeed it could be proven at national level&mdash;that they were people who could possibly wreck the union. There is in every organisation the danger that when a thing appears to be a success, people who did not want to touch it with a forty-foot pole want to come in on it.  The credit union, while it is growing pretty strongly, is still a very tender plant and could be pretty easily broken up by the wrong type of person getting in and doing certain things.  They are particularly anxious about the fact that the undesirable type of person, who can put up a face to those who do not know him, could go to the district court and get an order saying that he was entitled to be a member and could then say: &ldquo;I am here by right of law and I am going to do this, that and the other thing,&rdquo; and for no other reason than perhaps to show contempt for those already there, wreck all the hard work that had already been done.</P>

      <P>I do not for a second dispute that Deputy Tully has been in contact with certain unions and has got this impression but we had very lengthy discussions with the Credit Union League who suggested a whole series of amendments to us and at no stage did they suggest that this right of appeal to the district court should be deleted.  Furthermore, in regard to the type of person Deputy Tully mentions, the undesirable person, there are later in the Bill adequate methods for dealing with people who behave in an undesirable way.  They can be expelled from the credit union if they carry on in a fashion which is contrary to the rules of the union.  In the case of expulsion, the person will have the right of appeal to the district court.  It seems fair that in the first instance a person should have an appeal to some body other than the other party involved and that if it is a question of expulsion, he would not be unjustly expelled either.  You will find when we come to it that if there is this type of person in the credit union&mdash;and I have no doubt that people who will prove to be undesirable will get into many of these unions&mdash;there are perfectly adequate provisions for dealing with them.</P>

      <P>The trouble is that we are in the difficulty that the undesirable who is expelled in normal circumstances is finished with but here he has the right of appeal to the district court.  I distinctly remember the case of a man employed by a fairly sizeable farmer as a van driver. He was a pretty bad van driver and the employer tried to dismiss him. The man went to the Garda and succeeded in having a driving test, before driving tests were established, and got a certificate to say that he was competent. He was then able to say: &ldquo;I am entitled to be here.&rdquo;  I can see the same circumstances arising here, <Col N="786" /> where an undesirable will be able to put up a plausible case in court and finish up as the big boss in the local society.  The result will be that through his action, or inaction, he will wreck it.  I hope it will not happen but this is one of the matters about which people are annoyed.</P>

      <P>I just do not see this.  As I see it, if certain capital is to be channelled into a credit union in an area, particularly the sort of area with which Deputy Tully and I deal, the people within that area should be entitled to get the benefits therefrom, unless they are extremely undesirable people.  The right to go to the district court, even in regard to expulsion or on the question of admittance, is wise and proper.  I do not agree with Deputy Tully in regard to the question of an undesirable man going to the district court and ending up as the big boss of the union.  I do not think that is a practical possibility.  One might as well say that the customer of a bank would end up as the bank manager.</P>

      <P>The customer will have only one vote.  Before he ends up as a director or a member of the committee, he will have to have a majority to put him there.  If he is undesirable, he will not have that majority.  There is the possibility that perhaps a clique &mdash;and when I use that word in this connection, I do not wish to be misunderstood&mdash;might develop in charge of the credit union and might wish to exclude or include certain persons.  In this situation it is only right that there should be an appeal.  The Parliamentary Secretary's point in this regard is the right one, that there is no point in appealing to an interested party.  The whole point is that the appeal is to an arbitrator, to another person who is not involved, who has competence and who will give a fair decision.  I do not want to find myself arguing against Deputy Tully on this but that is how I see it, and I am a director of a credit union myself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 9, to delete subsection (6) and substitute the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(6) (a)  A credit union shall not make a loan to a person who is a member of its board of directors, Membership Committee, Supervisory Committee or Credit Committee except with the unanimous approval by secret ballot of a special committee present when the loan is considered, which special committee shall consist of a majority of the board of directors, a majority of the Credit Committee (if any) and at least one member of the Supervisory Committee, but shall not include the applicant for the loan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  A credit union shall not accept from a person who is a member of its board of directors, <Col N="789" /> Membership Committee, Supervisory Committee or Credit Committee a guarantee for a loan by the credit union to another member of the credit union.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is again a relaxation of the Bill at the request of the Credit Union League.  As at present drafted, subsection (6) limits borrowing by any of the officers to an amount equivalent to the total of shares and deposits pledged as security for his loans.  The object of this was to prevent abuses by unscrupulous officers who might be tempted to provide loans for themselves in improper circumstances or against inadequate security.  The history of the co-operative movement indicates the need for safeguards against abuses of this kind.  The Credit Union League, however, argues that a restriction of that kind could have the effect of preventing less well off persons from seeking and retaining office since they would often want to borrow beyond the limit prescribed.  The League felt the officers concerned should enjoy the same borrowing rights as members in general except that the unanimous approval of a special committee representative of the directors, the Credit Committee and the Supervisory Committee should be required.  The amendment gives effect to that recommendation. I feel the demand for unanimity is a sufficient safeguard and accordingly we are proposing this amendment.</P>

    <P>This arises because one of the major difficulties that have been encountered in the co-operative movement over the years is that members tend to be elected year after year.  Indeed, that situation is not confined to experience in credit unions.  After some time they begin to look on the society as a sort of private affair of their own and they may begin to neglect the interests of the general body of members.  Our original intention in drafting the section was to guard against that development. In theory, it sounds a very good thing but for practical reasons the Credit Union League were opposed to it.  It is quite difficult to get experienced and knowledgeable people&mdash;and people who have an interest as well&mdash; to act as directors of credit unions.  A statutory provision such as the one in the Bill as it stands would seriously reduce the available pool of persons and as a result would be likely to slow up the development of the credit union movement.  The effect of the amendment is to permit credit unions the option of adopting or rejecting the rule set out in subsection (3).  I suppose in practice this means most credit unions will opt to retain.  I should also add I gave a good deal of consideration to the possibility of devising some form of rotating system which could be incorporated in the Act but it did not prove practicable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully:</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is wrong that this should be included. The amendment says that except where the rules otherwise provide a person shall not be eligible.  The Parliamentary Secretary and Deputy Donegan, both of whom had considerable experience in the GAA world, know that most of the football clubs down the country are run by the same people over a period of years.  If a rule such as this were introduced, the clubs would disappear in a very short time.  Similarly, if it were suggested that county councillors could serve only three years as <Col N="792" /> Dáil Deputies, there would be an outcry by them.  In many credit unions, practically the same people have held office for some time; they have the experience and they have the respect of the members.  It would be entirely wrong if it were written into the law that they would have to be removed after a certain limited period.  For that reason I think the section should not be included at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan:</NameTxt>
      <P>The thinking behind the section is probably right.  In regard to the GAA, one of my experiences was to be expelled for playing rugby. I had considerable experience before that sad event.  As I see it, this works in two ways.  There is the small credit union in the country parish; there is the possibility, as I said before on a different section, of a clique developing, people almost owning the credit union, and that situation has been mentioned by the Parliamentary Secretary. At the same time, there is the difficulty that you might not have available the requisite number of officers of the standard that would be desired, and this would leave it up to the credit union in a particular instance to do what it would wish.  I think, on balance, it is the best solution.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment was put down because a particular credit union asked that the period be extended to ten days, and we have reached a compromise at seven.  It is obviously desirable that the election of officers should take place as soon as possible after the meeting at which directors are elected and I suppose what normally happens is that the two meetings are held on the same evening, with <Col N="793" /> those involved waiting on.  However, there does not seem to be any objection, in principle, to the extension to seven days from five.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;(8)  The rules shall provide for the signature of at least two officers of the credit union on all conveyances of property of the credit union <Col N="794" /> and on all cheques, drafts, notes and other obligations of the credit union and on all transfers by the credit union of shares or other investments.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The desirability of having two signatures on the cheques is recognised in all clubs, societies and so forth, and there is no need for me to say anything further on that.  However, some difficulty in drafting was encountered as it is necessary to provide for the possibility of one or both of the officers being away or not being available. Ultimately, it was decided to deal only with conveyances of property and the subsection as drafted is limited to conveyances of property. Nevertheless, we feel, after consultation with the Chairman of the Committee of Co-operative Societies, that this is not enough and that some attempt should be made to deal with the dual signatures on cheques and so fourth. The amendment as now proposed achieves this and, at the same time, permits the credit union to decide in its rules which particular two officers will do the signing in the normal course and what substitution will be allowed. This applies, as the House will note, to the transfer of shares or other investments, and so forth, where any obligation is incurred on behalf of the union.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment arises from the fact that the quorum as in the Bill is 30 per cent and we have had representations from several sides to the effect that this was too high.  It is obviously considered desirable that members of the credit union should take an active part in its affairs, and general participation in its working is of the essence of the co-operative idea.  The Credit Union League pointed out, however, that in practice it is not easy to get <Col N="795" /> members to come to meetings and I do not have to explain that to Deputy Tully and Deputy Treacy.  People may be very interested but they do not come along; accordingly we have agreed to reduce the quorum from 30 per cent to ten per cent or 15 members, whichever is the lesser, as is dealt with in amendment No. 16.</P>

In that situation, which would not be a weird one in an ordinary country parish, it might well be that a meeting of two people could make decisions which would not be in accordance with the wishes of the general body.  I know that the thinking behind this amendment is good and proper, but I wonder whether the percentage could not be looked at before Report Stage to see whether ten per cent is right or a little too low. I think we should move from 30 per cent but I am not sure whether we have moved too far in the case of the small credit union.

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="797" /> The Minister's amendment came in after my amendment.  I tabled this amendment because I felt that, whilst this committee was absolutely necessary, it could consist of persons nominated by a Minister who would not have the same sympathy with credit unions as many of us here have and I felt that one member at least should be a representative of the Credit Union League of Ireland.  This would have the effect of leavening the committee and would make it a more helpful committee.</P>
    <P>I notice the Minister has changed the situation in his amendment; every person appointed shall be appointed by reason of such person's knowledge of matters pertaining to credit unions.  But that does not mean that he cannot appoint persons who are ex-bankers or civil servants and who are not associated with credit unions.  He is not bound to appoint even one person with a practical knowledge of matters pertaining to credit unions.  If my amendment were accepted, I feel it would be of great help.  If there is a clash between my amendment and amendment No. 19 from a drafting point of view, then I suggest the spirit of my amendment could be incorporated on the Fourth Stage.  It is right there should be a representative of the Credit Union of Ireland on this committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan:</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason the official amendment was put in after Deputy Donegan's was that we had direct representations from the Credit Union League in regard to this matter. We also had certain other representations. I was anxious to discuss this with the Credit Union League and I had two of the most important officials of the League to see me a short time ago.  There are certain difficulties in the proposal that the League itself should be named in the Bill.  In the first place, the League is not registered under any Act of Parliament and its legal status is somewhat indefinite.  If the name of the League were incorporated in the Bill, there would be nothing to stop the League changing its name in a few years' time.  It would <Col N="798" /> then be necessary to bring in amending legislation to cater for that situation.</P>
      <P>Unless there are very cogent reasons indeed, it is not generally desirable to name any particular society in an Act of Parliament.  Let us face it: even though this particular society is of the highest standing and repute, it may not always remain so. This applies to every institution now in good standing but which may not be in good standing at some future date.  We should look foolish if we were not to take account of these facts. We did say, of course, that as a matter of practice, there would certainly be at least one and, in fact, probably more than one member of the Credit Union League appointed by the Minister.  It is obvious to the House that a <i>rapport</i> has been established between the League and the Department.  Both parties are satisfied that the other is doing its best and we are anxious that the Credit Union because of its activity, status and so forth, should have people on the committee whom the Minister would appoint but, for the reasons I have mentioned, and for other reasons, I find considerable difficulty in actually incorporating the name of the League in the Bill itself.</P>
      <P>We do, of course, go a considerable distance in clause (b) of my amendment, which reads:</P>
      <P>Every person appointed to membership of the Credit Union Advisory Committee shall be chosen by the Minister for such appointment by reason of such person's knowledge of matters pertaining to credit unions or because he is capable of giving substantial practical assistance in the work of the Committee.</P>
      <P>This was accepted and agreed to by the representatives of the League as being completely satisfactory to them. It is right to say they were under some misapprehension as to what our intentions were in regard to the advisory committee and I am glad to say that we have dispelled their doubts and achieved full agreement in regard to the amendment.  Perhaps, in those circumstances, Deputy Donegan would withdraw his amendment.</P>

      <P>I do not entirely accept the position indicated by the Parliamentary Secretary that the Credit Union League of Ireland has in fact no legal standing.  After all, it has been created by the constitution of the Credit Unions.  It is their headquarters body.  It would appear impossible to me to be any other body than the Credit Union League of Ireland, seeing that the name is now accepted and is enshrined in the constitution of the credit unions.  I accept, however, the Minister's assurance to me that the Credit Union League of Ireland, with which he was dealing, has been placated on this matter and that they are happy. Personally, I should prefer, from my experience of Parliamentary activity and legislation within this House, that the Minister, whoever he might be, would be bound more closely.  However, if it is their view that everything is all right, though they can part with me on that point, I shall certainly withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel it is wrong that the credit union should be forbidden by law to advertise.  I agree with the thought behind credit unions or a section of society or employees at a factory or any group of people brought together by their ordinary lives, but while that is true, there may be situations in which the credit union might desire to advertise so as to receive greater sums in investment at a time when they would be pressed for finances and would desire to advertise so as to give people, who do not know, at that stage, the benefits that can accrue from membership of a credit union, information as to these benefits. I think section 32 is a mistake and that the credit union should be allowed to advertise.</P>
      <P>I do not foresee advertisements from credit unions on Telefís Éireann, such as we see at the present moment from building societies, seeking funds.  I do not think it would ever go that far. However, I think that the provision that credit unions may not advertise is a mistake.  I should like to hear the Parliamentary Secretary comment on that matter now, before we proceed any further.</P>

      <P>The position here is, as Deputy Donegan knows, that very large-scale frauds have been perpetrated on the public in this country.  We must take whatever steps it is necessary to take in this Bill to protect the public against fraud.  The section as it stands now is modified, at least to some extent, by an amendment to section 35, to which we shall be coming later.  The effect of this amendment is to enable the Minister, after consultation with his advisory committee, to relax the restriction to such extent as he may consider desirable.  I have in mind, for instance, a circular type of progress report that a credit union may send to its members in a confined locality.  This is not national advertising but it is letting those who have a common bond know the position in printed form. That may not be described as advertising within the meaning of the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Minister now has or will have, if the House agrees to the amendment, the power by regulation to allow <Col N="801" /> such advertising as he, after consultation with the advisory committee, thinks proper.  This also was a matter which was discussed at some length with the representatives of the Credit Union League.  They, having originally expressed uneasiness, as Deputy Donegan has now, about the blanket prohibition in section 32, also expressed their approval of the relaxing arrangement under section 35 which will enable the Minister at the one time to keep firm control, in pursuance of section 32, while allowing such limited advertising as he may consider desirable. In other words, so far as form is considered, the Minister will always be in control: he will have to be fully satisfied that any form of advertising is necessary before, by regulation, he will permit it.  I foresee circumstances in which the Minister would, in practice, make a regulation allowing an advertisement in certain form and subject to whatever regulations he would prescribe.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I see, in the growth of credit unions, a very real intrusion upon the money that is collected by way of investment from the citizens of this country and its application.  Money that would go to commercial banks, post offices and a lot of other places such as building societies will now go to credit unions.  If this growth were encouraged by advertisements, I could well see a situation arising whereby the volume of business done by credit unions would become much greater than the volume of business done by building societies and the Post Office and it would certainly be something that would appear in the little blue book we get at every Budget time that is called the Capital Budget.  Let us face the fact that the Minister and the Cabinet have a vested interest in this because availability of capital or shortage of capital affects their administration. The channelling of capital into credit unions means that it will be locally employed and employed towards individual citizens of the State through an agency which has no relation to central Government.  I am not saying the Government want to restrict the expansion of credit unions but I say that section 32, notwithstanding <Col N="802" /> the amendment mentioned by the Parliamentary Secretary to section 35, does give the Minister that power.</P>
      <P>Even though the Parliamentary Secretary has indicated to me that the representatives of the Credit Union League of Ireland have had their doubts and fears allayed by his assurances, I would now say that I am getting a little worried about the fact that he has been far too efficient in allaying these doubts and fears because these people have not perhaps been as long on the road looking at legislation and its application afterwards as the Parliamentary Secretary and I have.  We never know what sort of a Minister we shall get the next time.  While the Parliamentary Secretary and his senior colleague may have every desire to expand credit unions, nevertheless, when they have got a bit bigger, I could well imagine a successor of the Parliamentary Secretary on any side of the House taking the view that further expansion of credit unions might be contrary to the laudable desire he might have of channelling a larger percentage of capital towards Government coffers.  That is why I object strenuously to the refusal to allow advertising by credit unions.  Is it not true that we all believe that credit unions will handle a larger volume of money in a few years' time than the Post Office or the building societies? I use these as examples because the other example, the commercial banks, is so much bigger business that one could never see the credit unions coming up to even ten per cent of the volume of business transacted by commercial banks.</P>
      <P>This is a bad provision.  It is the only amendment about which I have strong views.  It would be far better if this section were removed from the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Deputy Donegan in his criticism of this section.  I cannot understand the reasoning of the Parliamentary Secretary in the case he makes for the section, which positively restricts a credit union from advertising its affairs to its members or advertising any aspect of its financial affairs.  This <Col N="803" /> kind of restriction must hinder the growth of a credit union.  It does not apply, I think, to any other savings group.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy:</NameTxt>
      <P>We must, therefore, assume some form of bias in regard to this section, especially since one must remember that credit unions are world-wide and this is not merely an Irish association for thrift and lending money to members at reduced rates of interest.  This is a world-wide organisation and it is reasonable to assume that it grew to world dimensions as a result of propaganda in regard to the intrinsic worth of credit unions as such.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary seemed to feel that if he allowed credit unions to advertise <i>ad lib</i>, it might not have good effects.  When one recalls that the primary purpose of credit unions here and in many other countries is to eliminate usury and fraud, the Parliamentary Secretary should have more confidence in the Irish organisation and the high principles to which they adhere and should allow them the liberty which all other groups have to advertise themselves.</P>
      <P>I disagree with Deputy Donegan when he goes on to suggest, perhaps, a rivalry between the Post Office and the banks and the credit unions.  There were fears of such rivalry but it is now clearly understood that the resources of the credit unions are deposited in some of the banks&mdash;in which, is a matter of indifference&mdash;and the capital is available at large to the banks, the Post Office, possibly, and the Government.  I see no rivalry but I see an inhibition or bias and a very serious restriction on the growth of the credit movement in this country if credit unions are to be debarred from advertising the advantages which membership has to offer to the general public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will have another look at the section <Col N="804" /> and I feel sure he will satisfy himself that it is too rigid.  I am mindful of his remarks in respect of section 35 but again any advertisement in respect of the credit unions would be solely at the discretion of the Minister in power and he would determine, I should imagine, what he would allow them to advertise and that might not be sufficient for the aims of the Credit League of Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Treacy has well taken a point on which I think Deputy Donegan is in error in suggesting that if credit unions absorb a great deal of money, this would be to the disadvantage of the Government.  On the contrary, the more money they get, the better I like it.</P>
      <P>I assure Deputy Treacy that there is no bias whatever against the credit union movement.  It is not because of bias that this Bill was introduced or because of bias that the proposals of the Credit Union League and all other individual credit unions and individual citizens who made suggestions to us have been so carefully considered.  It must be obvious that a credit union is in a different position from any other type of society by reason of the fact that it is composed of people who have a common bond and that membership is confined to those who have that common bond.  Since there is this common bond, then, <i>a fortiori,</i> it is not necessary to advertise.  But in case either Deputy Treacy or Deputy Donegan consider we are being biased &mdash;which is far from true&mdash;I certainly undertake between now and Report Stage to have another look at this section with a view to modifying the section itself rather than keeping the machinery which I proposed a few moments ago, namely, that the Minister should have power by regulation to control the extent to which advertising could be done by a credit union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should also like to add that if, as Deputy Treacy said, the credit union movement is world-wide, so is credit union legislation and the prohibition against advertising contained in this Bill is not peculiar to this country but operates in some other countries because of the fact that a <Col N="805" /> credit union exists with people or individuals or a group who have a common bond and cannot otherwise exist. I will see what can be done, in view of the points raised by the Deputies, to water down this section but I do wish to repeat that the Minister has an obligation to protect the public against fraud.  In saying that, I am not for a moment suggesting that the Credit Union League or anybody connected with it is now or at any time in the future likely to commit fraud.  What I am saying is that frauds do occur as a result of advertisements and that it is our duty and it will be the Minister's duty and continuing obligation to ensure that he has the power to prevent persons under any guise from attracting funds from the public by means which turn out to be fradulent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatHogan" hpid="Mr. P. Hogan (South Tipperary) Mr. P. Hogan (South Tipperary)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> I am pleased that the Parliamentary Secretary has told us that he will have another look at it.  He mentioned something I did not know, namely, that advertising for credit unions is restricted, if not prohibited, in many other countries.  I envisage this credit union movement as a co-operative savings movement.  Our position here financially might be a little different from many other countries in so far as money can so freely move out of the country at a rate which we cannot afford.  It seems to me that we should not limit advertising by a credit union which essentially conserves money here and keeps it here while at the same time we allow free advertising, for example, by finance houses.  One need only go down to Grafton Street and withdraw all the money one has and get a higher rate of interest than is obtainable in the commercial banks. As to what happens to that money afterwards, we appear to have no particular knowledge or control.  It seems to me that money could easily move out of the country through organisations like that which are quite free to advertise here and at the same time we are putting restrictions upon what is a savings movement and would tend to conserve and keep money here. In fact, it would appear that if too many restrictions are imposed as regards <Col N="806" /> advertising, our credit union movement will be just a system of little money boxes in every parish and will not become anything worth while.</P>
      <P>I admit, the Parliamentary Secretary is worried about the question of fraud but I would suggest that he might be able to think up some other sections to embody in the Bill to circumvent the possibility of fraud and at the same time allow a little more latitude on the question of advertising so that we would allow this movement a little better opportunity to expand because I think it is essentially good and will prevent money leaving the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased to hear that.  I just want to make one point against the Parliamentary Secretary.  I do not see the relation between advertising and fraud about which he tells us.  He says that frauds resulted from advertising.  People get shot as a result of other people having guns but that does not mean that I should be refused a licence for my shotgun.  One has to be extremely clear on this.  I do not accept at all that advertising by a credit union would tend to make them more prone to fraud.  I do not mind discussing fraud in relation to credit unions or any financial institution because it is our job on Committee Stage here to do that sort of thing and to think up all the odd sorts of situations that might occur.  That is what we are being paid an allowance for once a month.  I do not see that relation and I do not see why a credit union that was advertising would be more prone to fraud than any other credit union, with the exception that they might have to pay the cost of advertising and might for that reason be spending more than they should.  I do not see how advertising affects the common bond and I do not see why a common bond removes the necessity for advertising.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would just like to give an example &mdash;Drogheda town, with something less than 20,000 population&mdash;where the credit union movement is but at the initial stages and where the good <Col N="807" /> curates of that town are trying to push it forward.  I could easily imagine a situation whereby men in factories &mdash; the cement factory employing 800 or 900 persons &mdash; would not know anything about the credit union if there were not some means of advertising that if they left 10/- of their wages behind every week as a saving, they would be in a position at any time to walk into a credit union office and get cash whereby they could make a bargain for a television set at cash price rather than buy it on the instalment system at the colossal rates of interest mentioned by Deputy Hogan.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary, in friendship, seeing that he is going to look at it before Report Stage, to examine it from the point of view that I have expressed.  For instance, I have in my pocket for a constituent &mdash; I am aware that exhibits are unparliamentary and therefore not allowed &mdash; an advertisement for farm credit bonds from the excellent Agricultural Credit Corporation and also an advertisement detailing the extra one per cent available for larger amounts left for a period of more than three months.  This sort of advertising is extremely necessary so that the organisation will get that sort of investment.  I hope what I am saying will be read not only by anybody interested but by the officers of the Credit Union League of Ireland.  The necessity for advertising does exist in the case of credit unions.  I am more than thankful to the Parliamentary Secretary for the kind way he has met us here today and for the fact that he will look at it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. B. Lenihan):</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>I would like, initially, to give Deputies a very short résumé of what the Bill contains.  Its main object is to give lessees and certain yearly tenants who pay a group rent the right to purchase the fee simple of their property, that is, to acquire the greatest estate in land that can be acquired under our law.  Persons who have to collect rent from neighbouring lessees and pay the total to a common landlord are being given the right to obtain an apportionment of the rent, following which each lessee will pay his portion of the rent direct to the landlord. Where disputes or difficulties arise with regard to the exercise of these rights a simplified system of arbitration by county registrars is being established to cater for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the matters which the county registrar will be able to settle is the purchase price of a ground rent where <Col N="811" /> the parties cannot agree.  To reduce to the very minimum the possible field of disagreement a maximum purchase price is being provided where the land is held under a yearly tenancy or under a lease which has not less than 25 years to run and where the land does not exceed an acre; in that event the purchase price will be such sum as would enable the landlord to maintain his income if he had invested the purchase money in the most recent National Loan.</P>
    <P>The Bill also amends, in a number of respects, the existing landlord and tenant law.  It reduces from one-sixth to one-eighth the fraction of the gross rent which will be payable when a reversionary lease is given on the expiration of a building or proprietary lease pursuant to the Landlord and Tenant (Reversionary Leases) Act, 1958.  It provides that, where a landlord relaxes a covenant restricting change of user or the carrying out of minor improvements, he will not be entitled to gain financially, and that, where planning permission for such works has been obtained, it will not be necessary to obtain the landlord's consent at all.  It deems a covenant in a lease requiring the lessee to insure with a named insurance company to be one which does not specify such a company.  It abolishes the general rule that the lessee must bear the lessor's costs of drawing up the lease.  Finally, it provides that certain covenants will continue to have effect after purchase of the fee simple, namely, covenants which protect the lessor's own amenities or which are required to enable the lessor to comply with a statutory obligation.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the main purpose of the Bill is the introduction to Irish law of the principle of leasehold enfranchisement. Over the years there has been a great deal of argument for and against this principle.  These arguments were fully considered by the Ground Rents Commission, which came down unequivocally on the side of giving lessees the right to become fee simple owners of their property.  I do not intend to go into the arguments for and against leasehold enfranchisement except perhaps to say that I consider <Col N="812" /> it fully in keeping with good social policy.  The law should encourage private ownership of houses and householders should be allowed to become full owners of their houses, if they so wish.  Indeed, I am happy to be in a position to sponsor legislation which will, I hope, mark the end of this thorny question, and I am particularly happy that the solution has been recommended unanimously by a Commission who were highly qualified to deal with all aspects of the matter.</P>
    <P>The persons who are to enjoy the right to purchase the fee simple are building and proprietary lessees within the meaning of the 1958 Act and certain yearly tenants.  It is generally accepted that these persons are those who might be said to own the &ldquo;bricks and mortar&rdquo; interest in their property subject to the payment of a ground rent.  The right is being given to these persons irrespective of the use to which they put the property &mdash; that is whether the premises are used for business purposes or for residential purposes.  The Commission proposed that the right of purchase should be given to lessees of residential and composite residential and business property.  The Government have decided that it should also be given in respect of purely business premises.  As far as leasehold enfranchisement is concerned I see no logic in distinguishing between property owners by reference to the uses to which the property is put.  The essential distinction is that between the owners of the bricks and mortar interest in the property &mdash; and all others.</P>
    <P>Naturally, the question of the purchase price gave the Commission and myself a great deal of difficulty.  The Commission suggested a rather elaborate formula which required that a number of criteria be considered in deciding upon the purchase price, the main one being that the price should be what a willing purchaser would pay and a willing vendor accept for the interest.  They rejected the idea that the price be related to a specific number of years purchase as this must inevitably, in certain cases, be unjust either to the landlord or the tenant. While I accept that the provision of a specified purchase price by reference to a given number of years purchase <Col N="813" /> would lead to anomalies as feared by the Commission, I have been strongly of opinion that the absence of some clear indication to prospective purchasers as to what the purchase price should be would be a practical defect in the legislation.  The resulting uncertainly would deter leaseholders who would otherwise avail themselves of the facilities given by the Bill.  It would tend to encourage litigation where the amount in dispute would not be considerable. The solution which the Bill proposes will, I hope, prove satisfactory. It is that the formula suggested by the Commission will apply to all cases but that, in addition, the price so decided shall be subject to a maximum in practically all cases.  The maximum price will be a sum which if invested in the most recent National Loan would give a gross income equivalent to the rent being purchased. This will ensure that landlords, whose interests are being compulsorily acquired, will be able to maintain their income.</P>
    <P>It is, in my opinion, necessary to approach this whole question from the point of view of maintaining the landlord's income because in a large number of cases the landlords may be the trustees of a charity or policyholders in an insurance company and any legislative provision providing for a purchase price which would result in a drop in their income could have serious financial results not alone in relation to the reduced income but also by reference to a drop in the value of their assets.  The maximum will apply in all purchases pursuant to the Act except where the lease has less than 25 years to run or where the land demised is over an acre in extent.</P>
    <P>The exclusion from the maximum price provision of larger properties raises the difficult problem of potential development value.  It is sometimes argued that a landlord's interest in leasehold property consists not only of the value of his rent but also the fact that he may be able to share in the increased value of the site on redevelopment.  As against this it is argued that the landlord can never benefit from potential development value during the currency of the <Col N="814" /> lease without the lessee's first taking the necessary steps towards redevelopment.</P>
    <P>The solution adopted in the Bill is based on the practical view that in smallish properties the landlord's chances of realising any share of the redevelopment value are very slight and that purchase of the fee simple by reference to the rent only is fair in such cases.  However, where there is a good deal of land accompanying the property the purchase of the fee simple could mean freedom from a covenant restricting development and could result in a windfall of several thousand pounds to the lessee who had bought the fee simple on the basis of a small rent.  This is particularly important where such properties were originally leased at low rents for the purpose of retaining an open character in a neighbourhood or for providing sporting amenities.  I consider that drawing the line at an acre of land is a fair solution to this problem. In cases where the lands are extensive the purchase price will, in default of agreement, be determined by the county registrar who will have regard <i>inter alia</i> to the nature of the land, its location and user, to the current price of similar property and to any other matters which he considers relevant &mdash; in short, to all the various criteria which the Commission recommended should be taken into account.</P>
    <P>The exclusion from the maximum purchase price of leases with less than 25 years to run is consistent with the Commission's recommendation that the current rent should be taken into account in deciding the purchase price only where the lease had at least 25 years to run.  This recognises that on termination of the lease the landlord is entitled under the 1958 Act to increase the ground rent to a sixth of the gross rent.  This prospect of an increased rent has a present value which becomes greater as the lease runs out.  I accept the Commission's view that this value is of no significance when the prospective increase is 25 years or more away.</P>
    <P>Next to the purchase price, perhaps the most important question the prospective purchaser will ask himself is <Col N="815" /> what will the costs be.  This is a question which is very difficult to answer because the circumstances affecting leases differ very widely.  Some leases which are held direct from the fee simple owner will not present very much difficulty and the costs involved in purchasing the fee simple will not be very great.  On the other hand, there may be a number of intermediate interests between the purchasing lessee and the fee simple owner.  Naturally, in such cases the purchase of the fee simple will give rise to greater difficulty and the costs will be greater.  Apart from the ordinary costs of conveying the fee simple, costs may also be involved in disputes when the parties cannot agree on any question arising on a proposed purchase.  I think it would be generally agreed that very little can be done to avoid the necessary costs of conveyance; such costs will be borne by the lessee who is compulsorily acquiring the interest.  I think this is fair.  However, the lessee can go to the county registrar if he feels the costs are unreasonable and the latter can award costs against any party who has been unreasonable.</P>
    <P>Very careful attention has been given to keeping the costs of settling disputes to a minimum.  Because of the provision in the Bill for a maximum purchase price very few cases should have to come before any county registrar. In addition, a procedure by which the county registrar will decide the issue is provided which is as simple and inexpensive as possible.  I think that this procedure should prove effective and satisfactory to all parties in the type of case which will come before a county registrar.  By way of a safeguard, however, there is provision for an appeal against an award of the county registrar to the Circuit Court so that, in effect, the traditional jurisdiction of that court in landlord and tenant matters is being preserved.  Finally, the provision that costs may be awarded against any party who has been unreasonable should go a long way towards keeping costs to a minimum. To sum up, what is being provided is, in effect, a simple procedure to enable parties to settle, by arbitration, disputes which in most instances will relate to <Col N="816" /> small amounts of money in such a way as to avoid costs as far as possible; a procedure, moreover, which does not exclude recourse to the courts if this should prove necessary in any case.</P>
    <P>I would now like to deal with the miscellaneous amendments proposed in the Bill.  Perhaps the most important of these, from the practical point of view, is that which proposes to reduce the rent payable when a lease is renewed under the 1958 Act from one-sixth of the gross rent as defined in that Act to one-eighth of that rent.  The gross rent, introduced in the Landlord and Tenant Act, 1931, and repeated with some modifications in the 1958 Act, is a national rent.  It is not the actual open market rent but a rent arrived at by the court on the basis that the demand and the supply of the type of premises in question is in equilibrium and the tenant agrees to do all repairs, pay rates and take out fire insurance.</P>
    <P>This formula should have produced, one might say, a level of gross rents which was not affected by the scarcity of premises for letting in recent years. A gross rent fixed this year should, for instance, be the same as a gross rent fixed back in 1958 subject only to an increase to compensate for the change in the value of money. In fact, however, the increases since 1958 have been much greater than the decline in the value of money.  The Bill accordingly proposes to reduce the fraction mentioned in the 1958 Act from one-sixth to one-eighth.  This is calculated to ensure that a rent under a reversionary lease fixed by the courts will be fair, having regard to the decline in the value of money and the corresponding rents being charged when the 1958 Act was passed.</P>
    <P>The Bill also proposes that future alterations in this fraction may be made by way of a Ministerial order. To have effect, however, the order will need to be approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  It is clear that the gross rent formula does not provide a static measure which will ensure a fair rent on reversion and that, accordingly, it is not unreasonable to envisage that periodical alterations in the fraction may become necessary and should <Col N="817" /> be provided for.  For such an alteration I think that to proceed by way of legislation would be unnecessarily elaborate and that the requirement of prior approval by both Houses of the Oireachtas enables the net issue involved to be fully ventilated beforehand.</P>
    <P>It is also provided in the Bill that where a lessee proposes to change the user of premises or carry out minor improvements contrary to a convenant in his lease the landlord must not make any financial gain from giving consent.  It is already provided in the 1931 Act that the landlord must not unreasonably withhold his consent and that he cannot make any financial gain from consenting to a change of user except where structural alterations are involved.  The Bill also proposes, as a logical extension of these provisions, to enable a lessee who has already obtained planning permission for a change of user of minor alterations to go ahead with the work without getting the consent of the landlord.  Taken together, these provisions mark the passing from private control to the control of the planning authority of any work which a house-owner wishes to undertake by way of a change of user of the premises or small additional buildings or alterations.</P>
    <P>In this connection I would like to stress that the landlord's control over bigger works is not being affected.  The `improvement' is defined in the 1958 Act to mean an addition to or an alteration of a building or the erection of ancillary or subsidiary structures but not including any alteration or reconstruction of the buildings so that they lose their original identity.  While therefore a lessee who wants to put up a small front porch or any other subsidiary or ancillary structures would be free to go ahead once he gets planning permission, anybody who wants to build on a hotel or a factory or engage in housing development on the unbuilt-on land will still need the permission of his landlord if there is a covenant in his lease prohibiting change of user or the building of additional structures.  Of course, in the latter case the lessee will now have the alternative of purchasing the fee simple <Col N="818" /> if he cannot agree terms for relaxation of a covenant with the landlord.</P>
    <P>The only other matter of real importance arising on this Bill is the question of restrictive covenants generally. The Ground Rents Commission recommended that convenants protecting the amenities of a district should run with the land following purchase and should be enforceable by the planning authority and by the former landlord in certain circumstances.  This is a matter to which I have given very close attention.  I am satisfied that under planning legislation the planning authorities have sufficient powers to achieve the desired measure of control formerly exercised by means of such covenants and that a specific provision enabling them to enforce these covenants would be superfluous. Making former landlords responsible for the enforcement of such covenants would be ineffectual and would, in most cases, be unwelcome to such landlords.</P>
    <P>Accordingly the provision in the Bill on this matter is that the amenity covenants will lapse on the purchase of the fee simple and that the purchaser will be the fee simple owner in the fullest sense.  There are only two cases where I have considered it reasonable to make an exception to this principle.  I refer to covenants which protect the lessor's own personal amenities and covenants which are required to enable the lessor to comply with a statutory liability imposed on him.  Such a covenant might, for example, specify that the lessee will not build over a certain height so as to obstruct the view from the lessor's own residence; or, say in a lease of railway lands, there might be a covenant allowing the lessor access to the lands so as to maintain bridges, drains, etc. as required of the railway company under statute.  The distinction between this type of covenant and the ordinary covenants designed to protect the general amenities of a neighbourhood is that the restrictions imposed in the first case are specific in operation, are reflected in the rent reserved under the lease and cannot be satisfactorily provided for by planning legislation.  The covenants normally <Col N="819" /> inserted in leases to protect neighbourhood amenities, such as covenants as to user and the erection of further buildings, are general in their operation and planning legislation caters for them substantially.</P>
    <P>In connection with covenants which will survive purchase, I would like to mention that I propose to introduce, on the Committee Stage, an amendment which will ensure that section 27, which proposes that a lessee may change user or carry out minor improvements without the lessor's consent, will not operate to nullify the provisions which propose to preserve these particular covenants.</P>
    <P>I hope that the explanatory memorandum will be of assistance to Deputies.  Some of the provisions in the Bill are, of necessity, complex and it has been difficult to envisage all the specific problems of a practical nature which may arise when the Bill becomes law.  This is particularly so because of the great variety of leases and tenancies which exist.  For this reason I would like to stress that any suggestions for detailed amendment of the provisions of the Bill will be most carefully considered.  As I see it, the general principles in the Bill are acceptable to all of us; but as it is a measure which is concerned with a great deal of matters of detailed procedure, that this will be &mdash; I think Deputies will agree with me &mdash; a Committee Stage Bill.  I look forward to a very useful discussion of the various provisions at that stage.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to repeat how pleased I am to bring before the Oireachtas a Bill which marks so definite a break with the traditional concepts underlying the relationship of landlord and tenant, namely the introduction of the doctrine of leasehold enfranchisement.  Irrespective of the extent to which the rights given in this Bill are used, their very existence will be of the utmost significance in the future.  I am very conscious of the great work which was done in the investigation of this problem by the Ground Rents Commission under the chairmanship of Judge Conroy.  Despite the many difficulties involved, the Commission succeeded in recommending <Col N="820" /> unanimously in favour of giving these rights to leaseholders.  I should like to take this opportunity of expressing my appreciation of their valuable services and I am sure I am speaking for all Deputies when I say this.</P>
    <P>I ask that the Bill be given a Second Reading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is right when he says there is no disagreement with regard to the principles of this Bill.  I should like to join with him in the compliment he has paid to His Honour, Judge Conroy, and the Commission over which Judge Conroy presided in dealing with and reporting on this question of ground rents.  I suppose it would have been naïve politically to expect the Minister to extend similar congratulations to this Party and the Labour Party for their advocacy of this measure over the years.  I am proud to record that as far as my Party are concerned before ever the Ground Rents Commission was established, we advocated this change in the law.  I think, although I do not seek to speak for them, the same is true of the members of the Labour Party.</P>
      <P>Generally speaking, the Minister is right when he says that a Bill of this sort is essentially a Committee Stage Bill, particularly when there seems to be broad agreement on the principal object to be achieved.  But I feel the Minister shrugged the matter off rather lightly when he said in effect he did not propose to go into the arguments to justify this measure.  He need not justify the measure to me.  But it would be a mistake for the Minister or for any Deputy to get the impression that there is not another point of view with regard to ground rents and with regard to the leasehold system in this country. The Minister should have gone on record to give the arguments which, in the first place, justify the report of the Ground Rents Commission, and secondly, justify the introduction of the measure here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a coin that has two sides.  When the Minister decided to come down on one side &mdash; and I am not in disagreement with what he has decided &mdash; even as a matter of courtesy to those who take the other view, he should have <Col N="821" /> taken the trouble to explain the arguments which justify his decision.  He should have made it clear that in this country, not only in recent times but over the years, there has been a genuine desire amongst Irish people to be the owners of the homes in which they live and the land they work in the real sense.  They want to exercise the right of ownership without feeling that they must be beholden to anyone else.  That was one of the matters brought home before the Ground Rents Commission and one of the matters commented upon by the Commission in their report &mdash; the fact that that strong desire was there, a desire which had its roots in the past.  It is probably one of the things which for so many centuries provided the inspiration possibly needed from time to time in connection with the land struggle in this country.</P>
    <P>The Minister also might have endeavoured to satisfy those who would feel apprehensive about this measure with regard to enforceability of covenants by dealing with that matter a bit more fully than he did.  He said towards the end of his remarks words to the effect that he was satisfied that the town planning legislation we have at present, generally speaking, gives planning authorities the necessary authority to enforce desirable covenants with regard to user and so on.  One of the matters that will give rise to most apprehension under this Bill will be not so much in connection with what on the face of it might appear to be interference with a person's general right of property but the possibility that with the removal of the check that is there by reason of covenants in leases, you may have widespread development of an undesirable and haphazard character in neighbourhoods, the amenities of which up to now have been preserved principally by means of covenants in the leases.</P>
    <P>It is undoubtedly true to say that in the case of some estates, there has been excellent management from a civic point of view in preserving the character of particular neighbourhoods and the amenities in those neighbourhoods. One of the fears that will be expressed, I am quite sure &mdash; and <Col N="822" /> it was probably expressed before the Ground Rents Commission &mdash; is that with the introduction of legislation of this type, with the removal of the restraint imposed by these covenants, this question of haphazard development, and so forth, may get completely out of hand.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is any real basis for that fear, and the reason I do not think there is any real basis for it is the operation of the planning authorities under our existing scheme of things.  However, there are some people who feel that that is not sufficient and that the individual owner or the landlord who has control, by means of these covenants, of a neighbourhood has no interest in preserving the character of the neighbourhood and its amenities.  For what it is worth, I think, first, the fear is there and, secondly, that it was up to the Minister to dispel these doubts, instead of which he shrugged them off to some extent by saying he did not intend to go into the arguments for and against leasehold enfranchisement.</P>
    <P>There will be different views with regard to the methods by which payers of ground rents should be entitled to purchase out their ground rents.  The Minister has decided on a particular method under this Bill which enables arbitration to take place before the county registrar and which allows an appeal from the decision of the county registrar to the Circuit court. I do not understand why the Minister felt it was necessary to go to an officer such as a county registrar rather than either a judge, or a district justice, for that matter, to decide on these questions.  I do not know the Minister's reason for deciding that he will have nothing to do, except by means of an appeal, with the judiciary in connection with the question of fixing whatever the appropriate price will be.</P>
    <P>I recognise there may be difficulties very often in connection with fixing the purchase price.  One possible solution which occurred to me &mdash; and I am not particularly wedded to this as against the system proposed by the Minister &mdash; would have been to establish a tribunal to which applicants should apply for the purpose of having <Col N="823" /> a purchase price fixed, and that purchase price would then obtain for a certain period.  If the right to purchase out was not exercised within that period, then it would be fair to require a further application to be made in order to fix another purchase price because of the changing value of money over the years.  The method the Minister has adopted may well turn out to be a more satisfactory method.</P>
    <P>There are some matters, however, that are bound to arise, and I am not sure whether the Bill is strong enough to deal with them.  I have in mind, for example, the difference between the case of a lessor who has made leases of building sites and relied entirely on the creation of ground rents and that of a lessor who has made leases of building sites and who, in addition to obtaining the ground rents, has obtained a substantial purchase price or site fine in respect of those building sites.  I hope the Bill as it stands enables that kind of matter to be gone into by the county registrar as one of the relevant factors.  The Minister will be aware that there has been a very substantial increase over the years in the amount of the site fine that is charged in respect of sites for new houses.  Some years ago such sites comparatively near the city, although I suppose outside the city boundary, were fetching prices of £100 or £200; similar sites today are fetching prices of more than £1,000.  There again, it seems to me there must be some distinction in fixing the purchase price.</P>
    <P>There is another matter with which I should like the Minister to deal.  I cannot see that this is covered by the Bill, although subsection (2) (d) of section 3 may cover it to some extent. I refer to the case of a person whose lease has already expired.  As a man who has been a practising lawyer, the Minister is aware that from time to time a person who has had a lease will let the lease expire inadvertently without applying for renewal, that he will not have his mind fixed on the particular date as to when the lease terminates, and it expires.  Section 3 <Col N="824" /> (2) (d) does deal with the case of a person who has been a yearly tenant over a long period, I think, 50 years, and puts that person on the same basis as a person who is the owner of an interest under a building lease or a property lease.  It does not seem to me to deal with the case of leases that have fallen in a short while ago, where the former owner of the lessee's interest is still in occupation of the premises and is there now on the basis of a tenancy from year to year. I would ask the Minister to consider that case between now and Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>In dealing with the question of the costs involved to the lessee who proposes to purchase out the fee simple under the machinery provided here, the Minister said there were a number of matters which would affect costs. He is, of course, quite right.  You will have the case of the single simple transaction in which the owner of the lessee's interest holds directly under the owner of the fee simple.  There is a simple single transaction involved there.  Consequently, costs will obviously be less than in the more complicated case.  There will be a number of complicated cases, the kind of cases in which, according to the Commission's report, a pyramid of interests arises.  There is a concession the State could make here.  It would not cost the State any money and it would be a real contribution so far as the purchasers of these rents are concerned.  The State might waive the stamp duty on the conveyances necessary in order to purchase out the interests.  That simply involves the State in not imposing a further burden on these people.  It will not cost the State anything by way of subsidy or anything like that.  The State will not have to provide money and, at the same time, this would be a real contribution to those who want to buy out their head interests.</P>
    <P>I take it the Minister has examined the question of the constitutionality of the provision whereby the county registrar is being put in the position of giving what seems to me to amount to judicial decisions.  I should imagine <Col N="825" /> this is a matter on which the advice of the Attorney General has been obtained. I should like the Minister to assure the House that that is so.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, the Bill is one for a Committee discussion rather than a Second Reading debate.  I should like the House &mdash; I am sure the Minister feels the same way about this &mdash; to have a very full opportunity of dealing with this Bill in Committee and of considering amendments between now and Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne:</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Higgins joined hands with the Minister and talked about their common professional interest as practising lawyers.  It often seems to me that lawyers in power are very like civil servants in power.  Can you imagine civil servants as TDs? There is a danger lawyers may develop along the same line.  If the Members of this House were to approach this piece of legislation with a lawyer's mind, I do not think that would be desirable.  It would certainly be far from entertaining.</P>
      <P>Ground rents have their origin in the economic despoliation of this country and any discussion on ground rents in an Irish Parliament would be inconceivable to me without at least some formal bow to the shades of Lalor and Davitt.  It can be said that Lalor was one of the first men to give lucid expression to the idea that absolute ownership of land did not reside in any authority outside the Almighty; and Davitt, as we know, worked a revolution, possibly the major economic revolution in the history of this country, by his organisation of the tenant farmers and by the securing of the purchase of the land from the landlords.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is an odd thing, but from the early part of this century, the whole problem of ground rents seems to have lost interest for the Parliamentary Party of that day.  Right up along, even during the years which were celebrated within the past month, this fundamental question at the root of every economic problem besetting this country never seems to have been effectively approached or, indeed, even talked <Col N="826" /> about to any great extent.</P>
    <P>This Commission was set up in 1961 subsequent to my introducing a Private Member's Bill to bring about the abolition of ground rents.  The Commission of course would have been set up, had I never put down the Bill.  The report of the Commission indicates that right up to that time, contrary to what might be thought, there was no great clamour evidenced in this House for the ending of this pernicious system. There was only one person, one famous person, to whom due credit should be given in history, who took an interest in this problem.  I refer to Captain Redmond.  He appears to have been the only one to have taken an interest in this problem of ground rents as it affected urban properties apart from agricultural land.</P>
    <P>Down through the years, no great thought was given to the problem apparently and it is only since the war, for very good reasons, very sound political reasons, that the pot has, as if it were, come to the boil.  If one looks into it, one finds the explanation. In 1948, when the inter-Party Government came into office, they started what was to become an intensive and most successful programme for the encouragement of house building in the towns and cities throughout the country.  Lack of housing at the time constituted a major problem.  In that year there began unprecedented speculation in land.  Suddenly, land which was no more than agricultural land, and bad agricultural land at that even judged by the standards of agricultural production, became, by reason of the intervention of these speculators who wanted to build and sell in a booming market, a goldmine.  All of us know of instances of land around Dublin city or around Dublin county, which ordinarily would have sold for agricultural purposes for anything from £80 to £140 an acre, which suddenly became available at figures such as £1.500 an acre and more, depending on its proximity to what were considered desirable building areas. This, of course, was the much-lauded law of supply and demand which has been espoused by the major Parties <Col N="827" /> in this country as Holy Writ, regardless of what hardships it might work upon the people.  In any event, that was the situation.</P>
    <P>As the years went by since 1948, more and more houses were being built on the perimeter of the city under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts.  At a conservative estimate, the corporation of Dublin and the county council of Dublin have advanced in the form of loans under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts, £15 million to £16 million for house purchase.  I imagine the figure is much more but I am being very conservative.  That £15 million or £16 million is to be seen in the tremendously wide swathe of suburban purchase type houses.  All the house-holders in these schemes, these worthy people who have sacrificed much, most of them, before they got married in order to get the deposit to put down for their house and who, as we well know, are an acquisition to any community and are people who should be cherished and encouraged have had this problem of ground rents imposed upon them because the system of ground rents has operated since King John landed at Waterford, if he did, in fact, land at Waterford and if it was King John.  However, it was around that time.</P>
    <P>I do say, with some authority, that there was a gentleman named Strongbow who was the Earl of Pembroke and he had one thing in common with Nelson &mdash; he had only one eye.  He stood, according to the chronicles, on the hill which is now called Mount Merrion and he was told that, as far as he could see, that land was his.  It must have been a wonderful eye because the estate, which still bears his name, mind you, and still works, has property running, if I do not make a mistake, from Bray Head to the middle of North County Dublin, represented so ably by my learned friend, Deputy P.J. Burke&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;which brings us to the question which has not been referred to at all of the moral authority upon which ground rents are based.  I do not think that they have any base <Col N="828" /> in justice.  I do not think that any person can seek to make any argument for them except the fact that they are there and that there also exists the innate conservatism of Governments. The fear of change ordains that they must be left there and meddled with as little as possible.  I am not clear from the Minister's statement, or the Bill, as to whether, if a person does succeed in getting over the various fences he must clear in order to become a freeholder, he will not in fact be in a position to recreate ground rents himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not clear that this Bill does, in fact, what I have no doubt the Minister intended it should do, namely, mark the beginning of the end of ground rents.  I think there is a danger that it does not.  This vast number of people, of purchasing tenants, to whom I have referred, who live in the suburban areas of Dublin, Cork and the larger cities and towns, who have availed of loans to build houses for themselves, model citizens, have suffered most under the impact of this system of ground rents and it is because they have become so numerous over the years that steps are at last being taken to do something about the whole problem. With all due respect, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, the steps envisaged here are the very minimum steps that could be taken if an effort is being made at all to placate what might be described as an irate tenantry.  These people, paying very large interest on their loans, have, in fact, no rights of ownership at all because the superstructure in which they live, known as the house, sits on land which is owned by somebody else, perhaps owned by a number of other people.  The report of the Commission referred in a happy phrase to &ldquo;the pyramid of interests&rdquo; surrounding the ground rent and involved in ground rents.  You can have landlords, head landlords, all kinds of interests, intervening between the person who is the descendant, legal or otherwise, of the original robber baron and the ordinary John Citizen of today who must pay the bill.  All kinds of interests can intervene and do intervene here &mdash;&ldquo;a pyramid of interests&rdquo;, it is called.  It is on the basis of the possibility of hardship being caused at some levels of this pyramid that argument <Col N="829" /> is made for amelioration, for any steps in regard to abolishing ground rents.</P>
    <P>What about the interest of the person who is principally concerned, the person who must foot the bill, the person living in the suburbs of the city or the person buying the house who must pay the bill?  What kind of a salary would he need today to buy a house? I do not want to go into that because it leads one to lose one's temper when one thinks of the way the people are being scourged and robbed with house prices as they are today.  But take the situation as it is, with people living in houses.  Here, they have paid, many of them, large sums of money since first they went into these houses.  Since 1948, ground rents have been £10, £15 and £20 per annum and these people have paid out these moneys over the years.  There is no suggestion whatsoever in this Bill that they will get any credit whatosever for these moneys they have paid.  There is no suggestion that there should be any consideration in respect of moneys already paid.</P>
    <P>I think that is wrong.  I think an allowance of some kind should be injected into this Bill in respect of the many thousands of purchasing tenants of houses in the suburban areas of Dublin and elsewhere.  Some provision should be made whereby these people will get credit for the money already paid in respect of this piece of what is no more than robbery, money extracted, for no purpose whatever but a false presumption of ownership, from people who are hard set to live and cope with their ordinary problems.  It does not matter whether the amount is small or large: the principle is that it is ill-gotten money so far as the landlords are concerned.</P>
    <P>A friend of mine who was in London recently went into a West End publichouse and met there a well set up young man who seemed to have nothing to do but had plenty of money.  He was introduced, and on hearing the young man's name, my friend said: &ldquo;You are my ground landlord.  When were you over last?&rdquo; The young man said: &ldquo;Over where?&rdquo; My friend said: &ldquo;In Ireland.&rdquo;  The <Col N="830" /> young man said: &ldquo;I was never there in my life.&rdquo;  That may just be an exception but, to my mind, it lights up in a dramatic way the falsity of this business of ground rents.  We all agree that we must get rid of them but I do not see in this Bill power sufficiently strong to enable us to get rid of them quickly enough or that we are taking power sufficient to do justice to the people from whom these ground rents have been extracted over a long period.</P>
    <P>For instance, there is no retrospective effect whatever.  What of those who have been paying ground rent for 50 years in some of the residential areas, people on fixed incomes, for instance, whose leases expired a year or two ago and who have no rights whatever under the Bill?  It seems the legislation is overloaded, with all due respect to the Minister, with consideration for the landlord interest. One is liable to get that kind of result when one is too concerned with the niceties of legal verbiage.  The most effective social reform has been secured all through history by people who approach problems of this kind with a firm, if not fanatical, conviction that something had to be done but with no great knowledge of how to do it. It was when the technicians of the law got at the intention of the idealist that the reforms were whittled down, in many cases, to mean nothing.  I suggest we want as little as possible of legal technicalities discussed here.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party will have a number of amendments based generally on the matters to which I have drawn attention, when we come to Committee Stage.  There are many aspects of this measure which need clarification and amendment and we shall deal with those in Committee.  Suffice to say now that we are not persuaded that the method of determining the purchase price is in any way a just one for the tenant purchaser of the type I mentioned.  There is also need for some form of purchase to obviate the apparent necessity in the Bill of putting down a lump sum.  There should be some method of purchasing when eventually the Bill becomes law, in whatever form it becomes law, by <Col N="831" /> means of instalments because very few people of the type I have in mind, the best people in the country, those who try to help themselves, try to be thrifty and build their own houses, can find £100 or £200.  In fact, very few people outside a certain element can find that kind of money.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see some steps being taken towards the reform of the ground rent system as one of the very few &mdash; I think there was only one other and myself &mdash; who brought in a definite legal instrument and tried to have it passed in this House so as to bring about the end of this feudal anachronism.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore:</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to congratulate the Minister on introducing the Bill, because, as Deputy Dunne mentioned, this is something that Irishmen have sought for many years, from the days of Fintan Lalor and Michael Davitt. The Minister is to be congratulated on being efficient and fortunate enough to have the honour of introducing this Bill.  Deputy Dunne who, I know, has a very deep interest in this matter, mentioned that this was probably the first step.  Some 20 years ago, I think, the House passed a Bill which enabled port authorities to extinguish the right of a private landlord, if they wished to do so.  In some parts of the city, certain land was acquired which had been held by a foreign estate for over 700 years.  I suppose the Government could have introduced just as drastic a power in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy O'Higgins said, there can be arguments on both sides.  Take, for instance, a landlord who provides ground for SDA dwellings, such as Dublin Corporation.  They put £10 or £15 ground rent per year on such houses but that does not go into any coffers but is used to develop further sites for more houses.  I am sure local authorities will fall in with the aim of the Government to abolish ground rents but we may find ourselves then in the same position as in England. There one day I went to a housing estate and I questioned the developer about the ground rent.  I found there was no ground rent but that there was an additional charge of £300 per house <Col N="832" /> instead.  We may dislike ground rent but at the same time our people could hardly find £300 to get a site for a house.  Perhaps some brain more brilliant than mine can get around that.</P>
    <P>Another issue which I hope the Bill will solve is the problem of the absentee landlord.  Nobody likes paying ground rent but one feels all the more aggrieved at having to pay it to a foreign landlord.  If this Bill will help to end that type of thing it will have justified its existence, if it never does anything else.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dunne asked would the Government forgo any stamp duty on transactions under the Bill.  I do not know whether that is possible but I would make a plea that on the next Stage the Minister would provide that the expense in connection with acquisition of ground rent should be kept as low as possible so that as many of our people as possible may benefit under the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> By and large, I approve of this Bill.  It is a Bill that we on this side of the House have been advocating for some time.  As a matter of fact, I remember going on a deputation from the Association of Municipal Authorities to the Minister for Local Government on a number of matters, including a proposal that ground rents should be abolished or that lessees should be given the right to purchase.  That was several years ago.  I gathered from the Minister at that time that while he was in favour of it, he was having difficulty in persuading the Government to accept his point of view.  We asked him then: &ldquo;What is the difficulty in introducing a one-section Bill prohibiting or making more difficult the creation of future ground rents?&rdquo;  The Minister appeared to be in entire agreement with us but nothing was done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as existing ground rents are concerned, I approve entirely of giving lessees the right to purchase them, and the Bill does that.  I also approve as far as existing ground rents are concerned of giving a fair purchase price to the landlord, some of whom may be widows or persons who bought these ground rents in order to secure an income for themselves for the rest <Col N="833" /> of their lives.  It is reasonable that they should get a fair purchase price, and I think the Bill does that.  The formula worked out for purchase of ground rents is in or about the present market value of ground rents.  Therefore, I am satisfied with that.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy O'Higgins, I am not too happy about handing over to county registrars the right to adjudicate in disputed cases.  This will now be done apparently in chambers.  For years back the circuit judge has been adjudicating in matters of this sort fairly, expeditiously and with comparatively little expense.  It would have been a better idea to leave the decision with the circuit judge.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal in what Deputy Dunne said.  The Minister says that he hopes to be in a position to sponsor legislation which will mark the end of this thorny question.  I know that he is there speaking about leases in general.  But, this Bill does not even begin to deal with the abolition of ground rents.  As a matter of fact, it contains the machinery for creating new ground rents.  Speaking for myself, I believe that the creation of future ground rents should be discouraged.  The day that the ground rent is created the amount of it is fixed and the purchase price of it is also fixed because the amount required to buy it out will depend on the amount of the rent.</P>
    <P>The Minister in this Bill also has made provision for the granting of reversionary leases and an extraordinary situation can arise there. There are in the city of Dublin leases of 200 years granted under the Amery grant which deals with a lot of property along the Liffey and these ground rents at present amount to about £2 10s. perhaps per plot of land granted a couple of hundred years ago.  These ground rents are at present owned by Dublin Corporation and when they fall due for renewal under this Bill, a £2 10s. ground rent could very easily be increased to £100 because it can be one-eighth of the actual letting value, not of the land but of the land plus the buildings on it, and that could jump from about £2 10s. to about £100.</P>
    <P>I know that the fraction is reduced <Col N="834" /> from one-sixth to one-eighth but still it could be a very hefty increase.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister should have put something into this Bill to discourage the creation of future ground rents.  In that way he could not be said to be inflicting hardship on anyone.  A lot of these ground rents that are being created at present are being created by people who buy a tract of land in and around a town where not very much development is necessary and then proceed to lease it out on 99 year leases at quite considerable ground rents. That should be discouraged.  There was an argument in favour of leases some time ago when we had no town planning.  It was necessary that the owner of a building should be able to keep control of the entire property and he could do this only through a lease. It was necessary to keep control so that he could ensure that the amenities of the district were not reduced or done away with.  Town planning sees to that fairly effectively now.</P>
    <P>Therefore, in my opinion, it is a pity that something was not done in this Bill, at least, to discourage the creation of future ground rents.  We hear ground rent talked about here as something that is most undesirable, something that people have been fighting against for many, many years &mdash; Lalor, Davitt and Dillon &mdash; to get the right of the people to own their own houses and their own land.  A lot of these leases are for 99 years.  When 30 years of 99 have gone, and it does not take long for 30 years to go, the lease starts getting short and the property which is built on it is not as easy to sell, especially when the ground rent, as under this Bill, can be considerably increased on the expiration of the lease.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies dealt with the question of stamp duty and suggested that the Minister should do something to lighten the burden of duty payable on the purchase of a ground rent. Undoubtedly this measure will lead to an increase in conveyancing, an increase in the amount of property that will change hands and in the amount of stamp duty that will have to be paid.  Are Deputies aware that the <Col N="835" /> Budget of a short time ago increased in a very careful way the registration fees payable on transactions of the kind contemplated by this Bill by 100 per cent?  Before the Budget, the maximum registration fee payable to the Land Registry on a transfer of property was £30.  That was changed overnight, without any warning, to a maximum of £60.  Are Deputies aware that if a young married man goes to buy a house for £2,500, which would be a modest house and not a new house, the stamp duty would amount to £75 and the registration fee would be £19?</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> When you tell me that I am not doing so, I will bow to your ruling with the greatest respect.  This Bill should normally lead to an increase in the transfer of Land Registry property. The Budget increased Land Registry fees from £30 to £60 at the maximum. When we reach the Committee Stage, I would ask the Minister to introduce an amendment exempting from stamp duty and the increased registration fees imposed in the last Budget, property which is transferred under this Bill.  The solicitors' expenses of £50 are reasonable compared with the stamp duty of £75 and the registration fee of £19.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree that this is a Committee Stage Bill and the topic I have been dealing with can be dealt with in Committee, but seeing that the Minister is the only Deputy who can introduce a measure which will impose a <Col N="836" /> charge on the Exchequer, it is not open to Deputies on this side of the House to put down an amendment to relieve transactions under the Bill from increased registration fees and stamp duties.  For that reason I am appealing to the Minister to put down such an amendment.  If an Opposition Deputy puts it down, it will be ruled out of order.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton:</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to welcome this Bill which is one of the most vital and important measures introduced in this House in recent years and is one which should be welcomed, particularly in the towns and cities where ground rents and leases are in force.  The Bill tries to provide a fair and reasonable solution to this awkward and unfortunate problem of leases and ground rents.  It has treated the landlords pretty fairly and the provision that the purchase price will fluctuate with the market and that the landlord will not take any drop in his income is fair.  I would not think that the landlord should be victimised too much.  Many of them are trustees for small and unfortunate people and I would not like to see these people penalised.  This Bill has gone a long way towards meeting this point of view.</P>
      <P>However, it is not being fair enough in some cases where the tenants are concerned.  I do not like the provision with regard to the situation where a lease has 25 years or more to run. There is a considerable number of leases in this city which will not be covered by that 25 year provision and it is unfortunate that a large number of people are going to be excluded from the benefits of the Bill by this provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recently put down a Parliamentary Question asking how much the cost of living had increased since 1916 and I was told that it had gone up four-fold in the past 50 years.  There are many leases which are falling through now and the tenants are being asked to pay six, eight, ten and more times the price which they paid for the original lease 50 years ago.  If the landlord is to be protected, the tenant is also entitled to be protected.  Where a <Col N="837" /> lease falls in, it is unreasonable that the landlord should look for a price in excess of the equivalent in money values to the original price.  This is a matter that should be considered by the Minister and some maximum figure should be fixed.  The maximum rate the landlord ought to be allowed to seek is the equivalent of the original purchasing power of the money paid when the lease was first given or the ground rent fixed.</P>
    <P>I should also like to see some retrospective effect given to these ground rents and to see some adjustment being made for the tenant who has had his rent increased unfairly, as it has been in many cases, and to see some provision whereby he can come along and say: &ldquo;In regard to my rent, relative to the original lease, I am now paying too much; in buying it out over a period of years, I am paying too much for it.&rdquo; There should be some justice for the tenant as well.</P>
    <P>Other than that, I think everybody will welcome the provisions.  This is something which is many years overdue and I am delighted to see it.  I congratulate the Minister on introducing it.  I hope he will be amenable to the suggestions made in this House, such as I have made myself.  We may not all be as familiar with the law as Deputy Dunne is, and the legal Members of the House, and I hope the suggestions made by the ordinary laymen will be considered and as far as possible justice done to the tenant as well as to the landlord.</P>

      <P>There is an old saying that everything comes to him who waits and I welcome this Bill after waiting for it for 34 long years.  Away back in the happy days when I was young, I asked, on 12th July, 1932, the then Minister for Justice if he had received complaints from the town tenants' organisations in Cobh and other towns in the Saorstát, in reference to the exorbitant ground rents charged there, and if it was his intention to introduce a Town Tenants Bill or to set up a rent court or adopt some such means to deal with these rents.  The answer was unsatisfactory and I raised it on the Adjournment.  On the Adjournment, I was enabled to give a <Col N="838" /> picture, even though it was only a small picture, of those ground rent landlords and to show what they mean to a town. I will give a few instances.  There were 25 holdings and when the first lease expired, the landlord claimed the property and raised the rents on the 25 from £100 a year to £1,862 per year and compelled the tenants at their own expense to build according to the specifications of the landlord's architect in regard to any improvements that were required.</P>

      <P>The Official Report of the Dáil proceedings for 12th July, 1932.  In another case the land was leased at £12 10s a year and buildings were erected on that land at a cost of £12,000.  When the lease on the ground expired in 1902, the bank had a bank mortgage of £5,000 on the place.  The landlord refused to renew the lease to either the bank or to Cummins, the tenant, and let the place to another tenant at the huge rent of £415 a year.  Cummins had actually spent £12,000 on buildings, with the help of the bank, but his lease ended and he had to walk out because the buildings were confiscated by the ground landlord.  I could keep the House for a whole evening dealing with these cases.  There were four houses leased at £4 ground rent each and when the leases expired, the rents were raised to £50, £50, £42 and £35 respectively or, in other words, from £16 a year to £177 a year.  As usual, when one raises a matter on the Adjournment, one does not get too much satisfaction.  Thank God, in those days, I was young and when I came in here, I was not too long removed from a method called direct action and so in this case I adopted direct action.  I called meetings of the tenants, organised them and advised them to pay nothing.  We defied the law.  However, it wound up in a <Col N="839" /> stalemate.  After nine months somebody suggested arbitration and as I am always fair, I said: &ldquo;All right; we will have a go at that&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>One of the two landlords with whom I was dealing at the time was the Right Honourable William Philip Henry Rushbrooke, D.S.O., of Cosford, in the county of Surrey, England, retired colonel of his Majesty's Army. When he found he could get no money in England from his Irish estate, he decided he would accept arbitration also.  We appointed two arbitrators, who could not agree, and we were lucky enough to have a referee step in when they did not do so.  I have here before me the referee's decision given on 15th September, 1934.  The referee was John Joseph Horgan, 50, South Mall, Cork, a solicitor.  He went into the whole matter and it took him nine or ten days to do it.  I will not go into the whole matter, although it would be nearly worth it for the sake of getting it on the record, but I have here the names of some 500 tenants who were dealt with as a result of direct action.  Mr. Rushbrooke was collecting £9,000 a year from that unfortunate town at that time, where there were not ten men working.  When the referee was finished, he gave a 33? per cent reduction on all ground rents.  He reduced the ground rents on the Rushbrooke Estate by £3,100 out of the £9,000.  There were 220 tenants who did not avail of the arbitration because their leases were held by the bank.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We then tackled the Barrymore Estate where we had 120 tenants paying £6,000 a year to the Right Honourable the Earl of Barrymore.  We succeeded in extracting a reduction from him of £2,250 a year.  The tenants paid nothing during that time and the arrears amounted to £670 and they were wiped out, as were the arrears of £4,500 on the Rushbrooke Estate. These facts are contained in a little book which I have which gives an account of those times.  What use, in the name of heavens, was that reduction of 33? per cent to the man who had been thrown out or to the tenant <Col N="840" /> who was paying £14 or £15 a year and having that increased to £177 a year. It was far easier to deal with that matter then than it is today.  In many of those cases, those gentlemen have sailed out and somebody else with far more influence than they ever had or will have is in control today so far as the ground rents of this country are concerned.</P>
    <P>I tried to do a bit of missionary work in the neighbouring town of Midleton but I was told Lord Midleton was so decent with his people that they would not fight at all.  They did not fight.  I might say in passing in regard to the agreement in Cobh that for 34 years the tenants have been relieved of £5,350 a year.  In plain language, there is £181,900 in the pockets of the people of Cobh through direct action.  That much has been kept from the two absentee landlords who owned the town of Cobh.</P>
    <P>As I said, I tried to get the people of Midleton to do the same thing but they would not.  Recently, Lord Midleton decided to get out from under them.  He got out and a gentleman named Montgomery stepped in, with the help and assistance of a very extraordinary body.  He stepped in by borrowing £50,000 from the Foster Finance Company, a subsidiary of the Bank of Ireland.  Those are the new ground landlords we have to face &mdash; the banks who advanced £50,000 to buy the town of Midleton over the heads of their own customers. Let us realise now the difficulty that has been created of dealing with this matter.  Thirty-four years ago we were face to face with the absentee landlords but today you have the banks in control.  That is what we have to face and fight.</P>
    <P>I admit this Bill goes at least part of the way, but I would like to remind the Minister of this.  Away back when we endeavoured to get the land of Ireland freed, first you had the Ashbourne Act, then the Birrell Act and all the other Acts.  Then in the finish there was a compulsory Act brought in known as the Hogan Act in 1924. We had to follow that with other Acts in 1936 to pick up the large number of estates which slipped by in the <Col N="841" /> Hogan Act.  I suggest the Minister go seriously to work and bring in here one Bill that will put an end once and for all to ground rents in this country. Get rid of them instead of coming in with this this year and in five or six years' time, with another one.  If I am here in 30 years' time, they will still be at it.  I did not think I would be here for 34 years to see brought in what I appealed for in 1932.  However, this goes a good part of the way and as such I welcome it.</P>
    <P>I note the Minister talks of giving the landlord sufficient to enable him to get an income equal to 6¾ per cent on his purchase price.  Does the Minister consider that the Right Honourable Colonel Rushbrooke, who increased the rents from £17 to £177 a year, is now entitled to get 6¾ per cent on that? In the case of the unfortunate man who had his property purchased for £12 10s a year, who expended £12,000 on it, and then found £1,800 was clapped on it, does the Minister think the landlord is entitled to 6¾ per cent on that £1,800?  We are a patient people, but thank God, in my constituency anyway, we have proved what direct action can do.  Over £180,000 went into the pockets of the people of Cobh not by any action of this House but by illegal action.</P>
    <P>The Minister also talks of a 14 to 15 year purchase.  Might I refer him to his brother-in-arms, Deputy Blaney, the Minister for Local Government? The Minister for Local Government, to compensate us country boys for the land taken over by the plutocrats of Cork city with the assistance of this House, told me when I looked for a 15 year purchase that he would only give ten years and that that was the proper period.  He said:</P>
    <P>The provisions of this Order follow, not just one isolated incident such as the Cork agreement on the 15 years of some years ago, but rather does it follow the well-established principle laid down in the Dublin Act of 1930 followed since then in Limerick and Waterford and, indeed, in the much discussed extension of Cork in 1955.  Those were 10-year periods....</P>
    <P>Are we going to give the ordinary <Col N="842" /> Irish citizen from whom we take property a ten year purchase and give the Rushbrookes and the Barrymores a 14½ to 15 year purchase?  If we are, why?  Let us see where we are going in this and examine the matter fully.  I admit that in some cases the old landlords have moved out and have let in the Montgomerys and the banks. However, there should be some cure because the Montgomerys and the banks are only stepping in to grab land; they are only stepping into what was taken by force.</P>
    <P>There were two gentlemen below in Cobh drawing £15,000 a year and living over in Britain on the proceeds of the sweat and toil of the people of Cobh.  We knocked a share off them, and I suggest the Minister should knock more off after 34 years and that we should get back to the original leases when we are determining the value of property.  Since law and order &mdash; heaven help us &mdash; became strong in this country and some of those leases fell in, the landlord immediately put them back on the old rent and added the 33? per cent we had compelled them to take off.  I will see that that position is met in Cobh and that the rent will be based on this document and this document only, so that any crook who succeeded in increasing the extraction from those tenants will go back to where he started.  It is about time we had a showdown as far as these parasites are concerned.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that the provisions he is bringing in under the Bill should be compulsory in order to end this fiddle-faddle.  I know the pressure that can be brought to bear by the financial geniuses we have in this country and who are now very largely the principal ground landlords in Ireland.  I know what these finance companies can do, the same as I know the power of the banks.  We were elected to give some justice to the people who were deprived of their property in other days.  It is time they got justice now, 50 years after the Rising.  If ten years purchase was good enough for the Minister for Local Government to give in compensation to an Irish citizen in relation to the Cork <Col N="843" /> Borough boundary extension, then surely ten years purchase should be good enough for any absentee, rackrenting landlord.</P>

I have made these points repeatedly, both by way of questions and debates on the Adjournment, ever since I had a debate on the Adjournment in this connection on Orangeman's day, 1932.

      <P>I can prove its relevancy, too.  These two gentlemen claimed credit for the 1924 Act.  One of them was the then Cumann na nGaedheal Deputy, and he said: &ldquo;We are the Government that brought it in&rdquo;.  The other gentleman belonged to the Farmers' Party, and he said: &ldquo;It was the Farmers' Party that made you do it&rdquo;.  A poor old man sitting below the platform said: &ldquo;I want to know which of you is responsible because I was advised to pay no more rent.  The boys succeeded in getting a reduction of 40 per cent which I had been paying ever since.  Now you come along as an Irish Government and increase it.  I want to know which of you is responsible.&rdquo;  He was told: &ldquo;Of course, that was gun law.&rdquo;  The old man said: &ldquo;The Lord keep us under gun law.&rdquo;  We succeeded in extracting £5,000 a year from the rackrenting <Col N="844" /> landlords in 12 months, and we have been waiting 34 years for this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully:</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose we must be thankful for small mercies, and all of us who have been watching the development of this problem over the years &mdash; not as long as Deputy Corry but for quite a considerable time &mdash; must say that at least an attempt is being made to do something about it, but nobody would suggest, I think, that this is the answer to the landlord and ground rent problem and anybody who would think that would be making a very big mistake.</P>
      <P>The big trouble about this whole question is that ground landlords fall into half a dozen different classifications. We have, first of all, the old landlord who years ago owned property, disposed of it for a damn good price and, by including a little hidden clause, held on to the ground rent, and then went out of the country altogether.  That property has passed from one owner to another until we have the ludicrous situation that occurred in Drogheda a few years ago when a decent man who owned a butcher's shop and living accommodation over it spent quite a considerable amount of money on the property.  A few weeks afterwards a lady came into the shop, looking around.  He asked her if she required some meat and, in a North American accent, she informed him that she did not; she was looking around her property.  It appears her great grandfather had acquired the lease of this portion of the town and this lady informed the man who thought he owned the property that the lease was expiring and she wanted a substantial increase on the amount he was paying.  He had to pay that increase to this lady who had come to Ireland at the expense of that Drogheda butcher and a few of his neighbours.  That is one example.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is then the second group, the people who have prevented this Government and previous Governments from taking action in this matter, the various types of religious organisations who own considerable ground rents or who are ground landlords of most of the property in this city.  I have no <Col N="845" /> objection at all to these people having an income but I think it is most unfair that they, or anybody else, should hold up legislation as long as this legislation has been held up.  It is undeniable that this legislation has been held up because people did not want to tread on their corns.  Take the recent happening then in which smart people, particularly around this city, created ground rents and sold the leases of the land for building purposes to some unfortunate building society or even to a local authority.  They sold out in many cases to insurance companies and in some cases to groups of individuals. I understand that quite a number of senior civil servants, with a great deal of money to spare, bought this type of lease and are collecting as much as £25 or £30 per year in rent from the owners of these houses.</P>
    <P>I do not agree that, if a person buys property, he should be asked to continue paying a ground rent for that property.  The excuse used was that this was necessary in order to have some control over the development of the property and in order to ensure that the property would not be put to a use for which it was not intended. All that is now more than adequately covered in the Town Planning Act. Planning permission must now be obtained before any development takes place.  That cuts out the argument that it is necessary to hold on to the lease of the property in order to control development.  But despite that we have the situation still continuing, and it will be allowed to continue, because this will not solve the problem of people who are forced to pay substantial rents &mdash; 10/-, 15/- or £1 per week ground rent for the site on which they have built their houses, and that despite the fact that the person who sold the land to them bought it in many cases without any lease or without paying any ground rent on it, receiving a very substantial sum of money for the site and still retaining this hold over it, irrespective of the length of the lease.</P>
    <P>Mark you, some of the leases given are not so very long at all.  The old lease used to be 999 years.  Now some are as short as 60 or 70 years.  While <Col N="846" /> we may think that is a long time, it is only a matter of two or three generations until the lease expires.  The position seems to be that while one can buy any other article of property outright and it is one's own and nobody else's, so far as the site of a house or the house itself is concerned the person who sells that site or that house can retain the right to collect dues on that site or house indefinitely.  I think that is immoral.  It is something that should not be allowed and, before this Bill goes through, the Minister should go a good deal further to ensure the discontinuance of this practice.</P>
    <P>We will, I know, have howls from those who will feel they are being robbed.  We will be told by certain people that we are doing away with their livelihood.  Even some of my colleagues believe that those who own ground rents should be protected and that someone should see to it that their livelihood is not taken away. My answer to that is that nobody forced them to buy these ground rents and, if they have taken a chance, they have taken a gamble and, having taken it, even if their fingers get burned, it is my personal opinion that they have nobody but themselves to blame.</P>
    <P>I seldom agree with Deputy Corry, for many reasons, but in this case I believe Deputy Corry is right.  There should be a specific period of years laid down after which the ownership of the leases should pass to the people who actually own the sites or the houses.  This question of making it so extremely difficult to estimate how much the lease will cost or how it should be handled will, I think, discourage people from trying to make a deal with the landlord.  I am sure the Minister is well aware of what has happened in a number of towns, particularly in Leinster, in the Pale, where leases were granted for a couple of hundred years.  I am sure he knows as well as I do the situation in which a lease expires and the local lord of the manor, who may not have lived in the district for goodness knows how long, sends his agent to tell the owner of the property that the lease is expiring and, not alone does he want an increase in the amount being paid to <Col N="847" /> him, but he wants in addition that property changed over the years should be put back into its original condition when the lease was first granted.  We had the position in the town of Kells where an old harness room used when horses were the mode of transport had to be put back into the condition in which it had been centuries earlier, although it was housing a fire engine, just because the agent of the local lord felt he would not be carrying out the terms of the contract if he did not insist on this being done.</P>
    <P>Very often we find the landlord insisting on major repairs being carried out to houses and business premises which the owners have kept in what they considered to be good repair for many years and which they believe, in their innocence, they own until the time comes when the leases expire and someone they have never seen or hard of, except for the yearly collection for the upkeep of this person, sends out letters telling them they must do this, that and the other; and they must do this, that and the other all if they want to renew their leases.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister thinks he has produced something which will solve this problem.  I suggest to him that it only goes less than halfway.  I suggest that he should, as he did with a previous Bill &mdash; the Succession Bill, when it was in the House and when it was found that it was not adequae&mdash;take another good hard look at this Bill.  I am quite sure he will be able to devise ways and means of improving it and making it actually work.  I believe that the Bill, as it is at present, will not work.  The Minister is aware that, in the period of life of the second inter-Party Government, a similar Bill was introduced.  I do not know whether he has had a look at it but I am sure he will agree that, even though it did not go far enough, it still went a lot farther than his Bill now goes.</P>
    <P>I know the tendency with the Government Departments is to be very careful about whose toes they tread upon and whether or not people in high places will be offended if certain action is taken but this is a question of dealing with a matter which has <Col N="848" /> been dragging on for so many years. The Minister will earn the thanks of quite a number of people in this country who cannot otherwise help themselves if he will make this a Bill which will deal with the problem.  I believe, as I said a few minutes ago, that, as it stands, the Bill does not go nearly far enough.  It will allow a certain number of people to redeem their leases.  It will allow people who are in a position to deal with these matters to take a decision and to redeem the ground rent without maybe very much difficulty.  However, the vast majority of people who have a ground rent, and who are paying a ground rent, will still be left in the position that they cannot or will not take advantage of what is proposed in this Bill &mdash; and the old system will continue.</P>
    <P>It is true that, in some cases, old documents have been lost.  There is one lucky town in this country &mdash; at least, one that I know of &mdash; where the servant of the lord of the manor, who did not like the treatment he was getting at the hands of his master, decided he would light a fire and he used the title deeds of the town for the purpose of doing so.  In that particular instance, no ground rent could be or has been collected for very many years. It is rather a pity that we could not solve this problem by taking similar action.  While there seems to be a general view in this House that the people who own the leases are entitled to some compensation, I think they have had their compensation over the years and it is rather a pity that it has been decided that they must get some more.</P>
    <P>Finally, I again suggest to the Minister that, before he puts the Bill before the House, he should get very much more evidence than he has apparently got about what actually is happening with regard to leases and he should attempt to reduce the cost of living of the ordinary person, particularly around the cities and big towns, by taking away the right of other people, most of whom are in a very good way of living, to take some of their weekly income from them, as I said, in some cases, amounting to as much as 15/-and £1 per week.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher:</NameTxt>
      <P>I, like other speakers, welcome these provisions to give rights to tenants to buy out the property on which their house stands. I was indeed disappointed with the closing remarks of Deputy Tully that we should take away rights from people.  I am glad to say that there is one thing in the Bill, that is, that it makes provision for compensation to people who own ground rents.  We listened here for a while to Deputy Corry and we must add his name to that of Davitt and others because he has been campaigning a long time and took some very direct action.  But, in dealing with this Bill and leading up to this Bill, there is a long history of agitation in this country some of which goes back to the days of the agitation of the tenant farmer, the establishment of the Land Commission and the passage of various Acts by which he would be granted security of tenure.</P>
      <P>Leaving Deputy Corry's alien landlords out of this, I know from my own experience that many farmers who are in fact Land Commission tenants have been developing their land and have been renting the land and keeping that income.  They are not themselves willing to dispose of the land and they have no intention of disposing of it but they will and do, in fact, make it available at an annual rent.  Whether this is good or bad, it is a practice that is indulged in by a small builder.  The larger builder is quite prepared to buy out the land freehold, if he can get it, develop it and sell it freehold.  However there is always this question of what price a purchaser can pay for a house and whether the market price is a price inclusive of the rent or whether the rent charged is an exclusive profit over and above his normal profit.  I am not prepared to agree that there are people who, as it were, have these two profits.  I know from experience myself that today land is costing £3,000 an acre, with something like six houses to the acre.  They are an individual site, undeveloped, without water or sewerage services.  It is £500 for a site alone.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins:</NameTxt>
      <P>More, in some cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher:</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  If you take the <Col N="850" /> development of that site, it will add £200 to £250 and this will bring up even the normal site to £750 for a semi-detached or even a detached house.  It is not the landlord who puts the ground rent on that who will get the profit on it.  At that stage, it is all cost and outlay as far as the developer is concerned, and he has not even added yet his costs and other expenses in bringing it that far.</P>
      <P>What is the value of that site to himself?  We see here in Dublin and in other parts of the country developers who do in fact charge a fine of £600 or £700 and £15 or £17 10s ground rent.  If that system were abolished &mdash; and, as far as I am concerned, I hope it will be and I think it would be a good thing &mdash; it would place the availability of sites out of the hands of certain people and even the person who wants to build his own house&mdash; and I know there are many people in and around Dublin and in different parts of the country who do not engage in the building business who rent a site.  The difference between £700 and £950 can make all the difference as to whether or not he is able to do this but many of them take on this responsibility.  There is another involvement, and it is a difficult one, that often, until he gets his loan approved, he may not have paid the owner of the site at all for the land. The owner of the site oftentimes will accommodate him by way of a lease which he will hold on to until he has paid for the land and then until the time his loan or mortgage is paid off.</P>
      <P>This system is already built-in.  It was developed in Ireland over many years.  But these are not alien landlords. They are well-known Dublin people and Irish people all over the country.  They are in every rural town. You find them with a farm of land outside it.  If a school teacher or shopkeeper wants to buy a house, he does it either through rent or outright purchase.  This is entirely optional. To cut through this in itself may be a good thing but it deserves careful consideration in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is a move towards the abolition of control by a system we inherited.  The landlord so far as the <Col N="851" /> tenant farmer is concerned has been for the most part got rid of but we have another landlord, the Land Commission, probably the largest landlord. I have seen this happen to a tenant under the Land Commission: I have seen the holder of a tenancy valued at £45 getting £25,000 or £30,000 for that piece of land.  So, when we speak of landlords, let us be careful how we deal with them and the context in which we use the term.  The landlords we are dealing with today are, in the main, Irish landlords, often the Government, often Church bodies and often insurance companies and other bodies in which the money of Irish people is invested.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully said that perhaps those people bought those ground rents.  Perhaps they deserve no consideration but if they do not, at least the members who subscribe to these bodies and invest in them do deserve consideration.  In many cases the Church has inherited ground rents or received them through bequests. Whether we have regard for the Church or not, we must admit the Church is something associated with the people, Indeed some of the insurance companies are actually State-owned and the ownership is back with the people again.  The fact is these people have got these investments and that is why I think we cannot talk about expropriating them.  The measures proposed are fair and reasonable and should satisfy anybody.  Those who have put savings into this type of investment are entitled to be able to purchase a similar investment to that now being taken from them when the Bill becomes law.</P>
    <P>This is only a commencement measure.  I hope it will have an easy and speedy passage.  There are many aspects of it with which I should like to deal on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan:</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had a very constructive debate and I thank Members for the welcome accorded to the Bill on the Second Stage.  Everybody appreciates that it is very largely a Committee Stage measure.  The general welcome for it by the public and the general welcome in the House <Col N="852" /> indicate that the principles enshrined in the Bill are accepted.</P>
      <P>I think it fair to say that, in terms of 1966, ground rents and the form of ownership which creates ground rents are an anachronism, a relic of the past going back over hundreds of years.  It is not a relevant form of ownership in 1966 in that the person deriving the income is not in actual control of, or in association with, the working of the property.  That is not desirable.  From the modern social point of view, there should be associated with ownership a responsibility for working and developing the property.  This, moreover, should, as far as possible, be the objective of legislation.  In that respect there is an overwhelming argument in favour of moving away from ground rents as an attachment to property in Ireland.</P>
      <P>One disagreement in principle &mdash; if any &mdash; has emerged and it concerns the extent to which we are going in this Bill.  The kernel of the Bill is in section 3 where we give a right to purchase ground rent to tenants of business and residential properties. This, mark you, is an absolute right and I think in this respect Deputy Tully did less than justice to the Bill in his remarks because section 3 gives an absolute right to lessees and certain tenants of premises, whether business or residential&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins:</NameTxt>
      <P>Provided it is a building lease or a proprietary lease. That is not as general as the Minister seems to think.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes; but such lessees include all the persons who are generally regarded as being subject to the payment of ground rent.  The tenants now have this absolute right and the landlord has no right to refuse to sell the tenant the fee simple of his property.  The only argument that can take place between them is in regard to the extent of compensation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to emphasise here that the formula set out in section 18 equates the maximum compensation payable to the landlord to the income which the landlord would derive from investing the purchase money in the most <Col N="853" /> recent National Loan stock.  On current terms, this would give a maximum price of roughly 14.8 years purchase. This formula is a maximum formula and there is provision in the section for much less than that being awarded if, on the facts, the county registrar, or, on appeal, the circuit court judge finds the maximum compensation may not be warranted.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully was probably the most vehement critic of the Bill.  I wish to emphasise the expedition of the type of procedure for settling disputes set out in the Bill.  The procedure under section 18 is a very simple one to which I personally and the officials of my Department gave considerable thought.  I doubt if it can be bettered from the point of view of simplicity. I envisage that well over 90 per cent of the properties concerned in this matter of the purchase of ground rent will be properties coming within section (b) of section 18, that is, properties with not less than 25 years to run and less than one acre in extent. I envisage the automatic application of the maximum formula in such cases which would account for 90 per cent of the property coming under this Bill. I envisage them being settled on the basis of a simple letter and answer between landlord and tenant.  I do not envisage complications in proceedings where the maximum purchase price can be readily ascertained by making a simple calculation.  I think that simplicity is its virtue.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins raised the question of the constitutionality of a method of compensation which provides for determination by the county registrar and on appeal by the Circuit Court.  I have looked into this closely and I am satisfied it is constitutional. The county registrar is at the moment an official of the court and is charged with responsibilities analogous to this. For instance, in cases of administration of estates, he takes accounts; he makes judicial or quasi-judicial decisions as to who is entitled to what.  He handles the administration of estates which may run into substantial sums of money and of course there is an appeal to the Circuit Court.  That procedure <Col N="854" /> is used daily by county registrars and as it is analogous to what is proposed in the Bill, I think the constitutionality of it cannot be challenged.  We are on sure ground there.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins raised another point on section 3, the section giving the general right to acquire the fee simple, and queried whether a person whose lease has expired has such a right.  I think that is covered by subsection 2 (c) but I will have a closer look into the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins:</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether such a person should have the right but I will look into it.  Deputy O'Higgins also raised a matter which caused us considerable concern, that is, the question of covenants.  Despite what has been said here by a number of Deputies, it is true to say that some of these landlords, by good estate management, have contributed to the proper and rational development of particular areas.  I think the recent planning legislation passed by the House fully covers this question in respect of management and I feel that we can now safely give the freehold to the tenants and drop the general covenants.  We have retained the covenant where the landlord derived a personal benefit from it because an injustice could be worked in such a case.</P>

      <P>You have the case where a landlord is giving a lease to two or three different businesses and the landlord covenants with one tenant that he will not permit the same type of business to be carried on in other premises in which he is giving leases. Does that work in reverse?</P>

      <P>One of the advantages of this Bill is that it will encourage urban renewal and re-development. It means that a whole block comprising various premises can be purchased and a re-development or urban renewal scheme can more easily take place, subject to town planning regulations.</P>
      <P>The important point of principle which has not come up in this debate and which caused me certain concern was whether or not to abolish ground rents absolutely.  My personal preference was in favour of abolishing ground rents absolutely and doing a clean job on it.  However, it is not as easy as it sounds, the main difficulty being the question of housing and the cost of housing.  Undoubtedly, if ground rents were abolished in this measure, it would cause a substantial rise in the price of houses and in the cost of building throughout the country.  This would be the immediate effect of such a provision and this would be anti-social policy in present circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that the existence of ground rents enables houses to be sold at a lower cost. There is the further point of constitutionality and this is a very pertinent point.  Rights of private property are written into the Constitution and it can be argued that if a person has a property of his own, he is entitled to dispose of that property by lease and it would be wrong to deprive him of that <Col N="856" /> right.  I think there is certain cogency in that argument.  I think the procedure under section 3 where we are giving the absolute right to purchase ground rents to the tenants will mean that there will be a considerable decrease in the value of ground rents as an investment.  There is also a lot of cogency in that argument and I believe that the fact that the tenant can acquire the ground rent on the passage of this Bill will make ground rents unattractive as an investment and will lead to the diminution and disappearance of ground rents as a form of investment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins:</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely that is not so?  The person who now acquires a ground rent has a gilt-edged security which he never had before.  The value fluctuated before but now it is fixed for 14½ years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this will be the effect of it, that because of the insecurity of such investments over the long term ground rents will not now represent the same attractive investment as they did heretofore for investors such as insurance companies.  My information is that it is the view of insurance companies that they will no longer be such a good investment.  My information also is that many insurance companies purchase ground rents in excess of the figure of 14.8 years purchase.  Another point which is important is the flexible system of compensation linked to the current yield from national stocks.  It has been said that a purchase of ten or 12 years would be more fair.  That may be so, but there would be in it a substantial element of confiscation as far as the landlords are concerned.  I doubt if the House would wish to pass any measure which would involve that element of confiscation.  This is obviously so undesirable that the Deputies pushing that point of view were speaking emotionally rather than from the point of view of rationality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a lot of emotion in this matter.  I have always felt emotionally about ground rent.  Most people who talk about ground rents speak about them emotionally.  Most people feel that they are a relic of the past <Col N="857" /> and are no longer relevant, that they are a wrong form of holding property, an unjust form of holding property. We all feel that, and with some justification. At the same time, people who have this form of property must be compensated fairly in whatever measure is passed by the Oireachtas. I look forward to the disappearance of ground rents over the years once this right of purchase is written into a measure of this kind.  In years to come I hope Deputy Corry will be here to see the day when he will no longer have to agitate against ground rents because they will have disappeared as a form of investment.</P>
    <P>I think I have covered most of the points that were made in regard to matters of principle.  Deputy Norton raised a point concerning leases with less than 25 years to run.  These are, in fact, covered by the earlier part of section 18.  I agree that the terminology does not make it very plain and I had adverted to this with my officials some days ago and we are going to make the terminology plainer; it is a question of drafting. But, paragraph (a) of section 18 which allows a lease to go to the county registrar will apply in all cases including any case of more than one acre in extent or any case where there is less than 25 years of the lease to run.  Paragraph (b) does probably what Deputy Norton is advocating, where the automatic maximum compensation formula relates to leases with not less than 25 years to run and where the land is less than one acre in extent.  These will be the common run of property &mdash; 90 per cent of cases &mdash; where that automatic maximum will apply.  In any case where the land is an acre or more in extent or the lease has less than 25 years to run that will involve more important factors.  There may be a question of potential development or the expectation of an increased rent on reversion. In this case mentioned by Deputy Norton the procedure is laid down in the first half of section 18 to go to the county registrar for arbitration as to what should be the compensation and there is a process of appeal to the Circuit Court.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton:</NameTxt>
      <P>There are cases of business premises which have been leased for 50 to 100 years where the leases are falling in now and where the renewal of the lease is away out of bounds with the purchasing power of the original lease.  I mention the case of 50 years because I put down a Parliamentary Question recently with this in mind, where the purchasing power, I was given to understand, had fallen from £1 in 1916 and is now worth 5/-.  These leases are being renewed at anything from six to 20 times the original lease and the landlord is now looking for much higher rent, which means that when this is renewed at a far higher rent, out of all proportion to the purchasing power of the original lease, the purchaser is paying a far bigger capital sum than if this were not so. There ought to be some maximum term for renewing which would give the landlord of the lease the original purchasing power that he had but would not allow him to extort some exorbitant rent from the tenant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, there is nothing you can do in regard to leases that have already fallen in.  We cannot remedy the past.  Tenants are protected under the 1958 Act against excessive increases in the rent on the grant of a new lease.  All we can do in this Bill is to give a right to purchase the fee simple in the future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">

      <P>Once this Bill becomes law, even if there is only a week to go before the lease expires, the tenant can move under section 18 to have an arbitrator, the county registrar, fix the terms of compensation. He has the actual right to purchase under section 18.  The Deputy, I thought, was making the point that cases of that kind, with only a short period to run, were excluded for some reason by section 18 and that section 18 applied only to cases where there were more than 25 years to run.  The right of purchase applies to cases with only 24 hours to run.</P>

I certainly would not feel at all happy if the situation envisaged by Deputy Tully arose, where the Bill did not work fully.  I want to see this Bill function.  I want to make it clear that this Bill makes available to every holder paying ground rent on business or residential property the right to purchase and that it can be exercised expeditiously and with the least cost possible.  That is the main principle of the Bill and any suggestion as to anything we can do to ensure that it operates efficiently and effectively will be welcomed by me.</P>
      <P>I feel very strongly that any measure of this kind which affects basic rights to property, any measure such as the Succession Act, for instance, should be approached very carefully because it is important that we do justice to all sides in a matter of this kind and it is our job in the House to make sure by proper draftsmanship and by proper parliamentary work and consideration to do justice to all sides.

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> At Question Time today I asked the Minister for Transport and Power if he had any function in the day-to-day running of the semi-State company, Shannon Airport Sales and Catering Service, whether he has interfered or intends to interfere either directly or indirectly with a view to influencing the company to terminate a contract for the hire of a coach entered into by the said company with Messrs. Jackson's Garage, Limited and, finally, whether he approves as a matter of policy of the company hiring the most suitable coaches available on the best terms obtainable.  I asked that question because the garage mentioned in the question had entered into a contract to supply the Shannon Free Airport with a coach for a period of two years on certain specified terms to operate a package tour known as the Galway Bay Package Tour.  Let me say at once that this was only one of a number of buses or coaches employed by Shannon Free Airport.  All the other coaches were supplied by CIE.  That contract was entered into and then for some reason or other, which is not quite clear, the Shannon Free Airport intimated to Jackson's that they found it necessary to terminate the arrangement, as they called it, because of Government policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister today told me that he did not interfere in the day-to-day running of the Shannon Free Airport but that he was responsible for the general policy of the company.  He went on to say that a licence from his Department was a prerequisite to the running of Jackson's coach by the Shannon Free Airport and that such a licence had not been applied for and, <Col N="861" /> more important still, if it were applied for, he would not grant it.  I respectfully disagree with the Minister when he says that a licence is necessary for the operation in question.  Similar coaches are being operated throughout the length and breadth of the country without any licence.  This particular coach has been operating at Shannon Airport for the last month approximately and it is there yet.  It is operating daily and will be operating for the next few days.  If what the Minister says is correct, this coach has been operating illegally, breaking the law every day between Shannon Airport and Kinvara, under the eyes of the Garda and the officers of the Minister's Department.  It has never been questioned by a Guard and no intimation has been given to them that they were operating illegally.  If they were operating illegally, it is an extraordinary state of affairs.</P>
    <P>I want to put it on the records of this House that I am quite satisfied that a licence is not necessary and that if a licence is necessary in this case, then a licence is necessary in hundreds of cases throughout the country for which licences are not in force.  The Minister says that a licence is necessary and I cannot put it any further than that.  I cannot put it any further than to say that I am satisfied, both in law and in practice, that a licence is not necessary in this case and that if it were necessary in this case, there were innumerable illegal bus operations going on in the country without any objection.  However, more important, the Minister went on to say that if a licence were applied for in this case, he would not grant it.  He says he is responsible for the general policy of this company and I suppose he would not disagree with me if I said that this company was supposed to operate at a profit and that if it is, it would be unreasonable to expect the company to employ a CIE coach if it could get better service from another company at a cheaper rate.  That is exactly what is happening in this case and I defy the Minister to contradict me.</P>
    <P>Messrs. Jackson's have operated coaches for the Shannon Free Airport over the past couple of years and they <Col N="862" /> have given the utmost satisfaction. They have supplied a better bus than any bus which CIE can supply and I defy contradiction of that.  They have given an excellent service and I defy contradiction of that.  They have given a service considerably cheaper than CIE and I defy contradiction of that. Messrs. Jackson's employ about 100 people and they never had a trade dispute. They pay excellent wages and provide excellent conditions for their employees and, as I say, in their 20 years operating, they never had a trade dispute.  They have given perfect satisfaction to Shannon Free Airport and I will quote a letter dated 25th April, 1966 from the Shannon Free Airport to the Managing Director of Jackson's Garage Limited.  It stated:</P>
    <P>As I have already explained during our discussion, it has been decided to terminate the arrangement regarding hireage of the coach for the Kinvara tour as from 30th April, 1966.</P>
    <P>The bus is still operating.  The letter goes on:</P>
    <P>We have received instructions that the policy of my company in the present circumstances will be to use CIE coaches on all our tours.  I very much regret that we are unable to continue to use your coaches and would like to take this opportunity to thank you for the excellent and courteous service we have received from you at all times.</P>
    <P>The letter concludes:</P>
    <P>Should the position change at any time in the future, we would be more than happy to resume negotiations with you.</P>
    <P>You have not to take it on my word that this coach was giving excellent service.  That is on the word of the man who entered into a contract for two years with this company to operate Jackson's coach on one tour, the Kinvara-Galway Bay tour.  They were perfectly satisfied.  I defy the Minister to contradict me when I say that CIE have not in their fleet as good a coach as that supplied by Jackson's.</P>

At the same time Jackson's were paying excellent wages to a satisfied staff because this is a well-run company, well operated and well managed.  Because of this they could compete with CIE.  The only way CIE could get rid of this opposition and persuade the Shannon Free Airport Company to break a solemn contract entered into was to get the Minister, as head of CIE and of the licensing authority, to come in and intimidate the Shannon Free Airport Company and persuade them to break a contract they entered into.  There is not one word in that letter about a licence.

I would ask the Minister whether or not he is aware that this coach was operating there for the past month under the eyes of the Garda and the officers of his Department.  Why, if a breach of the law was being committed day after day, was no action taken to enforce the law?  I would like to ask the Minister whether he in his capacity of Minister for Transport and Power, the Minister in charge of Bord Fáilte and all the other State companies, received any complaints last year in respect of passengers travelling on package tours in CIE coaches regarding the type of coach or its operation.  I would ask him to tell the House the number of such complaints, if any were received or to confirm if none were received, if that is the case.  On the other hand, I would ask him whether any complaints have been received in respect of travellers travelling on Jackson's coach.</P>
      <P>All these things are relevant.

      <P>First of all, I want to say that if Deputy Fitzpatrick bothered to inquire, he would find that probably of all the services rendered by CIE the tour coach bus services are the most highly praised, and if he chooses to write and ask the Public Relations Officer of CIE for a list of voluntarily written letters from the people taking part in these tours, which appear regularly in the CIE <i>Nuacht</i> week after week, pages of them, he will have the final proof of what I say.  I will have no slander against the CIE tour bus service.  It is first-class, and the praise bestowed upon it is something of which CIE and all of us can be proud. That is not to say that Jackson's of Cavan could not have provided an excellent service with courtesy rendered to the passengers thereon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of licensing, it is <Col N="866" /> absolutely clear that under the Road Transport Act, 1932, I can refuse or grant a licence for a passenger road service.  It defines a service as one or more mechanically propelled vehicles travelling wholly or mainly on public roads and carrying passengers between specified terminal points or along a specified route for separate charges in respect of each passenger.  At my absolute discretion, I can give this licence or refuse it, but I have to take into account whether or not the proposed service for which the licence is required is in the public interest, having regard to the other forms of transport available.  There are a number of motor coach tours operated all around the country by persons licensed in this way.  They numbered nine last year and held 36 licences between them. These are in addition to the foreign coach tour operators who are also licensed and in addition to the licensed operators of regular provincial bus services other than CIE.  These licences are granted in general because CIE or other private bus services cannot provide the service.</P>
    <P>I think Deputy Fitzpatrick is confusing licences granted or withheld for that kind of service with people who charter a bus for an outing such as a football match or other event.  The service is not available to the public at large and it is arranged on an <i>en bloc</i> basis.  The bus is chartered for a particular event for a particular group of passengers.  It is not a regular service which goes on day after day. There is a complete distinction between the chartering of a service for a specific day or specific operation and a service which runs at regular intervals and for which passengers book in advance but who are not grouped together in a club or society in the ordinary way.  No doubt that is what is confusing Deputy Fitzpatrick when he speaks of a great number of these tour buses going around the country taking people to Knock and to other places of interest.</P>
    <P>In regard to this licence, I have been perfectly frank with the Deputy. I have said I would refuse the licence if it had been asked of me.  It was completely wrong for the Shannon Free Airport Development Company <Col N="867" /> to hire Jackson's bus without seeking a licence.  I did not know the bus had been operating until I received information thereon.  I have regular meetings with the chairman and the officers of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company at which the whole policy of the company is discussed in great detail in regard to industries established, in regard to Medieval Tours, the expenditure of capital, the expenditure on grants and so on.  I know all about what goes on down there but the company operates in such a way that I would not need to go into such minutiae as to say at a routine meeting to the chairman of the company: &ldquo;By the way, are you sure that you applied for a licence for any buses you have hired?  Do you employ buses other than those of CIE?&rdquo;  The company, I am very glad to say, operates so successfully that a Minister's intervention on a matter of that kind would not be necessary, and so it did not come up in the course of discussions with the Board of CIE and with the officers.</P>
    <P>I did not receive in my office any complaints that I remember in regard to the services of CIE buses for the Medieval Tours last year.  I cannot recollect receiving any letters concerning such complaints and, therefore, had no reason to suppose there should be a conflict of opinion between myself and the chairman of CIE as to whether he should use any other bus than a CIE bus for these tours.  I may say that the CIE tours from Shannon Airport have included the Galway Bay Tour.  There is an indication that something went wrong <Col N="868" /> in the planning of this whole project. I am sorry that there was this mistake in understanding.</P>
    <P>When the Deputy asks me about the comparative prices the answer is that the prices charged by CIE and by Jackson's are not comparable.  I do not reveal contract prices of this kind, and that is the custom in connection with State companies.  They are not comparable because the whole organisation of CIE is behind this Kinvara Tour as in the case of the other tours. Their advertising, their sales manager, are all concerned with selling the tour. Therefore it is quite impossible to make a comparison between the price for transport for which there is concentrated publicity and the simple hire of a bus for a specific tour.</P>
    <P>I think I have answered all the questions Deputy Fitzpatrick has asked me.  I have nothing against this firm.  I have every reason to believe that Jackson's is an excellent firm, providing an excellent service, but I felt that in this case I should be departing from precedent if I granted a licence.  Taking it by and large, licences are not granted to regular bus tour operators where they afford unnecessary and undesirable competition either with CIE &mdash; there is a clear indication in the Act that they should receive protection &mdash; or even with some other bus tour operator whose traffic might be cut by 50 per cent as a result of which neither of the firms could make a good profit or render good service.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 28th April, 1966.</P>

      <P>Following is the basic text of the letter which issued on 22nd March last to housing authorities notifying them of their housing capital allocations for 1966-67:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;I am directed by the Minister for <Col N="737" /> Local Government to refer to the consultations which have been in progress for some time past with housing authorities generally in regard to the capital allocation for housing in the coming financial year.  While the global amount which is being provided for housing capital expenditure in 1966/67 will be substantially more than in the current financial year, demands on capital, arising as a result of the accelerated rate of expansion of the housing <Col N="738" /> programme in recent years, temporarily exceed available resources.  As a consequence, it is necessary to allocate these resources between services and areas on a basis related to commitments, to the level of activity in recent years and to the demands expected to arise in the coming financial year.</P>
    <P>The allocation for the various authorities in your administrative area is as follows:&mdash;</P>

    <P>It is intended that there should be a certain amount of flexibility in the use of the allocations as between these services subject to the total amount shown above not being exceeded. There should be an immediate review of policy in regard to the making of loans for the purchase of previously occupied houses to conserve available funds as far as possible for the building of new houses.  In future, it is suggested that loans for second-hand houses should only be made where a need for rehousing is established which otherwise would fall to be met by a housing authority.  Each housing authority should determine the level of allocations which may be made on the basis of the level of expenditure now allowed.  In doing so, they should have regard to past experience in the relationship between allocations and payments, and may assume that the capital allocation for payments in 1967-68 will be of the same general order as in 1966-67.</P>
    <P Just="Center">LOCAL AUTHORITY HOUSING</P>
    <P>The capital allocation for local authority housing has been decided on the basis of detailed consultations with housing authorities generally in regard to the commitments in respect of work already in progress, and in relation to tenders already before this Department. Where no allocation is now being made on this basis, the position will be reviewed in due course in the light of such proposals as may be submitted later for the acceptance of tenders for new works.</P>
    <P>In areas where the allocation which it is possible to make at present is insufficient to enable all projects to proceed immediately it will be for the housing authority to decide the order of priority of the works to be undertaken within available resources.  Any saving which it is found possible to make now or at a later stage during the year, in the level of existing commitments, may be used to increase the allocation for new works.  This Department should be notified as soon as possible of the decision of the authority on the order of priority of the works to be carried out within the allocation so that the necessary sanction may issue to the appropriate loan or tender proposals before this Department. In the case of any works which it is not possible to release on this basis approval will have to be deferred for the time being pending a general re-appraisal of the situation later in the year.</P>
    <P>The planning of housing schemes, generally, should, in the meantime, proceed to tender stage so that there will be no undue delay in their commencement as and when further capital resources become available.  Forward <Col N="739" /> land acquisitions present a special problem and should be proceeded with, as far as practicable, on the normal basis of charging them to overdraft accommodation pending the raising of a scheme loan.  Housing authorities should also consider the possibility of proceeding at the present juncture by <Col N="740" /> option rather than outright acquisition. In cases where large areas of land involving heavy capital expenditure are being acquired the desirability of taking over the sites, and paying for them in stages in agreement with the owners should be further explored.</P>
    <P>The allocations for your area are as follows:&mdash;</P>

    <P>New loans for house purchase and supplementary grants will be approved for the amount of allocations which are not already covered by unexpended balances of approved loans.  The allocations are intended to cover all capital expenditure normally falling due within the year on the services specified, on the basis that the normal carry-forward arrangements from year to year will continue to operate.</P>
    <P>It will be necessary to finance approximately 10 per cent of the global capital allocation for your area for housing, sanitary and miscellaneous services from sources other than the Local Loans Fund, or from internal resources, e.g., receipts from sale of land or other property and special repayments of advances for house purchase loans.</P>
    <P>It will also be necessary to exercise control over demands on the Local Loans Fund at source to ensure that each housing authority is adhering to the allocations now notified.  For this purpose, it is requested that the monthly housing report be extended to include a statement of the draws on loans within the month.  For the purposes of budgeting for demands on the Local Loans Fund, it is requested that a statement be submitted as soon as possible setting out, for each of the four quarters of the coming financial year, the expected extent of the allocations which will be drawn within each quarter.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The capital allocations for the financial year 1966-67, as notified to housing authorities on 22nd March, 1966, are set out in the following table:&mdash;</P>
