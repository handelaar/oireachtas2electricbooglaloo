    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach the reason for the increase of 2,503 in the number of unemployed persons between 7th and 21st October 1966.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCarty" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. Carty) Michael Carty">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. Carty)</NameTxt>
      <P>The increase, which was mainly of a seasonal nature, was due principally to seasonal slackness in finance, turf work, agriculture, local authority work and hotels, together with some dockside unemployment.  This was offset by increased employment in shoe-manufacturing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to the fact that since the question was tabled the figure has risen by almost another 400, will the Parliamentary Secretary say if the Government will display in getting jobs for these people as much energy, aggression and effort as they have displayed over the past fortnight in trying to get the Taoiseach's job for themselves?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCarty" hpid="Mr. Carty Mr. Carty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carty</NameTxt>
      <P>I explained to the Deputy that the increase was due to seasonal slackness which occurs around this time of the year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>This, of course, is the <Col N="360" /> correct reply, probably, from the Parliamentary Secretary but is he not aware that the number in receipt of unemployment benefit has risen by about 2,500 over the same period last year?  That is true.</P>

      <P>I have been informed by CIE that the fuel pipes and air brake pipes in their new buses are made from high quality seamless steel tubing to rigid specifications laid down by the manufacturers of the vehicles.  Such tubing is not manufactured in this country.</P>
      <P>CIE make every effort to use the maximum quantity of Irish material in bus manufacture and they have informed me that, over the years, the volume of Irish material used has been increasing.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that for 30 or 40 years these pipes were made in Ireland and that the pattern for these pipes was made here and sent to England?  Surely the material could be imported and the pipes made here?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan)</i> asked the Minister for Finance if he will clarify the present policy of the Agricultural Credit Corporation Limited in reference to making loans available to farmers for the purpose of purchasing additional land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Lynch) Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the statement on agricultural credit issued by me through the Government Information Bureau on 31st August, 1965, and <Col N="361" /> to my replies to questions on the subject in October and December, 1965, and in February, 1966.  Briefly, the position is that in view of the general shortage of capital, the Agricultural Credit Corporation is confining its lending to projects of a directly productive nature.  As a result it has ceased to lend for such relatively unproductive purposes as land purchase and the funding of debt.  It does, however, make an exception in a case where a farmer with an uneconomic holding has an opportunity to acquire a small portion of land adjoining his holding at a reasonable price.  During the seven months April to October, 1966, 55 such cases were approved by the Corporation, totalling £51,410 in value.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he is aware of the growing frequency and duration of public lighting outages in Dublin; if he will ascertain the reason for Dublin Corporation's permitting public lighting to remain unlit for periods of up to a fortnight; and, if having regard to the serious risks to life, limb and property caused by unlit streets, he will ensure that steps are taken to remedy the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney) Neil T. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that at last night's meeting of Dublin Corporation a detailed reply to a question by the Deputy on the same subject was given <Col N="362" /> by the City Manager.  I am satisfied that the corporation are taking all practicable steps to remedy the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister is satisfied that every effort has been made to ensure that inspections by night and at weekends are resumed in Dublin, the City Manager gave a figure of, I think, 33,000 outages.  He did not give any figure for the duration of these outages and that is what is the great problem in Dublin at the moment.  Sometimes an individual light or a number of lights will be out for as long as a fortnight or three weeks because nightly and weekend inspections are not taking place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am satisfied about is that, from the information supplied by the City Manager, and which, I think, has already been supplied to the Deputy at last night's meeting, and by the outline they have given me of what they intend to do, we will not have these delays and we should have a better service in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that there has been a state of dispute between the City Manager and the trade unions for well over two years and would he, if necessary, intervene to ensure that peace is restored and that the inspections are carried out without further delay?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I took it from the information that I have got that we were to have daytime inspections to ensure that there will be lighting at night.  I was not aware that a dispute is causing real difficulty in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Minister that is it.  It is the fact that night inspections are not taking place.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Issues from the Local Loans Fund to Kildare County Council for the making of house-purchase loans amounted to £141,000 in 1965-66 as against an actual expenditure by the council of £120,000.  The capital allocation to the council for this purpose for the current financial <Col N="364" /> year is £100,000.  At the close of 1965-66, the council held a credit balance of £25,286 on their house-purchase loan account, and this sum is available to them for expenditure on loans in the current financial year in addition to the allocation of £100,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The desirability of applying a speed limit to this place will be considered during the review of speed limits on all public roads at present being carried out.</P>
      <P>The provision of traffic signs is a matter for the road authority acting at the request, or with the consent, of the Commissioner of the Garda.  However, the existing system of traffic signs, based on international practice, does not provide for a specific sign for a creamery exit.  Persons entering and leaving a creamery should exercise the same care as persons entering and leaving factories, sports grounds, churches and other places attracting a number of people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>

A team of three people is dealing with every complaint, suggestion and amendment that has come flooding in over the past few years.  It is this single team effort that is causing the delay.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he is aware of the inadequate medical services available in new housing areas in Dublin such as Coolock and Ballymun; and what steps will be taken as a matter of urgency to ensure that new residents in such areas will have the full medical services to which they are entitled made available to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume that the Deputy's question relates only to medical services provided under the Health Acts.  Dublin Health Authority, who are primarily responsible for the provision of health services in Dublin, state that generally the services in the new housing areas are adequate but that some persons from these areas are inconvenienced by having to travel further than normal to health centres. In order to remedy this situation the authority propose to provide new health centres shortly at Coolock, Ballymun and Walkinstown and to replace the existing unsatisfactory premises at Palmerstown.</P>
      <P>I am also informed that the health authority keep the position in the new housing areas under review to ensure that the health services are satisfactory. Examples of the steps taken to this end are&mdash;the appointment of additional district medical officers and public health nurses, where necessary, and arranging special sessions at child welfare clinics for children from these areas.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>In my reply of 25th October last to a question by the Deputy, I indicated that while recipients of social welfare payments would not ordinarily be regarded as eligible for a disabled persons allowance, a health authority could, in exceptional circumstances, pay an allowance in such a case.  Under article 6 of the Disabled Persons (Maintenance Allowances) Regulations, 1963, health authorities are obliged, in determining the amount of an allowance, to have regard to the means of applicants other than income from public assistance.</P>
      <P>I am informed that 776 disabled persons allowances are being paid to persons who are also in receipt of social welfare payments.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that health authorities are sufficiently aware of their powers and responsibilities under this scheme, and I do not, therefore, consider it necessary to notify them further.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so aware. There is no provision such as that contained in the Social Welfare Acts in relation to non-contributory old age pensions for the appropriation by a health authority of a contributory old age pension payable to a patient in a district mental hospital but health authorities are, of course, entitled to take the amount of such pensions into account when determining whether they will make a charge on the person concerned and, if so, the amount of such charge.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that some mental hospital authorities are writing to the recipients <Col N="409" /> of old age pensions?  For instance, when the wife goes into a mental hospital, they write to the husband and demand that the pension book be sent on forthwith.  Will the Minister endeavour to prevent a continuance of that practice?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>When I reported progress, I was commenting on the fact that the Minister had circulated proposals to both the employers' side and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and had expressed the hope in his introductory statement, that the setting up of his office would lead to better relations.  I <Col N="412" /> said I did not believe that legislation of itself would settle industrial relations. that this was a matter which would come about only because of the fact that both sides were willing to come together for the common good.  I asked the Minister in regard to these proposals which he had circulated if he had received any comments from either side or from both sides and if these comments would form the basis of discussions which the Minister might have with either of these before he attempted to draft the type of proposals he has in mind in regard to this matter of better industrial relations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the present time on the Irish industrial scene the hopes of both sides are pinned on the Labour Court as an instrument which enables the disputing parties to have somebody to look at it with them and to enable them to reach a solution of their problems.  At this stage I should like to take the opportunity of paying tribute to the Chief Conciliation Officer of the Labour Court for his good offices during the period in which he has shouldered this very onerous task.  One of the things that, perhaps, we do not advert to as often as we might is the fact that the number of disputes that are settled outweigh completely the number of those which flare up into a strike or industrial unrest and that the Conciliation Officer with his advisers has been able, in a great many cases, to throw oil on the troubled waters and reach a solution. One wonders at the present time if the Labour Court, as constituted, is not getting out of touch with modern conditions and the times in which we live. One of the points the Minister would need to bear in mind in that respect is that the personnel of the new Court should be such that the Minister, labour and industry could feel confident that they were up-to-date and alert in looking at the changing situation.  It is constantly changing not alone in this country but in every other country. This is important.  Setting up the Labour Court of itself will not cure the ills.  It is the courses which are taken ahead of time by officers connected with the Labour Court that might offer the best solution to the <Col N="413" /> kind of problems we are likely to come up against.</P>
    <P>One of the very important factors which I feel would be in the mind of anybody engaged in industry, and particularly of the workers in industry, is that continuance of work is more important than the conditions which obtain in any particular industry.  This is a very important point with them. We speak very often rather loosely in regard to the economic wealth of the country and the size of the cake.  I think the time has come for everybody to realise that it is not increasing the portions of the cake that counts but increasing the cake so as to make portions of it.  That is the greatest hope. Both sides will benefit from this kind of co-operation.</P>
    <P>When speaking of his Department, the Minister seemed to see it as having a variety of functions, as it has, and these were stated without regard to the priorities which the Minister will determine should be raised in relation to matters to be dealt with.  One section of his Department will deal with the welfare of workers.  Then he spoke of industrial relations, manpower forecasts and replacement services.  These, of course, are most important.  The Minister, I am sure, has the benefit of the work done by the Parliamentary Secretary when in charge of the manpower policy, has the results of the study made and inaugurated under his auspices and, indeed, the very elaborate discussions which took place in the Seanad on manpower policy.</P>
    <P>One of the very important things in regard to manpower policy is the fact that it is not a question of finding full employment for manpower; it is rather a question of relating the skills of manpower to the various types of work. There should be the possibility that manpower policy will seek to match jobs and workers in all parts of the country.  It is not just a question of providing full employment, very important and necessary as that is for the reason that there will continue to exist, seemingly, a hard core of unemployment. The figures seem to remain static; they move up and down seasonally but, by and large, a hard <Col N="414" /> core still remains.  But, outside of that, if there were enough of the right type of work in the right place at the right time, the problem of the Minister at that stage would be to see to it that not alone would these opportunities be created for workers but there would be workers equally placed to avail of them.</P>
    <P>Reading the debates in the Seanad, one is struck by the fact that it was felt that the employment exchanges were not the proper foundation on which to base the work of the new Ministry.  The employment exchanges, as they are called&mdash;most people speak colloquially of &ldquo;going to the labour&rdquo;&mdash;would be very false, if the policy the Minister wishes to pursue is to have the results which everybody hopes it will have.  Equally so, taking the employment services away from the exchanges as such would perhaps create a better image but at the same time I feel there will have to be very close liaison between the two offices.</P>
    <P>At present people are compelled to go to the exchanges to register for employment and on going there, find, in some cases, certainly, a very loose type of listing of the skills of people who come to register.  There is a first and second choice.  I wonder if the work in which these people are engaged even at present, and from which they may become detached by reason of unemployment, is really the kind of work for which they are essentially fitted.  Very often there is in the back of a man's mind that he takes a chance in stating the most likely second avenue of employment.  I admit there is an amount of that kind of information available to the exchanges.</P>
    <P>If the exchanges are doing their work &mdash;and I have no reason to doubt it&mdash; then I am sure they are in touch with the various opportunities of employment which may arise in their area.  If they are not, they should be.  Of course they will not always succeed in getting all the information, because of the various other avenues through which people obtain employment.  There is the avenue of friendship, the avenue of school unions, and, of course, there are <Col N="415" /> always the trade union branches.  These are means through which employment is sought and found but the labour exchanges ought to be in the position of knowing the opportunities available or about to become available.  That brings me to one of the most important points in this regard which the Minister mentioned, that is, accurate forecasts of manpower becoming available, and accurate forecasting of the opportunities for manpower when available.</P>
    <P>The Ministry for which the Minister is now responsible has not just an obligation to keep in touch with these problems but to keep in close touch with the related Ministries concerned. The Department of Social Welfare and the Department of Education are two very important Departments in relation to this new office.  The Minister mentioned the Industrial Training Bill and the redundancy payments which will come to be paid.  This is something we have to take note of, particularly in the light of the conditions we are likely to meet even in the Free Trade Area arrangements we have at present with Great Britain, and what is likely to occur if we get into the European Economic Community by 1970, or whatever year it will be.  These conditions will create for people in this country difficulties in regard to this matter and it will require a very high degree of skill in forecasting, and not alone in forecasting, but in the correcting of forecasts. It is very important that forecasts should not be left as they are but should be revised so as to ensure that the information contained is the most up to date upon which to form estimates.</P>
    <P>One of the matters which come to my mind at this stage is An Cheard Comhairle and its function in this situation.  As we know, young people now seek their apprenticeship through the services of An Cheard Comhairle; but I wonder if the Minister has given thought to the fact that with the techniques which are becoming increasingly available, with the speed with which changes are taking place, very often people who set out on a <Col N="416" /> particular apprenticeship course find perhaps within a five-year period, that the skills in which they were trained are being largely superseded, particularly in relation to technical education and in the lower echelons of the technical services.  For example, in regard to typing, copying machines and new photographic processes now play a large part and there is a tendency towards more copying by these processes.</P>
    <P>One of the things the Minister should keep constantly in mind is the relationship of An Cheard Comhairle to the quickly changing pattern of events not only here but in the world outside with which we will be increasingly in contact. If we do enter the EEC within the next few years, greater problems will be created for our young people.  One of the matters I should like to put to the Minister at this stage is the position of young people who have got their group certificates.  Before they can go on for higher technical training, they must have a job.  Here is the problem. What are our youths to do if they have not got a job and want to go on to higher technical training?  That certainly will be a very live problem, particularly in view of the fact that the Minister for Education says the school-leaving age is to be raised.  When they have got to the stage of having the common certificate, where are they to go from there?  If the psychologists, who will have some influence on their training for future employment, feel they should move into the manual phase or into technical education, how are they to proceed to higher technical education?  The Minister knows well that there is not full employment for quite a large number of young people who, if they were employed, would be able to stay here.  That is one of the matters to which the Minister must give serious attention in regard to the training of our young people in the future.</P>
    <P>That would seem to point the way to greater consultation between the Department of Education and the Department of Labour.  Leaving aside the problem of unemployment or the redeployment of labour already employed, the force of young people <Col N="417" /> coming up will throw a strain on the amount of employment available.  One of the facts which Investment in Education was supposed to highlight was the fact that by 1970 we will need a higher proportion of skilled labour if we are to meet the challenge of EEC conditions. I am sure it is immediately apparent to the Minister that the bottleneck being created by the condition that a person with a group certificate seeking higher technical education must have a job will have to be tackled and tackled quickly.  In this matter also the Department of Education must keep in touch with the Minister, because if we are rigid in regard to the terms or the type of education being given to young people, it will not be easy to change that rigidity later if these young people find that they have been trained for one particular type of employment, but the more general type of education which is now envisaged may be the answer to that problem.</P>
    <P>If the dream of the Minister for Education comes true, and if we have free education up to the intermediate certificate, or up to the level of the general certificate, will the Minister or the Minister for Education be able to supply the psychologists and the psychological help necessary in order to help the student to determine what line of education he should pursue, whether he should pursue the hand and eye subjects, or whether he should pursue a course which would lead him on to the leaving certificate and the university.  If the manpower policy is to work out efficiently and effectively, if we are to have the right people with the right skills in the right jobs, and get rid of the square pegs in the round holes, we will need a great deal of care, of forecasting and of method.  I do not see this as an easy exercise. I welcome the Minister's statement and I welcome more education for young people, but a corresponding effort must be made to ensure that this extra education is not wasted but is so channelled as to produce better results for our young people and for the nation.</P>
    <P>Very often in labour relations, seemingly it is not possible to see the problems which are likely to emerge.  Both sides seem to pursue parallel courses <Col N="418" /> without any contact with each other until some tiny problem or some tiny obstacle on the line causes a collision which it should have been possible to avoid.  In the new Labour Court which the Minister envisages there will be need for conciliation officials who will keep in touch at all times and look ahead to the problems, and try to foresee whether a certain line of conduct on either side may lead to a collision.  They must in time try to head off this and prevent such a situation arising, again going on the basis that it must be a question of getting one side to see that the interests of both side are concerned in their unity rather than in their disunity, that they are not antagonists but rather co-operators in the best sense of the word.  They must realise that both sides have rights and duties in their approach to this problem and that the rights and duties of one are not more sacrosanct than those of the other side.  If there is that approach and if the officials of the Department can use their best efforts in this way, there will be greater hope and less likelihood of the kind of collisions that have been occurring, causing upsets and losses to both sides.</P>
    <P>Another problem I should like to mention at this stage is that of the placement services which will fall to be dealt with by the Minister and the new Department.  We cannot escape the conclusion that as we proceed into the 1970s, we shall be in more difficulty in regard to formal industrial projects so that there is an urgent problem in regard to industries which up to the present were protected and soon will have their tariff shields withdrawn in a climate which might be inclined to send some of them to the wall.</P>
    <P>This is a problem we cannot look at too early in our efforts to minimise the hardships that might later be imposed on those industries.  The retraining of the people who work in such industries is one of the more important aspects of the Minister's cares.  The effective retraining of people in a certain age group is something that will require the skill of industrial psychologists and I am glad to note from the Minister's statement that he will make <Col N="419" /> one of those people available in the new Department.  I hope it will not be restricted to one because I cannot see how a single expert in this field can deal with these problems expeditiously if we are to be realistic in our approach to possible entry into EEC.</P>
    <P>The retraining of young people may not present the same difficulties as that of the more adult personnel but one of the things that seem to me to be of great urgency is the matter of re-deployment of labour.  I do not know what plans the Minister has for dealing with the situation but one can visualise situations of great hardship arising, cases of almost insuperable difficulties.  If in certain areas industries of a certain kind cease to function, the workers in those industries must be redeployed elsewhere and a consequent problem will arise requiring the best efforts of not alone the Minister for Labour but of the unions and the employers in order to face up to the problem effectively.</P>
    <P>Here again the Minister's Department will have to establish a close liaison with the Department of Local Government and with the National Building Agency.  If large numbers of people have to be redeployed, we must realise that it is no use thinking we can get men to move from an area where they have been employed to like employment or different employment elsewhere, if they are not supplied with homes in the new areas of employment.  This is a matter that will require very careful consideration, long-term planning and forecasting.  I feel sure that in reference to this problem certain industrialists have been and will be in touch with the Department and I am sure the Minister is aware of the difficulties that are likely to arise.</P>
    <P>Therefore, we cannot too soon begin to deal with plans to meet this situation.  I do not wish to refer to any particular industry.  I could take, for example, one close to me in Limerick city, affected by conditions of entry into the EEC or of the Free Trade Agreement with Britain because of the importation of screws and nails from England when free trade comes and <Col N="420" /> tariffs are removed.  I hope such a situation will never arise and that the Minister will therefore not have to deal with it.  The point I wish to make is that there must be pre-planning so that we shall not be dealing with the problem when and if it arises.</P>
    <P>The placement services come next in importance to the forecasting services. Placement is a matter that will cause most trouble, if I may use the word, for the new Department.</P>
    <P>The Minister has taken care of the question of redundancy payments from the point of view of contributions to provide for such payments, but redundancy payments of themselves are not much good for people with family commitments.  Of greater importance to a potentially redundant worker is retraining and the redeployment of his skills so as to enable him to continue as a useful member of society who will play his part in the national economy and be able to provide for his family.  This is most important in so far as a worker's personality is concerned: it is something which might be passed over lightly, without account being taken of the sociological effects on a person who, having been at work and having planned his life, suddenly finds himself without that type of work.  Of most importance to him is that at the earliest possible moment he should be retrained for re-employment so that his qualities will continue to be of benefit to his family and to the nation.</P>
    <P>On the question of manpower forecasting, the Minister mentioned difficulties in regard to the recruitment of the type of personnel he requires.  We realise that the assembly of information of the type required is not an easy matter, that great skill is needed. The Minister mentioned that he has a lot of figures and information.  I am sure every employment exchange in the country has a lot of information but whether it will be of use is another matter.  The age of a worker and his family commitments and circumstances are very important but more important still is that the employment exchange should know of the basic skill of the worker concerned and be <Col N="421" /> able to say what kind of similar work such a worker would be able to perform.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Labour Court on which the Minister has been formulating policy, I assume he has not finally determined the type of measure he proposes to bring before the House. However, I am sure he will be taking into account the views of both sides concerned in this matter.  There is outside of the two bodies as we know them at present, the employers and the employees, a great body of personnel who are concerned with those fears which I consider are well grounded.  I refer particularly to the conciliation and arbitration body.  This body has been in existance for a long time and has been concerned with very large organisations such as the Civil Service, the teachers, the Garda, Local Government officials and so on and by and large has worked well.</P>
    <P>I can see that the Minister's thinking in this matter is that it is necessary to bring them all within the ambit of one court and one procedure for the airing of these matters, although I am sure the people concerned who succeeded in negotiating different agreements by conciliation and arbitration, and who have had experience of what was possible at conciliation and arbitration level, certainly would feel that those are the two methods that should still be used and that full use should be made of them.  Certainly, in reading through the White Paper, if you like to call it such, which the Minister circulated in regard to conciliation and arbitration, I do not think it will be the answer to the problem which the Minister sees before him.  One of the things which certainly struck me in reading the comments on arbitration where a court arbitrator is used as an agreed arbitrator, is that if there is not such an arbitrator, there does not seem to be much use in telling people they are going to arbitration.  Both sides must have confidence in the individual concerned that this is a free process.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned he did not intend in the Trade Union Bill which he proposes to bring before the House <Col N="422" /> and of which we have not got the details yet, to interfere in the court as it is at present in regard to free negotiation, that the proper approach is that the trade unions and employers must freely negotiate on these matters. One of the things which could be of use in such negotiations is the use of assessors, provision for which was made in the establishment of the Labour Court.  This provision has not been used as often or as freely as it might have been used.  In these matters where technical points are at issue, it is most important that anybody who sets out to try a case should be expertly advised so as to deal properly with it.  Very often one is impressed by the ability of assessors in admiralty courts and by the expert advice they can give.  I wonder if sufficient use is being made of this service which was to have been available through the Labour Court to both sides?</P>
    <P>I consider that at conciliation level, whether or not there is conciliation, there ought to be available to the Labour Court an official of conciliation grade in a position to recount what took place at the conciliation meetings so as to bring the court up-to-date on the factual position before the court attempts to arrive at any final decision.  If more use were made of this type of service, there might not be any necessity, or perhaps not as great a necessity, to have to deal with the problem any further.</P>
    <P>Very important in a manpower policy and so on is the question of an incomes policy which was adverted to briefly when this matter was under discussion in the Seanad.  We have had some documents on this matter but they were not full enough or deep enough to give all the necessary information.  For instance, the Quinn Report which deals with basic wages, I respectfully suggest, was inadequately documented.  It ought to have been documented much better. The facts on which the report was based should have been published.  If this had been done, it would have given more reason for its acceptance as being a factual document in every sense.  There is not much use in publishing a report if people feel it has <Col N="423" /> not been inadequately documented. Perhaps the Minister will be able to tell us when the two Bills mentioned will come before us?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes; perhaps the Minister will tell us about these Bills later.</P>
      <P>There is one other matter I should like to draw to his attention, that is, the services, which one might call social services, to be provided by his Department. I should like to know if he has thought about graded benefit for employees. There is great hardship on a person who is in receipt of a good wage packet and who finds that when sickness comes his way, he is reduced to a small amount.  The discrepancy is not as apparent in some cases as in others. A worker in a rural area is apparently much better off than a worker in an urban area in this matter.</P>
      <P>If there were a graded system whereby a person who opts for higher benefits pays higher contributions, it would ease this problem.  When sickness or unemployment comes the way of that worker and if he has paid more to the Social Insurance Fund, he should be entitled to draw more than the person who has paid less.  I am sure the Minister will get up-to-date information on this matter from the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to employment generally, it is easy enough perhaps to measure <Col N="424" /> productivity where no services are concerned but if conciliation and arbitration services are to be brought in under the newer type of legislation, I want to put this question to the Minister: How does one measure productivity in regard to the services?  By what standard does one measure productivity at that stage?  If anyone in the service at that stage effects savings in relation to the work he is doing and to the money expended, a saving due to better working methods, I take it there ought to be a standard of productivity by which that is to be measured.  If, for instance, £100,000 is saved by better methods in the service, then the people who effect that saving are fully entitled to their part of that saving.  Otherwise, there is no incentive for them to increase productivity.  As I say, when it is labour of a type in relation to which one can readily measure the output, then the reward can be seen.  Where it is a question of reducing personal service, or perhaps doing work by better working methods, and a financial saving is effected, I suggest to the Minister that these people are as much entitled to their share of it as an incentive to further productivity.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Ministry itself, I think the title is a misnomer.  One might be inclined to conclude that its work is concerned only with labour.  In actual fact, it is a combination of labour and management.  The Minister's work is not concerned just with the labour force as such.  Management is also his concern and he has functions to fulfil in ensuring that management co-operates with him in achieving the kind of results for which he is hoping.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, we welcome the setting up of this Ministry.  This is something previously advocated in the Seanad.  We all hope it will produce worthwhile results.  The Minister does not envisage any short-term results, and on that I agree with him wholeheartedly. From the point of view of the collisions which occur from time to time between management and labour, this Ministry may provide a better type of machinery designed to avoid such collisions.  Manpower forecasting, redeployment, <Col N="425" /> the training of young people are all long-term policies and will be achieved only in the long term. Intensive effort and intensive co-operation will be required to enable the relatives to be realised.</P>
    <P>At all stages there must be a positive approach to the problems involved.  A negative approach will not be of much use.  I hope far more will derive from the employment exchange in the future as compared with the past.  If placement services are to be detached from the exchanges, as they are at the moment, I would hope that these would not be too far removed from the exchanges. I would hope there would be an office close by in which the individual would be put in touch with a further opportunity for work.</P>
    <P>We are looking forward to hearing from the Minister in relation to the other measure he mentioned.  We wish him well in his venture into the field of better industrial relations.  We hope this will achieve for both sides in industry some measure of lasting peace and that there will be an increase in prosperity from which all will derive some share.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister in his opening statement remarked on the impression created that the work of his Department was concentrated on industrial relations and the legislative changes it would be necessary to introduce in regard to those relations.  That, unfortunately, has been the impression. But that is not the view of our Party with regard to the functions of the Minister and his Department.  For some time past, we have been in favour of the setting up of a separate Ministry of Labour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the annual congress of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions in 1964 a resolution was passed&mdash;it was a resolution of Deputy Treacy's, the spokesman for Industry and Commerce in our Party&mdash; calling for the setting up of a Ministry of Labour.  The main emphasis at that time was on the placement of workers, retraining, and all these important aspects that go towards keeping a skilled working force, seeing it is deployed in those areas in which it is needed and generally <Col N="426" /> keeping the Government of the day up to date on the employment position in the country.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that the Ministry seems to have become embroiled at the moment in legal changes, many of which will not, in our view, improve industrial relations generally.  This is a matter on which I do not wish to say too much at the moment, since the Minister himself appears to be undecided, from what I can gather, as to whether or not he will go ahead with his first decision to introduce legislation, and I should like him, in the course of his reply, to say whether he will postpone legislation in regard to the status of trade unions and changes in industrial relations until such time as he can get consent for any changes he may wish to make from the two parties involved.  The Minister must know that any changes contemplated by him will have no prospect of success if he does not have the agreement of both the employers and the trade unions.  No legal formula will be in the least bit successful if it is brought forward against the wishes of either the employers or the trade unions.</P>
    <P>I am most concerned naturally with objections from the trade unions. There was some ambiguity in the Minister's opening speech in his reference to legislation being introduced before Christmas; he said the comments and suggestions of interested parties on his proposals had been received and considered.  I should like to ask him&mdash;he can choose his own time to reply&mdash;just how far consultations must go before he brings forward this legislation and whether he has considered all he wants to consider, or whether he considers it would be more realistic that changes in this area should be phased over a longer period than he proposes now.  In view of the objections, of which he is well aware, it would be ludicrous to imagine he could bring forward any legislative changes in this area before Christmas. He can go ahead quite properly with legislation in relation to industrial training and redundancy.  These are areas in which he and his Department should have something constructive to <Col N="427" /> offer and in which they could be helpful to those involved in industrial relations.</P>
    <P>Certainly&mdash;and I had this feeling earlier in the year when the Department was set up&mdash;they would have very little hope of giving help to either side if they took a wrong direction.  It was not the Minister's fault that earlier this year the Government took a wrong direction in regard to the ESB (Special Provisions) Act when they attempted to coerce people to work.  If this sort of spirit, or this attitude of coercion, operates in the industrial relations of the new Department of Labour, then its aspirations for helping those involved in industrial relations will be short-lived.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the national industrial safety organisation, a body of which I was at one stage a member. I cannot understand why the inspectors who examine the safety precautions in factories, and very often find that these are non-existent, cannot be used to see that a safety committee is established, and also why their duties should not cover the checking of the activities of these committees.  The Minister remarked that there are many factories in which these committees are not functioning at the moment.  Surely it would be a proper function if the inspectors coupled with their ordinary activities this kind of check-up on the committee's activities to see how they were working?</P>
    <P>In this regard we should bear in mind the number of man-days lost through accidents.  The total is very alarming.  We should keep that in mind when talking about the number of man-days lost through strikes.  Some of the ideas advanced by the Minister's Department at present in relation to the Labour Court are extremely alarming. If we are to hand out bouquets, then one belated bouquet should be handed to the Labour Court which has done a tremendous job in the past but which has received scant respect officially.  For years the court was housed in Griffith Barracks, although I understand that it has now been moved to a more <Col N="428" /> affluent centre.  The court has a record of 95 per cent success at the conciliation level, between employers and trade unions.  From what we hear of the Minister's proposal, it would radically change the character of the court.  It does not matter if you put the court in a well-furnished office because if you change its character and function then it does not give it much chance to bring peace to workers and employers.</P>
    <P>The public service unions have given warning that they are not too happy about the arbitration proposals under the new Labour Court and also we are very apprehensive about the overall impression we get of Government domination in regard to the staffing of the court and the number of judges and so on.  If the Labour Court departs from its position of being a purely voluntary body which brings peace as a result of impartial examination of the problem before it and if it becomes a shortcut to handing down an arbitrary decision, its days will be numbered.  It appears to me that the Minister should think again and that he should bear in mind the proposals made by some of the realists in industrial relations in regard to how they see the court's future being more assured and its function more effective. The last annual report of the court, in 1964, shows that of 405 disputes dealt with only 29 were not settled.  That is a very high record of success.  Out of the 29 which were not settled only six resulted in a stoppage of work.  The previous annual reports give similar pictures of success.</P>
    <P>The major point at which we could see the court's work being of benefit would be in regard to conciliation, having more conciliation officers, giving them an established grade and also in regard to the matter of the court's recommendations.  The complaint was made in the past that when a recommendation was issued it was too general and that it did not give specific reasons, where possible, for the recommendation.  It is extremely difficult to explain to members of trade unions why the court decided in a certain manner.  It is extremely important that the tripartite <Col N="429" /> nature of the court should be preserved. If we do not preserve it, the court will not be used by the parties we want to use it, the trade unions and the employers.</P>
    <P>There is nothing wrong in saying that the conciliation service should be extended so that officers would actually have power to investigate industrial disputes which appear to be in the offing and which have not come to the official notice of the court, disputes which anybody could see arising.  Perhaps they could be made mobile so that they could go around the country investigating disputes before they are actually under way and leading to trouble for the community in general.  Another complaint in the past is that when the services of the court are sought by a body of workers these services should be available within a given period.  Too often in the past it has been the case that the court's services have only been obtained if the workers are strategically placed and are important in the community.</P>
    <P>If workers happen to be in a small factory in the country its services may not be obtained.  The excuse was that the court was understaffed but the solution is to increase the staff in order to provide for two or three hearings in the one day and also provide the necessary cash, because money spent on expanding and extending the services of the court will be well spent.</P>
    <P>Up to recently the history of the court has been one of success in regard to industrial relations.  We would be extremely sorry to see the new Department regard as its function the abolition or radical changing of the court's character.  I hope that the Department's officials will listen with all due respect to the older practitioners in this field of industrial relations and take their advice as it is intended, in good spirit. The advice given by some of these people is meant sincerely to improve the situation and it is not tendered in any carping fashion.</P>
    <P>I am still somewhat uneasy about the Minister's statement because at one stage he leaves me under the impression <Col N="430" /> that there will be consultation with the parties and later that the consultation is over.  I would advise him strongly, even if it means less legislation to the credit of the Department, to ensure that any radical legislation which would not have full backing should be phased out, even if it was over five to ten years.  The trade union movement, it should be remembered, demanded only one change in recent years in matters affecting its own function and that was in regard to the problem arising out of the Educational Company of Ireland Act.  That Act weakened the trade union movement in the pursuance of disputes but the trade union movement, after the Supreme Court decision, asked the Government to amend the position so that the unions could preserve their former powers.</P>
    <P>Beginning from this request and decision, all the other matters have come in for a global change in industrial relations and a change in the status of trade unions.  I would advise the Minister very strongly that these global changes are not necessary and that the solution of industrial disputes does not lie in any legal formula.  This is an area, as I have explained already, in which relations between employer and employees are not susceptible to legal formula.  It appears to me to express the position when I say that there is no legal shortcut to industrial peace.  Any Department or any Government who think that a few changes in this area in industrial relations and in the status of trade unions will result in pulling the teeth of economic unrest will make a big mistake.  When trade unions have to go on strike, economic discontent is the basic reason.  We must allow such forces to operate in the form of democracy we have.</P>
    <P>To be fair, it must be said that the trade unions themselves have been doing a great deal of work in reforming the structure of their own movement. In recent years, and with very little newspaper publicity, they have formed what they have called industrial groupings and have put into these groupings unions that cater for roughly the same kind of workers. <Col N="431" /> Their long-term objective is to find such groupings actually beginning to negotiate for a whole body of workers together.  In other words, they have been taking a realistic and wise course. They have been attempting to mobilise the consent of unions involved in industrial relations, the consent both of the executive and of the members in getting them to act together.</P>
    <P>It cannot be said too often, although it may appear to outsiders to be more a subject of humour than an actual description, that the trade unions are democratic bodies and you cannot get unions to come together by waving a big stick.  It must be done over a period and the advantages of one union working with another must be seen operating in practice.  The trade union movement we have is a legacy of historical forces, the craft unions being set up as branches of British unions and then the great advance at the turn of the century in general unions.  This historical legacy left to the Irish working class cannot be altered in a day into one great rationalised central body all acting together. It happens to have different traditions and many people are very loth to leave the associations of which their fathers were members.</P>
    <P>Congress has been taking a realistic look at the position and as a first result, we have this grouping of unions together into broad industrial groups. They hope in future to staff these with officers who will give information, economic data and statistics, to officials involved in such groupings.  It appears to me that the Minister and his Department would do well to listen to the experts when it comes to reforming the structure of the trade union movement from within and to depend on the fact that only by the action of the trade union movement itself can any rationalised changes in the structure of the organisation of the movement be brought about.  It can be done only by the direction of the trade unions themselves and with their consent.</P>
    <P>The Department of Labour would have all our encouragement in hurrying <Col N="432" /> up as regards pushing forward this Bill relating to redundancy because up to a few weeks ago practically every month or so we had one factory or another going out of existence.  At this moment there is absolutely no provision for any kind of redundancy payment for workers put out of work as a result of their firm amalgamating with another.  I do not think we can look for any enlightened attitude in trade union negotiations with employers as a result of redundancy if no provision is made for displaced workers.</P>
    <P>I do not think there will be a future for the kind of agreement that we would all like to see coming into fashion, the kind of agreement we think desirable for the future, the productivity agreement, or any hope of securing the future unless we look after such problems as redundancy and training or retraining of workers.  I do not think the Department should drag its feet in these areas which are most important ones upon which to concentrate. By all means, it may drag its feet in regard to the rationalisation of trade union law, especially if it means not listening very closely to the only realists in this matter, the trade unionists and the employers.  If you are not in touch with those involved in negotiations day by day between employers and employees, you are apt to make grave mistakes.  I should not like to see this Department make grave mistakes.</P>
    <P>The Minister refers to the possibility of securing skilled forecasters in the area of manpower policy.  This is something we called for many years ago and it is extremely important.  It is certainly one of the essentials if we are to have policies geared to full employment. You must be able to forecast what the labour position will be over a period of years.  The Minister claims that such skilled forecasters are not in evidence at the moment in the field of statistics. He says that he hopes to be able to obtain them in the near future.  This is an area on which his Department should concentrate and an area in which they could do very useful work. One of the things he is calling for as a desirable change in this area is the idea <Col N="433" /> of giving an official strike a legal definition.  I do not think that desirable and I think the Minister is inviting trouble in seeking such a definition.  I cannot see how it would be helpful in the present situation.</P>
    <P>His proposals about the voluntary amalgamation of trade unions are good but, as I have said, Congress itself is doing extremely valuable work through its grouping system.  This is an area where mistakes may be made and in fact goodwill may be lost by the Department.</P>
    <P>The idea that a negotiating licence should be granted at the discretion of the Minister and his Department is an extremely serious proposal.  It is a concession that I do not think the Minister will receive from the trade union movement. It is a proposal that hits at the independent life of the movement.  As regards this proposal of giving negotiating rights to a group of workers catering for a particular industry, I should advise the Minister and his Department to look very carefully at what Congress itself is attempting to do by its own means in the way of amalgamation and rationalistion.  This is being done voluntarily, and in the long term, is likely to be more effective than what is contained in the recommendation of the Minister.  It appears also that freedom of association which we accept under the International Labour Office would be seriously endangered if a new principle were adopted like an appeal on the group negotiating licence to the High Court.</P>
    <P>The comment has been made that this is put in a stronger way than in Part III of the earlier Trade Union Act which was declared unconstitutional. I certainly would not like to see the Minister and his Department becoming a quagmire of conflicting legal claims, constitutional and unconstitional, freedom of association or not. There is a great deal of work that his Department can usefully do.  I would suggest that in regard to the judicial concept of relations between employers and employees, he should not proceed too hastily in this area, if he wishes to <Col N="434" /> proceed at all.  If he wishes to be helpful, as I know he does, he should proceed in this area only with the full agreement of those engaged in the sphere of industrial relations, the trade unions and the employers.</P>
    <P>This may mean that the Minister will not be able to notch as many changes in the law in this area to his credit as he might wish.  However, the easiest job anyone could do is to make changes in the law affecting trade unions and conditions of work.  It would be quite otherwise with the day-to-day relations between employers and employees.  I would far prefer to see the Minister and his officials making progress in regard to such humdrum activities as re-training, the employment service, seeing there is a proper redundancy service brought into being, and employment forecasting.</P>
    <P>The employment service is a section which has been taken over by the Minister from the Department of Social Welfare.  A long time back when we were calling for a Department of Labour, if we could not get a Department of Labour&mdash;and the Government seemed to be adamant in their refusal to set up such a service&mdash;we asked, that, at the very least, an employment service be set up under a separate authority.  Considering the kind of social welfare benefits handed out and the poor law atmosphere of a social welfare office, one realises it is not the best place to discuss the employment prospects of any individual.  I would, therefore, ask the Minister, considering the importance of a proper employment service and of seeing they are staffed with people who know about the labour market, whether it would be possible to have this office separate from the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>A great deal of the resurgence of interest this year in industrial relations has been due to what people imagine to be the number of strikes we had.  It cannot be said too often that, according to our last survey on the matter, the majority of strikes occur over such things as conditions of work, dismissals and suspensions, at the level of the individual firm, between employer and employee.  I should like to see the Department of <Col N="435" /> Labour concentrate on another very valuable area, namely, the study and implementation of a grievance procedure in each firm throughout the country.  The kind of industrial relations existing in a country at any given time must be the sum total of the relations between employers and employees in each individual factory.  If the relations between employers and employees are not good at the level of the individual factory, and if this is the case in a number of firms, industrial relations over the country will not be good.  I should like to see the Department concentrate on this humdrum area, an area which may not reach the headlines but in which serious disputes beginning from a very small origin may erupt at any given time.</P>
    <P>Some years ago the trade union movement, with the employers, drew up a series of guidelines on how the grievance procedure should operate at the level of the firm.  This is an area in which the officials of the Minister's Department could engage in order to see whether any agreed code of principles, a mode of procedure, could be drawn up for introduction to firms. It is no secret to say that in Irish industry a grievance procedure, a method whereby the ordinary worker can air his complaints at the level of the firm, is virtually non-existent. Irish management appears to operate on the basis that this is Ireland and we do not need any complicated procedure for meeting our workers, that they can always complain, though goodness knows to whom.  The more we transfer the conduct of our industrial relations away from this kind of amateur, hit or miss basis, the more successful we shall be in the long run. I should like to see the Minister use his influence with his Department to emphasise to employers the importance of preserving good relations in matters concerning conditions of work at the level of the firm.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to put my big foot in it, because I recognise the Minister is&mdash;at least I hope he is&mdash;involved in delicate negotiations at the background of our discussions.  I would emphasise <Col N="436" /> to him, however, that even for political reasons we do not wish to see this Department come a cropper.  The role which this Department has to play in industrial relations is much too important to see it become a casualty for the wrong reason.  I remarked before that the Department could easily become a casualty if at the very start it loses the confidence of the people who are involved in industry.  It will lose that confidence if it concentrates on the wrong things.  If it concentrates on the area I mentioned, retraining, redundancy payments, the employment and placement services, if it concentrates on apprenticeships, the provision of skills for people, if it concentrates, as the Minister said in his opening speech, on matters that affect the welfare of workers, it will secure the confidence of those involved in industrial relations.</P>
    <P>If however, it becomes involved in a wrangle over the constitutional position, or becomes involved in tilting at windmills, if it starts to tilt at trade union status, or if it tries to deprive the trade unions of the rights they have always enjoyed in the conduct of industrial disputes, it will lose this confidence. If it loses the confidence of the trade union movement in its efforts to improve industrial relations, then its days of usefulness will be numbered. Therefore, I would urge upon the Minister in regard to any legislative change he may have in mind, that before he brings any such change before this House, he and his Department should be absolutely convinced that it has the consent of those involved, the trade unions and the employers.  This consent will be got only by speaking to them frankly about all the problems involved. If there is utter objection to measures which he brings in here, if it is the function of his Department to help in this matter of industrial relations, the measures should be dropped.  This is the realistic and the most important thing to do in industrial relations and if you are to be successful you must be realistic.</P>
    <P>If the Minister adopts the criterion of remaining realistic in his help and work in this area, then, above all, he <Col N="437" /> must be extremely careful as to how he deals with the Labour Court as at present constituted.  By all means, expand its effectiveness by improving the conciliation service, by extending the divisions of the court so that it can meet more often, by making its recommendations more accurate, by ensuring that the recommendations of the court come out without undue delay after a dispute has arisen and that the recommendations are spelled out in as much detail as possible, with an explanation as to how they were made.  If one were to concentrate on these areas in improving the efficiency of the courts one would be doing an extremely good job.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, if one becomes involved in legal manipulations to change the character of the court, one loses the confidence of those who have been using the courts up to quite recently and the free collective bargaining system that has grown up will be affected.</P>
    <P>The Minister should remember that he is dealing with what has been relatively a success in our industrial relations.  It is the keystone of whatever industrial relations system we have set up.  Largely, it has enjoyed the confidence of the trade union movement and they have used it extremely well. Figures are there to prove that cases that have been brought to the court have been brought to a peaceful conclusion. It appears to me that before we tamper with its working we should be extremely careful and consider the reasons for any changes that may be proposed.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister, in replying to the debate, can assure the House that full consultation will go ahead with the parties involved in industrial relations, that there will be a postponement of any change in laws, that he will cease to raise any great objections, that he will, if you like, adopt that old trade union practice, &ldquo;Go slow&rdquo; on these measures.  If these measures do not enjoy the confidence of the people involved, the employers and, in particular, the trade unions, they will be of no avail.</P>
    <P>Remember, we do not intrude too <Col N="438" /> deeply into relations between employers and employees.  The State should preside over a situation.  If our community is forming pressures and if there are conflicts between employers and employees, if we live in a democratic State, on no account should the State tilt the balance in favour of one or the other.  If the State departs from a neutral position the State assumes a very dangerous character in the eyes of one section involved in the conflict. I am not one of those who become depressed at conflict between employer and employee.  If the economy is going ahead in a healthy fashion these conflicts can be cut to a minimum.  We should avoid unnecessary disputes but let it be understood that, since we live in a democracy, and there are different interests represented by industrial employer and employees, conflicts and industrial disputes are bound to occur and we cannot avoid them.  The only thing is to clear our minds so as to ensure that negotiations are undertaken before this happens, to see that our industrial relations system is effective and sensitive to dealing with the problems and, above all, that the Labour Court functions as effectively as possible.  If the conciliation section of that court could take an even more active part in finding out when disputes are occurring it would be that much more effective.</P>
    <P>This Party called a long time ago for the setting up of a Department of Labour.  We mentioned the things on which that Department should concentrate. This Party still holds to the view that the really vital matters which this Department should concentrate on are in the areas of employment, service, retraining, ample provision for redundancy, manpower forecasting and apprenticeship in general.</P>
    <P>There is one last point that I should like to make.  I am rather at sea about the relationship between the Apprenticeship Board and this Department. If the Minister could give us a little more information about the overall functioning of the Department in regard to the Apprenticeship Board it would prove extremely helpful.  These are the areas that I should like to see <Col N="439" /> the Department concentrate on.  One final word: You must have the confidence of the trade unions if you wish to change the status of the trade unions in law.  Proceed extremely slowly in this area.  Be suspicious of any results that appear to come too rapidly in this area.  Above all, remain in touch with the realities of the situation by seeing that all changes are made with the consent of the people involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. N. Lemass Mr. N. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to agree with Deputy O'Leary in so far as he says the Minister should go slow in introducing legislative proposals.  I was one of the people in this Party who proposed that the Government should set up this Department and I was impatient about its being set up.  If at times I or other people might seem impatient about getting new proposals from this Department the Minister must excuse us and resist all attempts that any of us might make to push him too fast.  It is not my desire to push the Minister too fast and it is not the desire of anybody who is interested in the welfare of the Department.  As Deputy O'Leary says, the Labour Party and the trade unions and everybody interested in this field of Government wish the Department well.  It is to nobody's advantage if the Department should run into difficulties.</P>
      <P>We realise that if any proposals which emerge from the Department are to be successful they must of necessity take time.  Interested parties must be consulted.  Their views must be respected. The intentions behind each proposal must be clearly explained and understood.  It is most desirable in the case of this Department that, where possible, agreement should be obtained from the interested bodies before legislation is introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We do not often dwell on the achievements of various Governments in this matter of labour relations and labour legislation.  Great strides have already been made.  The Minister has referred to the strides already made in relation to conditions of employment, industrial relations, services, apprenticeship, <Col N="440" /> conditions in factories, shops, offices, mines and quarries.  In other words, even though there was no Department of Labour as such, except in the very first Government of the State &mdash; the Department of Labour which disappeared and became involved in the Department of Industry and Commerce and the Department of Social Welfare&mdash;the Government have always had a policy to protect and foster the interests of the workers.  That applies most particularly in the case of Fianna Fáil Governments.</P>
    <P>The Minister has already put forward proposals to amend the Industrial Relations Acts and the Trade Union Acts and some misgiving has been expressed already in this regard but I understand that consultations have taken place and are in process of taking place and we can only wait and see what the final outcome will be.  I imagine that it will be some considerable time.  In view of the Minister's statement that he intends to have discussions with all the employers organisations and all the trade unions, obviously it must take some considerable time before any final proposals come to the House for consideration.</P>
    <P>While I agree with Deputy O'Leary in general, I think he goes too far with his expression of caution.  Many of us agree there is need for change.  It is well over a hundred years since the basic legislation dealing with trade unions and employers was drawn up and it is fundamentally the same today as it was 100 years ago.  It is only the conservative element that would oppose change out of fear of change.  But we are living in a world of change.  We must set our house in order to deal with modern rules and procedures designed especially to suit modern Ireland, which means increased participation in world affairs.</P>
    <P>In these proposals the Minister intends to draw up panels of persons having qualifications in economic, social, industrial and legal matters who will act as additional members of the Labour Court.  In the proposals as we have seen them there is nothing about <Col N="441" /> these people being appointed after consultation with the representative bodies.  If these panels are to be drawn up they should only be drawn up after direct consultation with the representative bodies.</P>
    <P>My remarks are aimed at making the proposals before us more acceptable. Regarding the Labour Court, which Deputy O'Leary dealt with, I agree with him to a degree.  But I think what we require is something similar to the present situation, that is, the usual conciliation and arbitration services with a public hearing before the Labour Court if necessary, but subsequently to have a final court of appeal available which would be binding, as is envisaged in the Minister's first proposals.  Many a pending strike has been averted by the threat of a public hearing.  Such a strike could not be avoided in the future under these proposals as we have seen them if either side refused to go to the Labour Court for fear of an adverse decision that would be binding on them for three months.</P>
    <P>The last occasion I was speaking on this subject was the debate on the economic situation.  At that time I pointed out that certain human factors had to be taken into account when bringing about the amalgamation of trade unions, that ordinary human emotions were involved and could prevent such amalgamation.  For instance, a long-serving paid official might be in danger of becoming redundant. Even an honorary officer, who had gone every year, say, to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and spoken as an honorary executive officer of his union, might find himself with much lesser status in a bigger trade union.  When it comes to the push the rank and file members are usually proud of their trade union and its traditions and are reluctant to let a small union go into a bigger one.</P>
    <P>I dealt also at a subsequent date with the question of the legal costs involved.  We have three trade unions catering for the engineering industry. This will shortly be reduced to two. The two unions amalgamating have found that it will cost them well over <Col N="442" /> £1,000 in legal fees to bring about this amalgamation and get the necessary searches done.  As a first step, I think the Minister must have a legal official attached to his Department who can do the necessary research, look up the various rules and attend to all the legal matters that might arise.  This should be done at State expense.</P>
    <P>Secondly, there must be a redundancy scheme for officials who may become redundant and unemployed.  If it is Government policy that trade unions should try to get together, if possible in the groupings for the various trades referred to by Deputy O'Leary, then if they are brought together there is going to be redundancy. This part-time official going to become redundant, who has worked hard to get into his position, will be able to influence the members of his union.</P>
    <P>The same ideas should apply here as apply in the case of industry and commerce.  If two industries get together for any sort of amalgamation, such as the GNR and CIE, when redundancy occurs the Government bring in a special redundancy scheme. The same applies to the amalgamations we read about between Players and Wills and Dublin Dairies and Merville.  While no negotiations have taken place between Shell and Munster Simms, the union made it clear that they took a serious view of it and insisted that such discussions should take place.  In this sense the trade unions are a business just the same as any other business.</P>
    <P>In order to bring about the desirable situation of one trade union catering for all groups of workers in a particular class, it should be made as easy as possible for the unions to join together.  It should not cost them money.  If anybody loses his job or becomes redundant, there should be a State-assisted scheme to enable these people to go out on pension or get a lump sum.  You will find that, if such a scheme could be brought in, reaction amongst the rank and file members to any proposed amalgamation would be much improved.</P>
    <P>Another thing that concerns me is <Col N="443" /> that the actual rules of various trade unions can vary a great deal.  This applies not only to how labour might be withdrawn but it can also affect the election of executive officers.  The system of the block vote, the X vote, where you must vote for so many people, tends to make it difficult for an ambitious trade unionist anxious to get on the executive to do so if the people at the top do not want him. I agree, however, that this may have a built-in safety valve, because the people at the top are mostly reasonable men of experience and integrity with the maximum goodwill to the declared intent of the Department. At the same time, the differences that can exist in the rules between one union and another can cause difficulty and would certainly cause difficulty if those unions were planning to get together.</P>
    <P>Another matter that occurs to me concerns State employees.  Reference was made to them in the Minister's speech, but the point is that some of them, to the best of my knowledge, have no staff association.  It is the Minister's intention but it should be spelled out clearly that all State employees will have access to the Labour Court constituted as I have said without being binding in the first instance.</P>
    <P>I think the proposals we have heard regarding education and career guidance are accepted by all.  Everybody is impatient and says the Minister should get on with this as quickly as possible.  But, as against this, Deputy O'Leary, in concluding, wanted to know something more about the Apprenticeship Board.  Recently, I understand, the Minister sent a letter to officers in the apprenticeship authority asking them to make suggestions, either under their own name or anonymously, as to how improvements might be made.  This is a good idea. I have spoken to some of these people. They all have ideas of their own as to how things might be done better in the future.  They were a little confused, however.  There was some reference in the letter to the Department's being a development authority.  I had hoped to have a copy of the letter with me <Col N="444" /> today but I have not.  I should like to go along with Deputy O'Leary and to hear a good deal more about the Apprenticeship Board, its work and what is foreseen for it in the future, when the Minister is replying.</P>
    <P>With regard to ordinary industrial relations, I think the key to the secret here is a question of people not being sufficiently frank with each other.  If employers gave the maximum information as to their profits and their costs, as to their markets, as to how they would need more production in certain fields or how they could not pay so much wages but were the first to offer an increase when it had not been sought when things were going well, a much better relationship could be brought about.  But all of these things in the traditional small Irish business must be kept absolutely secret and this has been handed down from father to son.  In the case of some of the bigger giants throughout the world, this information is freely published.  With big companies such as ICI, and so on, a great deal of information is freely published.</P>
    <P>When the Government are giving guidelines as to what the economy can bear in the way of increased payments, I believe they could better be understood with more adequate information emanating from the information service the Minister intends to set up.  Likewise, the trade union representatives could bring about a better understanding of their position by expanding on their reading of national figures and their reading of the trends which bring about whatever claim they intend to make in the way of a national round of wage increases.  It is this fencing and this trying not to put your cards down on their backs face up which, to my mind, causes a certain amount of suspicion. If an offer is made, without the full picture being shown, the person who has heard that offer will probably say to himself that that is just the minimum they are prepared to go to on the point of negotiation.</P>
    <P>My main reason for speaking today was to refer to the question of the integration of trade unions and to refer again to the National Engineering Union and the IETU who, I believe, <Col N="445" /> might have been more reluctant to amalgamate had they been aware of the vast legal costs that were involved. and, furthermore, to ask the Minister to think of the human problem of the redundancy of paid officials in the event of an amalgamation.  If these two points are thought out and proper proposals are brought forward with regard to them, then such amalgamation will be easier to bring about in the future.</P>

      <P>If we need a Department of Labour, that is, if the work to be done by this Department cannot also be done by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, then it is a pity that the Department should be born in the climate of bad industrial relations that has obtained for the past couple of years.  I think we will accept that, between threats of strikes and actual strikes, there have been a large number of industrial disputes over the past few years.  Many of these were disputes because the highly rising cost of living had made workers feel the pinch and feel they could not exist without greater pay coupled with a bad situation where, in many cases, employers, mostly small employers, found themselves unable to pay.  There were also cases of industrial strife in State and semi-State companies and these industrial strifes were very often the result of bad labour relations.</P>
      <P>I think that, most of all, the root evil that brought about the strife for the past number of years was the 12 per cent wage increase arranged by Fianna Fáil at a time of two by-elections, neither because of its being too large nor any reason like that but because it did not go into any of the depth of detail that was necessary in any type of general wage increase that was to last for two and a half years. Inevitably, as prices followed the wage increase and as the workers found themselves back where they were in, say, nine to 12 months with a year or 15 months to wait for a further increase the resistance of the group of employers who felt they had paid too much on the occasion and the demand of the worker who found himself worse off than he had been brought about this situation of bad industrial relations and industrial strife.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="446" /> We were immediately reminded, and reminded again, that the only method of conciliation we had was not conciliation at all but confrontation and the only time the Labour Court, any Government agency or any intermediary came into play was when the horse has left the stable, when, in fact, there was a strike, threat of a strike or a dispute in evidence and the activities of the Joint Labour Committee set up by the Labour Court and the joint industrial councils were the minority rather than the majority in all labour relations.  In such a situation, there has been born in the Government's mind the view that something should be done about it and they decided to set up a Department of Labour.  As well as setting up a Department of Labour, they have issued a series of proposals for the amendment of the Industrial Relations Acts and Trade Union Acts.  I intend to examine these proposals here tonight and also to make what I consider to be a fair appraisal of the problem as it is and how it should be faced.</P>
    <P>The first cardinal point I should like to make and which in my view must be accepted by employers and employees is that you can bring a horse to the water but you cannot make him drink.  If I am sent to jail tonight for stealing £10 from Deputy N. Lemass or Deputy O'Leary, the punishment is not that of being sent to jail for three months but that my standing in the community and my creditworthiness are gone.  If I am sent to jail tonight because I have illegally picketed, then, if I am a member of a trade union and normally associate with my fellow members, there is no stigma upon me.  In fact, I am a martyr and a hero.  When I come out of Mountjoy in a month's time, there will not be for me the finger that points at a thief or other criminal but there will be the finger that points at a hero and there will be the comment: &ldquo;There is the fellow who stood up for us.&rdquo;  There is a corollary in the experience in relation to the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association and, indeed, in the happening outside now with the NFA <Col N="447" /> which it is indicated might end tonight. These people were prepared to go on strike.  They knew that when they went home to their little parishes in Ireland there would be no stigma. The first principle, and the first principle accepted by the Minister and the Government, is that force does not work.  You have to get some sort of situation whereby you can get agreement between the employer and employee on the course of action and a situation of peace which would be accepted by all sides as far as reasonable.</P>
    <P>I want to suggest to the House and to the Minister that conciliation after the event is of no use and the only way we can get anywhere on this is by producing a system of contract of service.  I would suggest that instead of the proposal he has produced there should be a proposal whereby either a union or an employer, or an employer's organisation, might apply to the Labour Court to have a contract of service recommended for the particular work, whether it be in a sector of industry or a new concern it does not matter.  But there should be the right of either to apply for a recommendation of a contract of service.</P>
    <P>This contract of service should cover many of the things we will give away to employees in the next five years by the confrontation system as well as by the strike system.  It should cover superannuation and pay.  If there is a dispute, before a worker goes on strike and his trade union are prepared to take strike action, they will approach the Labour Court and follow a certain set procedure whereby there will be plenty of time to discuss the matter.  On this basis, we should now specify that a union, a group of unions, or a group of employees, who are prepared to go into this contract of service will know about such things as service pay, longer severance pay in the event of disemployment and the general basis of work in the industry.</P>
    <P>Let us accept&mdash;Deputy O'Leary mentioned trade unions and the amalgamation of two oil companies where there was extreme anxiety because <Col N="448" /> there was no provision for redundancy &mdash;that if somebody is working for 20 years and for any reason is disemployed he should not be handed a week's pay and let walk out the gate. This should not happen in 1966.  If we are to expect anything better it is surely that there should be less conflict and less strikes.  We should have a course of action and a contract of service that could be applied by either the unions or the employers and a recommendation should be prepared by the Labour Court which could be accepted by either or both but in the event of it being accepted by both it should stand for one year and be reviewed thereafter.</P>
    <P>Whether we like it or not, crippling inflation is with us and as the months and the years go by the value of money will fall.  This is highly regrettable and causes political controversy at times.  If there are to be corrections in wage levels these corrections are necessary for one-year periods.  It would be far better, for example, if such a period had been adopted in the case of the 12½ per cent. If it were a year there could then be an adjustment so that prices and wages could follow a logical pattern.  The present system of the irresistible force meeting the immovable object or a bargain like striking the hand at a cattle fair would not then exist.  There should be a Christian outlook, taking into account all the details, the conditions of remuneration, rates for a man after a certain number of years work and so on.</P>
    <P>The Government should look again at their proposal for the amendment of the Industrial Relations Bill.  I would suggest that there are certain things, if my concept is accepted that are wrong in the Government's proposals.  The Minister suggests that the Chairman and members of the Labour Court will be appointed by the Minister.  Under the Trade Disputes Act, 1946, the Minister designates an association of the unions that shall have representation on the board.  Thereby the Labour Court representatives and the employees also provide this.  In regard to joint labour committees, the Chairman of a joint labour committee&mdash;one upon <Col N="449" /> which Deputy O'Leary served for years &mdash;was a well-known Deputy named Deputy George Colley and the two independent members were appointed by the Minister.  Then there are members appointed by the trade union and employers' representatives.  If one member is absent they will equalise, in effect, and then the award is made.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that for the Minister to appoint entirely and absolutely all persons to be members of the Court, even after consultation, is a mistake. I think a trade union, and the employers' organisation should have, when the Minister has appointed an independent chairman, the right to appoint their members.  The objection to the panel assistance mentioned is of a similar kind.  You cannot make a horse drink if he does not want to.  If the Labour Court is to function it must operate in such a way that both sides can approve.  One of the serious suggestions of the Minister is that three months after an arbitration award is made by the Labour Court the Trade Disputes Act, 1906, will not operate. That means no picketing.  I suggested when I opened my remarks that arrest for picketing is not the same as arrest for stealing £10 from Deputy Lemass's wages.</P>
    <P>You have to produce a set of laws and guidelines for the Labour Court and for industry&mdash;rules which will be accepted.  When you have trade union members picketing who will continue to put 50 more on picket when you have taken up the first 50 you reach a situation in which the State and the whole conciliation machinery have been thrown overboard.</P>
    <P>The main basis for forward movement should be contract of service and a recommendation for such by the Labour Court and free negotiation within and eventually, if it becomes necessary, picketing if there is a contract. You may as well accept that in 1966 you will not get a remedy for the strike weapon.</P>
    <P>The right to withdraw labour is en-embedded in the worker's mind.  As an employer, I know that.  The workers feel that if they are wronged, they have <Col N="450" /> the right to go on strike.  Every artifice should be employed to see to it that this is the last resort.  Every action of the Minister should be designed towards that end but in the interference with strike if a strike occurs the Minister will fail.  I, as an employer who would hate to have a strike, want to assure the Minister that I believe in the fundamental right to strike.  I believe it is there and whether an arbitration award is made or not, we must leave it to the worker to accept it.  If he does not accept it, then there are certain other things that can happen.  For instance if there is a contract of service and if it is accepted, and during the intervening 12 months, it is invalidated completely and absolutely, things like severance pay can be withdrawn.  The penalties for the invalidation of such a contract of service can be set down, and I am fully aware that in the succeeding negotiations, if there was an illegal strike, one of the things that might arise is the complete re-instatement of workers without penalty of any kind.  It is still a talking point, something on which you can discuss the matter, and it does give the worker, once a year, the right not only to discuss his wages but to get down to the depth of his service, to get down to his rights and his wrongs and to get to the stage where he feels he belongs.</P>
    <P>It is true that, seniority excluded, the worker in industry at the present moment could find himself on the pavement with one week's wages in his pocket.  I do not think anyone can contradict this.  It is true, and if major redundancy or a change of policy means that as the &ldquo;first in, last out&rdquo; principle applies, the handing of the cards to the senior man also applies, then that senior man may find himself, unless the union to which he belongs is in a strong position, which it might not be, to have negotiations with that employer and try to force something from him, that man may find himself on the street with one week's wages in his pocket.</P>
    <P>If you are to get responsibility from labour, you must go far deeper into the thing than these Government proposals do.  Let us face the fact that <Col N="451" /> these proposals have been the subject of criticism already.  I quote from the <i>Irish Independent</i> of September 28th, 1966.  The column is headed &ldquo;Warning of Conflict on Union Law&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The trade union movement might well be on the brink of a serious conflict with the Government on the issue, said Mr. Donal Nevin, assistant general secretary of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, referring to the Government's proposals for radical overhaul of trade union law and industrial relations legislation, in Dublin yesterday.</P>
    <P>Mr. Nevin, who was addressing the delegate conference of the Irish Bakers', Confectioners' and Allied Workers' Union in Four Provinces House, said: &ldquo;Even at this stage we would hope that the Government would take another look at this dangerous and undemocratic legislation and see that here again the view of Congress is the wise and correct one&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The trade union movement, &ldquo;without a single dissenting voice&rdquo;, had already rejected the proposals, he said.</P>
    <P>My view of the matter is that everything the Irish Congress of Trade Unions say about this matter is not right.  Everything the Federated Union of Employers say is not right.  But I would say this: the Minister is a very patient and amiable man and it might have been better if this set of proposals, which I hope are only a kite being flown in the wind, had never been produced to the light of day and if the Minister had not decided to go through these lengthy negotiations which he now tells us will be extremely protracted.</P>
    <P>The Minister should try to get a formula whereby the employer could feel that he would have a continuance of service, and good service, from his employees and the worker would feel that he belonged a little more than he feels he belongs at the moment.  In times of rationalisation, the redundancy of workers and all the rest of it, the <Col N="452" /> worker would have this contract of service specifying in detail his rights, the service required from him and the procedural activity that would result from a disagreement.  If the procedural activity were lengthy and detailed, he would know that any improvement in his conditions would be retrospective and that if that improvement were in the number of hours worked, he would be paid for the hours he had worked from the time the claim was made.  In my opinion, the contract of service should not run for more than a year, because creeping inflation is not only with us but sometimes even passing us at a gallop.</P>
    <P>The Minister has an odd sort of situation in relation to his proposals for tribunals and committees in organisations such as the ESB.  He says that the ESB may still have tribunals so long as that does not have repercussions on outside employment.  I do not know what to say about this because I should like to hear it gone into in more detail, and if the Minister in his reply would do so, I should be very much obliged.</P>
    <P>I should like to make the position of this Party clear in relation to the recent ESB Bill which has been the subject of some comment.  Our position is quite clear.  It is this: this should never have occurred.  There was great laxity and the situation was allowed to develop wherein essential services such as the ESB had not had the detailed set-up provided for them which would obviate the danger of a strike which would put light out all over the country.  We felt that in the crisis which existed, we had the responsibility to vote with the Government to see to it that the light did not go out. But we moved an amendment.  We made our position quite clear.  We regarded this as a temporary measure, the shame and blame going right back to the Government, and we felt that this temporary measure should operate only until such time as a proper arrangement was made whereby the ESB workers and the management would have agreed services and conditions which would mean that this would not occur again.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann condemns the action of the Minister for Local Government in urging city and county managers to revise local authority rent schemes on an exorbitant scale; that it deplores the Minister's threat to withhold housing <Col N="454" /> subsidies from local authorities and the action of city and county managers in introducing rent schemes which can only result in further inflation and consequent economic hardship on the families of the tenants concerned.</P>
    <P>This motion was provoked and made essential by the action of the Minister for Local Government, as outlined in its terms which are obvious to every Member of the House.  In the economic conditions in which we live today, it would seem to most an obvious fact that Government Departments and Ministers have a special responsibility to see that in so far as they can affect, by their statements or actions, the trend of living costs of the ordinary people, such statements and actions should be directed to restrain costs from increasing. We have all seen within the past two or three years the disastrous, calamitous effect of certain steps taken by the Government, which had the result of increasing the cost of living.  I shall not refer to them in detail but, in passing, would mention a particular instance, the turnover tax.  Any step of this kind which increases the cost of living of the workers, the main producers of our society, has the inevitable end result of reducing the purchasing power of the wage packet or salary and incites in turn an inevitable demand amongst the people, justifiably, for wage increases.  These wage increases again in turn are reduced in their real value by what has come to be called the spiral of inflation.</P>
    <P>It is because of this step of the Minister for Local Government in inciting city and county managers to review existing rent schemes and to review them with a view to increasing rents, which must have an inflationary effect on the economy, that we put down this motion.  We think it essential that the matter be discussed by the House and that an effort be made to bring the Minister for Local Government to see reason.  Indeed, I do not know in this day of &ldquo;instant Taoiseachs&rdquo; whether the present incumbent of the office will be responsible for the discharge of the obligations of his Department this day week. <Col N="455" /> It would seem that he may or may not: the things is in the balance.  I am not concerned about that; it does not matter to us who the individual is. What we are concerned about is to see that there is a change of policy in the approach of the Minister and his Department to the question of rents generally.</P>
    <P>There have been statements of a wild and irresponsible nature by the Minister and members of his Party concerning the tenants of Dublin Corporation houses; for instance, concerning the incomes of tenants of Dublin Corporation houses, which must be answered here and must be nailed for the falseness which is inherent in them. We have heard about tenants of corporation houses who are said to be earning astronomical wages or salaries. I have yet to meet them, and I would claim to have a closer acquaintance with them than the Minister, in so far as they are constituents of mine in large numbers.  Indeed, while there may exist instances of families whose aggregate earnings may total a figure which would seem&mdash;if it is loosely used in argument as it has been here&mdash; to be extraordinarily high, these families are, if you examine them closely, usually families of adult people, each of them earning in their own right, each of them with his or her own responsibilities of keeping themselves and, in most cases, of saving as much as they can in order that they may get married.  Anybody who is familiar with the problem which faces newly-married couples of this city today must admit that the costs of that undertaking&mdash;which it is most essential we should encourage&mdash;are going beyond all bounds of reason. The costs which face young people today about to get married do not need to be demonstrated by me.  They are people who are exploited to the very last possible penny of their very often slender means, and more particularly exploited in the field of housing.</P>
    <P>Young people about to get married must set about saving for a deposit for a house and I hope to have an opportunity in the very near future of exposing in this House a scandal in <Col N="456" /> the matter of house deposits, in the matter of the usury rate of interest charged by builders to people who have put down house deposits of up to £700, which in some cases are liable to confiscation.  If the loan is not granted by the local authority, such people have to pay interest while the builder waits on the loan from the local authority in some cases from nine months to one year.  Such people are being denied the opportunity of seeing their houses until the loan is paid and they have put down the deposit and secured the loan.  However, I will dilate on that, as I have said, when another opportunity offers itself.  I cannot properly deal with it on this motion as I am tied to time.</P>
    <P>That is the kind of problem that faces young people who are members of the families of tenants who live in Dublin Corporation houses.  They have to try to get together such huge figures because the grasping greed of the builders and developers in this city demands huge deposits and huge prices for houses.  When statements are made regarding huge aggregate family incomes, it must be borne in mind that each person in the family has a responsibility to save, and to think in terms of adding together the total earnings of the adults in a family is not to be realistic, because the total earnings in such case are not relevant to the actual amount which is used for the running of the household.  Yet that excuse is used for the proposed savage increase in rents not only in the case of Dublin Corporation schemes such as Ballyfermot, Finglas, Coolock and Rathfarnham, but also in the case of schemes much nearer to the city centre which are on fixed rents.  A proposal has been made and encouraged by the Minister, on his initiative, that the rents of such tenants, both differential rents tenants and fixed rents tenants, should be increased.</P>
    <P>We think this is socially undesirable and economically disastrous.  The whole thing reveals something which I have often referred to here before: the disregard and lack of knowledge of the problems facing corporation tenants with which the Custom House has been <Col N="457" /> afflicted for so long and, indeed, with which the bulk of the Fianna Fáil Party have been afflicted for so long. Looking at the Official Report of the Dáil Debates of October 11th, when the discussion was proceeding on the Estimate for the Department of Local Government, at column 940, one finds a Fianna Fáil Deputy exposing his attitude in these words:</P>
    <P>The Minister is now asking and urging local authorities to increase those rents and to help to reduce the new rents for the new home-owners and, indeed, to try to keep taxation down by making those pay who can afford to pay.  Anybody who cares to trouble himself to go around some of the old housing estates in Dublin will notice the number of cars parked outside the homes and in the streets and can be in no doubt as to the position.</P>
    <P>Let us take that for analysis as an approbation of the Minister's policy. By the way, the Deputy who made that speech is not a Dublin Deputy, but he has a lot to do with Dublin.  He refers to the number of cars outside the houses of corporation tenants, and he obviously thinks it undesirable that there should be cars outside such houses.  Obviously also he considers that the existence of these cars outside corporation tenants' houses connotes wealth.  The principal reason why there are cars&mdash;and they are not there in the numbers suggested in this speech&mdash;and secondhand cars to be found outside the houses in corporation schemes is that it is cheaper to run a car to go to work than it is to pay the extraordinarily high bus fares demanded by CIE.  That is a simple fact.  The presence of cars outside these houses does not by any means indicate undue wealth.  It is an economy.  It is cheaper to buy a car on the hire purchase system and drive it to work, and possibly share the expenses with two or three neighbours, than it is to use the buses.</P>
    <P>This gentleman suggested something else.  He suggested that the workers were apparently living in luxury and rolling in wealth.  He went on:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="458" /> I think indeed that local authorities should go farther.  They should make it mandatory on the tenant fully to declare his income and, indeed, any changes that might arise in his income, either upwards or downwards.  If his income goes up he should notify it and if it goes down he should notify it.</P>
    <P>That of course is typical of the kind of authoritarian, stupid person who has no regard for the individual rights of the citizen.</P>
    <P>I remember when the idea of differential rents was first proposed.  It was proposed by one of the great social pioneers of the century in this country. The principle behind differential rents was, to put it simply, that the workers in those days, which were far more difficult than they are now, should not have to pay the same level of rents when unemployed as they had to pay when in employment.  It might be said that the concept was idealistic to some extent.  The working out of that ideal did not prove to be what one had hoped for.  In the event, the working out of the differential rent system resulted in one section of the workers being made to subsidise another section, and this was done by the manipulation of interested members of the local authorities, by the activities of the Custom House over the last number of years, and by the influence of the Custom House.  When I say &ldquo;the Custom House&rdquo;, I mean the Minister for Local Government.</P>
    <P>One of the great disabilities of the system has been the inquiry into the circumstances and the income of individuals. It is not at any time desirable that the income of the ordinary citizen should be subject to scrutiny by outside sources, except in so far as it can be proved to be socially desirable.  Here we have a Fianna Fáil Deputy who will go right down the line to have the income of the humble corporation tenant examined in detail and in every particular, and make it legally obligatory on him to report an increase or a decrease in income to, it is to be assumed, Dublin Corporation. No matter what his attitude might be on fixed or differential rents, he <Col N="459" /> wants to impose this on the whole of the corporation housing estates.</P>
    <P>We reject this.  We say it is contrary to commonsense.  It is unacceptable to the people and if a law is unacceptable to the people, it has always been found not to have been workable.  Therefore, in tabling this motion, we are expressing the feeling that it is our duty in this House to impress on the Minister that the present actions of the City Manager of Dublin in trying to change the rents scheme in the Dublin area are not alone ill-advised and unacceptable but will never be made to work because the people living in these houses are incensed at the approach made by the City Manager at the instigation of the Minister.  I want to pin the blame on the Minister because he is the one who thought up the idea.  It is his brainchild and he must answer for it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): I rise to support the motion on behalf of Fine Gael.  Some time ago the Minister issued a circular inviting local authorities to revise the rents charged for local authority houses and in the same announcement, he threatened that if local authorities did not revise rents in what he called a realistic manner, he would cease to pay subsidies on the houses concerned.  The first thing I wish to say is that this is a particularly inopportune time to increase rents.  The Minister will probably say it is not the intention to increase rents and that in many cases rents will be reduced.  I say the object of this proposal is to collect more money from local authority tenants.  If that is to be achieved, it follows that if there are to be reductions, there will have to be substantial increases also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say it is a particularly inopportune time to ask tenants to pay higher rents for their houses because there is an acute shortage of houses throughout the length and breadth of the country. Notwithstanding what the Minister may say, local authorities find it impossible to get the green light to proceed <Col N="460" /> with housing schemes.  Admittedly, there is a shortage of money, but one of the schemes or devices employed by the Department to avoid building houses at the present time is despicable.  I know a local authority who submitted a proposal to build 20 houses.  After consultation with the Department of Local Government, the Department pointed out that approval for the building of 20 houses could not be given because the Minister and his advisers were of the opinion that 32 houses should be built on a site which was entirely unsuitable for the building of 32 houses.  The subsidy is paid on a cost of £1,650 per house.</P>

      <P>I wonder if the Deputy misunderstands the motion. It has reference to city and county managers and to the proposed revision of local authority rent schemes.  It deplores the Minister's threat to withhold housing subsidies from local authorities and the action of city and county managers in introducing rent schemes which can only result in further inflation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): I fully appreciate that.  I have been making the case that the effect of this revision will be to increase rents and that this is a most inopportune time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the Deputy's argument?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): That is my argument.  I was attempting to show that in fact there is a black market in houses brought about by the Department.  The Department refused in a case I know of to sanction the erection of 20 local authority houses and invited the local authority to build 32 houses, though the best technical advice available to that local authority was that it would cost about £500 per house to develop the additional 12 houses.  I say that is tantamount to refusing authority to that local authority to build houses and I say further that no revision of rents, the overall effect of which will be to increase rents substantially, should be put into effect until such time as the Minister for Local Government and the Department <Col N="461" /> have discharged their obligations to the local authorities in the matter of housing.</P>
      <P>The Minister's proposal is based on the argument that rents of houses should be based on family incomes.  In other words, he argues that the incomes, or a substantial portion thereof, of members of families living in local authority houses should be taken into consideration in calculating the rents charged to the head of the house.  We know that members of families are not regarded as lodgers in these houses: we know that by and large they consume in food and other expenses as much as they contribute to the family exchequer and that they often are a burden on the family exchequer.  I do not say that is always the case and I do not base my argument on that proposition but I do say that members of a family who are more than 20 years of age have their own responsibilities to think about.  They must provide for the day when they themselves will want to build houses, when they will get married and take on the responsibilities of married life.  If considerable inroads are to be made on the earnings of these members of families, it will become impossible for them to plan for their own future.</P>
      <P>I know that the effect of the scheme which has been introduced, or at least drafted, will be to increase from 23/-to 35/- per week the rent of a man who has a wife and four children under the age of 16 years to support.  His earnings are £9 per week.  Admittedly, notice is being taken of the fact that some members of the family are earning, but this is being done under the guise of reducing the rent of a man who has a wife and five children under the age of 16 years and has to support them on unemployment assistance of £4 9s per week.  It is proposed to reduce his rent from 7/5 to 4/- per week.  I say that a man with a wife and five children on unemployment assistance of £4 9s 6d per week should not be charged any rent.  The promise of reducing his rent from 7/5 per week to 4/- per week simply means nothing and is not worth the trouble involved in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, it is proposed to increase <Col N="462" /> the rent of some houses which were built as long as 30 or 40 years ago.  Some of those houses do not have the amenity of a bathroom or even the amenity of an indoor toilet. Agreed, those houses are being treated on a somewhat different level from the others but before the Minister suggests to local authorities in the year 1966 that they should increase the rent of a house with no bathroom and no indoor toilet facilities, he should see to it that those facilities are provided at the expense of the local authorities, generously subsidised by the Department of Local Government.</P>
    <P>The proposal here is to increase rents throughout the length and breadth of the country.  I have dealt with rural local authorities in the specific case which I gave.  In the city of Dublin, the proposal is to increase rents by as much as £2 and £3 per week.  It is very significant that the Minister for Justice in introducing a Rent Restrictions Bill recently dealing with private landlords thought fit to restrict private landlords to an increase of 15 per cent or 3/- in the £1, whereas the Minister for Local Government is inviting local authorities to take heed of non-existing incomes in arriving at the rents to be charged.</P>
    <P>It is not good enough for the Minister to stand up here or elsewhere and say that a realistic approach should be made to the rents being charged by local authorities.  The Minister should tell exactly what he has in mind.  He should draft a scheme for the whole country which he thinks will be fair and equitable.  It is a question here of passing the buck, of asking local authorities to work out a reasonable scheme.</P>
    <P>At the present time no justification at all can be made for a substantial increase in the rents of local authority houses.  I agree with the assertion that to increase the rents of these houses at the present time will mean an increase in the cost of living which will be followed by a demand for higher wages because the present wages being paid to those people have been fixed, many of them by the Labour Court, many of them by negotiation and one of the <Col N="463" /> factors which were taken into consideration was the rent which those people had to pay.  What would the Minister and the Government say to a demand which might follow on his proposals for an increase in the wages payable to people living in local authority houses following these proposed increases?</P>
    <P>I want to tell the Minister with the utmost conviction he will not convince this House and will not convince the tenants of local authority houses that his idea is to reduce rents.  He simply will not get away with that.  Why should he refuse to pay a subsidy to people who refuse to reduce rents?</P>
    <P>I am strongly against this proposal for a number of reasons which I have outlined.  The first reason is that the time is most inopportune.  The second reason is that it will apply to houses which lack modern facilities and houses which should be provided with those modern facilities.  The third reason is that in arriving at the income of a family, the Minister proposes to charge against the head of the household income which everybody knows he does not in fact receive.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I suggest that this circular of the Minister, this draft of the Minister, should be postponed until such time as the Minister has discharged his obligation to the community of providing houses both for private individuals, who want to build their own houses and for local authorities who want to house people who are not fit to house themselves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>The action of the Minister in this regard cannot in any way be contradicted on the basis that he is not the architect of what is happening at the present time.  Prior to the issue of the circular dated 30th March, 1966, he indicated in this House, and elsewhere, that, in his view, the rents of local authority dwellings should be revised and that the basis of the revision should be that the maximum rents in the differential rent schemes should be equated with the full economic cost of the dwelling &mdash; not just the full economic cost of the dwelling at the time of its construction, or even one or two years after its construction, but <Col N="464" /> the full economic cost of providing the dwelling at this stage.  Further, in those cases in which there were fixed rents, many of them fixed 20 and 30 years ago, in his opinion, schemes should be introduced bringing these dwellings under a differential renting scheme and, in fixing the rate of the differential rent, the maximum rents should be the target, providing an equivalent rent structure at today's prices.</P>
      <P>The Minister embarked on this adventure following on his failure to agree to adjust the level of subsidy to local authorities.  In this House, and outside it, repeated appeals were made to the Minister pointing out that the level of assistance given by the State had been progressively declining over the years.  The subsidy on loan charges was a figure of two-thirds up to a maximum of £1,650.  When the same type of house was costing £2,500 to build, the loan charges subsidy remained at £1,650.  The Minister was not prepared to adjust it.  The approach was the same in the case of flat schemes.</P>
      <P>The Minister was quite open about his views.  He felt, as Minister, that people should pay economic rents.  The peculiarity is that those who buy their houses are not supposed to be required to pay economic prices.  The same Minister who was advancing this theory in relation to those who rent houses was quite willing, in the case of a house purchaser, that he should get a State grant, a supplementary grant and remission of rates.  In the Housing Bill, which went through this House not so long ago, he even referred to a development grant.  He indicated that local authorities might pay grants on the lines he suggested for development.</P>
      <P>He issued a circular to local authorities, dated 30th March.  In the course of that circular, he said in the appendix, paragraph 4:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The maximum rent for the dwelling in each group should be equivalent to the rent based on the actual or estimated cost of providing similar accommodation at current prices, adjusted to the general standard and amenity of the dwellings, together <Col N="465" /> with the amount calculated at one per cent of such cost to cover maintenance, depreciation and administration.</P>
    <P>He goes on to say that the level of rents should, in his opinion, be reviewed within every year once they were rationalised so as to provide increases if costs of building houses went up in the meantime or to provide some amelioration if there was a reduction in rates.</P>
    <P>What do we find?  The Minister sends a circular out to city and county managers and they proceed to implement that circular.  It was made quite clear that any future help to local authorities, meaning the city and county managers, would depend on how they reacted to the Minister's suggestion. There are many ways of issuing instructions and one of the most effective is to suggest to somebody that if he does not do something, then he will be at some disadvantage.  That is a good method of ensuring one's suggestions are implemented.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>What happened?  In the case of the city and county managers of Dublin, the suggestion was acted upon and a number of schemes were proposed.  In the case of earnings assessable for rent purposes which were 1/- or so more than the average industrial wage, there would be an increase in rent.  The increase could become quite substantial.  In a report submitted by the principal officer of the Housing Department, it was indicated that the maximum increase for a four-roomed dwelling would be as high as 8/- in the first year.  Over a period of five years, the maximum rent increase could be 40/-.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a great deal of talk about people in the lower income group getting reductions.  There is no reference to the fact that these increases will not only be 40/- maximum but 39/-, 38/-and 37/- on those whose income does not reach the maximum.  On a four-roomed dwelling, over a period of five years, the increase can be as much as 40/- maximum.  In the case of older dwellings, it can be £1 per week.  Let <Col N="466" /> us talk about the increase of 8/- a week in the first year.  A few months ago, when workers were looking for an adjustment in wage rates, the Government said they should not have any such adjustments.  Government speakers throughout the country advised against wage increases.  A few months later the Minister comes along and recommends to city and county managers that they must increase the rents of their tenants.</P>
    <P>Let us look at another aspect of this matter.  The circular states:</P>
    <P>The maximum rent for the dwellings in each group should be equivalent to the rent based on the actual or estimated cost of providing similar accommodation at current prices....</P>
    <P>This proposal, in respect of houses built in 1934, 1936 and 1938 would mean a maximum rent based on 12/6 per room, plus rates.  Yet, according to the information supplied as recently as the 12th January last, the full economic rent of houses built in Crumlin in 1934&mdash;and the full economic rate covers the cost of acquisition, development, construction and maintenance and also the current rates&mdash; works out at £1 8s 8d.  However, the Minister says to the managers: &ldquo;That is not good enough.  It is not good enough for people to pay even the full economic rent; you must have profit and you must increase the rent over and above the full economic rent.&rdquo;  We have the peculiar situation that people who have been tenants of corporation dwellings for upwards of 30 years, paying the rent fixed by local authorities, and any increase in rates that took place, plus a special contribution in respect of repairs, to the extent of 28/6, would be expected to pay 48/-.</P>
    <P>I suggest to Deputy Dowling that he should visit Dún Laoghaire and learn of the activities of his colleague for the Dún Laoghaire/Rathdown area, Deputy Andrews, who is making it known there that he is completely opposed to the proposal in the area to impose a substantial increase of rent on the cottages in Sallynoggin. At present the tenants pay 8/6d a week, plus rates, and he is completely <Col N="467" /> opposed to their being brought under the differential rents scheme.  When this debate has been concluded, it will be interesting to see if Deputy Andrews, and possibly the other Fianna Fáil Deputies who may be keeping very quiet on this issue, will vote with the Minister or vote in favour of their undercover activities in the various areas.</P>
    <P>Our motion says that the proposed increases are exorbitant and should not be supported.  The Parliamentary Secretary will hardly disagree with me when I say that to apply increases in the region of 8/- or 9/- per week this year and the same increases next year and the year after would certainly be to apply exorbitant increases.  At present instead of assisting people who need assistance, instead of building dwellings which are urgently needed and instead of providing the money for the acquisition of land so that housing schemes can go ahead, the Minister is engaged in an exercise of using his authority to issue this circular to the city and county managers urging them to impose these unjust increases on tenants of local authority dwellings.</P>
    <P>Many of these tenants up to the present have been fairly strong supporters of the Fianna Fáil Party and many of them are quite vocal about their objection to the scheme.  Unfortunately, however, some of them have the idea that these increases are being imposed by the elected representatives in the various local authorities. It has not been brought home to them sufficiently, but possibly this motion may do so, that the initiative in this matter lies with the Minister and nobody else and the city and county managers&mdash;and not for the first time&mdash;are acting as agents of the Minister.</P>

      <P>The House will remember during the debate on the Housing Bill the number of occasions on which this Party sought to have more power of decision left in the hands of the local representatives and that on each occasion the Minister <Col N="468" /> refused.  He was not prepared to listen to Deputies' arguments or their appeals for democratic decisions being left in the hands of democratically-elected people.  We know why the Minister was not prepared to do that. The Minister would know that a circular such as that issued by him on the 30th March enjoining city and county managers to impose rent increases would, if it were up to the elected representatives, be thrown out and treated with the contempt it deserves.</P>
      <P>It is not sufficient for the Minister to plead that there is a shortage of money.  Everyone is aware that there is a shortage of money and it was many weeks before the Minister admitted in this House that there was a shortage of money.  But to endeavour for the first time to get tenants of corporation dwellings to pay rents which are even in excess of the economic rent is surely an attitude that cannot be supported, when, on the other hand, the people who are willing or anxious to buy their own homes are supplied with grants and supplementary grants, etc.  Why is it that some attempt was not made to deal with the problem of those in the lower income group earlier?  Nobody with any knowledge of the situation will deny that a small percentage of the people will benefit but many of these will benefit only to a relatively small extent.  Many who benefit will be people who need other forms of assistance than a mere adjustment in their rents.  This is not a motion on which we can discuss in detail that aspect of the matter but the Minister and the Government and every Deputy knows the needs of the old age pensioners and the widows.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The justification put forward for putting increases on families where the income is fairly large because of the number of wage earners in the family is that people on a low income may derive some benefit.  Perhaps the Minister is not aware that in the case of a man and wife with three or four children, aged 16 to 19 years, with perhaps two of them having just started work, the calculation of what the differential rent will be for that family <Col N="469" /> is 13/4d. for the girl with perhaps 12 months' service in a factory and another 13/4d. for her brother who is also, perhaps, a year at work.  That amount of their income is to go towards building up the maximum.</P>
    <P>If the Minister or any Deputy behind him can make a case for £4 15. 0d. rent a week, I want to hear it.  If any Deputies who have knowledge of the circumstances in Dublin city can make a case for introducing a differential rents scheme for tenants who have been local authority tenants for 25 or 30 years and compelling them to pay very substantial increases in rent, I want to hear it.  They will not convince the tenants concerned that they are being treated with justice or equity. I support the motion and recommend its adoption by the House.</P>

      <P>We of the Fine Gael Party are only too glad to lend our support to this motion because it does no more than express our innermost thoughts regarding the outrageous proposal to fleece local authority tenants throughout the country to subsidise the Government in their financial crisis.</P>
      <P>I see in the <i>Evening Press</i> tonight that one of the elders of this House, Deputy MacEntee, is astonished that the Taoiseach should be resigning.  It is no cause of astonishment to those who see in this House a Government who do not know where their head or their tail is and who are simply going around in circles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last week we had a motion asking the Dáil to encourage CIE to provide free travel for old age pensioners and the Government went into the Lobbies and said as a matter of principle that it was wrong that social welfare beneficiaries should be subsidised out of the transport industry.  The Minister for Transport and Power and his colleagues enunciated their philosophy that social welfare beneficiaries, being people who were down and out and deserving of support from society, should get that support direct in the form of a direct State payment through the social welfare code and in no other way.  That is how they voted last week but this week we shall probably see them going to the Division <Col N="470" /> Lobbies saying that these social welfare beneficiaries must be supported out of the rents being paid by people in local authority houses because that is the only justification for the miserable plea being put up by the Minister for Local Government, the Government and the Fianna Fáil Party in defence of their outrageous proposals.</P>
    <P>They put the baby of the social welfare beneficiaries in their arms, give it a twist to make sure the baby cries and then they say that those who abhor these outrageous increases in rent want to make the baby cry even more.  But what the Minister is seeking to do is make every local authority tenant subsidise the social welfare beneficiaries.  He is not asking the well-to-do people who are not living in local authority dwellings to subsidise social welfare beneficiaries living in local authority houses because they cannot afford houses elsewhere but he is making the poor help the poor.  That is the whole basis of any justification which he has, as yet, proposed to the local authorities, the country or the Dáil in respect of this outrageous proposal.</P>
    <P>There are not too many grey hairs yet showing on my poll and I remember the time when my neighbours in Kimmage, Dublin, were by scores and hundreds down on their knees scraping for cinders in the dumps of Kimmage. Those are the people who 30 years ago went into the local authority houses in Kimmage.  They are the people who today, I am glad to say, in most cases can do a little better.  They are no longer on their knees in the rubbish and dirt of Dublin.  Perhaps they have a little car that they bought for about £50 third or fourth-hand.  Perhaps they have a television set and perhaps in the autumn of their days, they have some little comforts that they did not know 20 or 30 years ago.  But that is not good enough; they must not be left to enjoy this; we must reduce the local authority tenants down to the lowest common multiple.  We must make them, if they survive another few years, pay an extra 40/- or 45/- in their rents. If ever there was a more despicable <Col N="471" /> philosophy put before people for acceptance, I do not know it.</P>
    <P>It is well known that people in their younger days, when they establish homes, may find it a burden to pay the rent or the cost of a house, but if they are fortunate enough to have a deposit and take out a mortgage, their mortgage will be related to the price of the house at the time they purchased it.  Although the property may increase nominally in value&mdash;it may in ten or 20 years double in price in the open market&mdash;the repayments which people make under privately arranged mortgages or under mortgages with the local authorities remain at a level which is associated with the price of the house at the time it was built.  One would consider it fair that we should apply the same mode of payment to other people, people who, because they have not got deposits and because their incomes are low, dwell in local authority houses.  It is reasonable to argue that because one section of the community can enjoy repayments at a standard level associated with the price of the house at the time it was built, the less fortunate in the community might enjoy a similar experience, and to some extent that has applied until now.</P>
    <P>In the future it is not to apply to the less fortunate members of the community. They in future are to be obliged to pay&mdash;we shall not use the word &ldquo;rent&rdquo; because &ldquo;rent&rdquo; is a rather confined work; whether one pays a mortgage repayment, a rent or some other form of outgoing, it does not matter; we shall use the word &ldquo;outgoing&rdquo;&mdash;outgoings which have no relation to the cost of the house in which they dwell or in which they have dwelt for decades past.  This is a contemptible proposal.  It is a proposal which, no matter how the Minister may try to twist it, is directed against the section of the community which is not as well off as the people who are buying their own houses because they have the means to do so.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Fitzpatrick, and others here have emphasised the <Col N="472" /> dangerous inflationary spiral that will be set in motion by this proposal.  At the present time, for instance, in Dublin something like half the population of the city dwell in corporation houses.  Is there anybody here so foolish as to suggest that you are not creating and stimulating inflation if you oblige people to pay in the next five years rents which are not only a percentage of what they are now paying but increases which in some cases will be double and treble what they are now paying?  Is there anybody here so foolish as to suggest that a household who are called upon to pay in rent an increase of 40/- to 45/- over the next five years is not going to demand an increase in wages?  Of course they will, and more power to them for doing so, and it would be less than justice not to give them such increases in wages to meet the increase in the outgoings in their homes.  The alternative is to lower their standard of living, and there is no other way of describing it.  If you are to ask families to pay an extra £100 a year for the houses they now occupy, they are bound to demand increases in wages, no matter how many people in the house are bringing in money.</P>
    <P>One cannot understand Deputy MacEntee being astonished by the Taoiseach resigning.  How could it be otherwise when he has the Minister for Finance in Waterford asking for a relaxation of pressure on demands for increased income and, at the same time, the Minister for Local Government in the same Government setting in motion something which is going to put the greatest pressure on income increases that we have experienced for decades.</P>
    <P>In the Dáil tomorrow we shall have before us again the Rent Restrictions Bill which this Government are asking us to approve.  This Rent Restrictions Bill proposes increases in rent of 15 per cent only.  We could consider when we discuss this matter next week that 15 per cent in some of the circumstances envisaged in the Bill is not justifiable, but the Minister for Justice considers that all that is necessary to give equity to the owners of private houses is an increase of 15 per cent upon the basic rent which in some cases was created, <Col N="473" /> or certainly had its roots, as far back as 1914.</P>
    <P>That is the proposal for one section of the community, but again those are the people who are able to pay higher rents perhaps than many people in local authority dwellings.  However, this is not good enough for the local authority tenant.  He will be compelled under the Minister's proposals to pay, in some cases, rents 100, 200 or 300 per cent higher than he is paying at present, and that within a cycle of five years, with the pious indication that if he or she should fall on poor days, the rent will be reduced to a very low figure at the expense, I wish to emphasise, of his fellow-tenants in similar local authority accommodation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Larkin struck the nail well and truly on the head.  He drew attention, quite properly, to the fact that the State has been reducing its contribution to housing costs.</P>
    <P>There is a stranger in the House.  Of course, members of the Seanad can be nominated to the Government.  Goodness knows what is going to happen next.  Where was I before that apparition appeared.  I was saying that Deputy Larkin drew attention to the fact that the State has been reducing its contribution to housing costs.  We are tired to the point of being ill with the speeches of the Minister for Local Government indicating how much more in pounds, shillings and pence he is spending one year after another on housing.  The additional amounts which he has spent&mdash;and he knows this all too well&mdash;bear no relation to the overall increase in the cost of houses, and the State contribution towards the cost of local authority houses has been falling year after year, because the Minister has maintained the same subsidy ceiling whereas the costs of houses have been spiralling.  That has been bad enough in relation to houses but the situation becomes very much worse in relation to flats which are so much more costly to build.</P>
    <P>The real reason why 40,000 people in Dublin are converging from the suburban areas and marching here in the greatest protest of indignation we have ever experienced is that the <Col N="474" /> Government have been reducing the subsidy on housing one year after another.  The result is that if the Minister for Local Government and the Minister for Finance will not provide money for housing at a time housing is increasing in price, the money has to be produced somewhere. Therefore, some wiseacre thought up the idea: &ldquo;We shall milk the people who are living in houses which were built 30 or 40 years ago at a mere fraction of what it would cost to build them today.  These are the people who have matured over the years, who have now some members of their grown-up families working and living with them.  These are the people we shall milk for the future.  These are the people we will make pay for the Government's neglect in failing to raise the Government subsidy in accordance with the increased cost of building.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In addition, the Government's failure over a period of seven years to maintain an adequate number of new houses, at a time when money was plentiful, at a time when money was cheap, now obliges the Government, in a state of panic, to endeavour to make good their default at a time when money is scarce, when money is dear.  So it is that money must be borrowed at inflated rates of interest to build houses which are being put on the market at inflated prices and, notwithstanding the competition which exists in relation to tenders for local authority houses, the fact is that the housing industry is now so well arranged that the prices of even local authority houses can be kept at an artificially high level in order to ensure profits at the public expense.</P>
    <P>The sad situation will also exist that the tenants who are in comfortable circumstances but are unwilling to pay the rents which the Minister now proposes to exact from them and who may not be disposed to purchase the houses in which they live at the prices which apparently it is proposed to demand from them will not be in a position to move out of their houses into privately built houses because the money is simply not there to enable such houses to be bought. <Col N="475" /> The Minister knows all too well that builders in the private sector are experiencing financial difficulties.  Some have gone bust.  Others are on the verge of bankruptcy and can easily be tipped in there.  Others have avoided this predicament by simply stopping building altogether.  Whatever builders there are who still have money and their own resources are finding it difficult to build because building land is not available for them.</P>
    <P>So the position is that several people will have the gun put to their head.  Literally, they will have no choice.  It is only because of that, because there is no opportunity for election, no opportunity for choice, that this scheme is being brought in. If this scheme were brought in at a time when there was a generous supply of houses on the market, there are many local authority tenants who would get out of the houses they now occupy and perhaps it could be argued, although I would not support the argument, that it would be advantageous to bring in these penal rents because it would force out of local authority houses people who could well afford to buy their own. There are very few people&mdash;in fact, I am sure there are no tenants of local authorities&mdash;who could afford to buy their own houses outright and they would therefore be forced to look for mortgages.  There is simply no money available from Dublin Corporation, from Dublin County Council, from the Government or from any building society to finance tenants of local authority houses who want to surrender their houses rather than pay the penal rents which the Minister now proposes.</P>
    <P>So it is clear what the Minister's motive is, that is, to exact more money.  Quite clearly, at a time of financial crisis, when money is short, the Minister would not be asking local authorities to propose any scheme the net effect of which was going to reduce the amount of money available for housing purposes.  It is patent, therefore, even before we do any arithmetic on the consequences <Col N="476" /> of the Minister's proposals, that the whole object of this exercise is to extract more money out of local authority tenants.</P>
    <P>I said earlier, perhaps erroneously, that the Minister had only one justification for his scheme, and that was, that a marginal number of people might be on lower rents and that, therefore, the rest of the people should suffer rent increases of 200 and 300 per cent in order to pay for the marginal reductions to be given to a very small number of people but, of course, that was not the only argument to be advanced in favour of his scheme.  The other argument was that money was needed for the housing programmes. That is true.  Money is needed for future housing programmes but until now it has been possible to finance housing programmes without milking existing tenants to pay for the cost of future houses.  The Minister has not yet justified this change in policy, this change in outlook, that people who occupied houses years ago and who have ever since been repaying the cost of them should now, in addition to paying the cost of the old houses, also be called upon to pay the cost of houses to be built in future.</P>

      <P>I could accelerate to 40 but might knock down more obstacles on the way.  The kind of thing to which I have been referring reminds me of the annoyance which is often felt in some Dublin parishes where the parishioners build churches, halls and so on and then, with the spread of the city, are asked to contribute towards the cost of churches and halls to be built outside their parishes.  This causes a certain amount of vexation but, for the greater good of the greater number of people, in religious matters, people are prepared to make that sacrifice. <Col N="477" /> It becomes an entirely different exercise when people are asked, not only to pay for their own houses, but also to pay for houses for other people after they have paid for their own.</P>
      <P>It must be borne in mind that the tenants now occupying houses for 20, 30 and 40 years, at the time they first bought their houses were obliged to pay what was then the full economic rent.  Many of them went into houses in respect of which there was no subsidy paid by the State and the total cost fell upon the local authority.  In the meanwhile, I am glad to say, better counsels prevailed and Oireachtas Éireann passed legislation which would make it obligatory on the Government to come to the assistance of people in providing their own houses. But there are people who are paying what are called fixed rents today, or relatively low rents in relation to their income today, who at one time paid rents for their houses which represented as much as 25 per cent of their income.</P>
      <P>People who did that are entitled to some consideration in the autumn of their days.  Instead of being allowed now the benefit of the immense sacrifices which they made in those days, they are being obliged to pay for the Government's mistakes, to pay for that valley of seven years during which no houses were built, to pay for the Government's panic measures after neglecting housing for seven years, and to pay for the exorbitant rates of interest for any money borrowed here because of the Government's recklessness in financial matters for the last decade or so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is completely contrary to every canon of equity and I cannot see how the Minister can justify it.  If the object is to get people to buy their own houses.  I do hope the Minister for Local Government and the Government in general will no longer dig their heels in against the overwhelming wishes of Dublin Corporation, that the corporation will be facilitated in bringing in a tenant purchase scheme, that the State subsidy will be continued in relation to houses bought in <Col N="478" /> connection with a tenant purchase scheme.</P>
    <P>The Minister may not know, because I am sure his partisan colleagues behind him would not want to upset him when he has other things on his mind, but Deputy Dowling, Deputy Moore, Deputy Mrs. Lynch, Deputy Burke and others have said in Dublin Corporation that there should be a purchase scheme for Dublin Corporation tenants.  I do not blame the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Yes, Sir, but in relation to the scheme of local authority rents there is also the scheme for driving people to cease to be tenants and to become purchasers of their houses. That is a recognised object of the Minister's proposal.  My argument here is that in Dublin this becomes impossible, certainly for the majority of persons, because the Minister refuses to maintain the subsidy in relation to houses which people buy.</P>

      <P>The Department of Labour was founded mainly to deal with three related and specific problems: firstly, industrial relations; secondly, the implementation of a national manpower policy which includes training, retraining and accelerated training at all levels of industry, redundancy schemes and placement services to anticipate the strains which affect workers particularly in industry in changing circumstances; and thirdly, a wide range of legislation and other activity which must be calculated to bring about better conditions and a better climate for workers and to protect them against accidents and illness.  These are the three main purposes behind the establishment by the Government of the Department of Labour.</P>
      <P>It is worthy of note that the incumbent of the office is a man equal to the responsibility it demands.  The first Minister for Labour in the Dáil was Countess Markievicz.  She, at that time, saw the rigours and hardships of the workers in their struggle for the right of association in trade unions.  She was herself very much involved in the early period of that struggle.  It was a militant type of person who was required in those early, formative years.  Today, with the trade unions in the strong position they have fully earned for themselves, a calm, serious, deliberative person, with the technique of seeing both sides of an issue and of evaluating the justice of a case, was obviously the person to be chosen for this very important Department which will play an ever-increasing role in the future of a developing Ireland.  Deputy Hillery is such a man, and I have every confidence that his efforts in this field will bear great fruit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is much woolly thinking in regard to labour relations.  In any period of industrial crisis, we have experts, both professional and nonprofessional, giving all sorts of advice to the Government.  They tell us: &ldquo;You should stamp out strikes; a Government should govern&rdquo;&mdash;they suggest all sorts of methods which spring mainly from hysteria.  They do <Col N="480" /> not tell us to take the long-term view of more cordial relations between management and employee.  On a recent visit to the EEC headquarters in Brussels, we were briefed by the person in charge of the Labour Relations Department there.  One very significant statement he made was this. In the EEC countries, management and employee are viewed, not as antagonists in a war to gain more wages or give less wages, as the case may be, but more on the basis of the normal marriage where there is give and take on both sides, where there are good times and bad.  This is the atmosphere they have created.  No one can be complete boss.  There must be a certain amount of fluid movement between both sides as to who is in command.  If it is all one-way traffic, it will not work.  There must be some degree of commonsense between both parties.</P>
    <P>I quote an illustration of this.  One of the industries in my constituency is Bulmers of Clonmel.  This industry started in a very small way with six people.  With management and workers co-operating, it has now grown to an industry employing nearly 200 people and well over that figure at peak periods.  The managing director was one of the original six who started it.  He appreciates their problems. There is regular consultation between the unions, the shop stewards and the management.  This has made for a greater degree of trust between both sides and they both realise this. It is of no advantage for one to persecute the other.  If the employer persecutes the employee, he will get less return from the employee.  Similarly, if the employee demands too much in wages, which must be reflected in the price structure of the commodity to be sold, he may well deny himself a job if production costs become too high.  But by this kind of teamwork, they have made a success of this industry and brought it from humble beginnings to the concern it is today.</P>
    <P>When people talk about strikes, they always seem to pick on the employee. In many instances management in this country is not suited to or trained for <Col N="481" /> its responsibilities.  Indeed, it might well be said that in all too many cases management was inherited rather than merited.  In the future&mdash;and indeed this is evolving now from present trends&mdash; management will be trained specifically in this field and will have a greater capacity to understand the many problems of the employee and of the various unions.</P>
    <P>Something that would seem to have gained a lot of public sympathy and possibly support during the industrial unrest in the past year was the idea of the semi-strike being brought into operation.  This works fairly well in Florida.  If a dispute arises between employer and employee, the employee cannot withdraw his labour, nor can the employer lock the employee out for the term of the dispute.  Production continues but both sides subscribe to a central fund.  The employer gives half his profits for the duration of the dispute and the employee gives half his wages.  If a settlement is effected within a certain number of days, both parties can withdraw the amounts subscribed by them.  If the dispute is not settled within the specified period, the money collected is sent to the local authority to be disposed of.  This may have many demerits but it certainly has the merit of being a positive inducement to both sides to resolve their problems.  We have seen down through the years that, no matter what the dispute, however justified it might have been and however protracted, eventually a settlement had to be made.  Surely it would be in the interests of all to have that settlement made early rather than late?</P>
    <P>Deputy Donegan by insinuation and innuendo implied that many people were trigger-happy about going on strike.  I do not accept this.  We know well that the average wage earner spends his wages every week and indeed is committed to a great deal of expenditure through hire purchase rentals and such like.  He will not wilfully put himself in a position in which he and his wife and family will have to accept a lower living standard for the duration of a strike that might go on for some weeks or some months.  He will not do <Col N="482" /> this without some justification or cause. There is never a strike without some basis of reason and some very cogent reason.  People just do not go off and deny themselves the luxuries or the necessaries of life because they want to prove that they can go out on strike.</P>

      <P>Reference has been made to the Labour Court.  Deputy O'Leary, I think, said he would not like to see any great interference with it and, indeed, neither would I.  I think the Labour Court functions reasonably well.  Unfortunately, their recommendations are not always implemented or are not implemented with a sufficient degree of promptitude to solve the problems they have deliberated upon.  There is room here for greater scope for the Minister and his Department to explore the avenues and approaches so as to ensure that, with the co-operation of ICTU and FUE, the findings of the Labour Court will become a little more binding and will be implemented more quickly than at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Donegan spoke about the ESB Bill.  At one stage he lamented the fact that it was put through the Oireachtas, and in the next breath, vehemently defended the right of the worker to strike.  That seems a contradiction. Maybe I misunderstood him, but I doubt it.  We saw that there is a point at which a Government, in the national interest, must take action. It may be unpopular action but it must be taken.  The ESB Bill was an instance of that.  Surely we could not deny to all people, in justification of the right to strike, the right to electricity, the right to save life.  Dilatory action on our part might unwittingly have made us executioners of people who, for example, are sick.  We could <Col N="483" /> cause grave harm to industry, to life itself and to the social amenities of people.  These are a few points on this subject and I think they are quite relevant.</P>
    <P>The other aspects of the Department of Labour are such that we just cannot say that the Department of Labour is designed specifically to deal with industrial disputes.  It has other very specific functions.  It has to look after the health of the workers and ensure that factory regulations are complied with by all people who own or run factories and that the workers in these factories enjoy the benefits of legislation. Again, many of the laws under which trade unions operate at the moment are somewhat archaic.  The earliest trade union law is, I believe, 1871, almost 100 years ago.  Surely what was suitable for that time can no longer be justified as being suitable for the 20th century?  Indeed, we are coming to the autumn of the 20th century.  We must visualise, then, a more realistic approach by all sides to labour problems and industrial relations, all told.</P>
    <P>Manpower policy is another facet which comes under the aegis of this Department.  It was dealt with here at length by the present Minister for Health, then Deputy S. Flanagan, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  Again, we find that changing circumstances must bring with them changing demands and changing solutions.  We feel that people can no longer be located in a spot with factories and shops established at their doorstep.  Rather would it sometimes be more convenient and more profitable for all concerned to have workers commute to industrial centres and to have residential towns built in reasonable proximity to these industrial centres.</P>
    <P>The Government have two basic functions in the field of industrial relations. The first is to provide machinery with which to help the parties to resolve their differences.  I have no doubt a manpower policy will bring to life many differences.  Through natural resistance, people will be slow to move <Col N="484" /> into new fields.  This is human.  We dread the unknown and stick the known, no matter how much it may be to our disadvantage.  I suppose the old axiom that the devil you know is better than the devil you do not know is one of the prime causes of this.</P>
    <P>The Department of Labour has another very important function, that is, to maintain proper relations between the public, the Department, workers and industry, generally speaking. I want to quote from the Minister's speech what I consider to be a very important sentence.  He said:</P>
    <P>Institutions, to remain useful, must be dynamic.  They must be sensitive to change in the sphere in which they are operating and they must respond to such changes.</P>
    <P>That, I think, is the challenge of this new Department.  It is adapting itself and the Government, by establishing it, have proved that they are adapting themselves to changing circumstances. ICTU and FUE must do likewise. We cannot have a stalemate nor can we hold on forever to the ideas current 20, 30, 40 or 50 years ago.  No matter how much in vogue they were then, they are obsolete now to a lesser or to a greater degree.</P>
    <P>We believe also, in the field of bargaining, that every man &mdash; this is human nature &mdash; will be a bargainer when it comes to his job and that the employer will not be willing to give out 10/- if he can get away with 8/-because he is in the manufacturing business to make money and profit. Neither will the trade unions be willing to accept 8/- if they think they can get 10/-.  The merits of these cases will work themselves out, provided all parties go in with an open and realistic mind, so that if they find, in the particular field of industry in which they are negotiating, that there are difficulties ahead, they will, in the interests of their own members, make an effort to curb the impatience, possibly, of people seeking an increase, for the time being at least, so as to allow the factory or industry to get on to a firmer footing.</P>
    <P>The accident portion of this Department and how it relates to workers is, <Col N="485" /> I think, of primary importance.  I am sure that, <i>inter alia,</i> this will be connected with the Department of Social Welfare when the new legislation comes before the House.  This is a very worthwhile development.  It should be given every chance to bring benefit to those most in need of it.  We all know that at present a worker who suffers accident in his work receives £4 10s per week workmen's compensation. If an award is made subsequently, this money has to be refunded.  Because of the length of time it often takes to adjudicate on such a case, it frequently happens that a family are in very reduced circumstances because of commitments, grocery bills, and so on. Lack of finance can reduce the family and the spirit of the family to a very depressed level.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to say that the Department of Labour can function well, and will function well if it gets full co-operation from all sides involved in industrial relations, be they employer or employee.  It is only with maximum effort on the part of both sides that the Department, which will be acting in the best interests of the nation, which will be acting as the watchdog of the under-privileged, which will be acting as mediator and protector for all, will work well, and I wish the Minister and his Department success in bringing about more rational and agreeable industrial relations in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am particularly interested in one or two of the opening remarks of the Minister for Labour where he refers to the fact that there were two previous Minister for Labour in the first and second Dáils.  The Minister for Labour at column 1795, volume 224, of the Official Report of 20th October, 1966, said:</P>
      <P>A Ministry of Labour operated under the first Dáil Éireann and the second Dáil Éireann, and did a good deal particularly in the field of conciliation and mediation in industrial disputes.  For the record, I should say that there were only two holders of the office of Minister of Labour, namely, Madame Markievicz and Joseph McGrath.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="486" /> The peculiarity about that is that the first Minister of Labour was Madame Markievicz and, yet, the Minister in introducing his Estimate, gave no indication whatsoever, as far as I can see, that he was going to interest himself in taking on some of the functions which have been adopted in countries outside this in relation to the principle of equal pay for equal work.  It appears to me, whatever other Ministers may have had as an excuse as successor to Madame Markievicz in that particular post, no one would suggest that the late Madame Markievicz played any less than a full share in the struggle for independence.  Yet, today there is throughout the Government services, throughout local authorities, throughout industry and commerce, throughout the factory life of this country, the position where people of the same sex as Madame Markievicz are given lesser recognition, are paid less, purely because of their sex.</P>
    <P>There are doctors, nurses, psychiatric nurses, civil servants, girls and women in factories who, and I am speaking about people who are doing the same work, accepting the same responsibility, required to undergo the same period of training, are paid less than men.  The new Minister for Labour at column 1798 of the same volume said:</P>
    <P>Wages and salaries are ordinarily settled and adjusted through a system of free collective bargaining. This process is enshrined in a number of international conventions and it has been accepted, in principle at least, by organised labour, by employer organisations and by the public generally in this country.</P>
    <P>But the Minister did not refer also to the fact that the Convention on equal pay for equal work is also accepted in progressive countries, by the Governments of these progressive countries, by employers and by trade unions, but, so far, this Convention has not been signed by this country which prides itself in other spheres on attempting to give some leadership.  I hope the Minister will deal with that point and will give some assurance to <Col N="487" /> the thousands and thousands of people who serve the country well, and who work hard, many of whom have gone through their schools and their university, many thousands of those whose university has been the university of the factory, of the shop, etc. but who are treated in the State, purely on the grounds of sex, as second-class citizens in this regard.</P>
    <P>Of course, I think it is to some extent a reflection on their fellow women-folk and a reflection on us in this House that there are so few women Deputies elected to Dáil Éireann. Consequently, it is left on occasion for some of us to say a word on this matter.</P>
    <P>I speak of industrial relations, first of all.  I think it only just and proper that tribute should be paid to the efforts of the Labour Court, and particularly to the conciliation officers over the years for their work in endeavouring to maintain, or bring about, peace in industry.  The work of a conciliation officer in particular is very difficult.  Not everybody is equipped to deal with it in quite the same way.  Certainly the community has been fortunate in having had over the years a number of outstanding conciliation officers.  They have come into the most difficult industrial situations and by exercising their tact and their knowledge of the background of the industry and their experience of conducting cases have been successful in settling many serious disputes. Unfortunately, a number of these disputes should never have occurred. They would never have occurred if there was the same exercise of understanding and the same attempt to discuss the problem in a realistic way by those directly involved.</P>
    <P>This situation is not peculiar to private employers or those engaged in the operation of industrial or commercial undertakings for the purpose of making profit for their shareholders. This situation has occurred on a number of occasions in semi-State bodies and even in Departments for which the Minister is responsible to this House.  For instance, there was <Col N="488" /> the deplorable situation last year which was caused by the failure, and it was a failure, on the part of the responsible people in the Board of Works. The situation was only a minor inconvenience to Deputies who suffered from lack of heat here but it was a situation in which a number of people who only were desirous of doing their work efficiently were forced to take action.  They were treated&mdash; and in this case they were not females but male workers, many of them with many years' conscientious service&mdash;as second class citizens because they were not skilled craftsmen.  The Labour Court eventually came up with a formula to settle the dispute after some weeks.</P>
    <P>I might also take this opportunity of bringing to the attention of the Minister for Labour the situation which exists, according to information given to me as a result of Dáil questions, in the various Departments of Government. The Minister for Labour is responsible, he tells us, for just a little bit more than just acting as Minister for Labour in a narrow field. He is concerned, I think, with endeavouring to ensure that the relationships between employers and workers are maintained at a reasonably good level.  Let us hope that that extends to those who are treated as second-class citizens by his colleagues along the bench.  There are thousands employed in the various Departments who are not entitled to any sick pay if they are out sick in contradiction to the situation in most semi-State organisations, in practically all local authoties and in most substantial private concerns.  No provision is made for them when they retire after 30 or 40 years' service except a miserable gratuity.  I hope the Minister will consider that it is part of his privilege to exercise on his own colleagues his wisdom by directing their attention to the fact that what would be expected from a private employer should be granted without any difficulty by a Minister of State or a semi-State body.</P>
    <P>The Labour Court has done well and proof of that is the percentage of its recommendations which have been <Col N="489" /> accepted.  It is somewhat unfortunate, I think, that in recent years, in contrast to the experience in the earlier years, the recommendation in many cases says that &ldquo;having regard to the circumstances of the case we recommend so-and-so.&rdquo; In the earlier stages of the Labour Court the recommendations not only included a recommendation as to what they thought should meet the situation but, in most cases, also included a summary not of the case presented by the workers' side and the case presented by the employers' side but a summary of their own views.  It is possibly true to say that at times some of their views were not too well liked.  If, when making a reommendation, the Labour Court made some criticism of how the case was presented now and again the criticism might have been resented but it was very useful criticism because it placed on both sides, whether the representatives of the workers or the representatives of the employers, the responsibility of documenting their case fully.  If they failed to do so and were criticised, the individuals concerned learned something for dealing with future cases.</P>
    <P>The court was set up on the basis of using the services voluntarily and on the principle that it was there to bring about and maintain peace in industry. The provisions in the 1946 Act were that if both parties wished to have the case dealt with under the clause for arbitration, they could do so and this was resorted to on a few occasions and with full freedom to each party to do so.  Its value was that it was a voluntary organisation.  It had no power to arbitrate and at the very start the suggestion of having professional advocates was resisted and dropped from the earlier proposals.</P>
    <P>One of the problems in recent years as far as the Labour Court is concerned has been that there has been an inadequate number of conciliation officers available.  On many occasions a conciliation officer was asked to go in to try to settle a dispute and he came at a time when attitudes had been taken up, when the lines had been drawn and when it was difficult for either side to <Col N="490" /> move without giving an impression that they were retreating.  In many of these disputes if the conciliation officer had been able to come in earlier with a knowledge of the situation it is quite likely that a number of them would not have taken place.  The main need as far as I can see is an extension of this particular machinery, the provision of earlier conciliation.</P>
    <P>One of the problems for both employers and workers in the Labour Court machinery is that an officer does not acquire the skill overnight.  Just at the particular point where he becomes expert at conciliation, there is an opportunity for him to advance in the Civil Service.  Nobody would want to deprive a person who has served in such a capacity of that opportunity; but it can mean then that the situation will arise in which some new conciliation officer has to start the tortuous procedure of learning the job all over again.  I will say that some of them certainly developed a knowledge and understanding of the process very quickly indeed.</P>
    <P>Reference was made also in the course of the discussion, by the Minister and others, to the question of factory inspectors and safety inspectors. There are just one or two points I should like to make in relation to the question of factory inspectors.  The Minister has a situation where there are insufficient offices available for the purpose of carrying out fairly thorough and constant inspections of factories. Too often reports are received of complaints made at the factories inspectors' branch of inspectors arriving at a factory and carrying out an inspection without the workers in the factory being aware that he was there, without his having even contacted any representative of the workers for the purpose of ensuring that the complaint made is properly investigated.  The Minister will have his hands full with the question of factory inspection alone, if he determines to carry out a thorough investigation of many of the backstreet factories operating in nearly every city and town in this country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="491" /> The same may be said of safety inspectors but, in this regard, I agree wholeheartedly with the Minister when he indicates that there is a lack of co-operation on almost all sides in respect of this very necessary precaution against accidents or injuries at work. The establishment of safety committees was introduced in legislation in this House by a former Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I do not know whether it is because we are all too human in this country, but there is too much of an atmosphere of familiarity breeding contempt&mdash;that because we are daily exposed to certain risks of injury to our eyes or limbs, <i>et cetera,</i> after a while we start to regard this risk as natural.  On too many occasions there is difficulty in persuading workers even to utilise the equipment available to them for their own protection.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, while most progressive firms have been willing to go along with the safety legislation, have been willing to recognise and work with safety committees and safety delegates, even today there are too many of them who are prepared to accept safety delegates as necessary evils. Safety committees, made up of a combination of safety and welfare committees, in fact are not afforded the full opportunity of doing their primary job; that is, to endeavour to look after the safety of their fellow workers.  In too many cases employers, while they may pay lip service and will assure the Minister they are fully in accord with every effort being made to protect the workers and to operate the legislation, when the Minister's representatives go along there, the constructive recognition of safety committees appointed by the workers is very little indeed.  I am glad to see that the Minister is prepared to see what can be done to improve that situation.</P>
    <P>I do not think anything need be said at any great length about the necessity for training and retraining. The Minister referred to it and there will be quite a number of contributions in relation to the need for training redundant workers.  There is a necessity for dealing with the question of redundancy compensation without <Col N="492" /> delay because, so far, while there has been a willingness to discuss in certain parts of industry redundancy compensation, there has been no real willingness to arrive at any particular adequate and acceptable agreement.  Part of this is due to the fact that for some time the question of the introduction of redundancy compensation on a national scale has been visualised and referred to.  Consequently, in many parts of industry the employers' side has been reluctant to do anything in the matter, awaiting some action at Government level.  Therefore, we hope this matter will be dealt with without any undue delay.</P>
    <P>The Minister now is responsible for employment in some respects.  I wonder would he consider whether that would include giving special attention to the difficulties of those in their fifties and upwards in obtaining employment because there is a particularly difficult problem when people, even in their late forties, lose employment because of redundancy, temporary redundancy or otherwise. They will have extreme difficulty in finding new employment of any permanent nature.  Even in circumstances where there is a reasonable demand for workers, there is still this attitude that once a worker goes beyond a certain age, he is to be put to one side. I suggest to the Minister that he might have this aspect of the matter examined and see to what extent he can assist the people concerned.</P>
    <P>In relation to the general field of industrial relations and negotiations, it is essential, in my opinion, that the workers should have full freedom to negotiate, to use the system of collective bargaining which they have won at such great expense.  There should be no interference with their rights to settle disputes by way of negotiation, to deal with their legitimate claims by way of negotiation, and if they consider it necessary, in accordance with their normal procedures, when they fail to get a settlement of their legitimate claims by negotiation, there should be no interference with their rights to resort to industrial action.</P>
    <P>Deputy Davern, in making a small <Col N="493" /> contribution in this matter, used the hoary old phrase, &ldquo;in the national interest&rdquo;.  That is a term that can be used too readily.  It was used in relation to the Offences Against the State Act, which this Party opposed; it was used in the case of the ESB Act, which this Party opposed; and if the occasion arises, it can be used on any pretext.</P>

      <P>As reported in the Official Report of 20th October, at column 1800, the Minister said:</P>
      <P>I shall regard it as my duty to see that negotiators have access to the most up-to-date information on national economic affairs.</P>
      <P>I have no quarrel with that.  He continued:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall continue to exhort them to have proper regard to that information when making settlements, in the hope that adjustments in wages, <Col N="494" /> salaries and conditions will be kept within the bounds set by increases in national production.  If, having done all that, I find that settlements in excess of the growth in national production are being negotiated, then some fundamental policy changes in regard to our procedures must be considered.</P>
    <P>I do not like that phrase, &ldquo;settlements in excess of the growth in national production&rdquo;.  The Minister talks about a viable economy.  There is a bit more to the term &ldquo;viable economy&rdquo;.  Adjustments in wage rates and salaries to meet changes in the situation either on a national basis or on the basis of the people employed in industry or commerce must also be viable. There is no use in the Minister coming to this House&mdash;and I hope he is not suggesting that he would do so&mdash;like King Canute and saying: &ldquo;So far; the tide stops there when I say it&rdquo;, because the tide will flow over him and anyone like him.</P>
    <P>We have a long way to go before the average workers are in receipt of salaries or wage rates which would give them the standard of living to which they are entitled as human beings.  There is far too great a disparity in the living standards of the workers.  In some sections, an adjustment of 3½ per cent at a certain time might be satisfactory, while at the same time, another section might need to be given an adjustment of 5½ per cent, 6½ per cent or 10½ per cent which might at the time be in excess of the growth in the national economy.</P>
    <P>It is not very many months since thousands of workers in this city were walking the streets because the employers listened to someone saying that if they gave any more than 3½ per cent, the national economy would be in danger.  Thousands of men and women had to walk the streets to convince the employers that that should not have been attempted.  I recommend to the Minister, since he will have a lot on his plate, that he should turn his attention to another situation that exists and is beginning to be a source of trouble.</P>
    <P>I was reading an article in a personnel magazine yesterday in which some <Col N="495" /> personnel managers in Britain highlighted this problem of the disparity in fringe benefits between workers employed in the same undertakings; such fringe benefits as holiday entitlements, sick pay entitlements, working hours and so on.  The Minister is aware that this is a situation which is growing and will develop.  There are some groups of workers who work a 35½ hour week and in the same undertaking, other workers are required to work a 44 hour week, a 42½ hour week or a 40 hour week.  When he is examining that situation, the Minister might also discuss the situation existing in his own Department and in his colleagues' Departments.</P>
    <P>These are matters in which the Minister possibly will not take any active part, except that he may advise the parties concerned to face up to the realities of the situation.  In the year 1966, it is somewhat contradictory to have workers in an undertaking working a 35 hour week, a 36 hour week or a 37½ hour week, covered by a sick pay scheme, perhaps with additional holidays, and possibly with a pension scheme, whereas their fellow workers engaged in productive work in the same undertaking work a 40 hour week or a 42½ hour week and have no sick pay scheme, shorter holidays, and in too many cases are not covered by a superannuation scheme.  This situation is changing rapidly elsewhere and a move in that direction is starting here.  I hope the Minister for Labour, under whose aegis many of these changes will be brought about, will bear this in mind and set a good example in the national sphere.</P>
    <P>There are the employees of the Board of Works, for instance.  Surely the Minister for Labour can consult with the Minister for Finance&mdash;of course I do not know who he will be next Thursday&mdash;and say to him: &ldquo;Is it not time you had a look at the staff?&rdquo; He could also consult with the Minister for Defence under whose authority these conditions also exist. Ministers and even the Taoiseach have spoken in this House about <Col N="496" /> creating an atmosphere in which industrial relations problems can be settled.  As well as creating an atmosphere, the Minister for Labour might get his colleagues to set a national example.  There are far too many State employees being treated as second-class citizens.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to deal with matters which the Minister has indicated he is considering, for instance, the matter of working parties on both sides of industry.  I do not think that a contribution by me at this stage would be of any great value because I have no doubt the spokesmen for both sides will more than adequately present their cases.  When these discussions or examinations are completed, there may be another day's work to be done.  I hope the Minister will listen and pay attention to the arguments and submissions presented to him by an organisation who are directly representative of workers in the country. If he listens to the points made by them, he will not make many mistakes in dealing with this problem.  I said at the beginning that we wish the Minister and his Department well and I should like to conclude by repeating that I sincerely trust he will be successful in his endeavours.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a pity that when the Department of Labour began, the wrong foot was put forward as I believe it was when the Minister stepped into the same building as the Labour Court.  It was a very serious error to house the Department of Labour and the Labour Court in the one building. It is like putting the Department of Justice in the Four Courts and I believe the Minister for Labour will bring on himself a great deal of difficulty because of that location.  The reason I say so is that already doubts have been expressed about the impartiality of an industrial court which works side by side with a Government Department concerned primarily with the issuing of directives, the creation of policy and administrative matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I submit it is desirable that at the earliest possible time the Minister should find a home in a building other than that housing the Labour Court. <Col N="497" /> The Labour Court to date has primarily been an arbitration court or a court concerned with settling disputes that had reached or were about to reach the level of war, but in any event the very title of the Labour Court indicates that it is a place where decisions are taken by impartial people between disputing parties.  The association of a Government Department with what ought to be an independent agency is undesirable.  I would be the last in the world to suggest a proliferation of Government buildings or of unnecessary accommodation but I suggest it would be preferable to have at least a visual separation and, on that account, separate buildings are greatly to be desired.</P>
    <P>I doubt, for instance, if people would have confidence in the impartiality of our courts if the Minister for Justice were to be housed in the room next door to the Chief Justice. This is not to suggest that individuals who have held these offices and who will hold them in the future would in fact deliberately qualify their decisions because of their proximity one to the other, but doubts certainly arise and doubts have already arisen.  I have heard them voiced by people of the highest integrity and it would be wrong to let this occasion go by without bringing these matters out in the open because the sooner this is done, the sooner such matters will be remedied.</P>
    <P>We note that the Minister said he has an information officer.  Might we appeal to him to see to it that the information officer will concern himself with informing Members of the Oireachtas on the operations of the Department?  It is unfortunate that no information was passed to Deputies regarding the Government's proposals in relation to trade union law and industrial relations law until the matter had already been headlined in the public Press and until negotiations had taken place between the Minister and the various people directly concerned. Ultimate decisions in relation to trade union law and industrial relations law will have to be taken here on these benches and the people who will have to make these laws are entitled to be <Col N="498" /> informed.  It was only when a specific appeal and an application were directed to the Department that members of the Opposition became aware of the Government's proposals.</P>
    <P>Then we saw why there were rumblings and the trade union movement were not prepared to accept the Government's heads of policy.  We find that the proposals in relation to trade union law are entirely rules governing the declaration and the conduct of war.  They show little understanding of the basic problems of disputes in industrial matters.  They endeavour to treat symptoms as the root cause of industrial difficulties.  All they propose amounts to rules or conventions which they will endeavour to oblige both sides to accept when both sides are already in a state of war.</P>
    <P>We in Fine Gael regard this as a confession of failure and as an acknowledgment that the Government, notwithstanding all that has been said in this House and elsewhere, have not yet grasped the real situation in regard to industrial relations.  They seem to have in mind that the Government, and the Government alone, are the people who can decide what is or is not a trade union, that the Government, and the Government alone, may decide whether any new group is to be recognised as a trade union.  I am sure we all cherish the belief that freedom is something precious.  If we believe that, there must be freedom for people to form associations.</P>
    <P>We believe that if there are people who disagree with the majority in their own trade union, who disagree with the executives and find themselves unable to remain in the same company or the same union, they have a right to form a new association.  Many of the groups which we now recognise as lawful trade unions, many of the groups which have contributed immensely to the welfare of the workers and the welfare of the country in general, were at one time rebel organisations.  That has not, in any way, diminished the contribution they have made towards the welfare of the workers.  It is quite likely that the workers might not be in whatever <Col N="499" /> relatively better situation they are in now as compared with the past if there had not been freedom to form such rebel organisations in the past.</P>
    <P>We believe that if we are to have a situation in which the Government withhold recognition of any new organisation, we will only crystallise the differences in those organisations. If there is a breakaway group, although you may condemn them for doing so, may deplore fragmentation, and might wish this not to happen, we believe no amount of wishful thinking can ignore the fact that if there is this breakaway, it is because a group of men are discontented.  You will not create content by saying you will not recognise this discontent.</P>
    <P>When we speak of such breakaway groups, it is no harm to mention them by name.  The National Busmen's Union now caters for the greater number of busmen within CIE.  If I understand the situation, although it may be an irritant and an embarrassment, this arose out of the discontent of a large number of men with their own union.  It may be they themselves were the cause of this discontent in that they did not participate as actively as they should have in the organisation of their union.  Despite that, this does not confer on this House or Minister any right to interfere with the freedom of association, nor does it give any right to anybody to say: &ldquo;We will tell the unions how to run their affairs&rdquo;. That is what we find the Government have in mind.  We do not know what way as yet the Government are prepared to mend their hand.  It is most unfortunate that they should have started off on the wrong foot and in the wrong direction.  This is indicative of a dangerous frame of mind.  We can only hope that better counsels will prevail.</P>
    <P>The idea which the Government have to prevent any strike which they call an unofficial strike is no remedy for disputes.  There are many ways in which workers can protest other than strikes.  What is to happen if the Minister declares a particular strike unlawful <Col N="500" /> and the workers return to work? They can then use the weapon of the work to rule and this can cause a whole industry to grind to a stop.</P>
    <P>I have never had any great faith in contracts which have to rely upon sanctions for their carrying out.  If the Minister prohibits a strike, this will not bring about industrial peace.  We believe it is extremely lamentable that Government thinking in relation to industrial matters should be confined to this state of war.  Usually the cause of a strike can be found years earlier in growing discontent and lack of communication between management and workers.  As far as we see it, the Government have done little thinking in depth in that particular field, and until such time as the Government do some thinking in this matter, we do not think there is any hope of successfully tackling the problem.</P>
    <P>The people in Aer Lingus deserve our congratulations for having successfully concluded this new contract.  We should congratulate any activity which can lead to industrial peace and to the welfare of the workers in general.  It is certainly a great achievement and a milestone in our industrial relations that it has been done in Aer Lingus. From what we know of CIE and the ESB, we believe that both those organisations are very far away from making such an agreement.  I say this, and I say it critically of the management of CIE, notwithstanding the most improper remarks of Mr. T. P. Hogan, the Chairman of that organisation yesterday, when he denounced the members of this House for daring to criticise the management of CIE.  He said we were not even able to manage our own affairs.  Notwithstanding his audacity in that regard, if he listened to what is being said here, he would know what is being said on the shop floor and in the CIE system, and he would know the opinion of the ordinary people of this country.  Until such time as CIE listen to what the ordinary people have to say, whose representatives we are, we believe the sorry state of affairs in CIE will continue.  We will deal with Mr. Hogan's improper <Col N="501" /> remarks another time.  His remarks are a reflection on the people we represent and whom we are supposed to be serving.</P>
    <P>The rights of workers to continuity of employment and to security have not been properly recognised in this country as yet.  We consider it obligatory on our society so to arrange things that workers and their families can look forward to the future with some degree of confidence.  Therefore it is essential, whether their employment is terminated because of the failure of their employer, because of changes in economic activity, redundancy caused by any trade arrangement or otherwise, that we ensure that workers get longer notice before their employment is terminated in future and that they get some compensation when their employment is terminated.</P>
    <P>Last week I addressed a question to the Minister relating to a group of firms in this city who have recently announced they are to amalgamate. We are told that, as a result of that amalgamation, 58 workers, at present in what appears to be permanent employment, will be declared redundant and will be discharged after having received certain compensation.  Unfortunately, the situation is much worse than the public announcement would lead us to believe.  There are 58 people in what is classified as permanent employment who will be discharged but my information is that there will be a couple of hundred people who will be upset in their lives because of this new arrangement.  There are people who are regarded as temporary and part-time, and the fact that their classification in the firm's employment may not be as high as that of a person who is full-time and permanent does not solve their difficulties, difficulties which will be immense as soon as their particular employments come to an end.  Many of them are necessarily supplementing incomes in their families by part-time employment.  Many of them, from time to time, when domestic circumstances allow, take up employment for short periods.  All these are employment opportunities lost and incomes lost to the families in question.</P>
    <P>We appreciate that we cannot discourage <Col N="502" /> the move towards rationalisation, and, as this appears to be inevitable, it is essential that we should expedite the introduction of a redundancy scheme and make provision for redundancy payments, where appropriate, and new training facilities, where appropriate.  We feel the Government are dragging their feet too much where this particular problem is concerned.  I do not think there will be any reluctance on the part of employers or employees to contribute towards a scheme of redundancy payments and retraining and we would hope there would be no reluctance on the part of the Government to contribute the major share towards such a scheme, though the Government have indicated on occasion that they think they should be free of all financial responsibility in this matter.  We do not think they can be free of all financial responsibility, the more so as redundancy will take place as a direct result of treaties made by the Government, and for no other reason.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear from the pattern of growing unemployment that redundancy is also growing.  Some of it is due, of course, to the financial crisis through which, because of the Government's mismanagement, the country is going, but some arises because firms are already making arrangements to adjust to the competition which will be inevitable in free market conditions. What is unfortunate at the moment is that the redundancy which has taken place because of the new economic developments is concealed in the growing volume of unemployment due to the financial crisis.  It is imperative, if people are to be saved from emigration and if homes are not to be broken up, that the Government should take steps now to provide a proper scheme of redundancy payments and retraining.</P>
    <P>If I might return for a moment to the case of the firm I mentioned last week, apart from the 58 people referred to in the published statement, a large number of workers will be retired compulsorily when they reach 58 years of age.  That is an extraordinarily young age at which to retire workers, particularly when they are in an <Col N="503" /> employment which does not impose any tremendous physical strain or call for any great physical exertion, and the problem is, therefore, much greater than it would appear to be on the surface.</P>
    <P>Though I make these comments, I do not minimise in any way the generosity of the firm in question or the efforts they are making to meet the problems which are arising.  One part of the programme provides that the payments which are to be made to the workers declared redundant and to those who are retiring will be reduced by whatever sums may be provided for in the Government's scheme of redundancy payments.  What the workers are being compelled to accept at the moment is an agreement which will be qualified by something which is as yet unknown.  That is undesirable. There is a likelihood that other workers will be affected in the not too distant future and it is imperative that the Government should, without further delay, declare their intentions in this regard so that workers will know exactly where they stand.</P>
    <P>I should like to touch now on the incidence of accidents on building jobs.  There are certain regulations which ought to be observed on building sites and in the building industry generally.  Unfortunately these are not observed.  Deputy Larkin mentioned the fact that, where safety regulations are made and safety precautions taken, workers will not always comply with what is recommended or provided for their own safety.  That is perfectly true, but there are too many instances in which safety precautions are not taken.  At a time when the building industry is going through a difficult period and competition is very keen, there is a temptation to skimp on safety precautions.  I beseech the Minister to ensure that there are more frequent inspections of building sites. My information is that not infrequently inspections take place following an indication given to management and workers that such an inspection is about to take place. Those who work in the industry will recite stories of how they were <Col N="504" /> engaged on putting up safety devices and taking safety precautions, having got a tip off that an inspector was going to visit the scene.  When this was mentioned here before, the Minister threw up his hands in holy horror that such a thing could happen, but such things have been known to happen. It is, of course, quite wrong.  It is no way in which to ensure that safety precautions are taken and observed.  I would ask the Minister to ensure that these inspections are carried out without prior notification, and more frequently.</P>
    <P>What I say in relation to the building industry is probably equally true in relation to factories and workshops generally.  Inspections should be carried out more frequently and without prior indication.  It may be that informing management of proposed inspections is not done deliberately.  It may be that it is done because of some set pattern which enables inspections to be anticipated.  Steps should be taken to ensure that whatever warning has operated in the past will cease to operate in the future.</P>
    <P>I join with other Deputies in wishing the Minister well in his new Department. He is dealing with the greatest national asset this country has, the labour and sweat of its people.  He has a tremendous duty and, from his opening statement, it is obvious he appreciates that to the full.  I wish him well.</P>

      <P>The creation of a Ministry of Labour has caused much rejoicing in the ranks of the official labour movement.  This Party have been stressing the need for such a Ministry for many years.  The Department will have the responsibility of creating full employment, creating job security and achieving a rising standard of living for our people.  The Department will also be concerned with improving industrial relations, improving conditions in jobs and providing a decent standard of wages for workers. As I say, for a number of years we advocated the establishment of such a Department and it was with the utmost reluctance that the Government accepted such a proposal.  The Taoiseach, who is now making his exit from active politics, is on record as making excuses from time to time and indeed repudiating the idea of a Ministry of Labour as unnecessary and unsuitable to the requirements of this country.  It required a lot of persuasion to convince the Government that such a step was necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We welcome the establishment of this Department because we realise that a highly intelligent and adaptable labour force is a vital necessity to <Col N="506" /> our requirements as we come closer to freer trade with Britain and closer, eventually, to the Common Market. We realise the inadequacy of our educational facilities and that we have a surplus of untrained and unskilled people for whom, in these times of technical change, there will be no future in years to come.  We realise that there is an acute shortage of skilled employees and particularly skilled technologists.  Realising this and realising, for some years past, that free trade was impending, it is to be deplored that the Government did not take more positive action in regard to the training and employment of people.  In recent times we heard a lot of talk about education and the training of people in new skills and new techniques and we heard talk about the feasibility of establishing schools of technology.  The recasting of our vocational educational system was forecast but despite the number of years that have passed since free trade became the keynote of controversy in these islands there has been no tangible evidence or proof of the establishment of these schools of technology which are so vitally necessary. It is futile to talk about training schemes unless we are given the opportunity to train our people.  It is pertinent to ask what are these apprentices being trained for&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and where are the employment opportunities for them.  At present we have a standing army of nearly 50,000 unemployed and emigration figures run at from 20,000 to 30,000 this year.  In addition, we have an average of some 40,000 boys and girls coming on to the labour market every year from the schools. This means that we should be providing at least 25,000 to 30,000 jobs per year in order to make worthwhile inroads into this great labour reservoir which is available.  We are doing nothing like that at all.  Last year 4,000 new jobs in industry were created and that number is a mere fraction of the number of jobs required.  The figure was also 7,000 less than in the year before, so that in relation to the <Col N="507" /> targets set in the various economic expansion programmes we are truely falling flat in respect of these jobs and these aspirations.</P>
      <P>I do not envy the Minister the task he has before him but I do wish him well.  He had at his disposal something which is the envy of the more progressive countries of Europe.  He has a labour force comprising nearly 100,000 people each year.  This is the great human asset which he has at his disposal. There is an acute shortage of labour in the countries which I have in mind but here in Ireland this great reservoir of human talents lies wasted, dormant and unexploited.  It is an indictment of the Government that this should continue and that we should have this disregard for our own people, that we should have such little regard for their talents and show such disregard for the need to put them to work in their own land.</P>
      <P>It has always been a test of Government to ask to what extent they achieve full employment and if the Government are to be judged on the test of full employment, prosperity and security, they stand completely condemned, sadly lacking in responsibility in that respect because as long as they have been in office&mdash;nearly 30 years&mdash; they have failed miserably to solve the problem of employment, despite the many catchcries and slogans they brought to the hustings in so many general elections.  We had such slogans as: &ldquo;Wives, put your men to work&rdquo; and &ldquo;We promise 100,000 jobs&rdquo;. These slogans must surely have won many votes for the Government Party in recent elections.  The people were gullible enough to accept these slogans with some confidence in the Government to carry out the promises implied. We now know that in regard to all these promises the Fianna Fáil Government have failed miserably to meet their commitments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are so many aspects of the Ministry of Labour that one could talk for a long time on it.  I had the honour to propose a motion at the Irish Congress of Trade Unions in Belfast in 1964 to the effect that a Ministry of Labour should be established and that <Col N="508" /> this idea should be brought home to the Government in the Twenty-Six Counties.  The motion said that in view of the development towards free trade and the removal of restrictions on imported goods, Congress was of opinion that a Department of Labour should be created with a Minister responsible for dealing with the problems which would arise for labour in these conditions, such as unemployment retraining and placement of workers in new employment and adequate financial support during unemployment.</P>
    <P>That motion was adopted by Congress and we took the issue from there to this House and persisted in our endeavours to convince the Government that such a Department was vitally necessary.  We knew the ravages which impending free trade would cause among industrial workers here.  We had the reports of the Committee on Industrial Organisation, a body established by the Government for the purpose of assessing the extent to which our industries could stand up to freer competition.  These reports were alarming. They indicated that in a very large number of industries which they investigated&mdash;70 or 80&mdash; in free trade circumstances about 11,000 workers would lose their jobs and that if the adaptation measures which the committee recommended were not taken by the industries concerned, a further 23,000 would lose their jobs.</P>
    <P>These reports referred to the impending free trade with EEC countries but I think they are just as relevant in respect of free trade with Great Britain.  As the barriers of protection go down 10 per cent each year, competition with the industrial giants of Great Britain will be too much for many Irish industrialists and they will go to the wall.  Some will go quickly. We are satisfied that the industrial battle in which we have engaged is a battle between a pygmy and a giant and that industrial graveyards will result and that there will be many thousands of Irish workers lying prostrate on the battlefield.  This will be the situation and it will become progressively worse in the next nine years. In these circumstances there was a <Col N="509" /> moral obligation on the Government to take urgent steps to equip and assist industry to adapt itself to meet this economic impact.  There was a moral obligation on the Government to bring in speedily the necessary legislation to safeguard these redundant workers and to introduce schemes for retraining and apprenticeship, schemes for the re-employment of these people in alternative work.</P>
    <P>While we have had all this talk we do not, as yet, as I said earlier, see any tangible evidence that there is an improvement, for instance, in our vocational education system to accelerate the training of apprentices.  I am not aware that additional trades or skills have been added to the curriculum of the technical schools.  They are still fiddling about with carpentry, metal work, and mechanical training of one kind or another.  These are necessary skills but represent only a fraction of the skills and techniques required in this modern age.  Our technical schools are not equipped for the training required in modern industry.  The only schools of technology we know of are confined to the cities and mainly to this city, the Bolton Street School of Technology, the Rathmines School and perhaps the School of Commerce in Cork. Outside of those I do not know any means of training or providing the necessary training or advice in new industrial techniques.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that is not the Minister's Department but it is pertinent to ask when we shall see the creation of these schools of technology, some six or seven of them, which were so much talked about a few years ago.  When will we see evidence of their establishment and when will we see students taking their places in these schools?</P>
    <P>I appreciate there are many aspects of this Department.  I appreciate that the first instalment of the manpower policy, which is an integral part of the Department of Labour, has come into this House, that is, the training of apprentices.  I have made my comment on that measure, but I said at that time that, from a practical point of view, as a trade unionist, as a man who is not far removed from industry and <Col N="510" /> still very close to the problems of industrial workers, knowing full well their hopes, their fears and their anxieties, I would much prefer the introduction of a redundancy payments scheme.  We wanted a practical scheme to give relief to workers affected.</P>
    <P>Since we have been talking about this Department of Labour and while the Minister has been talking about what he proposes to do in respect of training, redundancy payments and all of these things, he must surely be aware that many hundreds, and indeed thousands, of workers have become redundant in this country, that consequent on the signing of the Free Trade Agreement with Britain last Christmas week, a number of industrialists panicked and threw in the towel, closed the doors of their enterprises with the result that in very many towns which I could mention here hundreds of workers found themselves out of a job, and there was nothing, despite all the talk, in any Act of Parliament which they could invoke to give them relief by way of redundancy payment, by way of retraining, or a hope of being reabsorbed in alternative employment, nothing but social welfare benefits which were there all the time.</P>
    <P>I may tell the Minister that the cost of living is so high today and the unemployment benefits so inadequate that no family man conscious of his responsibility to his wife and family can remain very long without getting into deep debt; no responsible family man can continue in such a state of insecurity, in such a state of social depression, and invariably such a man goes to England, because this Government provided nothing, in spite of the grandiose proposals about which they have been talking in this House.  It is time to end all this grandiose talk and give us legislation which the workers can invoke, particularly in respect of redundancy pay.</P>
    <P>How long does the Minister propose we must wait for this scheme to become a reality?  Must we wait until the nine years which have now to go have expired and free trade meets us in its full impact, or is it anticipated the <Col N="511" /> aim to which the Taoiseach still holds fast&mdash;that we shall be in the Common Market by 1970?  Is it not high time we had these redundancy proposals brought into this House and speedily implemented?  In saying that, I express the hope that the redundancy payments will be such as to ensure a sufficient amount to permit the worker to live in at least frugal comfort until he gets an alternative job and that while he is being retrained, it will be an amount comparable with the wage he had in his previous employment.  I hope also the Minister will have regard to the principle of redundancy payments applicable in other countries and that he will have regard to the number of years which the worker had in that industry, that the redundancy payments will be applied to his years of service, that there will be a week's wages, a week and a half or two weeks' wages for every year of service in his employment.</P>
    <P>My desire is to impress upon the Minister that it is now high time that the redundancy proposals were implemented. Too many people have lost their jobs as a result of the inability of their employers to compete in these modern times, in these times of rigorous competition, which will grow progressively more severe.  It is not good enough to talk about these things and to ignore the fact that in my constituency and in the constituency of every Deputy here, factories are closing down.  Indeed, it is said that for every factory that has been established in recent months, some two or three have closed down.  The Minister can refute that statement when he is replying, if he can, but these people who have lost their jobs have been thrown ignominiously on the unemployment scrap-heap and have been given no State help to rehabilitate themselves in any form, other than the unemployment benefit payments which are payable under the social welfare code.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the Minister will now be concerned, as indeed he is, with industrial relations.  We have observed the Minister's speeches in recent months since he took over his new <Col N="512" /> office and we share his concern for an improvement in industrial relations. We do not want to see our country or our society branded as strike-ridden, and that is the kind of picture which has been created recently by reason of industrial unrest and the number of strikes with which we have had to contend in recent months.  This would be a bad thing from the point of view of attracting industrialists to our land and the establishment of new industries. However, the Minister should be very slow to take upon himself authoritarian powers for dealing with this matter of industrial unrest.</P>
    <P>The increase in the number of strikes we have had in recent times is due to many factors.  I believe the last round of wage increases would have passed off very quietly without any great unrest or industrial strife, were it not for the stupid attitude of the Government and, particularly, the Taoiseach, when he declared that a three per cent wage increase was all that the country could afford.  At a time when the cost of living had gone up by almost eight per cent, this was a most irresponsible attitude for the Leader of a Government to adopt.  He placed the trade union movement in an impossible position in negotiating a reasonable increase in wages with employers, individually or collectively.  It was a different situation from the previous round of wage increases which occurred at a time of by-elections, when the very same Taoiseach virtually recommended an increase of a percentage which was acceptable to both sides.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach precipitated industrial strife by the <Col N="513" /> ridiculous attitude he adopted of recommending a three per cent increase. Naturally, the Federation of Employers felt they had a great ally in the Taoiseach and treated the Irish Congress of Trade Unions with contempt and felt they had the full rigours of the law and the Government behind them in doing so.  This is what precipitated the head-on clash between the workers and employers.  People seem to forget that.  It took many months for the strife to resolve itself. The struggle was merely one to maintain decent standards, to compensate for the increase in the cost of living, nothing more and nothing less.</P>
      <P>Government spokesmen tried to infer that there was something sinister in this whole action.  Of course, nothing could be farther from the truth. They were merely Irish men and women agitating within their trade union organisations for a reasonable increase in wages to compensate for the cost of living increases which the Government had brought about.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the Minister's proposals in respect of trade union law. I am also aware that what the Minister seeks to do is to determine not only when a new union would be permitted to come into being but also whether an existing union would be permitted to continue.  This is power which the Trade Union Congress would not accept.  The Minister would do well to realise that this idea he has of taking power to decide what unions will come into being and what unions will continue in existence is something which is absolutely opposed by the united Congress of Trade Unions.</P>
      <P>The right to freedom of association is contained in our Constitution.  No group or society should lightly surrender that right.  Apart altogether from the trade union movement, it seems to us to be contrary to the spirit and intention of those clauses in our Constitution guaranteeing freedom of association that we should ever allow any Minister or any Government to determine what kind of organisation shall come into being or whether an organisation shall be permitted to continue in existence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="514" /> I would ask the Minister to be very slow to try to impose this kind of measure on any section of our people and to discuss the matter further with Congress and its affiliated constituents to see if a more amicable settlement can be arrived at.  The powers which the Minister is taking unto himself in this proposed legislation are wholly unacceptable to labour and to the trade union movement.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Minister is unhappy in respect of the present setup of the Labour Court and that he has in mind proposals in respect of that body.  We are of the opinion that the Labour Court has done a good job of work, that it has been an effective instrument in resolving strife between employer and employee.  The most recent annual report of the Labour Court, that is, for 1964, shows that out of 405 disputes dealt with by the Court, only 29 were not settled and in only six of these 29 cases stoppages of work occurred or continued.  The previous reports of the Labour Court showed a similar picture.</P>
    <P>The trade union movement considers that the Court's record of useful work shows that its existing basis and constitution are fundamentally sound and should not be altered radically.  It would be a great tragedy if the Minister were to change this court of arbitration into something in the nature of a court of law, a court of compulsion. It is recognised as a court of conciliation and of arbitration if necessary. I admonish the Minister to keep the law out of it, much as the lawyers behind him might want to encroach upon it.  The trade union movement will have nothing to do with the lawyers attached to this court.  If ever they become attached to it, they will be shunned by the trade union movement.</P>
    <P>If we are to have a court of arbitration and conciliation, let us ensure that that court is availed of when disputes arise.  Let the Minister not be so foolish as to create some kind of court which will be shunned and not availed of by the unions.  I assure the Minister that there is a real risk of this.  I ask him to <Col N="515" /> be very slow in altering radically the present constitution of the Labour Court without having regard to the views of the unions attached to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  I ask him to be at one with them in the kind of body which will seek to resolve the various disputes that occur from time to time.</P>
    <P>The Minister has some worthwhile ideas in respect of future legislation which can bring about better relations between employer and employee and do much to eliminate industrial friction. We all realise the desirability of a change in the organisational structure of unions.  We appreciate that there are, perhaps, too many unions and that an amalgamation or a federation of some of these unions is a desirable thing.  It would make for efficiency within the trade union movement itself and would, I believe, make for better servicing of the members of these unions.  But I would much prefer that this fusion, which is bound to take place in the future, would come about as a result of the initiative of Congress rather than that it would be imposed upon them by Governmental strictures of any kind.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that some of the Minister's proposals will help towards the elimination of the multiplicity of unions with which we have to contend. I understand that he has it in mind to come to the aid of union officers who may be affected by amalgamation and that their superannuation and pension rights will be safeguarded.  This is a desirable thing and the Minister is to be complimented on it.</P>
    <P>I realise that the Minister's aim will be to attain a very high level of technical training for all the people who can be put to productive work in this country.  We wish him well in that regard.  But the Minister would want to consult with his colleagues in the Cabinet to bring about an acceleration of productivity in this country and to provide more industry.  We have a degree of stagnation in our economy at present.  We have a very high unemployment rate, to which I have already adverted.  We have had an economic <Col N="516" /> crisis on our hands for months past. We have had to contend with an acute shortage of capital, which is&mdash;let there be no mistake about it&mdash;affecting jobs. There is an air of insecurity over the Government, the country and the future.</P>
    <P>Those are the circumstances in which the Department of Labour is trying to operate.  I have heard it said that a Department of Labour can only work successfully in an economy of full employment. Therefore, this Minister has many disadvantages to contend with. In all he attempts to improve this position, we wish him well.  We wish him well in the creation of an efficient labour market, where there will be adequate forecasting and a clear indication of the supply and demand for labour.  He will have regard to the very excellent NIEC reports and the other reports available which pinpoint the way ahead for him.</P>
    <P>These are some of the sentiments I wished to express on this Estimate.  I should like to emphasise that the most important part of the Minister's task will be to assist unemployed, underemployed and redundant workers.  As far as the new legislation assists towards that end, we welcome it.  I feel we have talked too much about this matter in this House.  I now look forward to the practical implementation of these proposals, which will redound to the benefit of these workers about whom I am concerned.  Later on we shall, I trust, get the details of how the redundancy pay scheme, for instance, will operate.  As yet, we have not had positive proposals for such a scheme.  I should be glad if the Minister would indicate in his reply when he hopes to circulate the details of such a scheme and when we are likely to get down to discussing it and implementing it without further delay.</P>

Every time that they get themselves, and incidentally the rest of us, up to our necks in a bog, <Col N="517" /> a raft is thrown out and a new gimmick is started The Minister is the latest gimmick to distract the minds of the people from the fact that if we have a rising tide of unemployment, if we have an economic crisis, if we have shipped 300,000 of our people to Great Britain in the past seven years, it is the gentleman over there who is responsible for it.</P>
      <P>He is now cast in the role of a knight in shining armour, a Sir Galahad to rescue us all.  But it is the same old firm, the same man but in different clothes.

    <P>When I heard Deputy Treacy say that the whole Labour Party is given over to rejoicing at the establishment of a Ministry of Labour, I should like to remind him that if he imagines the establishment of a Ministry of Labour by a Fianna Fáil Government means the realisation of Paradise on earth for the workers of this country he is sharing an illusion I used to have that the Department of Agriculture would create tolerable conditions for the farmers of this country but they have been sitting for three weeks outside the Department of Agriculture to protest that they are on the verge of starvation.  They would be sitting there still only Deputy Jack Lynch said, in <Col N="519" /> effect: &ldquo;Not bloody likely.  You are not going to make me Taoiseach and hand me that plate to start my dinner with.  You will get them off the steps before you start to unload on to me the responsibility of government.&rdquo; More power to Deputy Jack Lynch for sticking out his chest and saying so.

However, under a Fianna Fáil Minister, it became an irresponsible instrument for the persecution and betrayal of the farmers. I hope the Minister for Labour will not emulate that example.</P>
      <P>I remember speaking, as leader of the Fine Gael Party, at a meeting in Ballina during the general election. I was expounding the doctrine of a prices and incomes policy.  Someone said to me: &ldquo;What do you do if you cannot persuade them to act reasonably?&rdquo; He was expecting and hoping that I would reply: &ldquo;I will make them&rdquo;, but I did not.  I replied: &ldquo;I should have failed.  That is all. No one can do more than his best.&rdquo; In a free country, the quintessence of freedom is for any man to destroy himself economically if he wants to do so.  If you cannot get men to collaborate for their mutual protection, you cannot make them.  It is all nonsense for the Deputies of the Labour Party to be shivering in their boots for fear this or any other Government would bring in compulsory arbitration.</P>

Compulsory arbitration has been the law in Australia for the past 25 years and it was brought in by a Labour Government and it never worked and it never will.</P>
      <P>There is no use in compulsorily arbitrating a labour dispute if the men thereto individually say: &ldquo;We will not work.  We do not claim to be functioning as a unit but, on the terms laid down in this legislation, as individuals, we will not work.  Goodbye.&rdquo;  Unless you want to introduce the system of Joseph Stalin or Adolf Hitler, you cannot put them into concentration camps because they elect not to work. It is true that you can impose heavy penalties on employers and people who have property you can attack, but the man selling his labour and nothing else you cannot coerce unless you are prepared to alter the whole basis of the society in which we live which I certainly do not want to do and which I hope and believe the Minister for Labour does not wish to do either. Therefore, all this cuffuffle on the part of the Labour Party about their apprehension that there will be compulsory arbitration is all my eye and Betty Martin.  You can pass Acts of Parliament here until the cows come home but you cannot make a man work if he does not want to work, unless you substitute a slave society for our free society.  Sometimes when I hear Deputies talking that way I begin to despair.  I hope the new Minister for Labour on behalf of the Government will be able to do the job that really needs to be done most urgently&mdash;not only to employ but to educate trade union officials such as Deputy Tully who are living in the 20th century and not the 19th.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>And we would pass it again and again rather than let people die for the want of an iron lung.  The only way you can do it if you have certain kinds of privileged employment is to take from that kind of employment the right to withdraw their labour and murder your fellowmen by withdrawing their labour when their lives depend on maintaining the essential public service such as power and light.</P>
      <P>Do not try to draw me.  I shall talk about it any time the necessity arises but please God, nobody will ever show a sense of irresponsibility in this country that will ever make the enactment of that kind of legislation necessary again.  It is the function of the Minister for Labour to try to teach not only employers but trade unionists as well.  If we are to survive in freedom, these two elements have to work together and the Government cannot make them do it.  The operative words are not &ldquo;to survive&rdquo; but &ldquo;in freedom&rdquo;. Mind you, sometimes when I listen particularly to younger fellows in this House.  I often wonder if the word &ldquo;freedom&rdquo; means as much to them as it meant to me all the time. I fully appreciate that at 64 one has lived in a different tradition.</P>
      <P>All my life was spent from the time I left the pram listening to my seniors yearning for the right to live free in their own country.  That was the dominant pre-occupation in their lives and for that alone they were prepared to make any sacrifice and, as we know, not only did they sacrifice their personal fortunes but their lives as well.  What they were struggling for was to be free, not to be an inferior race in our own country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sometimes when I hear some of the modern up-to-date young Ministers of the Fianna Fáil Party, I begin to wonder if their passion for freedom is as strong as that which I was reared to have.  When I hear them talking about a variety of changes that should be made, it occurs to me it is not for re-entry to the British Commonwealth <Col N="522" /> of Nations which we left when we declared the Republic, it is not entry into the Common Market, it is not really the benefit of the Common Market they yearn for. What they are really yearning for is a re-enactment of the Act of Union. They want to get back into the comfortable womb of industrial Great Britain. They cannot bear the burdens of freedom.</P>
    <P>Let us face this fact&mdash;and it is time some of the Deputies opened their eyes&mdash;if you want the standard of living that obtains in Germany, Great Britain or the United States of America, you must become a province of one of these countries.  You cannot have it in an independent republic. Let us face that.  Unless and until that is faced we are all talking ballyhoo.</P>
    <P>I want to say to those sitting on my right, opposite me and beyond them, that if you are misleading the people who voted for you into the belief that the establishment of a Ministry of Labour or anything else we can do will ensure for our people a standard of living equal to that of Great Britain, Germany or the United States without surrendering our political liberty, you are practising a deceit and most of you have the wits to know that.  The price of freedom in this country is to face the fact that to breathe free we cannot have the riches of a great industrial nation. We took that decision the day we determined to revoke Lord Castlerea's Union.  There is no use pretending anything else.</P>
    <P>That is one of the lessons we expect the Minister for Labour to teach every employer and trade unionist in this country.  That is the real price of living free and I think he has got to ask whether we are prepared to pay that price.  Do you intend to pay it yourselves, your children and your children's children?  That is the fundamental decision that will have to be taken before we can approach the problem of stable rational labour relations and an expanding capacity to employ men and women in our own country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="523" /> The second task which occurs to me that the Minister has to tackle in dealing with employers and trade unions is to draw their attention to the fact that it is irrelevant to carry on a class struggle that does not exist.  There was a class struggle in the United Kingdom to which we belonged 130 years, 120 years, 100 years, 80 years, 60 years ago and we fought a great battle in the British House of Commons on the side of labour to defend their interests in that class struggle.  As Irish MPs in the British House of Commons, we fought bitterly for the Trade Disputes Act which gave labour the rights they enjoy today.</P>
    <P>It was the Irish Party that welcomed Keir Hardie into the British House of Commons when there was nobody else to speak.  It was the Irish members with whom he associated and amongst whom he found his feet in the House of Commons.  It was around him the Labour Party grew up.  It was the votes of the Irish Party that sustained the Liberal Party of 1906-1910 which passed the Trades Disputes Acts and the other reforms which helped to give labour the rights it now enjoys in Great Britain and, incidentally, in the United States, because the United States copied what had been begun in the British House of Commons.  But since this State was founded, there is no class war.  There is not a single one of us that does not come from the same kind of people.  Trace back to our grandfathers and great grandfathers and we are all the same kind of people who did the same kind of work within the last century.  It is all nonsense to be trying to create artificial class distinctions between fellows who bought Mercedes Benz within the past ten years but whose mothers and grandmothers were scrubbing floors 40 or 50 years ago.  Mind you, I have more respect for the mothers and grandmothers who were scrubbing the floors than for some of the gents that are sailing round in the Mercedes Benz and the Bentleys now.  But it is all nonsense to be describing them as a class.  They may be a conspiracy but they are not a class.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Ah, well, a lot of people have queer ideas of what they are, I suppose.  Lots of people have illusions. It is bad enough for people to have illusions about themselves but when they begin to sell their illusions to their neighbours, that really frightens me.</P>
      <P>There is no class in this country and if we are to get rational, reasonable labour relations, it is the duty of trade union officials to make it known to their members that there is not such a thing as class and those who are swaggering about pretending that there is are deceiving not only themselves but anybody else who believes them.</P>
      <P>That was not true in the Great Britain to which we belonged 100 years ago.  Then there was a class.  There was a traditional aristocracy in England typified by the Duke of Devonshire who said: &ldquo;He is not a gentleman; he works.&rdquo;  That was the criterion of excellence.  There was a powerful landed aristocracy who believed that anybody who worked was not a gentleman and, therefore, belonged to another class.  Therefore there was a perpetual war eternally ranging between the landed aristocracy of England who had certain rights and positions and privileges and the proletariat whom they saw as beating at their gates.  They yielded step after step and they felt they were losing something that was precious to them.  They were perfectly right.  They were losing the oligarchy of England.</P>
      <P>It would be very useful if some of the Deputies would spend some of their leisure hours reading a little modern history.  I can recommend a book. Labour Deputies could read with great profit the recent biography of Disraeli by a man called Blake.  I waded through the whole six volumes of Moneypenny and Buckle.  Blake has now written a volume of 700 pages and it covers the story of England's public life from 1830 to 1881.  It gives a true picture of what class was and the struggle involved to combat it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To compare that situation with our poor lads who are prancing around here with their new-found riches and <Col N="525" /> do not know what to spend it on does not make sense.  They must spend it on the Mercedes Benz and the Bentley because they cannot put it in mink and new hats because the wife cannot carry any more.  They have to get some kind of evidence to announce to the whole world that they are in the dough. But to describe them as a class is just laughable.</P>
    <P>You might say that there was a class of illiterate aristocracy in rural Ireland but it is fast disappearing.  I knew, when I was a child in rural Ireland, a considerable body of people who never learned to read or write and they were the aristocracy.  I have visited people in their houses who could teach a duchess how to receive a guest and they were not rich.  They were very poor but they had all the dignity of a proud people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be prepared to argue with Labour deputies that these people represent a class which I respect and the passing of which I deplore.  To go further into that would be, perhaps, to widen unduly the scope of our debate.</P>
      <P>My purpose now is to establish that this is a classless society.  I attribute no virtue to anybody for that fact. It is just a fact of life and until it is recognised by the trade union movement in this country, they will spend half their invaluable time and talents challenging a dragon that does not exist.  We cannot do the job of establishing decent labour relations in this country unless the trade unions carry at least 50 per cent of the burden. They cannot do that if they do not know what the burden is, if they are staggering about with a hod over their shoulder moaning that they have 100 bricks to carry in the class war when everybody but themselves knows that the bricks are made of gutta percha.  They are wasting their time and energy struggling with a nonexistent problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But there is a problem, that is, the problem of convincing not only employers but the trade unions' members that in a free society free men have the right to starve themselves if they <Col N="526" /> choose to exercise it and one of the ways to starve themselves is to destroy the industry in which they work. It is wholly illusory and daft to be advancing the thesis that workers are exploited by employers.  Maybe the employers want to exploit their employees. Maybe they do.  A great many of them do not.  But what employer in this country disposes of the power that any trade union disposes of?  What is the good of talking to me about the employer trying to exploit the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union when the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union is one of the most wealthy and powerful organisations in this country?  There is not a single employer who could conceivably give it battle, never mind exploit its members.</P>
    <P>If trade union representatives in this House say that their members are being exploited, there can be only one explanation, that is, that the trade unions are not doing their job and if they are not, then it is their own conscience they ought to examine.  I now assert there is no employer in this country powerful enough to exploit a member of any trade union.  I wish to God the trades union&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give the Deputy a couple of wrinkles between now and tomorrow morning as to how he may get some information and it will not be Anno Domini will provide them.  I said that before and I was reported as saying &ldquo;Anne Donnelly&rdquo; provided them.  Fortunately, I noted it in the Official Report but, if I had not, it would have ruined me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the most depressing features of the Minister's appointment is the announcement that the Labour exchanges are to remain under the control of the Minister for Social Welfare. Listen, if we are to put over the concept of a Ministry of Labour to serve the cause of industrial peace in this country, we have got to convince two parties, the employers and the workers, that this Ministry is really concerned to serve them.  Is there anybody in this country who regards the labour exchange today as the place to go and look for a job?  The labour exchange in this country is a place to go and collect the dole.  Does any employer consider the labour exchange a suitable place to go and look for workers to fill the vacancies he may have?  Does any rational man spend an hour longer or a minute longer in a labour exchange <Col N="528" /> than it takes to collect the dole if he can get out of it?  A drearier, mouldier, more ineffective institution than the labour exchange in this country could not be contemplated.  It may work all right for the purpose of distributing the dole; I do not deny that. I have no doubt that the officers of the labour exchange discharge the limited discretion they have as well as any other public servant but the whole concept of the labour exchange under a Minister for Labour ought to be changed to that of a place to which a man looking for a job can go and that he will either find a job or he will be told what training is available and be put in contact with the training establishment, if he is prepared to go to it. Thirdly, if you can do neither of those things, act as his agent to extract from the social services every conceivable right he has to tide him over the period during which he may be temporarily unemployed.  Is that image being presented to the average working man of this country?  I do not think it is; I know it is not.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Mr. Hillery Mr. Hillery">

      <P>Why not do it tomorrow? We know it will not work tomorrow but when I started the Land Project every prudent adviser I had said to me: &ldquo;Minister, it will take one year to 18 months to prepare this scheme.&rdquo;  I said to them: &ldquo;I want you to be digging drains this day fortnight.&rdquo;  I said further: &ldquo;I am going to get the greatest possible authority to dig drains and, if there are any ructions about it, I will face the ructions&rdquo;.  They said: &ldquo;we will have to prepare forms&rdquo;.  I said: &ldquo;Prepare no forms.  Here is a letter: I want my land drained; signed Pat Williams, Glenamaddy&rdquo;, and there was an officer down with him within 24 hours laying out the plans and within a week we were on the land digging. We made mistakes.  The late Tom Walsh once ended up on a mountain trying to drain a man's land that everybody <Col N="529" /> knew was solid rock 18 inches below the soil and poor Deputy Tom Walsh was on the farm of one of the most prominent supporters of the Fine Gael Party in that part of the world. Of course we made mistakes, but we got the work done and what was much more important we convinced the farmers that the Minister for Agriculture meant business and when he said at Mullingar: &ldquo;We are going to spend £40 million draining the land of Ireland&rdquo;, he meant it; not like the Minister for Education threatening he would resign before the 31st December if his plans for free education are not implemented.</P>

      <P>I am explaining to the Minister for Labour how he ought to go about dealing with the conversion of the labour exchanges from what <Col N="530" /> they now are into what he claims it is his intention to make them.  He tells me it will be done as soon as possible. I am telling him it could be done in a fortnight and ought to be done within the limit of three weeks.  If the Minister means to do it, the important thing is to carry conviction to the average working man in this country that he has a friend at the labour exchange to get him a job and what is even more important, that the labour exchanges will carry that conviction to the minds of employers.</P>
      <P>I try to believe we can live in our own country; that is what I want to do.  I am quite disillusioned about Fianna Fáil, have no doubt about that. I still believe in Irish nationalism.  I know that is an old-fashioned profession of faith but I do.  Therefore, I want to convey the impression not only to the working man who is looking for a job that he will be helped to find it in the labour exchange but &mdash;what is much more important at the moment&mdash;to carry conviction to the minds of employers that if they want men, a good place to get them is from the manager of the labour exchange and if the employer applies to him, he will not be sent all the duds that the labour exchange manager wants to get off the dole, but that the labour exchange manager will send out men who want work, men he believes are able to do the work and send them to the employer in the confident hope that having experienced his services once, he will come back again.</P>
