      <P>I am informed by CIE that the Board has made every effort to interest Irish manufacturers in the printing of bus scrolls.  Due to absence of quotations from Irish firms, it has been necessary to have scrolls printed in Britain.  Recently, the Board succeeded in obtaining a quotation from one out of six Irish firms approached after consultation with the Irish Printing Federation but unfortunately, <Col N="1383" /> that firm's quotation was too high by a substantial margin.</P>

      <P>An application was received in my Department in November, 1965, from Ballina Urban District Council for a licence under the Foreshore Act, 1933, in connection with a proposal to erect a public convenience near Ham Bridge, Ballina.</P>
      <P>Following initial consultation with interested parties, the proposal was advertised by the council in April, 1966, and an objection was received.  Certain amenity aspects of this proposal have also had to be considered in consultation with the Department of Local Government and other interests.  When this consultation is completed, I shall be in a position to convey a decision to the council in relation to the position under the Foreshore Act, 1933.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power if arrangements have yet been made for the provision of water and sewerage facilities for the staff in the meteorological <Col N="1384" /> office, Mullingar, as promised in a reply of two years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The circumstances in which a new building for the Mullingar Meteorological Station was to be provided were set out in the reply to the Deputy's previous question on 5th November, 1964.  Plans for a new building to replace the existing one, and including a water supply and sanitary facilities, were drawn up by the Office of Public Works in March, 1965.</P>
      <P>The plans and specification for the building were not wholly acceptable from the meteorological point of view as the siting of the building would mean that adequate space would not be left available for the proper operation of the outdoor instrument enclosure.</P>
      <P>In addition doubts subsequently arose as to the suitability of the site generally from the technical point of view.  A full investigation of the problems involved may take some further considerable time.</P>
      <P>Normally only one officer is on duty at any one time at this station.  A chemical toilet and facilities for washing are provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister will agree that, having had an application before the Department for a long number of years and having given a decision in this House two years ago that the facilities were to be provided, it is a bit ludicrous to state now that an entirely new building is to be provided and that, because of the change in plans, it will be some time before the matter can be proceeded with?  Does the Minister not agree that, in addition to the one person he says is in the building at any particular time, there are four or five temporary people who spend quite a lot of time in the building, and that there are also two houses beside the building?  Would he not give a more satisfactory reply than he has given?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid it is quite impossible.  The new estimates of the meteorological requirements make it doubtful whether the buildings should be placed there at all.  In the <Col N="1385" /> meantime, an investigation is proceeding.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Lalor)</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the small amount of business transacted, the re-opening of the sub-post office in question would not, I regret, be warranted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware of the large number of old age pensioners using this sub-post office and the fact that many of them have not got relatives or others to collect their pensions for them at a far away post office?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary not consider having consultations with the Minister for Social Welfare with a view to arranging that in cases where old age pensioners are more than three miles from a post office, they could nominate a shop, similar to the way they can now nominate a post office, at which they can collect their pensions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to the supplementary by Deputy Pattison, I am aware there are a number of old age pensioners who can be inconvenienced in this regard.  I am not aware of the absence or presence of relatives.  However, there is a satisfactory arrangement whereby it is not obligatory on pensioners to collect their pensions personally from any of the adjacent suboffices. I find it hard to believe that pensioners could not get somebody to collect the pensions on their behalf.</P>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Nolan, the question he raised is a rather big one.  It would necessitate quite an amount of discussion, I am sure, between the Department of Social Welfare and the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. However, it is something that could be looked into.  I would not be inclined to think it is easy of solution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>Seeing that the Parliamentary Secretary, from the tone of his reply, is not going to change his decision in this matter, will he make arrangements to provide an appropriate telephone kiosk as an alternative?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a different question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>They are closing one telephone, if the sub-post office closes. The people should get that service, at least.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The amount of business done with the telephone in the public office which closed recently would certainly appear to make uneconomic the provision of a public kiosk.  However, it is something that is having attention at the moment, although the indications are that it would not be justified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a question of economics but of necessity.  There are quite a number of poor people in the area and they may require to use a telephone if one of them gets sick or is seriously ill, for example.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Governey</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that the Parliamentary Secretary is new to this Department but is he aware that some old age pensioners who have not relations to collect their pensions for them have to travel long distances to collect their pensions?  In some cases, it is actually over seven miles.  In the light of another supplementary question, I think, by Deputy Pattison, about a telephone kiosk, surely it should be <Col N="1387" /> erected for the convenience of the people in the area?  As far as I can see, no matter where you ask for a telephone kiosk in a rural area at the moment, the answer you get is that it is uneconomic.  Surely there is more than the economic factor to be considered? If a person wants a priest, a doctor or a veterinary surgeon, for example, surely there should be a public telephone within a reasonable distance?</P>

      <P>Approval to proceeding with the scheme for construction of a bridge to connect Valentia Island with the mainland was conveyed to Kerry County Council by letter dated 14th January, 1959, during the term of office of my predecessor.</P>
      <P>The question of appointing contractors to undertake the work is at present under consideration by the council in the light of a letter issued by my Department on 9th September last.  I understand that the council are in correspondence with the contractors who submitted the lowest tender for the project with a view to establishing whether mutually acceptable negotiations can be concluded to enable the project to get under way.</P>

      <P>Deputy Larkin is not ignorant of the terms of the circular, <Col N="1405" /> though he may portray here that he is totally so.  He should surely realise that a suggestion that rents should be looked at and rationalised is not paraphrased properly as he paraphrased it when he says it is an order to increase rents.  In fact, in this circular of which I have not got a copy at the moment, I remember distinctly there was an exhortation and, in fact, practically a direction that rents must be brought down in order to house those who cannot pay.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that, following the recent review of rents of houses let on fixed rents by Clonmel Corporation, 462 tenants have had their rents increased, 149 have had their rents reduced, and the rents of 16 tenants are unchanged.  I have not got detailed information as to the amounts of the increases or reductions in rent in individual cases, but the <Col N="1407" /> maximum proportion of income taken in rent under the scheme will not in any case exceed a fraction of about one-seventh.  The increase in the corporation's rental income as a result of the review is estimated by the corporation at £3,000.  The corporation incurred a loss of £11,000 on their housing account in 1965-66, after taking credit for the State subsidy.</P>

      <P>Joint Industrial Councils are voluntary associations of workers and employers. The Deputy is, no doubt, familiar with Part V of the Industrial Relations Act, 1946, which sets out the conditions under which a council becomes qualified for registration in the Labour Court, if it wishes to be registered. Apart from that, the scope and activities of these councils are matters for themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I am not clear as to what the Deputy has in mind in referring to the scope and effectiveness of these councils, I can say that these councils can perform most useful functions and <Col N="1415" /> I will be happy to consider any ways in which I can encourage the parties forming councils to make better use of them in promoting harmonious relations between employers and workers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if there has been any legal action consequent on the breaking of registered agreements over the past five years; and if he will give the incidence of such agreements being broken over the same period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>Under section 32 of the Industrial Relations Act, 1946, complaints of breaches of registered agreements fall to be dealt with by the Labour Court and the function of the Minister is limited to the prosecution of employers or trade unions who fail to comply with orders made by the Labour Court under that section.  No case has arisen in the past five years in which either employers or unions failed to comply with such orders.  The question of legal proceedings did not therefore arise.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Labour Court that the position is as follows:&mdash; 18 complaints alleging non-compliance with the terms of registered agreements were received by the Court under section 32 of the Act in the period November, 1961, to date.  In 16 cases the matters in dispute were adjusted voluntarily following intervention by the Court and the complaints were withdrawn.  In the case of one complaint the Court held a public hearing and, having found the complaint to be well founded, made an order directing compliance with the terms of the agreement. The direction was carried out and the question of legal action did not therefore arise.  In the remaining case the Court, having formally heard the complaint, found it to be not well-founded.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my reply to a question from him on 24th May, 1966, in which I stated that, before taking a decision on the possibility of ratifying International Labour Organisation Convention No. 100 relating to equal remuneration for men and women workers for work of equal value, the Government should have regard to the trend in free collective bargaining in the direction of equal pay.  Having regard to the general existing pay structures it would not be appropriate to ratify the Convention at this stage.</P>

In this connection I would refer the Deputy to the opening paragraphs of Part V of the published Report of the Commission on &ldquo;Driving <Col N="1424" /> while Under the Influence of Drink or a Drug&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The annual reports of the Commissioner, Garda Síochána on crime, indicate the number of persons charged with driving or attempting to drive while drunk.  Because of changes in the law effected by the Road Traffic Act, 1961, and in the format of the reports themselves, it is not possible to be certain that the figures for earlier years are entirely comparable with those for recent years.  The figures given in the reports in respect of mechanically propelled vehicles are in the form of a statement which, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, will be circulated with the Official Report.</P>
    <P>In this connection, I think it relevant to point out that the number of mechanically propelled vehicles on the roads increased from approximately 227,000 in 1955 to approximately 447,000 in 1965.</P>
    <P>Following is the statement:</P>

      <P>Born in Dublin in 1882, the story of his life is part of the history of the political, cultural and economic development of this country since the beginning of the century.</P>
      <P>He first worked as an assistant in the National Library and later turned to journalism.  He joined the IRB about 1900.  He joined Connradh na Gaeilge around the same time, became Manager of An Claíomh Solais in 1903, was a member of the Coisde Gnótha from 1909 to 1925 and General Secretary from 1916 to 1921.  He was one of the founders, in 1905, of Sinn Féin and, in 1913, of the Irish Volunteers. In Easter Week, 1916, he served as a Staff Captain in the General Post Office.</P>
      <P>He became a member of Dublin Corporation in 1906 and was regularly re-elected to the Corporation up to his resignation in 1932, on his assuming Ministerial Office.  His native Dublin was one of the many Irish cities and towns of which he was subsequently made a freeman.</P>
      <P>He was elected a Member of Parliament in 1918 and, from then on, was elected at each succeeding General Election up to 1945.  He answered the roll-call of the first Dáil Éireann on the 21st January, 1919, and, on the following day, he was elected the first Ceann Comhairle of Dáil Éireann.  After the General Election of 1921, he was again proposed as Ceann Comhairle but withdrew his name because of the demands of his post as Representative of Ireland in Paris.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From 1932 to 1945, he was a Minister of State: Minister for Local Government and Public Health for over seven years and Minister for Finance for nearly six years.  He was Vice-President of the Executive Council from 1932 until, upon the coming into operation of the present Constitution, he became, on the 29th December, <Col N="1433" /> 1937, the first Tánaiste, a post he held until his election as President on the 14th June, 1945.</P>
    <P>He was the second President of Ireland and the first to be elected President by a vote of the people of Ireland.  He served as President from 1945 to 1959 and, as a former President, he was, up to the time of his death, a member of the Council of State.</P>
    <P>Mr. Ó Ceallaigh received, as President, the highest honours that could be bestowed by the Heads of State of France, Spain, the Federal Republic of Germany, Italy and the Netherlands, and he had the signal honour of being the first person to receive the Gold Collar of the Pian Order, one of the three Papal Orders held by him.  Both our Universities, and that of Ottawa, conferred upon him the honorary Degree of Doctor of Laws.</P>
    <P>His warmth and amiability were the personal qualities of Mr. Ó Ceallaigh which struck one most and which endeared him to countless thousands of friends.  It is evident that these qualities of his hid great strength of purpose. He had great love of his country and of its culture&mdash;and, in particular, of its language.</P>
    <P>An chéad óráid a thug Seán T. Ó Ceallaigh uaidh i nDáil Éireann is as Gaeilge a thug sé í&mdash;ag an chéad tionól ar an aonú lá is fiche d'Eanáir, Naoidéag-Naoidéag.  Ó aois go bás do chothaigh sé a dhúthracht agus a ghrá don Ghaeilge agus do bhain sé feidhm aisti an méid ab fhéidir leis: is amhlaidh gur i nGaeilge a scríobh sé a dhírbheathaisnéis roinnt bhlianta ó shin.  Ar a shon san, ní misde dhom m'fhocail scoir ina thaobh a rá sa teanga chéanna.  Iarraim ortsa, a Cheann Comhairle, comhbhrón an Tí seo a chur in iúl do Bhean Uí Cheallaigh, agus molaim go n-éireódh ina seasamh anois na Teachtaí atá i láthair lenár meas mór ar Sheán T. Ó Ceallaigh a léiriú.</P>

      <P>Ar mo shon féin agus ar son Dream An Lucht Oibre, ba mhaith liom ár gcómhbhrón a chur chuig Bean Uasal Uí Cheallaigh.  The late Seán T. O'Kelly gave a lifetime <Col N="1434" /> of service to this country.  He contributed to the fight for Irish freedom and was one of our last remaining links with the Republican movement of the 19th century as a member both of the IRB and the Gaelic League.  He will be remembered in history for his representation of the Irish Republic in other countries, notably in France, when this nation was struggling for international recognition.  He will be remembered for his co-authorship, with the Labour Party Leader, Tom Johnston, of the original Democratic Programme, the foundation of the economic and social ideals of a free Ireland.</P>
      <P>Seán T. O'Kelly served as Tánaiste and in various Ministries.  Perhaps his most notable work in this field was his great effort in the early 30s as Minister for Local Government in the provision of much-needed local authority housing.  He left his mark as a parliamentarian on account of the amiability and friendliness which he displayed to members of all Parties. He was President of Ireland for 14 years and was regarded with respect and affection by all sections of the community.  Our sincerest sympathies go to his widow in her great loss.

      <P>From my earliest years, I have distinct recollections of my father recounting incidents when he and the late Seán T. O'Kelly and the late Alderman Tom Kelly were the three original Sinn Féin members of Dublin Corporation.  As well as attending meetings of the corporation, they worked together in Sinn Féin and the Gaelic League.  I first met him when he was a Minister during my early years as a Deputy.  He and I had a good deal to do during the debates on the legislation which set up the Racing Board.  Later, as Minister for External Affairs, I met him frequently when newly-accredited diplomatic representatives presented their credentials to him as President.  On those occasions and at all times he was most courteous and affable.  These qualities enabled him successfully to meet people from different walks of life and to understand their viewpoints.  His wide reading <Col N="1435" /> and long association with the national movement made him an excellent raconteur.  My colleagues join me in extending our deepest sympathy to his widow.

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann hereby approves of:</P>
      <P>Control of Imports (Quota No. 53) (Miscellaneous Brushes) Order, 1966.</P>
      <P>An explanatory memorandum has been circulated to Deputies giving particulars of the quota orders the approval of which I am moving.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Free Trade Area Agreement between this country and the United Kingdom provides for the retention of quantitative restrictions on the importation of brushes, brooms and mops up to 30th June, 1975.  The quota order which was in force up to 30th June, 1966, imposed restrictions on all such articles, without limit as to value, and licences were granted to importers on the basis of their purchases from Irish manufacturers.  In practice an importer could purchase cheap brushes from an Irish manufacturer and on the basis of these purchases be entitled to a licence which he could use to import expensive brushes.  The Government decided that this situation should not continue and agreement was reached with the British authorities on the institution of a new quota for brushes, brooms and mops costing less than 30/-per dozen, which would operate from 1st July, 1966.  To give effect to the decision it was necessary to make a new quota order and to amend the <Col N="1436" /> existing quota order to exclude from its scope brushes, brooms and mops costing less than 30/- per doz.</P>
    <P>Under the terms of the Free Trade Area Agreement, the Government was obliged to eliminate by 1st July, 1966, quantitative restrictions on the importation of stockings of silk or manmade fibres costing more than fifty shillings per dozen and originating in the United Kingdom.  The Agreement provides for the retention of a quota on stockings which do not exceed 50/-per dozen pairs in value.  With the agreement of the manufacturers, the Government decided to eliminate, globally, the quota on silk stockings costing more than 50/- per dozen pairs and it was necessary to amend the existing quota in order to exclude these articles from its scope.</P>
    <P>The Government were also obliged by the Free Trade Area Agreement to eliminate quantitative restrictions on superphosphates of United Kingdom origin.  The termination of this quota on a global basis was considered but it was decided that this would be detrimental to the interests of the Irish manufacturers and that the quota should be retained against third countries. It was necessary, consequently, to amend the existing quota order to confine the quota to superphosphates originating in countries other than the United Kingdom.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to know whether the proposed alterations in effect mean in respect of brushes and silk stockings that they apply to the cheaper types of brushes and stockings. I should like the Minister to say to what extent this will involve increased imports from Britain and if he has received any representations from the trade interests concerned.  In respect of the superphosphates quota order, could the Minister say whether this also will result in increases in imports and whether the prices will be altered?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position at the moment is that a number of superphosphate manufacturers here have a market available to them.  Can the Minister say that when this order takes effect there will be some alteration or anticipated alteration <Col N="1437" /> in the position?  If so, is it likely that the prices charged will mean that superphosphates will be available at a lower price or will it mean a change in the quality or type of superphosphates available?</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the quota on brushes, brooms and mops and on silk stockings, the quota is an increasing one over a period of years up to 1975 so that it would be true to say that as a result of this imports would increase, but the House will appreciate that it is in the context of the Free Trade Area Agreement and this is, if you like, a control of the increase in the imports on a graduated basis designed to minimise the effect on our manufacturers here.  In regard to the superphosphates quota, I understand that the amount involved here would be very little but that there is a subsidy on our own Irish superphosphates, which is designed to keep it at the world price. Therefore, as far as the consumer here is concerned, the price will not be affected.  It will still be maintained at the current world price.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Minister appreciates that it is a number of combines who handle fertilisers.  They are handled by one or two groups.  When the stuff is imported, they control the whole price structure.  It is what they say that really counts.  If there were more liberal trading in this commodity, it would have the effect of reducing the price somewhat.  I could not say to what extent it would reduce it.  If there were freer trade within the country instead of supplying this commodity to one or two firms and allowing them more or less to fix prices among themselves, this would bring about some relief.</P>

We have to balance, on the one hand, the possibility of getting goods at the lowest possible price against, on the other hand, the safeguarding of the employment of the people engaged in those industries in this country.  We have to try to steer an even course between those two objectives.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>The first and most important aim of the Bill is to make provision for further grants to Córas Tráchtála to enable it to continue its work of promoting Irish exports.  The Export Promotion Act, 1959, under which Córas Tráchtála was established, limited the total amount of grants to which the Board was entitled to £1 million.  The amending Act of 1963 increased this sum to £2,500,000.  By the end of the last financial year, grants made to the Board had amounted to £2,081,000, leaving a balance of £419,000 which is not sufficient to meet its requirements for the year at the existing rate of expenditure. This Bill proposes to raise the limit to £4,500,000.  In recommending that provision be made for an additional sum of £2 million, I am having regard to the part Córas Tráchtála are expected to play in the promotion of exports over the next few years and particularly to the fact that the development of the Irish economy depends to a great extent on the achievement of increased exports.</P>
      <P>I have no doubt that the House appreciates the excellent contribution Córas Tráchtála has made to the expansion of exports in recent years and that it will agree that the future of the organisation should be secured by ensuring sufficient funds to enable it to continue its work for the development of exports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1960 Córas Tráchtála was entrusted with the task of promoting and <Col N="1440" /> assisting improvement in the standard of design in Irish industry as part of its general responsibility for promoting, assisting and developing exports and the Board have instituted various schemes for helping manufacturers and exporters to improve their designs.  In 1963 Córas Tráchtála set up Kilkenny Design Workshops, Ltd., a wholly-owned subsidiary, operating a number of design workshops for the production of well-designed prototypes for industry.  The work being done in Kilkenny is already proving to be of value to Irish industry not alone in export markets but also in the home market.  The Bill will make it clear that the statutory powers and functions of Córas Tráchtála include the promotion and assistance of improvement in the standard of industrial design whether for home or for export purposes.</P>
    <P>It is also proposed to give Córas Tráchtála power to borrow for capital expenditure.  The immediate purpose of this proposal is to enable the Board to borrow the amount required to cover the capital expenditure on Ireland House, London.  In addition, under existing legislation the Board has power to dispose of premises or portions of premises not required for their own use.  The Bill gives power to the Board to alter premises in order to facilitate their disposal.  This will remove doubts entertained regarding the Board's legal power to alter premises to facilitate their disposal by way of letting or otherwise.</P>
    <P>Apart from the major proposal in the Bill to provide an additional £2 million for Córas Tráchtála, the Bill is largely a tidying-up measure.  I recommend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>There is general recognition that Córas Tráchtála have made a significant contribution to the promotion and expansion of exports. In considering the work which Córas Tráchtála have done, it is no harm to reflect on the initial consideration of this matter which was undertaken by a committee established by Mr. Dan Morrissey, when he was Minister for Industry and Commerce.  As a result of the examination of the situation by <Col N="1441" /> that committee, a recommendation was made that an export board be established. That board was subsequently set up by legislation introduced by Deputy Seán Lemass, when he was Minister.</P>
      <P>Originally, the purpose of establishing the committee to examine the question was undertaken because of the general recognition that more concentrated effort would require to be made to develop exports to the dollar area. When Marshall Aid assistance was being provided here, the American authorities were concerned that some permanent machinery should be established so that after the initial impetus which the economy secured from the granting of Marshall Aid had ended, definite and permanent measures would be operated in order to develop and expand exports to the dollar area. When the committee representing the different interests, under the chairmanship of the then Secretary of the Department of Industry and Commerce, Mr. John Leydon, considered this, increased dollar earnings were naturally uppermost in their minds.  After the establishment of Córas Tráchtála, it was obvious that possibilities existed for extending the work of the Board to areas outside the dollar area and at a later stage offices were established and promotional activities were extended to Britain and other non-dollar areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The success which has been achieved is quite significant but in considering the present measure, we should be concerned to examine from time to time the general development and encouragement of exports from the point of view of the economy.  In that respect, the Irish Exporters' Association, as well as other interested bodies, conducted certain investigations and it appears that one of the significant factors which emerges from an examination of the export statistics is the relatively small number of firms which, as a matter of policy, get into the export trade.  An analysis of the volume of exports indicates that relatively few firms account for a large proportion of the trade.  This aspect of the matter has caused concern about the possibility of extending and increasing <Col N="1442" /> the number of firms which are interested in, and as a conscious decision of policy decide to gear themselves for, the export business.  The negotiating of the Agreement with Britain last year&mdash;and the ultimate possibility of an agreement with the EEC&mdash;must bring home to those firms which have not yet determined to endeavour to secure markets abroad that the effect of competition arising from this Agreement on the home market will naturally limit the possibilities and the scope of development here, and consequently must involve a reconsideration of export possibilities.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister's Department or Córas Tráchtála, or both together, have from time to time examined, in the light of the Trade Agreement with Britain, and the possibility of another agreement with the EEC, what further outlets are available for Irish goods, or whether any consideration is being given to extending the relatively narrow range of goods for export.  This, of course, depends not merely on assistance from Córas Tráchtála, or on the various grants provided under the different Acts which enable financial and tax and other incentives to be provided in respect of exports, but in the last analysis it depends also on the representatives either of the firms themselves or of the associations which represent particular groups of manufacturers. However actively, energetically and systematically a State company, or even a State Department, may negotiate or arrange either agreements or promotional activities of one sort or another, the ultimate responsibility for selling the particular commodity or commodities depends on the individual representatives of the firm concerned.  One of the most frequent criticisms that have been expressed in respect of firms&mdash;or some of them, at any rate&mdash;manufacturing goods and selling them on export markets is that too often an initial consignment or sample may be of the required standards but when subsequent orders are sought, either the goods are not produced in sufficient quantity or they fail to measure up to the initial quality or standard which was responsible for <Col N="1443" /> securing the order or of evoking the interest of customers outside.</P>
    <P>Last year I visited the Kilkenny Workshops and it was interesting to see some of the work being done there. On the other hand, the actual financial returns from the operation of the workshop showed that so far the development has not proved financially successful.  I should be interested to hear from the Minister to what extent the work being undertaken there is being availed of, or is securing the interest of manufacturers and traders here.  In this regard I feel that the assistance which is being provided and the work carried out by the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards may be of help.  In so far as the increased financial assistance it is proposed to provide, by increasing the maximum amount of money which may be made available to the Board under section 2, offers a prospect of work being continued, then I believe there will be general acceptance of it.</P>
    <P>At the same time, it is important, in view of the present trading position and the effect which external factors, particularly such factors as the British import levy, may have had on our trade, that we should be ever-conscious of the continuing need for the most energetic efforts by all concerned to ensure that we not only maintain our existing foothold in markets abroad but that more strenuous efforts are made by State bodies as well as by individual companies and firms to extend and develop the size of our export potential and the range and type of goods offered for sale.  Like any other country in present world trading conditions we depend on our skill and ability and capacity to sell in competition with exporters and manufacturers not merely in Britain but in Europe.  That involves sustained and continuous effort at all levels and in every field of industrial enterprise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose it is true that the work of Córas Tráchtála is particularly important because of the necessity to try to keep our balance of payments right.  If Córas Tráchtála can get markets for Irish materials <Col N="1444" /> and so bring in foreign currency, it helps immeasurably.  But are they doing that?  Are they doing what they were set up to do?  The fact that recently we have been told that a mining concern which was set up a few years ago here&mdash;there are now two mines under the same company&mdash; hopes, within 12 or 18 months, to export ore to the value of almost the entire amount received from the cattle trade, shows that individuals who set out to get what they want, do in fact get a market for their goods.  I am sure that if these people had started a mine and had said they would expect some Government organisation to find a market for them, they would have the ore heaped up around the face of the mine and there would be very little export.  But they went to the Continent and made the necessary arrangements with people who can take the ore from them, with the result that they got a guarantee for the entire life of the mine for their exports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know that is not what happens when the export of materials manufactured here comes up for consideration because, as Deputy Cosgrave has said, we find that one or two things happen.  Either a material of excellent quality is produced and a market found for it but the problem of keeping up supplies apparently has not been investigated and in a short time we find that market, or most of it, can be lost because manufacturers cannot maintain the supplies necessary to keep it and supplies have to be sought elsewhere.  Alternatively, the goods are manufactured here and there is no export market for them. To give an example of the first, we can take peat briquettes.  We know that a tremendous amount of them can be exported but we cannot supply them.  We have not got them and we cannot, therefore, retain the export market which was found for them with the assistance of Córas Tráchtála. Peat moss is another example.  It should be possible to keep up the supplies of peat moss but despite the fact that in my own constituency a factory was set up with a great blaring of trumpets some years ago&mdash;God knows how many Ministers' cars were outside <Col N="1445" /> for the opening&mdash;it lasted only about 18 months and then closed down.  It has been closed for two or three years because the market was found but the material could not be supplied.</P>
    <P>That is one side of the story.  The other side is that of people manufacturing with State assistance a certain article and apparently no attempt is made to find whether there is an export market for it.  A typical example is what happened in Dundalk when the electrical works closed down there. They closed, in fact, on the evening before they officially opened because neither Córas Tráchtála nor anybody else went to the trouble of finding out if there was a market for the goods they were about to produce.  When they were ready to go into production, it was found that the places where they expected to be able to sell their products in Britain were already saturated by similar goods from similar types of factory very much nearer the market.</P>
    <P>This is something Córas Tráchtála will have to do its homework about. It is something into which they must go very much deeper and ensure that if they find a good market, the supply can be maintained.  Before encouraging anybody to start manufacturing on a big scale here, we must try to ensure that a guaranteed market is available.  I am quite sure our friends in the mining business know that a market can be found if we go to the trouble of looking for it.</P>
    <P>I travel a good deal and it is extraordinary the number of countries to which one goes where Ireland was never heard of and nothing manufactured in Ireland ever seems to have arrived there.  We have quite interesting products which could possibly find sale in some of these countries if properly pushed but they have never been heard of.  They may be short of certain goods which we make and could sell to them.  Nobody seems to worry that our trade could be directed to these countries.  I do not have to be told that costs of transport and other factors arise, but if we are selling butter to Kuwait with 3/8d. per pound subsidy, <Col N="1446" /> surely we could make some attempt to find something that would sell abroad and which would not need such a subsidy?  We must look into this seriously.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of selling truly Irish materials abroad.  The Institute for Industrial Research and Standards have been helping out in this matter and a number of firms, particularly furniture firms, have been attempting to make progress in this sphere.  They have been making a great success with Irish designs.  This should get a little more attention from Córas Tráchtála.  A few years ago a furniture manufacturer from my own constituency went to France and not only did he get an order for a very substantial quantity of furniture but he succeeded in getting from the French Government an order for chairs for the French Parliament.  If that could be done by a private individual, I see no reason why a Government-sponsored body should not be able to try to break into new markets and try to sell or popularise what we are making here.</P>
    <P>There has been comment on another matter.  This is something that certain people do not like while others seem to think there is a lot in it.  Personally, I believe there is cause for complaint. When we have established embassies abroad, they should have nothing but Irish furniture in them.  All furnishing and materials there and any other materials used there should, as far as possible, be Irish.  I am a Pioneer&mdash;I mentioned this before&mdash;but I have had the experience of going to our embassies abroad and finding that nobody ever heard tell of Irish whiskey.  Scotch was produced for those who wanted whiskey but Irish was not produced. It is a shame, and if we are manufacturing things which could be sold abroad, it is our job to push them.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister who is comparatively new to the Department may have some difficulty in getting everything done which he would like to see done, and I am quite sure he is an energetic young man who will be sincere enough to try to have the things which should be done tackled. When it comes to voting in this House <Col N="1447" /> a certain amount of money which is to be expended in the same way as it has been expended over the years, doing a little good but missing out an awful lot of good things, I do not think the job is being properly done.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave referred to the EEC and to our Trade Agreement with Britain.  The Trade Agreement with Britain is one of the things which have caused our manufacturers here a lot more difficulty than they had up to July of this year.  No matter what we may say about free trade&mdash;and we hear people talking about preparing for it and how necessary it is to prepare for it&mdash;I only hope that when the day comes when Britain goes into the EEC, and therefore we must go in, we shall have some industries which will survive.  I gravely doubt it, from my own experience.  I am quite sure the EEC do not want the type of industries we have here, small industries. They believe they can manufacture in a very big factory enough commodities of any kind to supply perhaps the whole EEC and that encouraging small industries is simply a matter of adding extra cost.  We should be prepared to find markets elsewhere in case something like that happens, and I would appeal to the Minister to direct Córas Tráchtála to go after new markets.  Existing markets where we have them at the present time are all right if we can get the amount of material required and if we can fill the orders, but if we have a tie-up with the EEC, we could find ourselves in a precarious position overnight.</P>
    <P>Some years ago a man succeeded in getting an order for a certain type of brick which could not be got in Britain.  He got an order for the manufacture of it here for export to Britain. When he suggested it to a number of firms and to Córas Tráchtála, he was told: &ldquo;It does not make sense.  You cannot make bricks here and send them across; the weight of them and everything else is very much against it. You just cannot do it&rdquo;.  Three years later the Sunday papers had a headline where somebody else had suddenly <Col N="1448" /> decided that this could be done, and the job is being done.  I know the Minister will meet people with crackpot ideas as to how things should be done. There should be somebody in his Department who would give the necessary attention to investigating ideas for such things which will come in by the dozen to him, and not have a blanket condemnation of everything so that some idea which could be very useful would be thrown overboard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasOHara" hpid="Mr. O'Hara Mr. O'Hara">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>The Leader of our Party, Deputy Cosgrave, has paid tribute to the efforts of Córas Tráchtála in developing new markets and new fields.  I feel it my duty to join with him in the tribute paid to this organisation which is doing its best and has been doing its best since its formation. It is to the credit of Córas Tráchtála that it has shown imagination and has succeeded in expanding industry.  However, it is not the success I would expect it to be and to this extent I must be critical.  I feel obliged to say that the personnel of many of these organisations are not the type of personnel suitable for the purpose or qualified to go out and seek markets and having got them, experienced enough to know what it is to hold them because many of them have not business training.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say that as one who had a business training and who was engaged in the export business long before Córas Tráchtála was thought of.  The family business to which I belong and in which I was trained engaged in the export business before I was born.  They exported from the North Wall and various other Irish ports.  As a young lad, I worked in the stores where goods were being packed and prepared for export.  Long before regulations came in about high standards, we were taught by my late father, God be good to him, that nothing was too good for the customer, and the customer in that case was across the water in England and in this city as well.  One need only go to the Department of Agriculture or to the Minister's own Department to find the records of those exports. People who have experience in that field may not have gone through universities; <Col N="1449" /> they may not be BAs, BLs or B.Comms., but because of their training and experience they are well qualified to say what is good and what is bad.  That was my training right from the packaging place to the place of export, the North Wall and the other ports at Sligo, the less important port of Ballina, and Galway and Westport. Some of these ports are now closed down.  The bulk of the exports was from the land of Ireland, agricultural produce of one kind or another.</P>
    <P>I am reminded of Deputy Tully's reference to mining.  Minerals were exported from Mayo through the port of Killala 80 or 90 years ago.  They were exported from there in the raw, not processed.  At one time&mdash;I do not want to go into detail on this matter because I could be accused of playing politics&mdash; we enjoyed certain preferences in the British market.  These advantages were thrown away, a retrograde step when we consider our geographical situation, how near we are to the greatest market in the world, the British market, from the point of view of our economy.  As long as I can remember, we have been throwing away very good and very valuable markets.  We have been trying to convince ourselves that there was something in Germany, something in Spain and something in France that was far better than what was across the water in England.  I suggest to the Minister that if he checks the facts and figures that are there available to him &mdash;not just the niggardly exports or imports that my late father and I might have engaged in but the overall position&mdash;he will learn something from them.  The records are in the files of the Department and he can learn a great deal from them.</P>
    <P>The Minister has had the experience of going to England, America and certain European countries.  The thought must have struck him from time to time that in heavily industrialised cities such as London, Birmingham, Manchester, the potential is there for us if only we were up and doing and minding our business.  When walking through the streets of London, Birmingham or Manchester, as I have done as a businessman, looking around to see <Col N="1450" /> if there was Irish produce in the shops there and failing to see it, he must have formed the same opinion as I have formed, that there is something terribly and damnably wrong with us and that we have a good deal for which to blame ourselves.  Instead of having persons who understood what they were doing and what they were talking about at the head of affairs, frequently we had alleged experts from foreign countries, who were invited to tell us how to do things and the opinions of our own people were never really valued.  You will find today, no doubt, engaged in export activity, people who came in here, not for the love of our blue eyes or the colour of our hair, but because there were grants available to them. They came from Europe and, perhaps, from the United States.  I am not condemning them all.  Some of them, no doubt, are decent and reputable people. Amongst them were the chancers and the Johnny-get-rich-quick type, who had their hands out for grants and, if it suited them at a later date, were ready to fold their tents and get out.  That has gone on, to my knowledge.</P>
    <P>I was not very old when I employed about 20 people and there was no need for a trade union around the place.  I paid the trade union rates in a country area and provided every modern amenity.  If I as a private individual were afforded the opportunities that some of these foreigners got, I would have a couple of hundred people employed now, without having the B.Comm. or any other degree, but having been trained in the hard school of experience, in a business handed down in which I was directly interested and was anxious to foster because it was a family business in which one was reared and trained and in which one was an expert.</P>
    <P>We seem to be prepared to go to the four corners of the earth for men and women with high-sounding names and to meet them at the airport or the dockside and welcome them and, with the Irish taxpayer's money, hand out generous grants, in many cases to very doubtful and very shady individuals. I could go on and on on that subject.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1451" /> I know the foolish policy that was adopted, that we could get on without the British market, the foolish policy of starting economic and other wars and the cheap talk that went on.  I know the amount of damage it did and how it prejudiced the British consumer against us.</P>
    <P>It may surprise the Minister when I tell him that, on one occasion when Dr. Ryan was Minister for Agriculture and went to No. 10 Downing Street and the late Winston Churchill was in a room adjacent to No. 10 the very words that Winston Churchill used were: &ldquo;Get as much as you can as cheap as you can from those Irish&rdquo;. He did not bother to meet the deputation. He knew that we had not any other market, that we were bad businessmen, that we were throwing away the markets that were there for us to foster if only we had the commonsense to do it.  I do not misquote the man.  I know this from the man who stood beside him at the time, who was very pro-Irish and married to an Irish girl.</P>
    <P>We have been throwing away these markets.  A lot of water has flowed under the bridge down through the years and a great deal of damage has been done.  To the credit of Córas Tráchtála, many of whom are not trained business people at all, I must say that they have been trying as best they can to restore our position in some of these markets and they have found it very difficult to do so.</P>
    <P>Traditionally, we sent the bulk of our exports to Glasgow and exported, to a smaller degree, to London and to Manchester.  Many of the older people remember when millions of pounds worth of Irish goods were landed at the Nelson docks and other docks in London and Scotland.  Such quantities of goods are no longer being landed at these ports today.  I say, without fear of contradiction, that that is due to the fact that we are very bad business people and were not minding our business when we had the opportunity to do so.  The war did not affect us adversely.  We gained when the bombs were raining down on <Col N="1452" /> Birmingham, London and other English cities.  We had the produce they needed.  Unfortunately, as has often happened before&mdash;I do not like going on the record as saying this&mdash;a few disreputable people engaged in business at that time were prepared, just because the British were in need of goods at that time, to put anything into old sacks or bags and ship it across and take money for it and to destroy our reputaion.</P>
    <P>It became necessary to have an organisation such as Córas Tráchtála, to have registration, to have some tabs on the type of exporter who engaged in business.  Personally, I feel that free trade is the most desirable thing we can have.  There is the businessman who is prepared to get up in the early hours of the morning, to look for markets and, having got them, is prepared to hold on to them because his very livelihood is involved, but it is necessary to establish bodies such as Córas Tráchtála in order to establish some sort of control and to maintain the highest possible standards for people who are prepared to pay a good price for a good article.</P>
    <P>It should be borne in mind that there is no country in which we have so much goodwill among our own people as we have in England.  Our own kith and kin are there, our own brothers and sisters, uncles and aunts.  In cities such as Liverpool and Manchester, the majority of the people one meets on the street are Irish or of Irish descent. They are prepared to buy our goods, provided we offer them an honest article and a continuous supply.  There is no use in saying that there will be a thousand rugs coming from Foxford if they are not delivered on time.</P>
    <P>Having mentioned rugs and woollen goods, I put it on the record in recent times that an industry started in Foxford a long time ago.  It is publicly known that it was the old Congested Districts Board that financed a nun there to start a mill.  That mill has been successful down through the years.  The business has been carried on without State assistance.  That business was built, first of all, on the belief of that nun in Divine Providence <Col N="1453" /> and, secondly, on the fundamental principle of producing a quality article and thirdly, by ensuring that the article would reach the customer in proper condition.  That business has lasted down through the years and has weathered all the storms created by wars, by Hitler, Mussolini and the rest, and it continues to expand, even in spite of the British import levy. That is a business that I know well because it is a local business.  I am conversant with its history.</P>
    <P>I know that frequently it met obstacles but because they produced the right kind of article, they have not had to go to Germany looking for customers.  Customers have come to them from Germany, the United States and other places.  If he looked at the addresses on the parcels leaving the factory, I doubt if the Minister could read all of them because they are in diverse languages.  I am not trying to belittle the Minister's educational qualifications.  I have the highest opinion both of himself, of his sincerity and integrity.</P>
    <P>It is time we realised in this country that, by and large, we have proved ourselves to be bad business people. Those firms that have made a success of their business have stood fundamentally on quality and have been able to hold customers once they got them.  Successive Fianna Fáil Governments &mdash; I am not referring to the present Minister but to his predecessors&mdash;were loud in their condemnation of everything British at a time when we were searching for markets.  We know the results today.  There is also the question of uncertainty of transportation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasOHara" hpid="Mr. O'Hara Mr. O'Hara">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>All right.  It is too bad he should not have some responsibility to see that, if we produce an article in this country, it is possible to export it. I wonder what Córas Tráchtála in Ireland House, London, would do if, as a result of their best efforts down town, they secured an export order for £500,000 and then found it was going to be held up in the docks for months.  In such circumstances, will the Leas-Cheann Comhairle not agree with me it is of vital importance that we are able to deliver the goods?  However, that might be more relevant to the Department of Labour.  The sooner we realise it is not merely a question of getting orders down town in London or Amsterdam, and saying we will deliver the goods in a fortnight's time when because of bad labour relations we cannot deliver them, the better.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cosgrave mentioned that only a small number of firms go in for the export trade.  That is true.  We are fond of monopolies in this country. There seem to be only a few favourites who can get into it at all.  People who have engaged in this work traditionally have been wiped out and pushed out.  I suspect some firms in this country got grants and assistance from Córas Tráchtála more for political considerations than because of their ability to export and deliver the goods.</P>

      <P>The matter of our entry into EEC has been referred to. Although down through the years we said the British market was gone, in recent times we entered into a Trade Agreement with the British, to which approval was given here.  We on this side always felt the British market was our traditional market.  The picture will be changed completely and Córas Tráchtála will have a much bigger job on hands if we enter into EEC.  There are some companies I should like to see continuing.  If a company closes down in this country, even though it employs only ten or 15 people, it is a loss to somebody and a loss to the national effort.  It can be a very serious loss from the point of view of the persons employed there and their families.</P>
      <P>If we enter into EEC&mdash;and I sincerely hope we do&mdash;I do not mind going on record as saying there are many of the mushroom industries opened by Ministers down through the years&mdash;for which golden keys and scissors for cutting the tape were provided &mdash;on the locks and doors of which rust will be found shortly after we enter the Common Market.

      <P>We were told about economic expansion but that seems to be falling flat.  If I develop that line of thought, the Chair will probably rule me out of order.  I shall conclude by saying that I sincerely hope that Córas Tráchtála will further put their shoulder to the wheel in an effort to clear up the mess that we ourselves, a native Government, have created here down through the years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>That lets me in.  I shall be brief.  It is very important that a matter of this kind should receive consideration by the House.  It behoves us all to encourage, as far as we can, the promotion of exports and the promotion of the practice of exports, particularly in view of what appears inevitably to be facing us.  For good or ill, this nation has been committed by this Government to walk hand in hand with Britain wherever she proposes to tread.  It has been announced that Britain proposes to lose no time in endeavouring to get into what we call the Common Market.  This, from what <Col N="1458" /> I can judge of it, is the most momentous problem we shall have to face in the years which lie ahead.</P>
      <P>When we talk about the encouragement of exports and the provision of moneys to enable greater exports to be made from this country, it is impossible to separate the thought from what the future holds.  On previous occasions here, when we discussed matters of this kind, I raised, as did many others in all parts of the House, I am sure, the problem of how well-equipped or how ill-equipped we are or will be to compete in the highly rationalised market towards which we are being driven primarily by the policy of this Government in locking our fate with that of Britain as they did under the Free Trade Area Agreement and, secondly, by world events.  It may be said that the Government had no alternative but to take the steps they took in binding our future with the economic destiny of Britain.  Everybody will not agree on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even in Britain, even in the Government Party in Britain, not everybody is persuaded that getting into the Common Market will represent what it has been represented as here.  Not everybody is persuaded that it will be the solution to all economic problems and that there is a huge market there in which, if we can get into it,. we can sell more or less at will.  Experience has shown this not to be the case.  In many instances&mdash;I am talking in the context of history rather than in the context of the Six&mdash;it has clearly been demonstrated that the results are depressing when you join together a highly industrialised economy with an agricultural entity, as was done, for instance, in the second half of the last century in Italy where the agricultural sector of the south joined with the highly industrialised northern sector, on the proposition, which everybody at the time accepted, that the benefits of mass production, as they were then described, in the northern part of the country would diffuse into the southern part and that the relative prosperity of that day would achieve a balance throughout the whole country.  This did not in fact happen.  The reverse happened.  The agricultural area was even further <Col N="1459" /> denuded of population and was reduced to an even lower standard of living than that to which it had been accustomed over a long period&mdash;and that was long enough.  In fact, rather than having an uplifting and a beneficial effect on the agricultural area, the advent of the greater market, which was the proposal then under consideration and which was acclaimed by the people of Italy, had a depressing effect.</P>
    <P>This is the danger we face in so far as the Common Market is concerned. It is a gambler's throw for us.  It is much in the mind of many people that the throw has been made with dice loaded against our economy.  It would appear to me that we are not doing sufficient by way of the provision of moneys to people in this country to encourage them to expand their business and to export more or by the preparation of our economy for the situation into which we are apparently inexorably being led.</P>
    <P>One of the most obvious steps which might have been taken by the Government and which has not, so far as I know, been taken would have been to establish an organisation which would send out into the world, as I instanced before, groups of what might be described as economic explorers who would find and fix the markets wherein to sell whatever we have to sell.  We have not much to sell.  When all comes to all and when we are forced back on the basic fundamentals of what springs from the soil of Ireland, we have a very limited range to sell.  It should have been the act of a prudent Government, which this Government have not proved to be, to develop an organisational arm which would take up this task of finding out exactly what we can sell and where we can sell it in the years which lie ahead and, indeed, what may be the immediate future if Britain's plans come to an early fruition.  Therefore, on that head, I think the Government stand guilty of the charge of listless inactivity and perhaps more correctly it could be described as an utter lack of appreciation of what is happening outside our shores.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1460" /> The economic world, as represented by the Common Market, as far as one can read and judge, as far as one can hear from contacts with parliamentarians in these countries, is a highly organised, rationalised entity in which the emphasis is upon mass production and a lowering of costs to the minimum level.  Indeed, it could be said that the emphasis is on a way of life to which we, as a nation, have never been accustomed.  If we are to participate in that struggle to survive, it will be essential for us to revolutionise our whole approach to industry and, indeed, to agriculture.  It will call for a far greater degree of governmental organisation than we now have and for a direction of industry to an extent which we do not now know. These are facts which must be accepted by our industrialists if we are to live at all in the circumstances which I describe.</P>
    <P>These circumstances are not at all our seeking, certainly not all the seeking of the Labour Party.  They are certainly not of a kind which I, looking at the situation, would think to be desirable and which we should seek.  The concept of the Common Market has been talked about as if it were a kind of heaven towards which we were striving.  I heard a previous Taoiseach say that it was urgently desirable that we should get into the Common Market, but I will not say that in the long-run this will be to the benefit of this nation.</P>
    <P>It will be a long time before we become properly equipped, in the sense of manufacture and distribution of goods and the reorganisation of agriculture, to compete with the kind of complex which will face us if the day finally arrives when we must join with Britain in that situation.  What we can do, facing the inevitable&mdash;and I say inevitable in a qualified way, in the sense that this Government are in control of the destinies of this country and have decided on it, and are bound hand and foot with Britain, and whatever Britain does we will eventually do the same&mdash;is that to which I have already adverted.  We should discover what we can sell and where we can <Col N="1461" /> sell it, and we should set about preparing for the adaptation of such of our industries as are capable of adaption for the advent of this difficult situation.  We, frankly, are very worried. When I say this, I know I am expressing the view of many thousands of workers in a number of industries who are worried about their future.</P>
    <P>Let it not be thought that we can overnight adapt an industry such as the car assembly industry, which is most often referred to, to any other purpose.  I should like to hear from the Government benches just what alternatives are to be provided for the workers in that industry.</P>

      <P>It is not my purpose to open the discussion.  Beidh lá eile againn i gcóir na h-oibre sin.  When discussing additional moneys for the encouagement of exports, which is the function of Córas Tráchtála, one is at liberty to make the point that sufficient is not being done to prepare the country for what is ahead.  One is entitled to ask the Minister what this new Government&mdash;because they are a new Government&mdash;propose to do to equip our people to face the very worrying future and, particularly, to readapt our workers who may be found to be in industries which may become redundant.  The Minister may take the opportunity, when he is replying, to tell us what is in the Government's mind on this point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>There is in connection with this Bill a Money Resolution &ldquo;to authorise such payments out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas as are necessary to give effect to any Act of the present session to amend and extend the Export Promotion Acts, 1959 to 1963.&rdquo;  I think it important that we should trace the history of Córas Tráchtála since its inception under the Export Promotion Act, 1959.  People talk about the Government not doing sufficient.  In my view, and in the view of the people I represent, the Government are doing what they think is in the best interests of export promotion.  I am quite satisfied as a Government backbencher that the Government would be delighted to hear of alternative proposals and they would accept these alternative proposals, sift them and take the best out of them.  But we have not heard any alternatives to those the Minister is asking the House to approve today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Córas Tráchtála was set up in 1959 and the total amount of grant to which the Board was entitled was £1 million. There was an amending Act in 1963 which increased that sum to £2½ million.  By the end of the last financial year, grants made to the Board amounted to £2,081,000, leaving a balance of £419.000 to be sought. There is now a Bill before the House <Col N="1463" /> which proposes to raise the limit to £4½ million.  Those who say that this Government are not doing sufficient in export promotion should examine the support given to Córas Tráchtála since 1959.</P>
    <P>Remarks have been made about Britain and our possible entry into the Common Market.  Can anybody in the House tell me&mdash;again it is a question of alternatives&mdash;where else can we get a better market than Britain?  We have broken, as it were, the psychological political link with Britain.  We should have done that 40 years ago but I believe we have done so now.  As far as the facts and figures go, Britain is our best market.  We should accept it as such.  I see that Mr. George Browne is moving in the Common Market field again and if Britain enters the Common Market and we do not go in with her, where does that leave Ireland?  It leaves Ireland hanging in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. When people talk about Ireland's role or Ireland going in hand-in-glove with Britain, they should remember that Britain has been one of our most important markets, as has been proven by the figures over the years.  The whole concept of a common market has been conceived in the minds of people who want to unify Europe economically.  If Britain enters and we are left outside, where is our best market?  The USA?  I do not think we could compete in America.</P>
    <P>I would ask those who say that the Government are not giving sufficient money to Córas Tráchtála to apply their minds in a very thorough fashion to the figures from the beginning of the export promotion in 1959 to the present time and they will see that the grants increased from £1 million in 1959 to £4½ million in 1966.  I think this is sufficient answer to those who state that the Government do not put sufficient emphasis on what Córas Tráchtála has been doing.  Córas Tráchtála has been doing a lot and it is to be congratulated on what it has been doing.  This sort of destructive talk is undermining, in my view, Córas Tráchtála and similar semi-State bodies.  These are new bodies <Col N="1464" /> created in the last five, six or ten years and they want every encouragement they can get.  I believe that encouragement should come from this House and if people feel that Córas Tráchtála is not doing a sufficiently good job, let them tell us where it is not doing a good enough job and give us the alternative.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not delay the House very long but I should like to support the recent statement of the Minister for Industry and Commerce in appealing to Irish industrialists to gear themselves for freer trading conditions and for greater competition in the markets in which they now enjoy such freedom.  The statement of the Minister for Industry and Commerce has tremendous significance for the many people engaged in the industrial sphere, both employers and industrial workers.  I hope that in his term as Minister he will reiterate this statement and, if necessary, take steps along the lines which he indicated he would possibly have to go if he saw that firms were not adapting themselves to the conditions of greater competition which we foresee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having listened to Deputy Dunne and the very pessimistic statements from the Labour benches this afternoon, I wonder do some of those Deputies ever read or listen to the statements by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Industry and Commerce. On this side of the House it has never been stated that entry into the European Economic Community, or even the European Free Trade Association, if that were possible, would be the answer to all our problems.  This was never said and that impression was never given.  It must always be realised that industrialists must prepare themselves for greater competition and this has been stated continuously over the past seven to ten years by Deputy Lemass as Taoiseach who tried to bring this message home very strongly to our industrialists.  Over the past five, seven or ten years, he has been making the statements, week after week and month after month, that our industrialists must prepare themselves for greater competition and must increase their efficiency and productivity.  That is <Col N="1465" /> absolutely essential if we are to survive.</P>
    <P>Nothing will ever be easy but there is always the great hope that we would have entry into the greater markets in which we could find sale for our goods. By increasing our efforts at home and capturing markets in foreign lands, we could increase our industrial employment, the number of factories in the country.  We could also follow up in other spheres of government in providing the necessary social benefits which we, in this Government, intend to provide for the less well-off sections of our community.  This can never be done unless we avail of the opportunities and help to create wealth. The Government have always tried to assist anybody who wished to make an honest endeavour to promote industrial production, thereby giving employment and devoting some of the rewards of the increased wealth thus created to assist the less well-off sections who are in receipt of social welfare benefits.</P>
    <P>It is rather disheartening to hear at this stage Deputies on the opposite side of the House stating that the Fianna Fáil Government were interested only in giving industrial grants to foreigners.  Again, this type of statement can be taken up incorrectly by members of the public.  You hear people repeating these statements without knowing whether they are true or false.  The very fact that the Minister for Industry and Commerce got up the other night and put Irish industrialists on the mat by telling them they were not availing of the adaptation grants provided by this Government to a sufficient degree, that he was not satisfied with the demand for adaptation grants, proves that this Government are more than anxious to provide financial assistance for Irish industrialists who wish to avail of them to increase their productivity and thus increase employment and help to improve the position in regard to our balance of trade.</P>
    <P>There is not a factory owner in the country who, wishing to extend his premises and thereby to place his firm in a more competitive position, to increase the efficiency in his factory and <Col N="1466" /> to capture markets abroad, who can say that he cannot get aid from this Government to assist him in that extension. We have continually stated that extension is absolutely essential. The aids are there and this Fianna Fáil Government are disappointed that demands are not coming in from Irish industrialists for these grants which are made available.  It is disappointing to hear irresponsible statements still coming from the Opposition benches that this Government are interested only in foreign industrialists.  One would think, sitting here and listening to the speeches from the Opposition benches, that there was only one factory in this country, that this Government only gave aid to one factory and one foreigner, that, of course, being Potez.  How often do we hear Potez mentioned here?  It shows the narrow outlook of some people and how little knowledge they have of industrial matters when they persist in referring to just this one factory which is having difficulty.  I have personal experience of Potez in operation.</P>

I do not know a great deal about their operations but they certainly seem to have a very able staff who go about their work in a very efficient manner, so effectively it seems that it is not possible for us to criticise them in the smallest degree.

Anyone who promotes exports is doing a good job in helping the economy and helping to provide employment, employment which is badly needed.  Deputy Dunne says we are tied hand and foot to Britain at the moment.  I do not agree that we are tied hand and foot but this Party have always held the belief that this country should trade with Britain for geographical, if for no other, reasons.  We supported the recent Free Trade Agreement because we believe we must trade with Britain.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Common Market, it is our belief that, if Britain enters, we must of necessity enter also.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann is of opinion that in view of the steep rise in the cost of living and the difficulties <Col N="1470" /> created thereby for all pensioners, all pensions should be increased.</P>
    <P>That, Sir, is an all-embracing motion. It is, in my respectful submission, no more than is necessary.  It is a motion which calls on the Government to recognise the fact that the cost of living has increased substantially and, as a result, severe hardships have been inflicted on all categories of pensioners. I am appealing to the Minister and the Government to do justice to all grades of pensioners.  In that, I include old age pensioners, widows, retired local government employees, retired civil servants, retired members of the Garda Síochana and all other categories of State and semi-State pensioners.  It is unnecessary for me to labour the argument or to emphasise the fact that the cost of living has increased very substantially.</P>
    <P>I propose to deal with this motion in a general way because other speakers following me will deal with each of the categories involved more specifically.  However, I should like to say a word about old age pensioners in the first instance.  The maximum rate of pension payable to an old age pensioner at the present time is 47/6d per week and that has been so now for over 12 months.  It does not need any great eloquence or argument to convince the country, or certainly Deputies, that that is a totally inadequate sum on which to expect an old person to live.  We should, in this country, be just to people who can no longer fend for themselves, to people who can no longer go on strike, who can no longer march in order to put their claims before the Government and the Minister concerned.</P>
    <P>I notice that a new means test has been introduced into the old age pension code.  Up to about 12 months ago a person could have £52 a year approximately and qualify for the full old age pension.  In the Budget of last year, I think, a new means test was introduced whereby people who had more than £26 a year did not qualify for the maximum payment of 47/6d per week, but in the Social Welfare Act of this year, we had yet another means test introduced.  When the last <Col N="1471" /> 5/- a week was given, it was stipulated that it would become payable only to people who were destitute, people who had no income whatsoever; even a right of residence disqualified a person from receiving this latest increase of 5/-.  That was an unfortunate provision to put into the Social Welfare Act of this year, because I think people should not be discouraged from making some provision for themselves, such as retaining a right of residence in the house which they transfer to another member of the family.  I shall deal with this only in a general way and I want to leave the old age pensioners and the widows on the note that the present pensions are really a disgrace to this country in this year of 1966.</P>
    <P>State servants, in general, and local government employees who retire have the same grievance.  The pensions they receive bear no relation at all to the salaries for the time being paid to their successors in office, and the pensions they receive very often bear no relation to the cost of living.  I have held, and held for a very long time, that the pension being paid to a retired civil servant or local government employee should be tied, and tied rather rigidly, to the salary being paid to the successor in office; that is no more than reasonable. I understand that local government pensioners have received an increase which is supposed to bring them up in line with the ninth round, to compensate them for the ninth round increase.  In fact, it does not do any such thing.  It ignores certain increases which serving officers received subsequent to the seventh round.  It ignores the status increases of which the Minister is well aware.  This means that those local authority employees who retired, I think, after 1963 are in a very poor position indeed, and feel that they have a genuine grievance.  It always puzzled me why the pensions of retired local government employees and civil servants were not related to the salaries paid to their successors in office.  It is very hard to justify their not being so related.</P>
    <P>Members of the Garda who have <Col N="1472" /> retired are also dissatisfied with the treatment which they received, and with the pensions which they are being paid.  I think it is a fact that there are six different rates of pensions being paid to the same grade in the Garda. Admittedly, they retired at different times, but it is an extraordinary thing that six different rates of pensions should be paid to the same grade within the Garda Síochána.  When these men joined the Force, they were led to believe that they would have a guaranteed standard of living, a reasonable standard of living.  Of course, so long as they remained members of the Garda Síochána, their organisations fought for them, and were in a position to agitate for them, and see to it that they were properly treated.  A man who joins the Garda should be guaranteed not only a reasonable standard of living while he is serving in the Force, but a reasonable standard of living when he retires and can no longer earn a living for himself.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Garda alone among all the State servants contribute to their pensions.  I think they pay something approximating to 2½ per cent of their salaries towards a pension fund.  I understand that no other branch of the Civil Service so contribute to their pension fund.  That is all the more reason why they should be properly treated by the Government and by the Department.  The same thing applies to local government officials who retire. They find themselves, comparatively speaking, much worse off than their serving brethren.</P>
    <P>Another thing that strikes me as being unfair to retired people is that many of them invest, and have invested in the past, in national loans, believing they would have some security in that way, but of course they find that what looked like a reasonable rate of interest when they invested their money, and what looked like a reasonable income, means very little at the present time because the value of money has been substantially reduced. At the same time, if they are within the income bracket, they have to pay income tax.  Those are the better off pensioners.  As I say, while their capital is being reduced if invested in national <Col N="1473" /> loans, at the same time they are called upon to pay income tax.</P>
    <P>It is really difficult to understand the general approach of the Government, and of various Ministers of State individually, to this problem of pensions. They do something, but they do it belatedly, and they do too little.  The system of giving pensioners something now and again in the Budget is quite unsatisfactory.  Usually when the Minister has dealt with everything else in the Budget, he sees if he has anything left, or if he can scrape a bit from some other place, and he throws it at the pensioners.  The amounts provided in this way in different Budgets by previous Ministers for Finance, year in and year out, have borne no relationship at all to the amounts being paid to the pensioners' successors in office. More important still, they bear no relationship to the cost of living.</P>
    <P>The question of the superannuation paid to retired civil servants and local government employees should be tackled on a realistic basis, and should be put on a proper footing once and for all.  It should be ensured that a person who during his working years received a reasonably good salary, and was able to keep up a fairly good standard of living, is not reduced to the position of a second- or third-class citizen when he retires, and is not thrown on the scrapheap, while those who are still in harness are well enough looked after because they are in a position to fight and because they have the machinery at their disposal to arbitrate for them and see that justice is done.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is good enough&mdash; it is deplorable and unchristian&mdash;that people who have ceased to perform a useful service, so to speak, should be forgotten and treated as something that does not matter.  I appeal to the Minister for Finance, who, I suppose, is the youngest man to hold that office for some time, who after all is the man in charge of the provision of pensions on an overall basis, the man who at Budget time is charged with providing the money, to bring to bear a new line of thinking on this subject and to be big enough and bold enough to say to the Government that they must provide the wherewithal <Col N="1474" /> to look after those who are not able to look after themselves.  If the Minister approaches the subject in that way, he will have the full support of this side of the House in any proposals he brings here to do justice to retired State servants and retired local government employees.  If the Minister is approached by the Minister for Social Welfare to provide money to help the still weaker section of the community, the weakest section, the old age pensioners and the widows and orphans who are utterly unable to provide for themselves and who must exist on charity&mdash;that is not the proper word because it should not be charity&mdash;who must call on the stronger sections of the community to look after them, the Minister should not be afraid to do so. I can assure him that he will have the support of this Party in providing money for that purpose.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>In seconding the motion, I wish simply to add my voice to that of Deputy Fitzpatrick in appealing to the Minister.  The motion asks the Dáil to express the view that because of the steep rise in the cost of living and the difficulties created thereby for all pensioners, all pensions should be increased.  I imagine the Minister will probably adopt the line that a motion of this sort is too broad and too general and that it would raise too many difficulties for him. We want to see the motion accepted by the House and implemented by the Government.  As Deputy Fitzpatrick pointed out, there may be difficulties. It may be necessary for the Minister to raise money and the raising of money is not always popular, but as far as we are concerned we are prepared to support any steps the Minister may take to raise money for the purpose of implementing the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people who are always hardest hit when the cost of living increases are those who for one reason or another find themselves on fixed incomes. There are people not covered by this motion, elderly people with fixed incomes of their own, arising not from pensions but possibly from investments. They, too, are hard hit when the cost of living increases but those in receipt of pensions, particularly <Col N="1475" /> those on small pensions, people of the sort Deputy Fitzpatrick referred to, old aged, widows, orphans and other State and semi-State pensioners, are particularly hard hit.  Because of their age, they are not in a position to alleviate the hardship by doing work or by seeking employment even on a part-time basis.</P>
    <P>The people for whom we are talking are those who by their years of service have earned reasonably generous treatment from the State.  They are people who have now entered their declining years.  They are not able to assist themselves; they are not able to obtain employment and during their working lives were not able to put aside anything towards their retirement.  They are the people hardest hit whenever the cost of living increases.</P>
    <P>One thing Fianna Fáil have proved themselves good at is increasing the cost of living and even during the past six or ten years&mdash;I have not got statistics in front of me&mdash;I am quite sure the cost of living has increased considerably since Fianna Fáil came back as a Government in 1957.  It is true that certain State pensioners have been given compensatory increases in pensions but the point we wish to emphasise in the motion is that in fact those people have not been fully compensated for the increases that have taken place in the cost of living.  The cost of living has gone up and as far as one can judge it is going up every day. If we could arrive at a situation where pension increases could in some way be tacked to the cost of living, it would get over to a large extent the difficulties those people face.  Before that would be of any use, however, it would be necessary, first of all, to build up pension levels to a degree which would enable those people to have some reasonable comfort.</P>
    <P>I hope that in speaking to the motion the Minister will not adopt the line I am afraid he will adopt of pointing to the difficulties of a new Minister coming into the Department of Finance of implementing a motion of this sort which may involve the raising of new moneys.  We appreciate those difficulties and we are prepared to <Col N="1476" /> face them if the Minister will do the same.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is with a feeling of pleasure that I rise to support the motion.  Any motion that has as its aim the alleviation of human distress and suffering is worthy of the consideration and the active support of all sides of the House, especially the Government side, on which devolves the obligation to implement measures to render assistance of this kind.  The Government Party have consistently maintained that any worthwhile improvements that have taken place for the benefit of the social welfare classes, especially the social welfare assistance classes, have come from them alone, particularly in recent years.  They have claimed that they brought about increases in most other types of pensions as well.  They tried to convey the conviction that the Fianna Fáil Government Party are overflowing with the milk of human kindness, always showing a deeply ingrained regard for those sections in the community against whom the winds of adversity blow hardest, especially the old aged, the widows and the orphans.</P>
      <P>Whatever regard previous Governments may have had for those categories of unfortunate people in the past, anyone who takes the slightest interest in the present position of the old age pensioners must come to one conclusion, that never in the history of this State have a Government been guilty of such flagrant neglect, and such a total disregard for the condition of those particular people, the non-contributory classes of widows and old aged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is evident from the kind of means tests which are applied.  In the Budget of last year, when a much lauded increase in social welfare benefits was announced, we were appalled to learn that associated with that particular increase, there was a stipulation that a means test applied.  Only those people whose income did not exceed £26 5s a year would benefit by the increase.  This was a pretty rigid means test.  Anybody whose income exceeded approximately 10/- per week would not get this increase in pension.  Those <Col N="1477" /> means tests are applied rigorously and most searchingly by the various staff officers attached to the Department of Social Welfare who investigate, in minute detail, the private affairs of those pensioners.  They quickly assess income and quickly decide whether a person's income is in excess of the limit set out in the means test applicable. Last year the means test figure was £26 5s. a year.</P>
    <P>A very large section of the social welfare assistance classes were deprived of that increase.  Mind you, the thing which I object to most of all is the false, misleading and hypocritical manner in which those increases are lauded by the Government Party at the time they are announced.  At Budget time, in particular, one might have substantial increases in taxation, whether by way of turnover tax or purchase tax, increases in the price of beer, cigarettes and even on the essentials of life, but as a cover up we usually get banner headlines about a 5/- increase for the social welfare classes, especially the classes to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>It is only when we get down to discuss the details of the measure to give effect to the implementation of those increases that we come across the niggardly means test which is applied and which has the effect in a very large measure of negativing the increase proposed.  This is hypocritical and fraudulent on the part of the Government.  They conceal the fact that by the application of a rigid means test, the increase is of benefit to only a small percentage.</P>
    <P>This was demonstrated most particularly in the Budgets of this year.  We had two Budgets this year.  In the first, we had a 5/- increase for those social welfare assistance classes, the non-contributory classes, only to find that there went with this increase a means test, which was more rigid and more niggardly than the means test of last year in that it stated that the 5/-increase was applicable only to those persons who could be proved to have no means whatsoever.  This was, most assuredly, a disgraceful piece of legislation.</P>
    <P>The number of people who have <Col N="1478" /> benefited by the 5/- increase is infinitesimal. Indeed, we have the figures to prove it.  I asked, together with other Deputies, a question of the Minister for Social Welfare on 17th instant as to the number of persons who benefited from the 5/- increase in non-contributory social welfare payments. The answer was that the total number receiving the maximum old age non-contributory pension on 31st October, 1966 was calculated at 73,100.  So far the number who have qualified for the old age pension increase of 5/-, comprising those who have no means assessed against them, is 10,074.  Only 10,074 persons qualify as against an acknowledged number of 73,100 persons in receipt of old age non-contributory pensions.  If ever a fraud was perpetrated on those old people, the most necessitous in our society, this was it.</P>
    <P>This was fraud with a vengeance. To purport to give this relatively small increase of 5/- and to negative it altogether by the application of a means test, which meant that only those who were proved to have no means would benefit from it, was surely the most despicable thing ever done to those unfortunate people. Many thousands of those pensioners have been calling on their public representatives within the past few weeks asking why they did not get the 5/- increase.  Over 60,000 old age pensioners are asking the question: &ldquo;Why did I, as an old age non-contributory pensioner, not get the 5/-increase which the Fianna Fáil Government promised me in one of the two Budgets of this year?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Those people have not got this increase and will not get it.  They do not realise that it was filched from them the very day it was granted to them by the application of this means test. Only those who are completely and utterly destitute, without help, shelter and food, can hope to get this 5/-increase; only those who are living virtually by the side of the road can hope to get it at the present time. Certainly many of them who are domiciled in houses and dwellings proper will have assessed against them money for shelter.  That will have the <Col N="1479" /> effect straight away of disqualifying them.</P>
    <P>We extend to all those thousands of unfortunate people our sympathy and our understanding of their sorry plight.  We extend to them our sympathy in their utter dismay and disappointment at the confidence trick played on them by the Government and we assure them of our desire to improve their lot to the greatest extent possible, not merely by 5/- but by very much more, because the rate of pension applicable to these categories at 47/6 per week is hardly sufficient to keep body and soul together.  At most it provides a subsistence level of existence for these people and God help any of them who are living alone without friends or relations to come to their assistance. We know of them and we know the privation and suffering they are enduring. This 47/6 is totally inadequate, in these times of high cost of living, to maintain a person.  The meagre pension is spent within a few days and these grand old people are living on bread and tea&mdash;mainly dry bread&mdash; until Friday comes again.  Meat and eggs and other nourishing foods which they need, and to which they are entitled, are out of the question.  It is to be greatly deplored, therefore, that at a time when these people need the active understanding and support of a humane, Christian Government it has been denied to them, in a most callous manner on this occasion.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to join with Deputy Fitzpatrick, Deputy O'Higgins and others in pleading for a better deal for these categories of people.  I appeal to the Government to end this kind of confidence trick and to end the means tests which deprive so many of what they are entitled to and what they were hoping for and expecting from the Government.  The Government's cheese-paring attitude at the expense of the ordinary poor was demonstrated again in recent months in regard to the reciprocal agreement between ourselves and the British Government in regard to British pensioners here.  We were very pleased to see this reciprocal <Col N="1480" /> agreement evolved in order to ensure that Irish people who are in receipt of British pensions, be they army pensions, retirement pensions or widows' pensions, could receive the increases which were granted in these pensions from time to time.  This Party was proud to have played some part in bringing about that agreement between our Minister and his counterpart in Great Britain.</P>
    <P>However, we never thought it would have such serious repercussions for the people we sought to help, the people whose standard of living we sought to improve by means of this agreement. We sought nothing more than to ensure that the £1 increase which Mr. Harold Wilson conceded to his people when he entered office some time ago would be applied to Irish pensioners here.  This was done as a result of the reciprocal agreement but again the vicious means test came into operation. Social welfare officers rampaged about the country and besieged the homes of these British pensioners and those of them in receipt of Irish pensions were peremptorily told to send back their books to the Department of Social Welfare.  The number of people in receipt of British pensions whose Irish pensions were reduced by an average of 30/- is on record in this House. Moreover, in the majority of cases, the Irish pensions were withdrawn altogether.  Quite a large number of these pensioners lost their Irish pensions which, you might say, averaged £2 7s 6d a week because the British Government had given them an increase of £1 in their pensions.</P>
    <P>No words of mine could ever convey to the House the feelings of disappointment, shock and dismay which these categories of people experienced when this transpired.  That because an increase was given by an allegedly foreign country, their Irish pensions should have been interfered with in this tyrannical fashion, reduced drastically or withdrawn, is something which in many cases they cannot comprehend and it is impossible for public representatives to explain what has happened to these unfortunate people. They are still abjectly bewildered by what has been done to them by this <Col N="1481" /> Government.  These are two instances of the outright callousness of this regime in dealing with the poorest of the poor and yet we have the pretence that they and they alone were the Party who did anything worthwhile for these, the least well-off of our community.</P>
    <P>The same could be said in regard to the Old IRA men.  This was an important year in our lives, the fiftieth anniversary of the 1916 Rising.  We celebrated it with a flourish of trumpets, with parades and much ado on the television, on the radio and in the press. We suitably honoured all those who participated in this great event but we seem to forget that quite a lot of these people are still with us.  They are not living in opulence.  Some of them failed to jump on to any political bandwagon; they failed to achieve opulence and security and many of them are living in extremely poor circumstances. I know of a 1916 man about whom I had to ask a question in this House.  He is living in an outhouse in the most destitute circumstances.  He was proved to have participated actively and genuinely in the 1916 Insurrection but the reply I got from the Minister for Defence at the time was, to say the very least, most unsatisfactory, that this man could seek home assistance if he was as badly off as suggested.</P>
    <P>This was the year in which we could have honoured those Old IRA men who participated in the War of Independence in 1916 and in 1921 and 1922.  We might have done this appropriately by seeking out those who are most in need and increasing their miserable pensions.  I have in mind particularly those Old IRA men who have been proved to have had active service during the War of Independence and who have been issued with the service medal for active service. These were people who were proved to have little means, because one had to be of little means to be granted an Old IRA special allowance because a pretty rigid means test goes with this pension.</P>
    <P>We had hoped, therefore, that an improvement would take place in the lot of these people but again the means test was applied with a vengeance <Col N="1482" /> and, to my knowledge, a very large number of recipients of Old IRA special allowances have had these allowances reduced drastically on one ground or another.  Perhaps it was because they had an income from another source, but if their income exceeded £3 a week, they certainly suffered a steep reduction in the Old IRA special allowances.  This showed scant respect for these men who had made possible the partial freedom we enjoy today.  They made it possible for us to exercise our right to stand up here in a national Parliament representative of the people of at least 26 of our counties.  We should have availed of this opportunity to pay tribute to them more fittingly and to ensure that they could at least live out their last years in frugal comfort. Many of them are not in frugal comfort&mdash;far from it.  Many of them, to our knowledge, are in deplorable circumstances; many are dying in the county homes, as can be verified, bereft of succour and support from the Government they helped to put in power in the kind of democracy we possess and which they helped to create.  This is a year of grace: the Government might have acted more generously in respect of these people.</P>
    <P>I want to mention other categories of pensioners for whom we could make a case in great detail.  I do not want to take up too much of the limited time available on a motion of this kind but I want to mention certain other categories of pensioners such as CIE pensioners about whom we have heard a lot in recent weeks and about whom more will be said on the Estimate for the Department of Transport and Power which is still being debated. I want to mention also retired gardaí, teachers, nurses and public servants. These are all categories of pensioners who are unable to engender the kind of support required to make an impact on the Minister or the Government in respect of their plight or who are not sufficiently organised or sufficiently strong numerically to impose their will on any Minister or Government. They are not members of a trade union and, consequently, if we in this House do not have regard to them <Col N="1483" /> and help them, clearly they cannot help themselves.</P>
    <P>I am not aware that old age pensioners are organised in any group sufficiently strong to make their voices felt here.  They are certainly unable to march as many other groups do, and similarly with the Old IRA, retired gardaí, national teachers, nurses and various strata of State servants.  These are people we should think of in relation to high prices and high cost of living and we should have regard to the fact that their incomes have been eroded in recent years to a very large extent as a direct result of Government policy in increasing the cost of living. The main increases in the cost of living have come about as a direct result of Government action.  The implementation of the penal turnover tax sent the cost of living spiralling.  Instead of the 2½ per cent increase which it was stated here would be the outcome, we have had a rise that is nearer to ten per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope I am not taking too much time.  The standards of these categories of pensioners we are now seeking to assist were deliberately lowered by Government policy in increasing the cost of living.  The introduction of the turnover tax, as has been proved, opened the door to every exploiter and extortioner to rob the people and to apply almost any increase in price they liked.  The prices control which we pleaded with the Government to introduce, and which is now being introduced in a most halfhearted manner, is proving ineffective. We have had the silly situation in which everybody was crying about the fall in the price of cattle while we all know that the price of meat to the old age pensioner or the housewife has not fallen by even a fraction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy will understand that while the motion speaks of pensions and pensioners in very general terms, only the pensions payable to <Col N="1484" /> those who have retired from the public service are immediately and directly under my control.  I was certain that this motion was directed to public service pensions in general rather than to old age pensions which have been discussed.  If I had known that the motion was intended to refer especially to old age pensioners, I should have asked the Minister for Social Welfare to deal with it in the House.</P>
      <P>On the question of old age pensions, I can only refer Deputies to the very full and comprehensive statement which the Minister for Social Welfare made in the Dáil on 20th October when winding up the debate on his Estimate. He then dealt very fully with the whole situation in regard to old age pensions and social welfare benefits generally. He explained the Government's position, their anxiety to be as generous as possible, and he pointed to the records of the past six or seven years and showed that between 1959 and 1966, a considerable improvement had taken place, relatively speaking, and that social welfare benefits, including the old age pension, have been increased substantially greater than any increases that have taken place in the cost of living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To come to public service pensions, I do not think I need remind the House that the annual cost of these pensions is very substantial indeed, and I think it would be accepted by most fairminded people that the pension terms which are enjoyed by people in the public service here are reasonably adequate, especially when their pension is compared with that of persons in outside employment.  Many of those people in outside employment are not entitled to a pension on retirement at all and the vast majority of them who have pensions have them on very much less favourable terms than public service pensions.  For instance, outside the public service, pensions are very rarely based on the final retiring salary.  They are generally calculated on average earnings over a stated period of service, whereas in our public service, the pension is related, as a general rule, to the salary on the actual date of retirement.  That is a fairly <Col N="1485" /> important advantage, especially if, as in recent years, substantial increases in salary occur on an average over two or three years, but it is also something which makes it very expensive for the employer, in this case the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>In Britain most civil servants' pensions are based on the average salary for the last three years of employment, and in other countries the same position applies generally.  It is, therefore, true to say that the pensions which are enjoyed by Irish public servants are as favourable, at least, as those enjoyed by similar employees elsewhere, indeed in many cases much more favourable. We would all agree that the £ today will not buy anything like as much as it would have some years ago and, of course, this affects the earnings in regard to long term contracts; even short term employment contract earnings are affected where the market prices have risen much less than the average.</P>
    <P>In the case of public service pensioners, we have not refused to assist them to meet the increased cost of living.  They have, in fact, been given pension increases whenever there has been a marked fall in the value of money which would cause them hardship or which would be likely to lead to a considerable reduction in their standard of living.  In considering any pension increase, the Minister for Finance of the day must have regard to the extra cost of the increases and also to the position of people outside the public service.  The record shows that increases have been given in public service pensions fairly regularly during the past ten years, and the last such increase was just over 12 months ago. Any further increase to pensioners would require an immediate increase in taxation as it was not possible to provide any money for this purpose in this year's Budget.</P>
    <P>Quite apart from the undesirable effects on the economy of any further increases in taxation, there is this additional objection which Deputies should keep in mind, that is, that many taxpayers themselves are living on fixed incomes, incomes that are not adjusted or adjustable to changes in the value of money.  For instance, <Col N="1486" /> there are people on pensions who have retired from industry and commerce in the outside world, and there are self-employed persons.  If we were to increase taxation to increase public service pensions, we would be doing an injustice to this type of person.</P>
    <P>I am sure Deputies will recall that in 1964 my predecessor established a committee to examine the principles involved in granting increases, with particular reference to the cost of making such increases and their consequences in relation to other superannuation schemes and social welfare benefits.  In the report which was presented to the House in May of last year, the committee recommended that pensions be increased sufficiently to compensate for increases in the consumer price index from the dates of the general rounds of pay increases to which pensions are currently related up to the date of the most recent pay increase.  In the case of pensions based on eighth and pre-eighth round salaries, the committee recommended they should be increased sufficiently to compensate for the increase in the consumer price index to February 1964.  Future increases should be given only when a general pay increase was being granted to serving personnel in all categories.  The percentage increase in these pensions should not exceed that granted in pay.  The committee recommended that future pensions should be based on pay averaging over the last three years of service instead of on the actual date of retirement to which I have already referred.</P>
    <P>The increases that have been granted to date have compensated pensioners for the rise in the cost of living at February, 1964, the date of the ninth round pay increase.  Those who retired before the eighth round have had their pensions based on the seventh round plus 14½ per cent.  Those who received the benefit of the eighth round have received a nine per cent increase.  There has been no general pay increase since February, 1964, of the type which the committee envisaged should give rise to a general pay increase.</P>
    <P>My predecessor stated when he was speaking in this House on 18th July, 1962, that what we have been endeavouring <Col N="1487" /> to do in relation to pension increases is to disburse whatever money it may be possible to make available within the limits of the Budgetary conditions, to make good the depreciation in the value of money caused by the rise in the cost of living, and any further steps which it may be possible to take will be in that same direction, subject also to Budgetary considerations. As Deputies know, this has been a particularly difficult year financially. All that could be provided in the Budget last March was about £250,000 and that has had to be given to the section of the community which seemed worst off, those with no means or who are in receipt of non-contributory old age, blind and widows' pensions and unemployment assistance</P>
    <P>It is all very well for Deputy Treacy and others to weep profusely over the old age pensioner, but at least the Minister for Social Welfare, on this occasion, allocated the very limited sum of money that could be given to him to those in the community who were in most need, that is, the people with no means.  I have not the slightest doubt, as the Minister for Social Welfare has indicated, he would have preferred to do a great deal more but in so far as he had only this sum of money available he took the right decision in regard to it.</P>
    <P>I do not think any Deputy would reasonably suggest that I should bring in a third Budget at this stage to give increases to public service pensioners or to anybody else.  I do not want anybody to think I am unsympathetic to pensioners.  I agree with Deputies who have spoken about this, that they are a section of the community for whom the Government must have a special concern and regard because they are not able to fight their own case, perhaps, with the same vigour and energy as other sections.  In the overwhelming majority of cases, they have given loyal and faithful service to the community and are entitled, I think we would all agree, in their old age, to be adequately catered for.  But, whereas I give that indication and assurance of the Government's concern for these categories, I am afraid that, at this <Col N="1488" /> stage, in this financial year, there is nothing concrete or immediate that can be done.  We just have not got the necessary revenue to do anything.  So, for that reason, I must regretfully ask the House to reject this motion.</P>

      <P>No, naturally; I am a good man.  Some of the points that Deputy Treacy made this evening were the peak points of my argument.  I referred to non-contributory old age pensioners and Old IRA medal holders.  Nobody can accuse these of being people with huge pensions.  I realise that the motion covers State pensioners of all kinds.  While I am interested in CIE men and various other pensioners, I think a start should be made where it is most needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember speaking on behalf of the Labour Party on this subject some ten years ago.  The Minister has asked where is the extra money to come from to give these people an increase. It is a very fair question.  The Labour Party have repeatedly suggested a tax on a luxury item, such as wine, tobacco, perfume&mdash;some specific thing. Supposing you were to put an extra 6d on 20 cigarettes and, by regulation, imposed the duty on the tobacco manufacturer to enclose within the cellophane wrapper a tax receipt for 6d, which would be specifically donated to non-contributory old age pensioners, I am quite sure that there would be no revolution in the country. If you wanted to do so, that could be extended to drink.  If a specific tax were put on a bottle of whiskey or any other spirits, even visitors to the country would be contributing and I am quite sure they would have no great objection.  Tourists from Great Britain would not be paying any more <Col N="1489" /> here than they are paying in Great Britain.  In Britain, the tax is specifically for the purpose of social welfare benefits.</P>
    <P>Why is it that this Government think that 47/6d a week is sufficient to keep a man or woman living alone, with no other means, in fuel, light, clothing and food.  I would hate to face that kind of prospect.  In my view, this is criminal.  I believe that a hoax was perpetrated by the Taoiseach when he was Minister for Finance in promising 111,000 people 5/- a week increase from 5th November.  We are now informed by the Department of Social Welfare that only 10,000 of these people qualify.  Surely somebody knew there was something wrong there?</P>
    <P>As I have already suggested, there is the urgent need for the Minister for Social Welfare to bring out a new book of rules indicating to Deputies and to the public their alleged rights. Most of us do not know where we are because things are changing so rapidly and promises are made that something is to take effect six months or eight months later.  That is a new trick.  In the old days, on Budget day, people were told they were getting an increase or that they were not getting an increase.  Now there are delay tactics by the Government and people are told they will get an increase in eight months, in arrear.  It is the lowest form of political bluff I have ever seen that 111,000 people were promised 5/-a week increase on 5th November and only 10,000 of them have qualified. Can anyone tell me who qualifies or how did the 10,000 qualify?</P>
    <P>Deputy James Tully asked an after-Mass meeting if there was any old age pensioner in the crowd who got a 5/- increase or anyone who knew an old age pensioner who got a 5/- a week increase and, if so, would he put up his hand.  There was not one.  I asked the same question throughout the constituency.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand the reason for this behaviour on the part of the Government. What gain was there in it? They led people to believe that an increase would be granted and then shattered their illusions.  Many of the old age pensioners concerned have <Col N="1490" /> gone into debt in anticipation of the increase.  I do not think that is reasonable government or that it is fair, even politically.  It is a disgusting thing.</P>
    <P>On the question of the Old IRA men, I heard the Minister talking about a percentage increase on a three-yearly basis, as in the case of retiring civil servants.  Under the last increase, Old IRA men got £4 for the year.  Was that a percentage increase?  I suggest that it was an insult to these people who formed the State.  I had not any hand, act or part in it.  I was too young.  I am not speaking for any particular person.  I am speaking for the people in my area who served the State.  Maybe they were not in active service during the days between April and July; maybe they were not actively engaged on those dates but they were there if they were called on and they were there on many occasions standing watch while some of the people with big names in this country were sleeping safely and soundly guarded by these people.  Surely these people are entitled to some consideration?</P>
    <P>All old age pensioners, and non-contributory pensioners in particular, are being badly treated and I pledge, as I pledged ten years ago on behalf of the Labour Party here in the House, that if any Government, be they Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil or any other, bring in taxation to improve the lot of the pensioners, they will not find a single Labour man opposing it, provided that we know it is on a luxury, something that is not essential&mdash;not tea, bread, butter, sugar or that type of thing, not foodstuffs or clothing&mdash;but drink, entertainment, cinemas, dances, tobacco or cigarettes&mdash;any of these things.  We will support that.  Or if you can invent a newer tax on top-hats or something like that, we will not worry.  We will support without question any tax on luxury spending.</P>
    <P>When Naas races are held, it is an ordeal to get through the dual carriageway. I do not go to races.  I have not sufficient money.  But there is a lot of money spent that could be got at.  I know the bloodstock business is a good business in Ireland.  But there are lots <Col N="1491" /> of things, games in particular.  I know games are good for the people taking part in them, but I am not so sure if they are good for the people looking at them.  If the people looking at them want to enjoy them, I see no reason why they could not contribute 3d or 6d towards the comfort of people who served this country well until deprived of the means of keeping themselves. They never got a wage during their lifetime which would enable them to save something for a rainy day.  There is no such thing as compulsory retirement here.  We are beginning to think of it now with the contributory old age pension.  We should have done so long ago.  Apart from the agricultural group, they are a dwindling body.  It should be possible to provide them with a reasonable pension even for their remaining years.</P>
    <P>I am chairman of an old age pensions sub-committee.  Unless three of us turn up, any application for an old age pension, no matter how long delayed it is, cannot be dealt with.  We attend on a voluntary basis.  We get no travelling expenses, not that I would qualify because we meet in my town. For county council meetings, health authority meetings, vocational education meetings, there is a shilling a mile; but for the old age pensioners, the people looking for charity, you do not bother with them.  Let the voluntary workers come if they want to.  If they do not come, let these poor people wait, no matter how hungry they are. Let them go to St. Vincent de Paul or the home assistance.  Can the Minister deny that that is the attitude of the Government?</P>
    <P>This is not a flight of imagination on my part.  I know what I am talking about.  I deal with these people every day of the week, every week of the year.  The investigating officer may disagree with the decision of the committee. We reason with him and try to explain to him.  I remember one case where we pointed out that even if the applicant did get £500 eight years ago as a result of being knocked down by a car, he did not earn much during those eight years.  He had to withdraw <Col N="1492" /> some of it and use it.  But, because he did not lodge it in the bank, because he could not prove where it went, he is still assessed with the interest on £500.  He appeals the case and it goes to an appeals officer.  A Deputy or somebody else makes a reasonable case on his behalf.  The case then goes to a deciding officer.  Without hearing anyone, without discussing it, this deciding officer can say: &ldquo;He is not getting it&rdquo;.  In social welfare contributory benefit, there is a tribunal on which the worker is represented and where he can plead his case.  In respect of social welfare sickness benefit an inspector is sent down and the applicant has the right to be represented either by a Deputy or his trade union.  At least, the matter can be discussed.  But in the case of the old age pension there is only the deciding officer, somebody in Dublin even Deputies are forbidden to approach.  He decides without any investigation other than the written word, which is mainly based on what the investigating officer says.</P>
    <P>Surely there is something wrong with the whole system of non-contributory old age pension investigation of and decision on claims?  I certainly feel there is.  I have intervened only for the sake of this particular group.  I realise CIE are a semi-State body.  My main grievance is that, because the pensioner qualifies for an old age pension of some sort, CIE immediately reduce his pension.  Deputy Treacy has referred to the agreement between Britain and Ireland in respect of the increases granted over a number of years to people who worked in Britain, earned their pension and came over here to live.  I took no small part in that.  Anyone who looks at the Dáil records for the past five years will see that I have been continuously prodding the Minister.  I have also been in touch with British MPs of my own union who did the same prodding when they had a Conservative Government. It was a matter of no small pride to me that I had a small part, as a Labour representative, in a Labour Government in Britain conceding to those people, who had served Britain in the past either by working or fighting for her, the same opportunities as the <Col N="1493" /> British people have.  But the Irish Government had to come along and, for the sake of about £150,000, be so cheap that they took from these people almost as much as they got from the British Government and made their position just as bad as it was before.</P>
    <P>Surely this Government were not that beaten for money that they had to attack the humblest section of our community, or were they?  I would prefer to see them reduce the salaries and expenses of Deputies if they were that stranded.  Those who have least seem to suffer most under the present Government.  Certainly, if a Labour Government did that, I would say the same thing about it.  I do not believe in it and I would not be party to it. This motion is an appeal to the Minister. I join with the Fine Gael Party who put it down, not on a Party issue but purely on a humanitarian issue. Even if the Minister has to bring in a third Budget, he should bring it in on the basis I have suggested and give these people, particularly the non-contributory social welfare group, something reasonable that will make it possible for them to offset the increase in the cost of living.</P>

      <P>I support this motion.  This subject has been discussed on numerous occasions on Private Members' motions in this House in recent times.  Every Deputy will agree that one of the most tragic things he meets in his constituency is the number of people dependent on pensions to provide the necessaries of life.  We are all aware of how inadequate in most cases these pensions are.  I believe that the vast majority of pensioners in this country are the victims of pensions schemes which are unjust and inequitable and that the pensions they are receiving are totally inadequate to meet the cost of living.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to delay the Minister or the House. <Col N="1494" /> I should like to say just a few brief words concerning this, as I regard it, most important matter of export promotion. There is no doubt whatsoever that the question of exports has been an important factor in the national economy but, in the years ahead and particularly in the immediate future, the question of export promotion will assume new importance.  From what I know of Córas Tráchtála, it has been doing a reasonably good job.  However, I am not at all satisfied that Córas Tráchtála as at present constituted and within its present framework is adequate to meet the intense competition which lies ahead.  Particularly, I believe the time has now come when an entirely new approach will have to be adopted towards this question of export promotion and I think that a much more dynamic aggressive policy is called for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel that the exports promotion board has much to learn, particularly in dynamic sales promotion, market research and market development, from the methods and the techniques which have so successfully been applied by our dairy produce export board.  I think I read a speech by the Minister over the past few days in which he more or less issued a warning to certain firms that they would have to gear themselves up: perhaps he was talking in a different context.  However, I feel there are certain firms in this country whose products have a potential on the export market but that somehow these firms have not gone about investigating or securing the markets.  I feel that to a certain number of firms, perhaps to many firms, Córas Tráchtála is merely a name and that perhaps there is a need for the exports board to maintain closer contact with the various industrial firms to make our industrialists aware of the facilities and the services provided by the board.  I do not rise to be critical.  I appreciate the work that Córas Tráchtála has done but I avail myself of this opportunity to suggest to the Minister that perhaps he should take a closer look at Córas Tráchtála to see if the existing structure can be modified and improved so that Córas Tráchtála can be geared to attack this vitally important question of exports <Col N="1495" /> promotion in a much more dynamic and progressive manner.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Colley) George Colley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is gratifying, I think, that speakers from all sides of the House, in referring to Córas Tráchtála have been at pains to point out that they felt it was doing a good job and trying hard to do a good job.  This, indeed, is my own impression and it is the impression I have received from conversation I have had with a number of industrialists in various industries. They all feel that the staff of Córas Tráchtála are very dedicated to their work and give an excellent service.</P>
      <P>There are people who feel that perhaps some of the services provided by Córas Tráchtála in the past are not now as necessary as they were and that there may be other services they could now give which they are not giving. This is something that will always bear examination.  I think a body such as Córas Tráchtála should regularly review its whole activities in the light of current circumstances and, in fact, I believe they do this.</P>
      <P>A number of suggestions in regard to activities in which Córas Tráchtála do not indulge were based, I think, on a misconception in regard to the functions of Córas Tráchtála.  The last such suggestion came from Deputy T. O'Donnell who suggested that Córas Tráchtála might approach its business more on the lines of An Bord Bainne but there is a very big difference in the two functions.  An Bord Bainne are selling a particular product and they have a brand name.  They are in the same position as an Irish manufacturer going in to sell his product. Córas Tráchtála has a different function which is to assess markets, to try to achieve introductions into markets, to aid such things as the mounting of a trade display and shows in various department stores but they are trying to find the smooth way into the market for the man who is actually selling.  This is a vital distinction between their activities and the activities of An Bord Bainne.  I think a number of suggestions made here today have been based on this misconception.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1496" /> I have heard some people suggest that Córas Tráchtála may be going too far in spoonfeeding some of our exporters.  I do not know whether this is so.  I know that many exporters appreciate very much the services they give in instructing them on the kind of documentation necessary to get their goods into various markets abroad.  I understand that they issue a loose-leaf folder containing relevant information which may be added to from time to time when they issue new sheets so as to keep the exporter up to date.  They are vital if exporters are to do their job properly.  They must pay attention to this small but very important item. Córas Tráchtála are providing a very good service in this regard.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave talked about the small number of firms in this country engaged in exports.  I understand that there are approximately 700 exporters, of whom 100 represent the vast bulk of our exports: I am speaking now of industrial exports.  I agree that, on the face of it, this seems a very small base on which to be dependent.  I was surprised when I went into this to discover that in fact the propoetion involved is considerably better than that in a number of other countries, including, I think, the United States.  It is a very surprising thing in that so many countries should have such a narrow base for their exports which are so vital to them.  This appears to be the pattern and our preparation seems to be a good deal better than that of other countries.  Nevertheless, I should like to see it extended because we, more than any other country, are dependent on foreign trade.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is necessary, or that it should be necessary, at this stage in this House to stress the importance of exports in our national economy.  We are all well aware of this.  What is not always so clearly realised is the importance of exports with our industrialists in their individual firms.  The position is that with the advent of free trade, many of our industrialists will find themselves competing on the home market, as they now have to compete on the export market.  To the extent that they can achieve exports, they can <Col N="1497" /> achieve economies in production which will enable them to hold on to their base in the home market and that will give them the confidence and the morale which comes from knowing one is competing successfully on international markets.  That is of great importance to them if they are to achieve success.</P>
    <P>I believe that in our present circumstances our exporters who are in the front line of battle, not only for success but for survival, are not accorded sufficient status, sufficient respect and sufficient honour, whether they are large or small.  It may be said, of course, that they are making money on their exports.  I hope they are.  But, whether they are or not, I feel strongly that we could all examine our consciences and perhaps find that we have not given sufficient status and respect to our exporters who are, in fact, maintaining the standard of living of this country on a level far higher than we could hope to achieve if they were not doing the work they are doing. They are our main hope for a rising standard of living in the future.  If one accepts this is so, one would accept that they deserve more honour from us as a community than we have tended to give them.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the Kilkenny Design Workshop.  I want to say that I consider that the work done has been extremely valuable and that it will prove to be very much more valuable in the future.  Deputy Cosgrave referred to the fact that he did not think it was yet paying its way. This is true, but this is not what it was set up for.  It could pay its way purely on commercial production.  It does a small amount of commercial production and makes some money.  However, it was set up to make design.  If it were set up for commercial purposes, it could pay its way but it would not be doing the job for which it was set up.</P>
    <P>For some time past, this project has been concentrating on trade products in connection with an export promotion drive which will take place in the New Year in the United States.  It was necessary to do this to ensure the success of this particular project; but this is outside its function, which should <Col N="1498" /> be more widespread.  It has been successful in reviving some crafts which were dying out in this country.  As a result of this, the people concerned have found very valuable export markets in crafts that were about to die.  I believe the Kilkenny Design Workshop will prove to be of tremendous importance to us in the future. For this reason, I have made arrangements to have more intensive effort put into the work of the Kilkenny Design Workshop.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy James Tully in saying that ultimately selling abroad depends on the individual firm or business. This, of course, is true, and this is the point I was trying to make at the beginning.  It is not the function of Córas Tráchtála and if Deputies would realise what the functions of Córas Tráchtála are, as I explained at the outset, they would have a clearer picture of what Córas Tráchtála are trying to do and how far they are achieving that objective.  I am satisfied they are going close to achieving the objectives they have set.  We, of course, will never be satisfied they are doing a one hundred per cent job but I think they are doing an extremely good job and will continue to do so.  They will, of course, review their functions from time to time to bring them into line with any changes that may come about.</P>
    <P>I am not aware of the complaints that seem to have been suggested by Deputy James Tully, that complaints have been made that Córas Tráchtála has advised on markets that do not exist.  He did not say that but what he said amounted to that.  I do not think there is any truth in it.  He did mention the furniture industry.  While it has a long way to go, it is one of our more hopeful success stories.  The CIO report indicated very little hope for the furniture industry.  As a result of the work of the adaptation council, the industry is now on the way to achieving exports.  It has a long way to go but there is still hope for it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully said something which he says he said before and I do not think it is true.  He said our Embassies abroad do not serve Irish whiskey.  I do not drink Irish whiskey but I do think they serve it.</P>

I am tempted to follow him, but I do not think I will, except to say that it seems to me the Fine Gael Party have a genius for being right at the wrong time: they are right about free trade now but they were advocating it at a time when it would have been wrong. I mention this as an example.  Deputy O'Hara seems to think that we in Fianna Fáil have thrown away all the markets we had in Britain.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Seán Dunne spoke about the situation which is impending in regard to free trade under our Agreement with Britain and our, I hope, impending entry to the EEC.  I am sorry he is not in the House for my reply.  He talked about all the dangers involved as, indeed, he was quite entitled to do.  There are dangers involved.  I myself have spoken about the necessity to prepare for this situation but I believe that we can deal with this situation and can come out of it very much better off than we are now if we deal with it now.  But Deputy Dunne talked about it as through we could not deal with it and seemed, to me at least, to be implying that the Labour Party was totally opposed to the whole idea of entry into the Common Market.  At no stage when he talked in this vein did he offer any alternatives.  He tells us what the difficulties are, and we know them, but he did not tell us what alternative was available to us.  It seems to me that it is time that Deputy Dunne and his colleagues and his Party came <Col N="1500" /> down off the fence and if they are against going into the EEC, let them give us a viable alternative.  If they are for it, let them use their influence to insure that we do prepare for entry.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to a speech I made recently in which I expressed concern about a number of managements who had made no effort whatever to adapt in preparation for entry into EEC.  I also said in that speech &mdash;though I was not reported, I think, as doing so, so I am not blaming any Deputy for not referring to this&mdash; that this did not apply only to management but that it applied to the workers as well.  It seems to me that Deputy Dunne and his colleagues would be doing a much better day's work for Ireland if, instead of ologóning about the dismal prospects for us without offering any alternative, they would ensure that the idea gets across that workers and management must prepare for this and must do it now.  If it is not done now, it will be too late, but we can do it now.</P>
    <P>Management has been at fault in certain industries in not making any effort to modernise or adapt, in some cases to merge or amalgamate, but unions have been at fault also in holding on to restrictive practices, in not insuring that we get the maximum output and efficiency from our efforts. This applies to both sides, and unless we prepare to work as a team in meeting this challenge, we will be in trouble, but we can, if we work as a team, surmount it.  I firmly believe this and that is why I said what I said recently and what I am saying now.</P>
    <P>I think the Labour Party could, with advantage, consider the position. Deputy Dunne said that he now regarded as inevitable that we were going to, as he put it, &ldquo;go hand-in-hand with Britain wherever she went and this was probably into the Common Market&rdquo;. I shall not go over that ground with him but if his Party accept that this is inevitable, I would appeal to them to use their influence in so far as they can do so, to see that all sectors of industry, workers and management, become conscious of what is involved and being conscious of it, take such action as is open to them.  There is a lot of <Col N="1501" /> action open to them to see that we are as well geared as we possibly can be to meet the competition which is coming. If they do that, they will do a good day's work for Ireland and insure that the money, which the House will, I hope, agree should be given to Córas Tráchtála, will be well spent.</P>

      <P>I am sorry for not allowing the Minister to conclude but I believe that what I have to say is of the utmost importance.  Last night, when the Taoiseach was addressing the Árd Fheis, he used words which I am going to employ here: &ldquo;fresh thinking on old problems&rdquo;, particularly having regard to early entry into the EEC which is inevitable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is only one aspect of the Minister's very extensive field which I should like to deal with&mdash;air transport. At the moment we are not allowing foreign airlines into Dublin.  We must be one of the few capital cities of the world into which foreign airlines are not allowed.  Of all the American tourists who come to Ireland, 75 per cent visit Dublin.  I do not believe you can make people go where they do not want to go.  In spite of the fact that the American airlines have only been able to fly into Shannon, many of their passengers have made their way to Dublin in hired <Col N="1502" /> cars.  All the car hire firms had record years and their cars are still touring the country.  All the countries of Europe at the moment are crying out for tourists, literally opening the floodgates to let them in.  We are closing the floodgates by limiting the transatlantic air liners to Shannon.  When Shannon was established, planes had to use it of necessity, as it was the last stop between Europe and America.  Aircraft these days fly nearly halfway around the world without having to refuel.</P>
    <P>I realise that Irish International Airlines are making a profit of £1 million a year which is very good and they are to be congratulated on it, but I believe that in the long run it costs the country much more than that.  For the £2 million or £3 million they make, the country will lose £4 million or £5 million.  It is also a well-known fact that people like to fly by their own national airlines.  They have a strange feeling about this.  Many of the people who fly by Irish International Airlines come from America and are coming to stay with their families.  Many of them do not use hotels at all.  It is well known that the other international airlines are willing to spend a lot of money advertising Ireland.  Irish International Airlines have nine offices throughout the United States, I understand.  Two of the other major airlines, TWA and Pan-American, have 240 offices.  One can imagine the advertising to visit Ireland that goes on from those offices. In fact, one airline is already spending a tremendous amount of money on advertising Ireland, even though they are only allowed to fly into Shannon.</P>
    <P>I believe it is not a good thing to have three directors of the Tourist Board having an interest in either Irish International Airlines or Shannon Airport, and these incidentally include the Director General and the Chairman, who are directors of the Tourist Board and Irish International Airlines or Shannon Airport.  Naturally, whilst Irish International Airlines is making a profit, there is no pressure on the airline to compete with other airlines.  If it <Col N="1503" /> were announced that, by a certain date, American airlines would be allowed to fly into Ireland, I believe there would then be immediate foreign investment in hotels and motels.  I can draw a parallel here with New Zealand.  New Zealand restricted the flight of other airlines into the country.  Other countries retorted by saying: &ldquo;If you do not let us in, then you will not be allowed into our countries&rdquo;.  They were forced in New Zealand to let other international airlines in and, as a result, the figures for tourism have shot up at a tremendous rate.  I have been promised these figures and, as soon as I get them, I shall let the Minister have them.</P>
    <P>The American traveller likes to take in the capitals.  That is a well-known fact.  Americans are not adequately serviced from that point of view through Shannon.  Shannon, of course, is very useful and it will continue to prosper; the industrial estate will ensure that.  There is a service to all parts of Europe from Shannon and I do not believe my suggestion would in any way lessen the traffic into Shannon.  Those who want to take in the whole of Ireland can just as easily start from Shannon as from Dublin, but I know Americans who will not fly on Irish International Airlines because they cannot land in Dublin. They have factories here but they cannot come into Dublin by PanAm or TWA and they, therefore, fly to London and travel by Aer Lingus or BEA to Dublin.  Now we lose as a result of that.  The Tourist Board has given it as its opinion that there would be no advantage to the country in bringing American airlines into Dublin.  The hotels argue that that is not so; they say the return on capital in the hotel business has been below ten per cent and difficulties have been experienced in obtaining investment. The major difficulties in gaining returns on investment are experienced by the traffic flow which is too low.  If development is to grow in the cities or in the country a much greater traffic flow will have to be generated.</P>
    <P>As I have already said, you will get <Col N="1504" /> foreign investment in the country in the building of hotels and motels if these people know they can advertise Ireland with confidence.  I have been told that if we get twice as many tourists as we get at the moment, we would have nowhere to put them.  If that is true, let us announce immediately that four or five years from now we will allow international airlines to fly into Dublin.  A hotel and motel programme will be started immediately.  There is need for fresh thinking.  It is most essential that we should plan now.  I shall delay the House no longer except to say that I should like to pay tribute to the wonderful staffs of Irish International Airlines.  They are doing a tremendous job, particularly in New York, which I visited not so long ago.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I intervene in this debate to indicate once more the interest of the Labour Party in the State bodies for which the Minister has responsibility.  We have persistently urged the necessity for the Government embarking upon the creation of more and more State enterprises.  In an atmosphere of monopoly-capitalism private enterprise is clearly unable or unwilling to do the job, a job which would provide much needed employment for our people.  We have harped time and again on the moral obligation on the shoulders of the Government to intervene directly in the establishment of public bodies of the type we are discussing here tonight.  We are proud of the bodies we have at the moment&mdash;Cómhlucht Siúicre Éireann, Bord na Móna, Irish Shipping, the ESB and even CIE.  These essential services are very largely in the hands of our Minister for Transport and Power and on him devolves the responsibility of ensuring that these State enterprises are brought as near as possible to perfection in order to serve our people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One reason I intervene is to appeal to the Minister to do what he can to bring about a change of policy in relation to the charges made by the ESB for the provision of electric current to consumers.  It is wrong that excessive charges should be laid down by the ESB for providing current.  Because of the charges, potential customers cannot <Col N="1505" /> avail of the current.  The policy pursued is anti-social because it militates against the small farmer, the small householder, the small shopkeeper, the cottier in those areas not yet covered by the ESB.  In a reply to a Parliamentary Question last week, we learned that a sum of from £40 to £500 is required to be paid in advance for the provision of current; recoupment of the deposit paid will be made when circumstances permit.  Such a policy militates against those of little means.  The rich have no difficulty in availing of current because they have no problem in finding a deposit of £100 or £500, as the case may be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>This showed the extent to which the Minister and his Department were bankrupt from the point of view of capital, and that at a time when the ESB had floated a loan, which was oversubscribed, for £4 million.  One wondered where the capital subscribed in this loan went when the ESB were obliged to insist on their consumers paying in advance for electric power. It has been said that the Minister for Finance filched in a very large measure the capital provided in the ESB loan. If that is true, it is to be greatly deplored because this is a State body which required its capital for the extension of its various services and it ought not to have been placed in the humiliating position of having to charge its customers in advance for the provision of power.  It ought not have been <Col N="1506" /> placed in the humiliating position also of having to tell the public representatives in this House that it would be some considerable time before vast areas of our constituencies are supplied with electric power.  I am particularly conversant with the areas in my own constituency which are, as yet, without electric current, large patches of rural areas, some of them populous, crying out for electric power and for which, by reason of alleged shortage of capi tal, the Minister's Department is unable to provide power with the urgency we feel it should be supplied.</P>
      <P>I note, too, that in respect of some of the other State bodies for which the Minister is responsible there would seem to be a lack of initiative and enterprise. This is particularly notable in Bord na Móna where there is evidence of an acute shortage of turf briquettes. This ought not be so in a State company. There is obviously a rare abundance of turf in this country.  We have vast reserves of bogland, as yet, unexploited; we have a vast pool of labour under-utilised, under-employed, and there is no good reason why we should experience an acute shortage of briquettes.  It is all the more alarming when one considers that there was a lay-off of substantial numbers of turf workers this year.  We had to raise questions in this House about the lay-off of turf workers in our various constituencies and I was primarily concerned about the lay-off of a large number of men in the bogs at Littleton, part of which converges on my constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would seem to us, therefore, that there is a lack of proper administration in Bord na Móna, when we are suffering shortages of the produce of the bog, such as turf and briquettes on the one hand, and experiencing the redundancy and under-employment of bogworkers on the other.  This is flagrant inconsistency which the Minister ought not tolerate.  He ought to insist that the Board utilise their plant, machinery and manpower to the fullest possible extent, that there ought not be redundancy at various times of the year particularly when, in the long run, we experience shortages of <Col N="1507" /> briquettes.  This is a fuel which has become very popular of late, is much in demand by housewives, and there is an obligation on the Minister and Bord na Móna to ensure that it is made available: furthermore, that the various agencies responsible for distributing the briquettes should increase to the greatest possible extent.</P>
    <P>It has come to my knowledge that there is restriction in the distribution end with regard to briquettes.  The distributors would seem to be limited to a small select group of people in various towns and cities and the average fuel merchant, village grocer or small shopkeeper, who now like to carry a supply of briquettes&mdash; especially as they are neatly packed&mdash; cannot secure supplies.  The few distributors available would seem to be selfish in so far as they look after themselves and their own special friends in the first instance.  The Minister ought to have a look at the distributive end and, where an application is sent to his Department or to the Board for permission to act in the capacity of distributor for the produce of Bord na Móna, this licence or approval should not be withheld without very good cause.</P>
    <P>I was very pleased to see in operation the car ferry between Rosslare and Fishguard.  This is an achievement on which we congratulate Irish Shipping Ltd.  I was pleased to hear today that yet another boat, the &ldquo;St. Andrew&rdquo;, is being converted for the purpose of car-ferrying in the future. It will increase to the greatest possible extent the number of cars which can be ferried from Fishguard to Rosslare in the years ahead.  It is a service widely availed of by English tourists.  We have seen at first hand the vast number of cars which come off the ferry at Rosslare and stream inland to the various towns and cities of our country.  The more the Minister can increase this facility the better.</P>
    <P>I do not know if I am entitled to advert to the new Department for which the Minister is now responsible, that is, the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that, and realise that we will be afforded another opportunity of talking about the Minister's responsibility in his new position as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs. I want to refer briefly to tourism.  One of the most heartening features of tourism is the interest aroused in the rural areas in the creation of the farm guesthouse plan. This is a scheme which the Minister could and should support to the very best of his ability.  The small guesthouses in the towns and villages and the farm guesthouses in the rural areas will be a boon to tourism in the future. Too much of the taxpayers' money in this country is being expended on luxury hotels for the millionaire classes, or the very wealthy people who come here from time to time, and there is little regard for the average tourists who come here in very large numbers, workingclass people from Britain, in the main, and other places, with limited means and limited amounts of money to spend, and who are seeking accommodation of a reasonable kind. They simply cannot afford the cost of the luxury hotels that are being built in this city, in other cities, and in many of our seaside resorts.</P>
      <P>This innovation of the family guesthouse, and the farm guesthouse in particular, is to be admired.  We wish to see it extended very much in the years ahead.  I am aware that where these guesthouses and farm guesthouses are known of, they are very fully availed of and very much appreciated by tourists.  Many of us have been told of the feelings of gratitude these tourists have on finding accommodation in these places.  The intimate family life which is available to them, the ingrained hospitality they find, the reasonableness of the charges and the very good home cooking, appeal to the average tourist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Moreover, the feature which is most admired, I think, about the farm guesthouses is the feeling that one gets <Col N="1509" /> away from the madding crowd, that one has an opportunity once again to commune with nature.  This is appreciated by foreigners, and especially perhaps by foreigners who are engaged in active work in the big cities, in the big noisy cities.  They very much appreciate gaining access to guesthouses of this type in the quiet rural scene, in rural areas amid the rural scene.  I am aware that the Irish Countrywomen's Association, Muintir na Tire and other rural bodies are actively supporting this idea.  I am aware, too, that this type of guesthouse is a very valuable means of supplementing the income on the small farms in rural Ireland.  It is no mean way of providing employment and, given the State aid to which it is entitled, this will become a valuable means of attracting more and more tourists to our land.</P>
    <P>We in the Labour Party are intensely proud of the various State bodies for which the Minister is responsible.  The dissatisfaction we have experienced from time to time is due to the unwillingness of the Minister to be fully responsible in this House for the undertakings and operations of these various bodies.  So far as we are concerned, these are essentially nationalised industries created and maintained by the taxpayers' money.  They are the people's industries.  We are the people's representatives in this House, and we are entitled to ask questions appertaining to the operations of these State bodies.  We are entitled as a matter of courtesy to receive the fullest information on the operation of these bodies. One can imagine the frustration and indignation felt in this House from time to time when the Minister, when questioned in regard to the operations of Bord na Móna, CIE, Aer Lingus, Cómhlucht Siúicre Éireann or any other State body, says that he cannot give the information, that he is not responsible for the day to day operations of these boards, or when the Ceann Comhairle or the Leas-Cheann Comhairle intimates to us that our questions are technically out of order.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am <Col N="1510" /> afraid legislation would be required to deal with that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>We would hope that the fullest information would be given in respect of those bodies in order to eliminate the feelings of suspicion and distrust which the secrecy to which the Minister holds fast creates, of necessity.  If the Minister took Members of the House into his confidence, and gave them the factual information required in reply to their questions, things would be in a healthier state and we would have much better relations between employees and staffs of the various bodies.</P>
      <P>It is greatly to be deplored that the highest incidence of industrial unrest has been found within our State bodies, such as CIE.  That is an indictment of the Minister and his senior staff in respect of the manner in which they deal with their employees. I will not go into any detail now as to what is wrong, but it has been revealed in this House by various Deputies, especially from these benches, that the rash of strikes and industrial unrest which was evidenced in CIE and other State bodies in recent months, was indicative of a breakdown in human relations within those bodies.  That is something for which the Minister must accept responsibility. It is not good enough to bring legislation into this House such as the ESB (Employees) Bill and hope by the enactment of anti-working class legislation of that kind to resolve this problem.</P>
      <P>You cannot force men to accept intolerable conditions.  You cannot force men by law to go to work and stay at work if they do not want to. It has been clearly revealed that the ESB (Employees) Bill which was passed in this House to deny the right of those people to take industrial action, strike action, if you like, is a worthless piece of legislation, and not worth the paper it is printed on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am merely admonishing the Minister to try to bring about better human relations within the confines of the various State bodies, and indicating that the culmination of this industrial action within the ESB at that time was the accumulation of the various pinpricks of industrial unrest which had not been attended to by that body and which eventually reached the crisis point of strike action.  We saw its repercussions during the passage of the Bill to which I have referred.</P>
      <P>These are the sentiments I wish to express about the various State bodies for which the Minister is responsible. I should like to assure him that as far as we on these benches are concerned, we wish him well in his efforts to improve, develop and enlarge these various bodies.  We will support enthusiastically any plans the Minister may have when he brings them to the House for the furtherance of any of the State bodies of which we are so proud.  We only wish that in a country with such a chronic problem of under-employment and unemployment and high incidence of emigration, the Minister and the Government will turn to the ideal of public enterprise more and more so that more bodies like Bord na Móna, Irish Shipping, ESB, Aer Lingus and others will be created, thereby providing more secure and lucrative employment for our people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the main, our State bodies bear the mark of permanency.  There may be problems from time to time and there may be criticism from time to time, but in the main these State bodies have the mark of progress and permanence, of security for the employees concerned, apart altogether from the essential services they provide for our people in regard to transport, power, fuel and lighting.  We in these benches take special interest in these bodies.  We have been advocating their establishment since the inception of our Party and we have always regarded ourselves as watchdogs of <Col N="1512" /> their progress.  Our desire is to see them grow and prosper.</P>
    <P>We were concerned when it was hinted here by a former Minister for Finance, now Senator Dr. Ryan, that there was a possibility that certain of these State bodies, which had been nurtured and developed by the taxpayers' money and brought to the point of success, might at some stage be passed over to private enterprise. We challenged it at the time as something wholly unjustified.  It is something we must watch very carefully in the future.  Therefore, we should welcome any assurance from the present Minister that there is no intention of departing in any way from the primary purpose for which these State bodies were established&mdash;the maintenance of essential services.  We want to see them continued and developed on behalf of the people by the Minister responsible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers) Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Treacy for his good wishes to me.  This was very pleasant to hear from him.  This has been a very long debate and I propose, if I have time, to continue the tradition of giving a reply to virtually every question asked during the course of many hours of discussion because I wish to make it clear that I believe the debate on the Estimate is a time when a great deal of information should be given on matters of a very detailed character which would not ordinarily be the case throughout the year.  At the beginning, I wish to deal with the parrot cries issued by various Deputies alleging that I have no function as Minister for Transport and Power.  Though these parrot cries are funny and though I am aware of the fact that the great majority of Deputies are fully aware of my position in relation to the State companies, I nevertheless think it right, in view of the wide publicity given in the newspapers to those Deputies who spoke of me as having no function, to reply to what has been said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am obliged once again to state very briefly my relations with the State companies and to indicate just <Col N="1513" /> what are my functions.  I examine with the boards of the companies, through my officials, the annual accounts of all the companies and all matters that seem to me to be of interest or significance in connection with the accounts.  I sanction in most cases the expenditure of capital.  I give sanction to that expenditure in relation to what I consider to be the Government's policy in relation to each State company and that means a very definite form of specific control of the general policy of each State company.</P>
    <P>I discuss at regular intervals with every State company all the important aspects of its administration, the frequency of these discussion depending on the company and the kind of work it undertakes.  For example, in connection with companies whose functions are promotional, I take a very deep interest in everything they do.  I do not suppose there is a single item of Bord Fáilte's general programming that I have not discussed in great detail and I have made suggestions in connection with many of the policies at one time or another.  I bring to the Dáil and Seanad at frequent intervals Bills for the enlargement of the capital of State companies and for other purposes.  At such times details are given to each House of the companies' progress.  I deal with every complaint of faulty services that comes to my Department and if faults are repetitive, I discuss them with the chairman and the general manager or with the board as a whole.  I incidentally meet the chairmen, managing directors and boards of the companies regularly. Irrespective of the fact that I have matters to discuss with them, as a matter of policy I meet them at regular intervals.</P>
    <P>I get a detailed statistical picture of every company in all its main activities. I examine constantly the steps taken through industrial consultants and work study, both those employed by the companies and those employed outside, to improve productivity.  I ask for comparative productivity estimates, when these are possible, in order to compare the efficiency of one or other of our State companies with those of a <Col N="1514" /> corresponding character and size outside the country or with private enterprise within the country.  I might add that is not always possible because such an examination has a limited value.  Nevertheless, results can be significant in certain cases.</P>
    <P>I ask for long-term estimates of production or achievement of one kind or another and I ask all companies to do such long-term planning as is possible, making a fair and a generally optimistic estimate of their future, based on whatever programme the company concerned has in mind or the Government have suggested.  I regularly inspect the premises of all State companies.  I ask for information from the management of companies regarding their industrial relations because I have realised that if a company is to be efficient and successful, there must be satisfactory industrial relations.  This will be a matter for the Minister for Labour in future but I shall be equally concerned with the provision of a background of economic information in so far as it is important for the Minister for Labour in order that he can visualise what it is possible to achieve in the field of industrial relations, taking into account the importance of State companies in the life of the nation.</P>
    <P>Then, I also have always received from the State companies general statements of their wage levels and fringe benefits so that I can be assured that, allowing for national income per head compared with that of the British and other people and the average of wage levels in the country and the particular economic position of any State company, the position of any State company is not one meriting any serious criticism.  There, again, the companies are supposed to work under the finest possible conditions of management and they are supposed to pay what might be described as a good average wage compared with a good wages paid in other similar occupations by good companies.  While, again, there must be variations because of the character of the company and its capacity to pay, nevertheless there must be general recognition that the State companies should not be subject to any extreme criticism in regard to the wage levels <Col N="1515" /> or fringe benefit arrangements they make for their people.</P>
    <P>I need hardly say that all that takes a great deal of time and no one can conceivably advocate that I have no function in regard to the State companies. I wish some of the Deputies on the opposite side would stop talking their appalling nonsense and not be trying to confuse the people.  I have presented this House on the occasion of this Estimate with 30,000 words of detailed information and documentation together with notes showing that those companies have been, right up to 1966, in the main, fulfilling the aims of the Second Programme, including CIE, with all its difficulties.</P>
    <P>If Deputies had really read the notes prepared in advance for them and circulated in advance before I read my Estimate speech, and if they had read my Estimate speech in detail, and in particular in relation to CIE, and the statement by Mr. Herlihy of CIE, which I got distributed, and which appeared, very luckily, at the time of the Estimate, they would have had, not 30,000 words but 40,000 words of detailed information enabling them to understand the progress and the problems of any single one of the State companies and enabling them to take part in this debate in a positive, constructive manner, as many of them did. The idea that I had not given information to the Deputies and to this House is so ludicrous as almost to need no argument.  I want to make this clear.</P>
    <P>After having said all that, do I have to repeat the reason why the Acts have been passed through this House in a form that makes it the duty of the Ceann Comhairle to decide whether a particular question is one which refers to the day to day operations of the company or whether it may be asked? Do Deputies really want me to repeat what I have said before on that matter? Do Deputies realise what would happen if there was no limit on questions and if deluges of questions were asked on every conceivable matter regarding the working of particular State companies?  I make a prediction here that any Minister who takes my <Col N="1516" /> place in the future, regardless of what Party to which he belongs, will make very little amendment, if any, in the law in regard to this matter because the questions which would be asked would involve the most minute circumstances of the operation of every company.  They could concern industrial relations and once Deputies of this House attempt to do the work which should be done by the branch executives of trade unions or by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions in relation to State companies there would be absolute chaos in the State companies.</P>
    <P>One of the things I have noted about this debate is whatever the Labour Party may have to say as to their attitude towards State companies, about whose conditions they were speaking when they described what they regarded as inadequate industrial relations in CIE, they were of a very general character.  It was not Deputies of the Labour Party&mdash;most of whom are union people&mdash;who started to try to create agitation in regard to the operation of a particular section of CIE, the Inchicore works. It was, regrettably, two Deputies of my own Party.  This was because they have not had sufficient experience of trade union work.</P>
    <P>Deputies know in everything I have said in relation to State companies and industrial relations that I never said on any occasion that any particular group of men should be treated in any particular way or given any particular wage.  That, again, is a function of the trade unions and the management in our system of free collective bargaining.  I have never gone beyond doing anything other than uttering warnings to the management and the staffs of certain of the companies. I have referred to the subsidy which could be afforded to them by the Government.  That is as far as I have gone.</P>
    <P>Deputies can imagine what would happen if there were unlimited privilege to ask questions.  If questions relating to the day to day activities, in which industrial relations were concerned, were allowed we would have absolute chaos.  Just to give an <Col N="1517" /> example in relation to quite a different type of question.  What would happen if Deputies could ask a question about the level of excursion fares for any GAA match, an excursion going from any part of Ireland to Dublin?  Does the House realise what would happen if such questions were allowed and the intolerable pressure which could be exercised on CIE, locally and otherwise?  I could give many other examples of what would happen if questions in regard to the day to day working of CIE were allowed without limit.</P>
    <P>Deputies know in their hearts that what I am saying is absolutely correct. May I also say that in countries which have had a long experience of either left of centre administration or a Government of the European social, democratic type, which can be described now as moderately labour and very, very left Conservative Government, a concept which is coming close as time goes on, in that kind of administration there is absolutely no difference in regard to the rule about answering questions on State companies. The reason is that when a State company is set up, it is supposed to operate as a commercial company, and whereas questions of a general kind can be asked in the Parliaments of those countries and whereas during debate members can learn fully about the operations of the company and can have their questions answered in a general way, the tradition is maintained there the same as it is here.</P>
    <P>Again, in order to answer those allegations that the House is ignorant of what is going on in our State Companies, during the financial years of 1963-64, 1964-65 and 1965-66, in other words, during the last three years, two Bills in this House were discussed in relation to tourism in which I answered every reasonable question asked.  There was one Bill on the British and Irish Steampacket Company, two on Air Navigation, two on the Shannon Free Airport Development Company, one on the Air Companies, two in connection with the Electricity Supply Board, one about Bord na Móna and there was another Bill of a private character about <Col N="1518" /> the ESB houses in Fitzwilliam Street. During this period, there were four major discussions on Bills in relation to transport.  In addition to that, there were four resolutions discussed during Private Members' time.  I defy any Deputy to read the records of the discussions on those Bills and to say that I did not, in a reasonable manner, answer all questions asked of me in regard to the operations of the companies concerned.  My conscience is quite clear about this.</P>
    <P>I suppose I really should laugh when I hear Deputy Coogan murmuring all the time &ldquo;He has no function&rdquo;, because as I have said, I have taken a detailed interest in the operation of these companies and conveyed a large amount of information about them to the Members of this House.  I could, of course, reply to this debate by saying that I accept that there is criticism of every State company, that no State company is perfect, that obviously there are problems, that the management do their best and I have trust in the board of directors and that the proof of their judgement right through these State companies lies in what has been accomplished during the period of the Second Programme for Economic Expansion.  However, I am going to repeat what has been accomplished and I will go on to give details in reply to all the observations that have been made and all the questions that have been asked.</P>
    <P>I should like to say that these State companies have led and are in the van of the Second Programme.  Most of them have lived up to everything asked of them in that Programme.  Some of them have experienced difficulties, such as Irish Shipping, which went through a period of abnormally low freight rates throughout the world but which in the past year has shown a small profit, after allowing for depreciation. There has been a very complete re-organisation in the company.  New types of ships have been acquired and a large carrier is being built.  The company will be able to achieve its objective in the future, provided freight rates do not fall alarmingly.</P>
    <P>In the case of the air companies, <Col N="1519" /> their success has been splendid.  The number of passengers carried by Aer Lingus during the period of the Second Programme increased by 53 per cent. That is beyond the demands of the Second Programme.  The number of passengers carried by Aerlínte increased by 301 per cent and they carried 1,437 per cent new freight.  The airports constantly extended in order to carry more passengers.  Shannon Airport shows an increase of 137 per cent in terminal passengers during the period of the Second Programme and terminal freight traffic increased by 216 per cent.  Dublin Airport shows an increase of passengers passing through it of 64 per cent since 1960.  Total freight has increased by 89 per cent. All these figures were up to and in advance of the requirements of increased production in the Second Programme. Cork Airport only opened in 1962 and the number of passengers is up since that time by 72 per cent.</P>
    <P>Of very great importance to the economy is tourism, which has lived up 100 per cent to its requirement in the Second Programme.  I am very proud of that because it is a tremendous tribute to Bord Fáilte, to everybody concerned in the industry and to the many private individuals who invested millions of pounds in new accommodation. The tourist industry, as the House knows, provides at the moment 18 per cent of the total export receipts of the country and is absolutely essential to our economic existence. Without it, we would collapse and go bankrupt as a nation.</P>
    <P>Consumption of electricity has gone up by 58 per cent since the inception of the Second Programme and in the case of rural areas, it has increased by 70 per cent.  Bord na Móna has experienced fearful weather difficulties, as I indicated in my opening Estimate speech, but nevertheless there has been an increase of 174 per cent in the milled peat produced since the inception of the Second Programme, 103 per cent in the amount of briquettes and 115 per cent in the amount of moss peat.  These again are figures which <Col N="1520" /> show complete compliance with the general industrial requirements of the Second Programme.  One cannot really refer to the Shannon Free Airport Development Company in relation to the Second Programme because in one sense it started from scratch in 1957 and now employs over 3,000 people.</P>
    <P>I could end the debate and save the House a lot of time by saying that I admit that there are criticisms and difficulties but nevertheless the State companies have done wonderfully in so far as their contribution to the life of the nation is concerned since 1960 and since the time we started planning our future, but I am going to speak in very great detail in regard to all matters raised during the debate.  I just want to make one short observation on Deputy Dunne's remark that apparently I created a sensation for him by admitting the existence of inflation in this country. Deputy Dunne must be innocent or he was pulling my leg because all the Ministers, the former Taoiseach and myself in particular have given the clearest picture of the future of the country ever since 1962 when the first signs of inflation appeared.  I can quote speeches which I made in that year in which I warned the public that if income exceeded the growth of productivity and if at any time there was a recession in England or international difficulties, inevitably whatever programme we had which envisaged an increase in production and exports, would be temporarily halted. My speeches are on record and can be read by anybody who looks back over the newspapers of the time.  Every responsible Minister warned the people that firstly, under our free collective bargaining system, they had an absolute right to negotiate wages in the way they wanted to, but gave a perfectly clear warning that unless guidelines in relation to income were observed, the cost of living would rise, the cost of government would rise, the price the Government had to pay for every service, for its own officers, for every service which they subsidised, would increase and that a great deal of the increases in income <Col N="1521" /> would inevitably be lost in increases in the cost of living.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether at this time it would be tactful to draw Deputy Dunne's attention to the fact that Great Britain is being run by a Labour Government.  A great many of the speeches made by Conservative Ministers, by Labour Ministers and Ministers in the Fianna Fáil Government ever since 1962 have been almost exactly on parallel lines, but in many cases for different reasons.  The people of neither country were willing to accept the advice given to them.  One can now see the difficulties in which the British people and the people of some other countries in Europe find themselves.  I mention that simply in reply to Deputy Dunne's extraordinary statement that I was making for the first time the admission that we faced inflation.</P>
    <P>I want to deal in great detail with CIE because most of the criticism was directed against CIE and I want to reply again to it.  I want to repeat that Dr. Andrews and his Board have undertaken and carried out a splendid job of organisation.  I am not going to give details of it; they have already been given.  At a time of tremendous expansion of private motor car traffic here, the actual figures for the carriage of freight and passengers show either a remarkable stability or a very large increase, thanks to the efforts of the Board and thanks to the acceptance by the vast majority of the staff of a perfectly tremendous re-organisation.</P>
    <P>When I hear of industrial relations that may not be so good in one sector or another of CIE and when I hear indignation expressed at certain changes that have been made in working techniques in certain sections of CIE, I say to myself: I do not suppose any company in the history of this country had to have such a tremendous re-organisation effected after a long period of gradual decline of the railways system which faced difficulties here similar to those experienced by railways in other countries.  Allowing for <Col N="1522" /> the changes that took place in attitudes, habits and techniques, a very great deal was accomplished with great co-operation by the vast majority of the staff for which the staff and management of CIE must be congratulated. Such reorganisation and progress must leave its trail.  There will be misunderstandings of new principles and procedures in CIE until they are fully understood and until workers and management come together and see the final course on which CIE is embarked.</P>
    <P>Having made that general statement, I now want to clear up one matter of a purely personal kind in the House. There was some strong objection rightly expressed to remarks of Mr. T.P. Hogan, part-time Chairman of CIE, in regard to members of this House. Certain Deputies who spoke were not prepared to be sporting enough to forgive Mr. Hogan when he had made an express apology.  I think we are all fair enough in this House&mdash;I do not think there are many mean Deputies&mdash; and I want to say here that Mr. Hogan did express to me his regret for a foolish statement.  He is a very well-known engineer who is highly reputed and has an excellent reputation in industrial relations.  He has been director of a number of important concerns.  I hope the House will agree with me that having expressed his apology, the incident should now be forgotten and that he should be given due chance as part-time Chairman of this very great organisation to carry on in that job without any prejudice against him because of a single statement at an indiscreet moment.  I take it all Deputies here will agree with me on that and I hope they speak on behalf of all Deputies in the House.</P>
    <P>I was asked a question by Deputy Oliver Flanagan, who incidentally very much commended the appointment of Mr. Hogan as Chairman.  I noticed that in the course of his speech he asked why it was decided to appoint a part-time Chairman.  I had already given the reason for that in reply to a Dáil Question, namely, that the organisation and revolution that had been required in CIE had, in the main, been completed, that the line of organisation <Col N="1523" /> had been laid down and that it was felt it was sufficient to have a part-time Chairman and the Board and that they, operating through the General Manager, who had been a director of the Board, would continue this work of reorganisation and do their very best to ensure that CIE played its rightful part in the national life.</P>
    <P>There were also some observations in regard to Dr. Andrews' pension.  I do not want to raise that matter again, except to say that I am quite certain that if one could be sure that, by offering an individual a pension of the amount received by Dr. Andrews one could, each time the pension was offered, see between 4,000 and 6,000 people employed in a new industry, if that was the way industry could be established here, why then, I do not believe this House would be unwilling to grant such pensions.  Dr. Andrews was responsible for the establishment of Bord na Móna, along with other members of the Board, and his inventiveness and initiative in that regard and the way he was able to inspire others and gather around him good workers and good engineers should be commended.  If providing such people with pensions at that level would bring us the kind of industrial revolution we need here, it would not be a bad way of doing it.  Unfortunately, that is not the practice.  We give grants in a different form.  I am speaking in a fanciful way simply to answer some of the criticism made in regard to his level of pension.  I should also say that in the case of the previous Chairman like terms and like pension were granted and there was nothing in his case that was particularly exceptional.</P>
    <P>I was asked by one Deputy about the charges made by CIE.  Of course CIE freight rates, charges and fares have gone up, as they have in Europe generally.  There is no excessive inflation in the cost of travelling by CIE or in the cost of sending goods.  It relates in general to increases that have taken place elsewhere.  I have looked at the figures and I find there is no exceptional inflation there.  I was asked why it was that CIE had more <Col N="1524" /> staff cars now than they had before. The answer is that whatever considerable increase there has been in the number of staff cars since 1958 is due to the fact that they have had to establish a sales organisation that would sell all around the country.  It is no use for an official, whose job is to sell freight all over the country, to go only by train: he must visit people and must get to area managers quickly and move around the country and see everybody.  The extra cost of the cars in relation, for example, to the £1 million worth of package deals effected by CIE, is negligible.  The extra cost of cars in relation to the turnover of CIE, which is £24 million, is negligible.</P>
    <P>This is part of the mean little talk one hears from certain Deputies who like to arouse envy in the minds of CIE workers by suggesting that, because there are a dozen or so more cars or because of the flower beds, the workers are being deprived of some extra benefits they could have had or that the company is being wasteful.  If only they would remember that figure of a turnover of £24 million, they would realise that if you added together all the alleged lushness in CIE, the whole thing <i>in toto</i> would not make a bag of nuts in the difference to the general level of the company's operations.  That sort of petty talk will not get us anywhere.  It will not benefit the workers or advance the interests of CIE.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dunne raised the old question of the closing of the railways.  I have already dealt with that in such detail that I need scarcely go into it here tonight.  When a branch line is closed, it is closed because it is really a bus line forced to run along rails, stopping infrequently, carrying far too few passengers and too little freight to justify its existence.  Thousands and thousands of miles of railways have been closed all over Europe in the past ten years, and if a better service can be provided by road at less cost to the taxpayer, the policy in all countries, subject to certain exceptions for special reasons, is to close down railways of this kind.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1525" /> Deputy S. Dunne implied that CIE was not run as a social service, that it was a purely commercial operation. There it is again.  Deputy Dunne does not bother to read the information I provide him with.  On the Second Reading of the Transport Bill, 1964, all the information was given about the social services operated by CIE, about the 39 services in Dublin that do not pay and never will pay; about the high proportion of provincial bus services that do not pay and will never pay; and about the remarkable services which help to make up for the nonpaying services and which provide a very large proportion of the revenue. For example, in Dublin, three of the bus services provide one-third of the entire revenue of the bus service in Dublin, and if those services were not highly profitable, either the taxpayer or the people of Dublin would have to pay very much higher taxes or fares for taking buses in Dublin.  This, of course, is common to bus services in other countries.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dunne accused me of having Victorian views in regard to the economics of State companies.  Now I accuse Deputy Dunne, in turn, of being a thoroughly Victorian Labour man because the modern labour parties, the modern social democratic parties, while believing philosophically in the social principle, have come to accept the operation of State companies in relation to private enterprise on what might be called a factual basis, that, as long as the system works, it is good to have private enterprise and as long as private enterprise is not supplying what is required for social and economic development, the State should intervene.  That is generally accepted in the modern labour world. It is accepted by Mr. Harold Wilson and Mr. Callaghan in England.  It is accepted by the Swedish administration which is a left-of-centre, socialist-in-origin government which has been in office since 1925, if I remember rightly.  They take an <i>ad hoc</i> view. They recognise that private enterprise and the State company system operating together have succeeded in building up the economy of Sweden.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1526" /> That is the view we have on this side of the House.  Therefore, I repeat for the benefit of Deputy Dunne and Deputy Casey that if I see the number of private motor cars doubled in ten years, a decision made by the Irish people, as made by other peoples, to have their private transport, if I see the Irish people make that decision in common with the French people on the basis that there are more motor cars per £ million of national income in this country than there are in any other country in Europe&mdash;and largely because of the scattered character of our population and the lack of village life&mdash;there is no reason why I should be obliged, for purely socialist purposes, to pump more and more money by way of subsidy into CIE.</P>
    <P>I have no obligation of any kind to ask the taxpayer to pay more and more pennies per gallon of petrol in order to support CIE.  We regard the subvention of CIE as the amount of money required to keep a railway system going efficiently that never can be made to pay in any conditions.  It is not a subsidy to support an ailing, inefficient company.  It is a subvention deliberately designed to maintain a railway in a country which is too big to justify the closing of the railway and which is not quite big enough to enable the railway to operate without entailing a fairly large loss.</P>
    <P>If Dublin were 300 miles from the main arterial terminals of CIE, the loss would be less because the railway would be better able to compete on long hauls, as in the case of every other railway, with road transport: 150 miles is a most regrettable length because the railway is still essential and yet it never can pay for reasons I have given so often.  We have a low density of population in this country, unlike Great Britain.  There is absolutely no transit traffic as in the case of the Dutch railway which has paid but which is beginning to go into the red, or the Swiss railway which is only just balancing its accounts.  We have as yet no substantial volume of metal ores or coal&mdash;and are unlikely to have&mdash;which form some of the basic revenue of <Col N="1527" /> railways where there is no large element of subsidy.</P>
    <P>Then there is the fact that although we are trying to establish industries in the west, Dublin, the capital city, is in the east and the railways move westwards to comparatively thinly-populated areas, and the length of railway in relation to each thousand of the people is still one of the longest in Europe, even after our having closed 621 miles of line.</P>
    <P>We want this railway to operate efficiently in the sphere in which it was justified, namely, long-distance freight, long-distance passenger traffic and the essential commuter service in Dublin. The £2 million at present paid in subsidy, which represents 4d a gallon of petrol to the taxpayer and represents 22 per cent of the rail revenue of CIE or 4/6d on every 20/- worth of rail ticket bought or freight fare paid, is quite adequate.  It is ludicrous to suggest that I should encourage a considerable increase in that subvention when I see £30 million a year being invested in private transport and the private sector willing to risk investing money in transport every year.  No social democrat or person believing in left-of-centre government or believing strongly in State enterprise would recommend the Minister for Transport to give way easily to demands for an increase in a subvention of that kind. If CIE were not compelled to run railways because it is part of the national economic life, there would be no need for a subvention at all.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell from Donegal asked a question about the buses which run parallel to the railway and he suggested that CIE rail service could not pay because there were buses running parallel.  If you examine the CIE bus services that run parallel to the railway, you will find that they call at different towns, many towns not covered by the railway.  Equally it would be found, if the ticket sales are examined, that a very large number of people get on the bus during its journey and for part of its journey and <Col N="1528" /> that they are not, in many cases, passengers getting in at Dublin and getting out at the final terminal.</P>
    <P>All that has been examined very carefully by CIE.  If those services were not run it would then be necessary to have services running in a circle from stations at enormous extra cost and at very great inconvenience to the passengers. There are many services relating to the railway already but these long-distance bus routes do not follow altogether the route of the railway. The Dublin-Cork bus, for example, goes completely off the railway route for most of its journey.  Therefore Deputy O'Donnell need have no doubts there would be substantial changes if all the buses following railway routes were abolished and the feeder services were established instead.</P>
    <P>In reply to Deputy O'Donnell, express bus services are doing very well at the moment.</P>
    <P>Deputy James Tully referred to the fact that he thought provincial bus fares were high.  The Deputy is right. Provincial bus fares in relation to certain Welsh bus services are somewhat higher when the mileage exceeds eight miles.  Up to that point they are about the same.  Above eight miles they are somewhat higher than in the case of one particular English operator.  I think they are not very different from the bus fares of the UTA, the Northern Ireland transport service, and I do not think there is any way of reducing them.  They are not so much higher as to serve as a real deterrent to travelling on the bus.  I have asked CIE to consider on a more elaborate plan the examination of excursion bus fares.  I hope that they will consider that but that is the answer to Deputy Tully's question.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully also asked a question about the synchronising of bus services with the arrival of railway trains.  In most cases the arrival and departure of buses do correspond with railway services.  There are exceptions to this and I would be very glad if Deputy Tully would give me the example of which he had a record of a bus which left five minutes before the train arrived because I should like <Col N="1529" /> to make inquiry of CIE in regard to the matter.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies implied that I never go by bus and do not know what the bus services are like.  That is completely untrue.  Do Deputies imagine that a Minister for Transport and Power would really seal himself off from the ordinary life of the people of Dublin by never going by bus? That would show lack of imagination, on my part.  So, I do go by bus and I have been by bus and I have got into buses, waited for buses at 5 o'clock in the evening in wet weather and I know all the difficulties of the CIE Dublin bus services.  I have watched the conductors and noted that 90 per cent or 95 per cent of them are extraordinarily polite and decent to the people they serve.  So the idea that I have not travelled by bus is as ludicrous as to say that I have not travelled by Aer Lingus or Aer Rianta or by CIE train.  I travel frequently by CIE train and, of course, I have been by bus in order to acquaint myself of the position.</P>
    <P>I want to say that I have also compared the Dublin bus services and the provincial services of CIE, as far as I can, with services in other countries with a very much higher income per head of the population than we have and, whether you examine it by looking at a map with the densities of population marked in the main centres and then at the bus services indicated in the case of European countries or whether you examine it by the number of passenger miles travelled by the public in these countries, or however you examine it, there is nothing fundamentally wrong with the CIE bus services in that it cannot be said by any stretch of the imagination that it is not fulfilling a social service as well as running buses that pay.</P>
    <P>I can also say with truth, and I am sure any Deputy who has been abroad to the Council of Europe or for any other purpose and who has watched people going to work in the morning in the large cities of Europe in countries with 50 per cent, 60 per cent, 70 per cent, 100 per cent more income per head than we have, will not disagree, <Col N="1530" /> that a higher percentage of people travel to work in Dublin seated than in most capital cities with a far greater income per head than we have.  Any Deputy who has been to Stockholm, for example, or Berlin or Zurich or Munich and has seen people going to work there will know that what I say is correct.  That is not to say that the Dublin bus service is perfect.  Of course it is not perfect. One of the great facts about the CIE bus service administration is that the Manager of the bus service knows that it is not perfect and is doing his utmost to improve it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon asked a question about my connection with the one-way street operation in Dublin.  I have no connection.  Of course, CIE are linked with Dublin Corporation in an enquiry into congestion in Dublin.  May I say that the one-way street operation has not nearly solved the problem and I myself have recently investigated this. I recently took a bus in Dawson Street at 5.30 p.m.  Even when the bus had emerged from the central complex, the bus took 25 minutes to go from Dawson Street to Kelly's Corner because of congestion in an area where congestion is supposed to have been solved through the one-way street operation. I can tell the Deputies of this House the melancholy news that until the congestion problem in Dublin is settled, every time at peak traffic hours, morning and afternoon and at mid-day, the rhythm of the bus service will be deeply disturbed, no matter what is done to remedy the position and that buses that are supposed to travel at five minute intervals will often be travelling in bunches at 20 minute intervals and there is nothing that CIE can do about it except ameliorate it as far as possible by having radio telephone link, inspectors' cars, by turning a few buses where this is possible back into the traffic and by the origin and destination survey about which I will speak later.</P>
    <P>I might add that the first specific experiment in factual surveys on bus operation conducted by CIE in Limerick, Waterford and Cork, proved extremely successful and there everybody admits that the bus service has been very much improved indeed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1531" /> I was also asked questions about the desirability of CIE not running all their buses into the centre of the city, seeing whether it would not be possible to route buses avoiding the centre of the city.  That, of course, involves knowing how many people want to cross the city from one point to another. CIE conducted some time ago a pick-up and set-down survey the purpose of which was to equate the capacity offered by city buses at all times of the day with the number of people travelling.  That enquiry of a preliminary kind is now I think fully processed and many improvements have already resulted.  CIE, as a result of that, re-scheduled 72 per cent of their major Dublin City routes and also provided new services and provided increased capacity of seven per cent in the morning peaks and 6.8 per cent in the evening peaks on the routes.</P>
    <P>As the House knows, nearly a quarter of a million passengers, a very representative sample, have been questioned as to the origins and destinations of their journeys.  During the survey that took place recently each passenger was asked: &ldquo;Where did you board?  Did you transfer from another route?  Where will you alight on this route?  Will you transfer over to another route later?  To what route will you transfer and at what place will you finally alight?  Are you travelling to or from work or school or other activity?&rdquo; The results of that survey will be examined by Professor Schachterle, the Dublin Corporation traffic expert.  Deputy Dowling and other Deputies who said that CIE should attempt to run buses to a lesser extent through the centre of the city, will learn later the results of the survey.</P>
    <P>I am afraid my own prediction is that Deputy Dowling will be disappointed. Although it may be possible that CIE will run more routes, such as Route 18, from one area to another and not through the centre of the city and may alter the pattern of services, I am afraid there will be found a very large number of people who want to go through the centre of the city from the periphery.  However, I hope it will <Col N="1532" /> result in CIE being able to contribute to some extent to the relief of congestion in the centre of the city.  I might state in passing that there are certain cities in Europe where buses are given some priority rights travelling through the city.  That may be another solution.</P>
    <P>I have already spoken about the CIE provincial bus fares.  In regard to the CIE Dublin bus fares, these compare at present quite favourably with those charged in London and Manchester. Although it is regrettable CIE had to increase them, the cost to CIE have gone up because of successive wage rounds and increased costs of materials. It is only fair to point out that Dublin bus fares even at this moment compare favourably with those in London and Manchester.  To give one example: For 3.2 miles of travel, the fare in Dublin is 9d; the fare in London is ?d; and the fare in Manchester is 9d.  Double that to 6.2 miles.  The fare in Dublin is 1/1d; the fare in London is 2/-; and the fare in Manchester is 1/1d.  Go up again, for example, to something equivalent to going to Dalkey or some place roughly that distance from the centre.  The fare in Dublin is ?d; the fare in London for a similar distance, 2/6d; and in Manchester, it would be the same, ?d.  Therefore, in reply to those Deputies who asked about fares in Dublin, I can say they compare favourably with provincial cities in Great Britain and very favourably with those in London.  I might add that the cost of oil is about the same.  The cost of many of the materials CIE buys is either the same or more.  The general wage-fringe benefit structure of the bus conductors and drivers in CIE is roughly euivalent at present to that paid by the provincial bus companies in England.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I said provincial bus companies.  A number of Deputies pointed out the severe burden imposed on the citizens of Dublin by the present level of CIE fares.  Naturally, fares have had to increase.  It is unpleasant that they have increased.  But it is only fair to point out that between 1958 and 1966, there has been an increase <Col N="1533" /> of 55 per cent in the index hourly rate of wages.  In the same period, the average fare per passenger journey in Dublin increased by 51 per cent. Therefore, the cost of fares in the Dublin CIE services has not increased quite as much as the increase in the hourly rate of wages.  Incidentally, the same thing applies to social welfare payments.</P>
      <P>I think I should repeat what I have said before: if you take the loss on the Dublin rail commuter services and the profit of the Dublin bus services, the actual net gain is so small that the argument that the Dublin bus services should not subsidise the rest of the system is not worth very much at present. It is not an argument of importance. Another figure that might be interesting to the public is that the profit on the Dublin bus services represents one-seventh of a penny per passenger journey.  Although that may mount up in the course of a year, nobody can say it is an excessive profit.</P>
      <P>Again, some further information about the increase in fares that has taken place between 1958 and 1966: I gave the figures for the increases in wages and salaries.  The cost of living has gone up by 30 per cent since 1958. Wages and salaries have gone up by 55 per cent.  Dublin city fares went up by 51 per cent.  Rail passenger fares have gone up by 40 per cent.  On the provincial bus and rail services, fares have gone up by 40 per cent.  This shows again there has been no desperate inflation in the increase of fares charged by CIE in general in relation to wages and salaries and in relation to increases in the cost of living.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dunne made some very outdated observations about work study. He accused me of having a Victorian political mind&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;although I continue to provide finance for the expansion of all the State companies and recently have been concerned with the creation of another State company.  I do not mind Deputy Dunne's observations, but Deputy Dunne himself is, as I have said, Victorian Labour in <Col N="1534" /> mind.  Apparently, he has not read the annual reports of the National Productivity Committee, which state that members of ICTU and employers are working happily together in an association to interest both managers and workers all over the country in work study, to point out how work study can be conducted and operated in the interests of the workers, resulting eventually in increases in their pay packets. They have been pointing out that work study, if it is to be successful, must mean that the workers work more happily and more effectively in their jobs. The trade unionists and the companies in the National Productivity Committee and in seminars all over the country have been persuading workers and managers to adopt work study or industrial consultancy of one kind or another.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dunne also talked about the work study done in CIE and other State companies as something to be avoided and not in accordance with Labour policy at all.  However, I recommend Deputy Dunne to read the reports of the National Productivity Committee and then go and protest, if he wishes to ICTU about their collaboration in carrying out work study propaganda, as I have said, on the basis that it must result in happier working relations for the men as well as in more productivity.  In fact, nowadays it is impossible to achieve greater productivity without, at the same time, having an understanding that the workers feel they are doing their work more effectively. It is not the object of work study that men should go home feeling more exhausted than they felt before work study had been operated. Everybody knows that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy James Tully rather laughingly suggested that I made some observations suggesting that CIE should have a complete monopoly and that everybody should be forced to go by bus.  I think he was merely encouraging me to make some observations on the report presented by Mr. Dan Herlihy, assistant manager of CIE, on the problem of congestion in Dublin.  It would take me much too long to speak about this matter in detail but I think the House knows <Col N="1535" /> that the majority of cities in the world are adopting, sooner or later, as part of their policy a restriction on the entry of private vehicles into the congested centres.  The British, with their immense wealth, are doing it in London.</P>
    <P>I recommend Deputy Tully, if he ever has time&mdash;he is a very busy man &mdash;to read the superb report on traffic congestion by Professor Colin Buchanan which far outpasses any other report of a similar kind.  He will see particulars of towns of various sizes in England and their methods of completely avoiding traffic congestion. One method is the construction of satellite villages, an enormously costly operation.  Another method is that of having two tiers of roads in the centre of the city which either disfigures the city or is prohibitively expensive.  A third method is the establishment of an underground railway system which begins to apply when a city reaches a population of one million, but there are other factors to be taken into consideration there.  A fourth method imposes some restraint or tax on those who wish to bring their private cars into the city centre and park them there at peak periods.  None of these has been decided upon here.  It is a matter for Dublin Corporation and their ultimate plans for the avoidance of congestion have not yet been published. In a city like ours I envisage that, in about 20 years' time, more people will have to travel by public transport to the centre of the city unless drastic steps are taken to improve the circulation of traffic by one means or another.</P>
    <P>A number of foolish observations were made by certain Deputies&mdash;again with the idea of suggesting that CIE is wasteful.  CIE has changed its livery, as everyone knows.  Deputy Ryan spoke about the various changes, all of which gave the impression that there was waste.  Of course, the answer is that the buses were repainted in the ordinary way and that, as they came for repainting, the new livery was painted on the buses.  There was no extravagance. <Col N="1536" /> It is equally true that the cost of providing the new type of destination scroll and of having the names in Irish does not amount to anything in relation to the vast revenue of CIE.</P>
    <P>One of the things that did infuriate me was to hear Deputy Ryan complain of the extravagance of arranging garden beds in Inchicore.  That makes me absolutely see red when I think of the filthy ghastly mess in Inchicore as it was ten years ago.  I recall the appalling dumps of loathsome refuse lying around the place, the cleansing that has been carried out and the fact that they are trying to make Inchicore a modern factory.  Deputy Ryan may know that the most profitable factories come more and more to be those which are surrounded by flower gardens a nice atmosphere and where the staff have a decent environment.</P>

The cost is negligible to CIE in relation to the changes made in the Inchicore workshops.</P>

      <P>Many Deputies spoke about industrial relations in CIE.  In so far as there is a solution in which a Minister could play a part, I would just say that that matter is now under the aegis of the new Minister for Labour.  In passing over this responsibility formally to the Minister for Labour, I did provide him with all the information, as I could see it, as to how CIE was to operate, in the economic sense, in the future.  In the case of the services in CIE where there has obviously been the most strained relations&mdash;the bus services&mdash;I suggested to the management of CIE some time ago that they might have an independent inquiry into it.  The Tavistock Committee has presented a report.  But, by the time the committee had reported, CIE had already carried out certain steps that were then recommended by implication by the committee. The decentralisation of management and control of the garages of CIE is one of the very obvious improvements that were made that could be deduced from the character of the report.  The report was of a very special kind.  It did not make specific recommendations.  It gave the facts on the industrial relations and the sentiments of the bus drivers and conductors. Already, quite a number of proposals implied by the report have been adopted by CIE and have been put into operation.  I do not intend to comment on that now because it is a matter for the management of CIE and the unions but I think it was interesting that the committee was appointed.  The way they operated was interesting.  The way they made use of the Tavistock report was interesting. Furthermore, Irishmen assisted in the preparation of the report and I hope it will have a fruitful result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad that nobody, in the course of the debate, contradicted my statement that the best way to get over the major industrial relations difficulties of CIE would be an arrangement undertaken by all the unions working in concert with the management over a very considerable period, particularly in regard to fringe benefits and conditions.  I suppose I may be somewhat <Col N="1538" /> of an idealist in suggesting that there could be one united action on the part of the unions concerned in this.  I am interested to note that Mr. Conroy, the General President of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, in the <i>Liberty</i> Magazine, July, 1966, said:</P>
    <P>There is need for rationalisation of our trades unions but this is a long term undertaking.  Every responsible trade union official would hope to live to see the day when all trade unionists in Ireland are organised in industrial unions. The idea is to have the one union catering for all workers in the industry or service or perhaps a single union catering for two or more industries.  This is, as I say, however, very much a long term undertaking although it surely is a necessary job of work that should be tackled.</P>
    <P>All I have said indicates that a gigantic State enterprise such as CIE providing public services, justifies consideration of Mr. Conroy's objectives, perhaps at an earlier date than might be necessary in the case of other industries.</P>
    <P>I have already pointed out that it is not for me to interfere in what the workers could gain by way of collective bargaining, or by way of wages, but it is right to point out that if everything they are asking for at this moment were granted, it would amount to an increase of 70 per cent in the salaries and wage bill since 1963/64.  There is no transport company in the world that could pay such an increase.  CIE has increased salaries by 27 per cent since the ninth round which compares with 23 per cent as a national figure.</P>
    <P>That shows the progress that has been made.  I recognise that as we advance in prosperity, there will be improvements, particularly by way of fringe benefits.  Therefore, I think perhaps the Minister for Labour could achieve a position whereby all the workers could come together and try to see what can be done in the next six years.  Where improved conditions could be achieved, CIE would grow in prosperity, if no strike action would <Col N="1539" /> take place, and this would be of ultimate advantage to the men and to the community.  I am merely repeating what I have said on a number of occasions, and I must repeat again that I have informed the Minister for Labour that the recent strikes were not the result of a consistent demand of large groups of workers.  They were a tragic result of small groups of workers, in their own wisdom, demanding a higher wage or better conditions, resulting in a freeze-up of the whole bus transport services.</P>
    <P>I am pointing out the facts as they undoubtedly exist.  Long-term examination of the problem would be better because all the demands now lying for implementation on the table of the CIE board&mdash;all the demands for improvements and all the escalation through the system&mdash;would, for example, mean a minimum increase in the tax on petrol of 1/- per gallon for the taxpayer to pay for the whole of the subvention required.</P>
    <P>It seems to me in this case that all the groups in CIE should go into the whole future picture of CIE over a long period, with a view to getting steadily improving fixed fringe benefits to the advantage of all concerned. Nobody can say I am anti-labour, or against the interests of the workers, in making that suggestion.  But, according to Mr. Conroy's speech, it will be very difficult to achieve the kind of collaboration necessary to bring that about.</P>
    <P>It is only fair to CIE, since there has been so much controversy over strikes, to mention the fact that, after allowing for the total number of staff in March, 1958, 1959, 1965 and 1966, the total increase in the yearly salaries and wages bill is 68 per cent since 1958-59, in relation to an increase in the cost of living of 30 per cent.  I merely mention that because it indicates that very great progress has been made and that, even if there were some elements among the workers in CIE who were low paid, this great increase shows that the unions were successful in regard to the real earnings <Col N="1540" /> of other categories.  This calculation, incidentally, does not include the £1 a week which would bring it up to 73 per cent.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies in touch with the unions, though I am glad to say very few&mdash;and Deputies from the Labour Party, with the exception of Deputy S. Dunne&mdash;spoke in a very guarded and discreet way about the industrial relations stress within CIE. I noticed that.</P>

      <P>I just want to give the other side.  A huge system like CIE experiencing a great deal of reorganisation is bound to have industrial troubles.  I want to mention many joint consultative council meetings that have been taking place throughout the system in every area; a great many meetings take place each year.  At these joint consultative meetings, representatives of the ordinary staff meet management at various levels and they discuss every function of the company's operations, including their own minor grievances.  They discuss such matters as service to the public, selling in CIE, tourism and private hire, public relations and adverse criticism by the staff.  They discuss every aspect of the operation of the company in connection with bus and rail services. They discuss ways in which industrial relations can be improved.  This goes on throughout CIE and I recommend Deputies who are interested in industrial relations to get copies of the CIE <i>Nuacht</i> of October 28th and they will find two pages dealing with the joint consultative council of CIE.  The report of elaborate consultation and discussion going on between the workers and management at all levels throughout the whole of the system will be very revealing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dowling spoke about the character of the work done in Inchicore.  Of course the answer is that the system in operation there is known to the trades union, has been approved by the trades union and that anything of a kind which resulted in gross discontent among the staff would be the subject of representations by the trades union.  I want to make clear these facts.</P>
      <P>The problem of men standing idle for three or four days with waiting cards hardly exists at all.  Waiting time does not usually exceed a few hours at a time.  Waiting time arises from a number of reasons and is normal in similar industries. The present control system identifies waiting time whereas previously men were without work and this was not regarded.  There are certain difficulties in applying production control in a workshop and the procedures adopted by CIE follow normal practice and are entirely satisfactory.  Satisfactory procedures have been established for the work measurement and for setting up of standards.  Quite obviously when time standards are applied to a particular job very often unexpected work is required and it is necessary to extend the standard time applied and that does alter the movements of the staff but this can be found in all similar workshops where similar work is done.</P>
      <P>The statement that the older skilled hands are dispirited in the workshops in CIE is not accepted.  Since the 1st September, 1965, in an effort to improve communication between management and staff the assistant mechanical engineer has instituted and participated in two-day seminars with small groups from the various workshops.  Approximately 500 workshop staff have attended those seminars and have clearly indicated by their comments and observations that they have confidence in the management and are satisfied with the working conditions.  In fact, the older men have played a very big part by explaining to their junior colleagues the many beneficial changes that have taken place in conditions of employment at the workshops.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1542" /> There was a suggestion that there has been a very large turnover in skilled staff and that a great number of staff have left the service during the past four years.  I looked up the numbers who have left in the past four years and there does not seem to be anything remarkable about it, neither particularly low nor particularly high. Since the beginning of the financial year in April the number of skilled staff in Inchicore actually increased from 448 to 461.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dowling and Deputy T.J. Fitzpatrick (<i>Dublin</i>) suggested that the workshops have a bad name as far as working conditions are concerned. Employers from other engineering workshops have been directed to Inchicore by the factory inspectorate as an example of good working conditions.  So much for that.</P>
    <P>All the conditions in relation to the practice of work study at Inchicore are in conformity with the International Labour Office recommendations and exactly the same system of production control is carried out in the USA and in other industrial countries.  In some details the system in Inchicore has been modified to suit particular conditions. In the highly advanced industrial countries such as the USA the ratio of staff to supervisors is very much less than at Inchicore so that the suggestion that supervisors are standing around at Inchicore and bullying the men, which incidentally they would not tolerate and it would not be tolerated by the trades union, is not true.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister means the opposite: the ratio of staff to supervisors?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The ratio of staff to supervisors is less in the highly advanced countries than at Inchicore.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think I have given enough information to show that the Deputies who want to talk about workshop conditions should be very careful to get their information correct.  There is no big workshop anywhere in the world where you will not get distorted stories of industrial conditions.  No doubt there is some discontent at Inchicore and I <Col N="1543" /> have no doubt it will take some time before the new system is accepted by one hundred per cent of the workers.  Nevertheless, with the holding of these seminars and the effort being made by the management to acquaint the staff with the necessity for central control, which is found everywhere in the world in workshops of a similar kind, it is possible to improve the position.  Of course, there is naturally a turnover of staff.  If Deputies were to go from one factory to another in Dublin where there are fitters of the kind employed at Inchicore it would be found that there is work that is more pleasant than repairing huge diesel engines.  There is work of another kind, an easier or more pleasant kind and that could account, in some cases, for the fact that workers leave Inchicore, apart from whatever strained conditions there may still be there.  The physical conditions under which the men work are a vast improvement on what used to obtain and everybody knows that.  I think I have dealt sufficiently with that subject.</P>
    <P>Somebody talked about a huge pylon being erected at great expense at the Inchicore works for an advertising sign.  The pylon was not erected for an advertising sign.  It was erected in order to provide better lighting which had been requested both by the staff and the workers.</P>
    <P>Observations were made about the store system at Inchicore.  All that is being re-organised and is now centrally controlled, productivity greatly increased, paper work gone down and not up as was suggested by Deputy Ryan.  There is nothing adverse to report in connection with that whole operation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish made some observations about an alleged failure by CIE to grant reduced fares to enable a group of boys from the Christian Brothers' school in Wexford to travel by rail to Dublin to see a science exhibition.  In consequence two private buses had to be obtained from Waterford to bring the boys to Dublin. We have investigated this and <Col N="1544" /> found out that CIE advertised a concession rail fare of 12/- return to enable school-children to attend the Atoms in Action exhibition which was held in Ballsbridge.  Copies of the advertisement had been sent to all the schools in Wexford.  Groups from two of the schools, the Marian Convent and the technical school, Wexford travelled by rail.  The area manager said that the Christian Brothers had contacted CIE and had asked them to provide a special bus to enable them to bring their children to Dublin to see the exhibition on Saturday, 2nd October.  CIE was not in a position to supply a bus on that particular Saturday, and he suggested that the boys should travel by train.  The fact is all the buses had been engaged on that Saturday when the Christian Brothers made their request.  It was unfortunate, but it certainly does not indicate that CIE were not making an effort to get people to Dublin from Wexford at reasonable rates on special occasions.</P>
    <P>I have, I think, dealt at great length with CIE and its problems and have answered reasonably all the questions asked with regard to the company.  As I have said, it is making progress and will continue to do so in the future.</P>
    <P>The next matter then is tourism. Deputy P. O'Donnell seemed to imply that there was something rather bogus about Bord Fáilte and its operations. However, other Fine Gael Deputies made positive contributions and suggested that Bord Fáilte was doing good work.  They made constructive criticisms so, perhaps, I can ignore some of the observations made by Deputy P. O'Donnell.</P>
    <P>He suggested that more encouragement should be given to British tourists.  Bord Fáilte spend what they regard as the right proportion of their promotional funds on bringing British tourists here.  Indeed, the greater part of their funds is spent in that direction. As a result of market research, however, they have discovered that the United States market is of immense value.  Americans spend more than other races when they come here.  They <Col N="1545" /> leave something like 20 million dollars a year here.  Bord Fáilte will carry out its promotional work in relation to what it thinks provides the best result from the expenditure of any given sum.</P>
    <P>Deputy P. O'Donnell, too, seemed to suggest that Bord Fáilte had not fulfilled its promise so far as promoting tourism is concerned.  As I have already indicated, the target set has been achieved and a very wonderful increase in tourist income has taken place.  In 1960, the value of tourist income was £42.2 million.  That rose to £63.6 million at 1960 prices in 1965. Deputy P. O'Donnell also suggested that a great proportion of that income came from relatives returning home or from persons who could not be regarded as genuine tourists.  Using the methods of the Central Statistics Office, and by the provision of sample cards, we know now that 75 per cent of the income from tourism comes from genuine tourists.  That is the position. The Deputy also suggested that we were pricing ourselves out of the market.  Actually, in his own county, the hotels were absolutely booked out this year and I can find no evidence that in the past year we were pricing ourselves out of the market and I hope hotels will be extremely careful in applying their charges.  Certainly, so far as the Deputy's county is concerned, what he alleges has not taken place.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also referred to the publicity work done by Bord Fáilte as having something in it of gimmickry. We are living in the year 1966 and what may appear to be gimmickry to some is the kind of publicity which draws tourists to the country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Treacy referred to the need for more guesthouses and extended accommodation of that kind.  He suggested we had concentrated too much on luxury hotels.  The position is that Bord Fáilte now conducts the most modern research and is able to tell approximately what the requirements are.  It has provided grants to encourage the extension of existing premises and the construction of new hotels in the correct proportions to cater for the various grades of traffic. <Col N="1546" /> Other Deputies suggested that not enough had been done to encourage the provision of farmhouse accommodation. I am happy to relate that in 1967 almost 1,000 bedrooms will be available in 230 farmhouses and, at that rate, by 1970 there will be 2,500 bedrooms available in farmhouses. With regard to other accommodation inspected by Bord Fáilte, but not actually registered in 1966, there were 5,000 bedrooms; that again indicates the development of moderately priced accommodation.  With regard to moderately priced registered accommodation as a whole, in 1963 there were 12,440 grade B to C and grade C hotels and guesthouse bedrooms and that proportion has increased in the past three years to 13,600 odd.  That means that in three years 1,200 extra bedrooms were provided.  That shows the progress made and the result achieved by increasing the scope of the grants for the improvement of accommodation.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies spoke about the need for more resort development.  As Deputies know, the Tourist Traffic Act, 1966, increased the fund for resort development to £3.25 million.  This includes the provision of £750,000 for commencing a second resort development programme to include centres other than those already designated as major resorts.</P>
    <P>Deputy O.J. Flanagan and others asked for information about tourist development at Tramore.  Tramore Fáilte Limited was set up about nine months ago and is now in operation. This company owns the foreshore area, including the gas company property and the railway station.  An overall plan is being prepared for the development of the property as a recreational area with both indoor and outdoor recreation facilities.  The plan is virtually complete.  The first job will be the provision of a caravan site and that will be considered at a meeting of the company next week. It is expected the caravan site will be ready by 1967.</P>
    <P>Deputy James Tully spoke very sympathetically on behalf of the tourist facilities at Laytown.  Without <Col N="1547" /> going into too much detail, Bord Fáilte did, in fact, make a grant of £650, or about ten per cent of the total cost of the development scheme there.</P>
    <P>Deputy T. O'Donnell referred to the work of the Shannonside Regional Tourist Company.  In reply to him, I hope he will encourage more members to join the regional tourist board because, although they are doing splendid work, they need more field officers to undertake such things as developing the tourist potential.  I am sure Deputy O'Donnell will be the first to help them recruit more members and secure more funds from local sources knowing that something like £3,500,000 is being paid in wages in Shannon alone.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Gibbons asked about the Rockingham Tourist Park.  A plan is being prepared for the development of the Rockingham Estate as a tourist park: there will be access roads and walks through woodland, camping and caravan sites, and so on.  This will, of course, depend on the provision of sufficient finance to enable the plan to be implemented.</P>
    <P>Deputy P. O'Donnell suggested that Bord Fáilte was wasting money in regard to taking part in angling festivals. I do not think anybody in the angling towns involved would agree with him&mdash;certainly in Westport, Moville or Rosslare&mdash;that money was being wasted.  The more anglers who come here the better, and the vast majority of these anglers encourage their families and friends to come over, resulting in the general growth of tourism.  That has been the case, particularly with French people, a great many of whom have come to this country to shoot snipe in the winter, as a result, originally, of having taken part in a sea-angling festival.</P>
    <P>A suggestion was also made that we had not done enough to encourage coarse fish angling.  The figures for that are that in 1960 the amount of money spent by the coarse fishermen was £336,000 and in 1965, it had grown more than double, to £832,000.  Organisation work is being conducted on a <Col N="1548" /> proper co-ordinated basis by Bord Fáilte, working in collaboration with the Inland Fisheries Trust.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell also asked about resort development in Bundoran.  This is going to proceed: there were difficulties in making the arrangements but a scenic car park is planned for Bayview Terrace in Bundoran.  This is to be undertaken with assistance from Bord Fáilte and an amenity grant from the Department of Local Government. The Department of Local Government requested one alteration in the design of the plan but Bord Fáilte do not expect that this will create any difficulties. We hope that the whole of the work will be effected in time for the 1967 season.</P>
    <P>A Deputy referred to the work of the Southern Regional Company, known sometimes as the Ivernia Board. This board like others receives a subvention from Bord Fáilte but I would remind Deputies that the tourist income from Cork and Kerry is reckoned to be about £6 million more than for the rates in both counties, which are £4 million, and we all look forward to seeing greater financial support for all these tourist areas or the regional tourist boards because they in future will have to do a great deal of the work which formerly was the work of Bord Fáilte and which, in other countries, is always the problem of the regional companies.</P>
    <P>Deputy James Tully criticised the regional tourist boards to some extent but I think if he reads the reports of all of the eight boards, he will find that allowing for the fact that last year was really their first year of operation, they are doing very good work.  In the information offices, they have accounted for over 93,000 bed-nights which they have booked.  They are also seeking more accommodation for inspection by Bord Fáilte; they collaborate with the local associations, they are assessing the tourist potential.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also made the very interesting suggestion that we should consider the mild winter climate as a tourist draw.  Bord Fáilte have worked out a list of marketable assets in this <Col N="1549" /> country, everything from skin diving, golf and archaeological monuments to the mild winter weather.  I hope that some day Deputy Tully's request will be possible and that Bord Fáilte will have a fund large enough to send special advertisements to dehydrated people all over the world saying: &ldquo;Come to the mild winter rain of Ireland&rdquo;&mdash;but I am afraid we are rather far from that yet; we have not reached the dizzy point of prosperity.</P>
    <P>In reply to Deputy Mullen, the registration of restaurants is not practicable at the moment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1550" /> I think I have dealt with all the questions with which I could possibly deal on the occasion of this debate.  I wish I had more time but there are a great many other Estimates to be gone through, and, if there are any interesting questions to be answered, I will communicate with the Deputies in question.</P>
    <P>Motion, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <P>Vote put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 24th November, 1966.</P>
