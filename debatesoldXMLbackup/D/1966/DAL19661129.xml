      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Lalor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Electricity Supply Board that Fuhir district is situated in Castletownbere rural area in which post-development work is at present in progress.  It is expected that Fuhir district should be recanvassed about March next and, if the results are satisfactory, supply should be extended about the end of next year.</P>
      <P>It is important that the maximum number of householders in Fuhir should agree to accept supply during the recanvass; the houses in the district are scattered and the refusal of some householders to take supply could have the effect of increasing substantially the terms to the remaining potential consumers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs if he will take immediate steps to have a telephone kiosk erected at Kilpedder, County Wicklow, particularly in view of the fact that the closure of the post office <Col N="1691" /> at Kilpedder has greatly increased the need for such a kiosk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The existing telephone facilities in the area are considered adequate and it is not proposed for the present to provide a kiosk there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the policy of the Department at present to deprive rural areas of all services so as to be able to supply the demands of the supermarkets in the larger cities?  Is that the new policy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The straightforward position is that so far as the telephone service is concerned, that service has not been reduced in any shape or form. The point is that the sub-post office was closed on 31st October, following the resignation of the subpost-master, but in the meantime the same facilities for the use of the telephone up to 9 o'clock at night are available as existed prior to the closing of the office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Parliamentary Secretary will appreciate that there is a difference between having a telephone in a post office which is open until 9 o'clock and in a private house the occupants of which have no obligation to stay open for the general public?  If a telephone had been put in <Col N="1692" /> a kiosk outside the location of the former post office, it would have solved the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>A problem has not arisen for solving.  The telephone is on the same premises.  It is available within the shop up to 9 o'clock at night as it was when the post office was in operation.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries what percentage of cows are at present being recorded; whether he is satisfied that the present system of marking calves sired by bulls standing at AI is sufficiently accurate to ensure that the progeny records themselves are completely accurate; and what figures are available concerning the national milk yields.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Boland) Kevin Boland">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the circular letter in question is rather lengthy, I am arranging, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to have it circulated with the Official Report.</P>
      <P>Following is the circular:</P>
      <P Just="Center">MODIFICATION OF DEFICIT PRINCIPLE.</P>
      <P Just="Center">REVIEW OF RENTS.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been represented to the Minister for Local Government that the arrangement, known as the &ldquo;deficit <Col N="1697" /> principle&rdquo;, has deterred some local authorities from reviewing the rents of their housing estates as a whole.  Under the deficit principle, if the loss on a housing scheme, after taking all rents into account, is less than the amount of State subsidy due for the scheme, the subsidy is reduced by the difference. This means that in some cases, particularly in the case of older schemes, the Exchequer, and not the local authority, gets the benefit of rent increases.</P>
    <P>In order to remove any deterrent to the review by local authorities of housing rents generally, on the lines recommended in paragraph 8 of this Department's circular letter (N 1/65) of 24th May, 1965, the Minister has decided, with the agreement of the Minister for Finance, that as from and including the current financial year the deficit principle should no longer apply to any scheme for which a loan was sanctioned by him:</P>
    <P>(1)  in the case of urban housing authorities, before 1st May, 1953, and</P>
    <P>(2)  in the case of rural housing authorities, before 1st April, 1960.</P>
    <P>This concession will result in an immediate financial gain to a number of housing authorities, particularly urban authorities.  It will also result in a considerable saving of staff time in local offices by eliminating detailed work required to complete annual subsidy claims for schemes coming within the concession.  The primary purpose of the concession, however, is to ensure that if local authorities decide that an increase in the rents payable by particular tenants of houses covered by the concession is equitable, the resultant increase in rental will accrue solely to the benefit of the housing account and will thus facilitate the reduction of rents where such is warranted.</P>
    <P>The need for such comprehensive reviews by most housing authorities will be apparent.  The economic rent of a house costing £2,200 is just under £3 10s a week plus rates.  Most local authority houses, except rural cottages, now cost more than £2,200.  The average cost of flats is, of course, considerably <Col N="1698" /> more.  As shown in the White Paper&mdash;<i>Housing: Progress and prospects,</i> the average rent in a recent year of county council houses was 5/- a week, week; the average for larger urban authorities was just under 15/- a week, while that for smaller urban authorities and towns was about 10/- a week. These averages are, of course, related to houses built when costs were lower as well as to new houses.</P>
    <P>The difference between what housing authorities spend on loan charges, maintenance, etc., and what they receive in rents and purchase annuities is, in the aggregate, substantial. In rural areas, for instance, county councils have been spending over four times as much as they receive.  The resulting loss is estimated at about £2.7 million.  Housing authorities other than county council spend just under twice what they receive and the resulting loss is estimated to be of the order of £2.9 million.  These losses, together with the loan charges of about £.4 million on capital grants for local authority houses paid in earlier years, bring the total loss on local authority housing to be borne by the rates and by central taxation to an estimated £6 million in the current financial year.</P>
    <P>With the increase in costs generally and with building programmes in prospect which will have as their objective the elimination of bad housing conditions wherever they exist, it is unlikely that the aggregate loss will fall. In many areas, particularly those of acute housing shortage, it may rise steeply.</P>
    <P>The Minister is concerned that the substantial contributions from public funds should be distributed equitably, so that those most in need benefit most from them. In particular, he would stress that no one in need of rehousing should have to be refused a house or should suffer hardship on account of inability to pay rent.  On the other hand, those who can afford to pay for their accommodation should be required to do so.  For this reason, the Minister proposes that housing authorities should now, following modification of the &ldquo;deficit principle&rdquo;, review the financing of their housing services to <Col N="1699" /> decide the extent to which some of the cost of housing now borne by the general body of ratepayers should be transferred to those tenants who are in a position to pay more for the accommodation provided.  In these reviews, the authority should have the object of ensuring that no applicant should be denied rehousing because of inability to pay more than the minimum rent and that each tenant pays a rent related to his family and financial circumstances and to the standard and amenity of the accommodation which he occupies. A memorandum on the subject is attached for guidance.</P>
    <P>Where rent increases are proposed following a review, housing authorities may find it desirable to apply them in stages over a period of years and so cushion their effect on individual tenants.  Housing authorities should also take the opportunity presented by the review to examine the general state of repair and standard of maintenance of their housing estate and, where necessary, work out a programme of repair and improvement to bring all their dwellings up to reasonable standards of repair, amenity and comfort. To encourage housing authorities in this object, the Minister has included in the Housing Bill, 1965, provision enabling him to pay substantial grants to housing authorities carrying out certain improvement works to their houses.</P>
    <P>The Minister will reintroduce the deficit principle in any area where it appears to him that the housing authority has not taken reasonable steps to rationalise their rental schemes. He will, therefore, require a report from each housing authority after 30th September, 1966, as to the action taken by them.  Any general adjustments made or provided for since 1st January, 1962, will be taken into account.</P>
    <P>Local authorities will be notified at a later stage of the particular schemes which come within the scope of the new arrangements and of the form of certification which will replace the present system of annual revenue accounts for these schemes.  Revenue accounts will, of course, continue to be <Col N="1700" /> required in the normal way in respect of schemes not coming within the new arrangements.</P>
    <P Just="Center">APPENDIX.</P>
    <P Just="Center">
      <i>Comprehensive Rent Reviews.</i>
    </P>
    <P>The ultimate aim of a comprehensive rent review should be to secure that, at the end of a reasonable transition period to be decided in the light of local circumstances&mdash;but in no case exceeding 5 years&mdash;the same type of rationalised renting structure will apply throughout the entire housing estate of the local authority.  It is suggested that the following procedure should be put in train to secure this objective:</P>
    <P>1.  The dwellings in the housing estate should be divided into a small number of categories based on the different standard of accommodation and amenities provided in the dwellings.</P>
    <P>2.  A decision should then be taken as to whether a graded or a differential rent system should be adopted. A system which grades rents in a scheme merely by reference to the type or location of houses is not regarded as appropriate to existing circumstances.  A graded rent system which provides for a series of rent levels related to fairly wide ranges of assessable incomes is appropriate to small housing estates where large scale fluctuations in the general pattern of family incomes are unlikely. A differential rent system&mdash;which provides for the payment of a fixed proportion of income as assessed by the local authority from time to time &mdash; is appropriate where the housing estate is large or where family incomes fluctuate fairly rapidly.  In calculating assessable income in both cases, deductions from gross income may be made for dependants, and a limit may be placed on the contributions which may be taken into account from wage earners, other than the principal wage earner.  A number of approved differential rent schemes currently in operation also provide for the exclusion, when assessing income, of certain <Col N="1701" /> items such as recent increases in a number of social welfare benefits. Children's allowances are also excluded when calculating assessable income.</P>
    <P>3.  A minimum and maximum rent should be fixed for each category of dwellings referred to at 1 above.</P>
    <P>4.  The maximum rent for the dwellings in each group should be equivalent to the rent based on the actual or estimated cost of providing similar accommodation at current prices, adjusted to the general standards and amenity of the dwellings, together with an amount calculated at 1% of such cost to cover maintenance, depreciation and administration.  In the calculation of the maximum rent, the payment by the housing authority of full annual loan charges excluding State subsidies or grants should be assumed.  The minimum rent should be a purely nominal figure intended to apply only to those of limited means.</P>
    <P>5.  In addition, the housing authority is required, by statute, to charge an amount in respect of rates on the dwellings. These charges in respect of rates are normally collected with the rent.  It should be made clear at every suitable opportunity that these rate payments are in no sense a charge for the use of the accommodation which the tenant occupies.</P>
    <P>6.  When the scheme is fully effective, each tenant should pay a rent related to:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) his family and financial circumstances; and</P>
    <P>(b) the standard and amenity of the accommodation which he occupies.</P>
    <P>In cases where a rent assessed on this basis would represent a large increase on the existing rent of particular tenants, rents might be adjusted by stages over a period until an appropriate point on their rental scale is reached.  Provision should be made <Col N="1702" /> in every scheme for the acceptance of a lower sum than the minimum necessary to cover the rent and rates on a house where the tenant is unable to pay this amount.  The full amount for rates on the authority's houses should, as at present, be transferred to the rates account.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 and 16 together.</P>
      <P>I have seen press reports referred to by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The capital allocation for local authority house-purchase loans and supplementary grants in the current financial year was increased since July by £550,000 to the record figure of £7,050,000, including an estimated £5,300,000 for house-purchase loans. Virtually all authorities are now in a position to accept new loan applications for payment in the current or in the next financial year, and I understand that the building societies who had temporarily suspended the taking <Col N="1703" /> of new loan applications intend to start receiving them again early in the new year.  Accordingly, I do not consider that any further increase in the allocation for local authority house-purchase loans for the current financial year is necessary at this stage.  I am, however, keeping the position under continuous review.</P>
    <P>No representations as to the inadequacy of the existing loan limits have been made to me since the limits were increased in June, 1965, and, in fact, a high proportion of the loans made by local authorities are considerably below these limits.</P>
    <P>Studies being undertaken by An Foras Forbartha and the practical operations of new systems such as those in Ballymun may help to achieve some stabilisation in house prices. These prices, however, reflect the movement in wages and prices generally, and I do not think that a general investigation of current prices of grant type houses would serve any useful purpose at this stage.</P>

      <P>The total number of children of school-going age in the Edenmore, Bonnybrook, Santry and Ballymun newly developing areas will be approximately 11,870 on the basis of the building schemes at present proposed for these being completed.</P>
      <P>The question of providing school accommodation in newly developing areas can only be determined when firm building estimates are available from the local authorities and when it is apparent that the proposed schemes will come to fruition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be appreciated, therefore, that while the Department begins to carry <Col N="1709" /> out its survey of the school accommodation requirements immediately firm proposals of house building are available it is understandable that there must be a time lag between the actual building of the houses and the schools since some delays must inevitably arise in the school managers' procuring sites and taking out title to them, and for other reasons.</P>

Last year my predecessor suffered an attack from the same source with regard to comprehensive schools.  Now that the matter has been brought up, I might say that my predecessor received from the Provincial of the reverend gentleman's Order a letter of apology informing my predecessor that the Reverend T.

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 34, 35 and 36, together.</P>
      <P>As was announced by my predecessor in the Dáil in May last, the Industrial Development Authority are engaged in making a reappraisal of the approach to the attraction of foreign industry to Ireland.  The need for such a reappraisal has been made more urgent by developments both here and elsewhere.  These include the prospect of our entry to the Common Market and the Free Trade Area Agreement with Britain.  An important consideration is that the incentives available elsewhere in Europe, especially in Northern Ireland and in Britain, have altered considerably since the Irish incentives were introduced.  As the attraction of outside industry is a highly competitive field this too suggests the importance and urgency of a reassessment of our incentives.</P>
      <P>On the recommendation of the Industrial Development Authority, it was decided to engage the services of a firm of consultants with considerable world wide experience in this work to assist the Authority in the reappraisal. The services of this firm were engaged early in April of this year.  Representatives of the firm have visited Ireland in connection with their assignment at various dates since then.  No representative of the firm is permanently based in Ireland in connection with the assignment.  The question of the publication of any reports arising will be considered when the reports in question are received.  As I indicated recently an interim report is expected soon from the firm of consultants.</P>

      <P>When progress was reported last week, we were discussing the question of support for the Garda Síochána in the course of their duties.  The first point under that heading was that individual gardaí carrying out duties like patrols should have the necessary support, that it is unwise to send individual men on foot and that every foot patrol should consist of at least two and that communicating machinery such as radios should be provided.  On the wider question of supporting the Force as a whole in carrying out their duties, we must ask questions about&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>A good deal of that, but also about what happens to the criminal when detected and brought to court and afterwards.  It is obviously very discouraging to a police force if they have gone to a lot of trouble to apprehend in the case of serious crime and having succeeded, find their work is virtually rendered useless either by the inadequacy of the sentence or the too-early release of the offender.  I want to make clear that I am not going at all contrary to the general intention the Minister has expressed regarding probation and rehabilitation of offenders.  That is excellent work and if done on a sufficiently big scale, and intelligently, can be of great benefit to the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no sense in getting sloppily sentimental about the offender at the cost or expense of the law-abiding citizens.  Certainly it is getting our priorities mixed up if we are prepared to be over-lenient with the offender and not equally prepared to protect law-abiding citizens.  While I completely commend the Minister's efforts at a rational approach to rehabilitation of offenders and while I also agree <Col N="1722" /> with the point of view that if this could be achieved and if the number of offenders who repeat is minimised, this is very much in the public interest, on the other hand, there is the hard core of criminals, to use a phrase I used last week.  So long as there is an organised community, and particularly organised communities such as you have in modern cities, there will be a number of criminals&mdash;let us use the proper word&mdash;whether they are apprehended on the first offence or whether they are repeaters.  For them, the only treatment must be a punishment which will be a deterrent, and not only that, but they must be isolated from the community so that they cannot perpetrate their wills on the community in the unlawful manner they are inclined to adopt.</P>
    <P>I am not one who will condemn old-fashioned punishment on the ground that a deterrent does not work.  Too often we hear it said and argued in academic circles and circles remote from the actuality of the criminal in society, that there are no such things as deterrents, that neither capital punishment nor imprisonment work as deterrents.  Frankly, I do not subscribe to that view.  I believe that in the severity of the sentence, there is a very real deterrent.  I know there are people who have been watching the experiments in Britain and who have come to the same conclusion.  It is customary on the part of people who advocate the abolition of such penalties in the comfortable academic atmosphere in which these things are often discussed to cry out &ldquo;inhumanity&rdquo; immediately people express such views.  Unfortunately, we have to deal with a very real problem and at a very early stage you must face the fact that either you are going to deal with crime or you are not.  All the evidence in the experimental period that we have seen since the war is that crime, if not dealt with, grows.  I am speaking of the serious type of crime.</P>
    <P>To return to the point in regard to the police force, it appears to me that it is necessary to back a good police force by adequate sentences, and I mean sentences of imprisonment. Furthermore, I believe that one can <Col N="1723" /> make a mistake in going too far in making prisons homes from home. These may be very unpopular things to say, but on the other hand, there are citizens who very frequently come up against lawlessness and who need the services of a good police force.  It is worthwhile listening to them also. I remember the occasion when the abolition of capital punishment was being debated here and when the Bill was passed.  I am not specifically referring here to capital punishment, though I would put no limit on punishment where, say, a police officer or somebody who is carrying out a duty on behalf of the community has been murdered.  I do not want to confine myself to that type of crime.  I am talking about crime such as those occasioning personal injuries, organised robberies and other serious crimes. When this Bill was going through the House, I remember meeting, not very far from this Chamber, some women who were very vocal indeed and pointed out the dangers that there are in cities for women.  It would have been interesting to hear their point of view on the Bill, which certainly was not in support of it.</P>
    <P>I have read in such places as the Garda magazine statements about the danger to citizens in certain areas.  I am satisfied that if it were not for the Garda force we have, we would have as high an incidence of that type of crime as you read about across the water.  My fear is that the very growth of our metropolitan area will bring an increase in that kind of crime if nothing is done about it.  The thing that must be done is to protect the good record of the police and we have no hesitation in drawing attention to the need for adequate sentences.  I do not think it would be proper for me to comment on any particular sentence or to suggest sentences are not adequate.  That suggestion has been made in certain cases, but the point is that, in principle and in practice, the sentences should be adequate to support the police, if for no other reason.</P>
    <P>That brings me to a very interesting and delicate question, the availability of <Col N="1724" /> accommodation for offenders.  I do not think I should go further than ask the Minister whether the problem and expense of housing convicted criminals has anything to do with the customary length of sentence.  I leave that to the Minister to answer in his own way.  For instance, how far are sentences commuted in the case of serious crime? What length of sentence is served as against the normal length?</P>
    <P>These are vital questions.  I am not thinking of the criminal involved nor do I begrudge to any criminal the remission he may get so that he is released at a much earlier stage than the sentence nominally imposed would indicate, but I am concerned with the possible repercussions on the working of the Garda force.  Not only must we underline for the Minister the question of protecting the garda personally but also the question of supporting the Force as a whole in carrying out their duties.</P>
    <P>In that connection, too, I mention warders.  They are a class who also need support.  I would ask the Minister how do the conditions of service of warders compare with those of other public servants, in regard to leave, pay and other matters of that nature.  The time has come to recognise that these public servants, like the gardaí&mdash;and teachers although that comes under another Estimate&mdash;are at least entitled to the same standard of living and scale of remuneration afforded to public servants in any other grade or class.  It is merely a traditional distinction that has been carried on.  There is no very sound basis for it.  Take the police officer, for instance.  He is a highly skilled technical man in our modern society.  He is no longer merely what the old-fashioned police officer was, say, one hundred years ago.  I therefore make that general suggestion about the incomes of the gardaí and the warders particularly.  In regard to the leave granted to warders in our service, I should like to know how that can be adjusted.  I should like to know also if there are enough warders in proportion to the number of prisoners they have to guard.  In any event, their conditions of service require some improvement.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1725" /> On the question of the publicity given to crime, I think it is important that the community should be aware of what the position is with regard to crime.  I do not think the police can object to that; indeed one of the greatest supports for the police is the fact that the public become apprehensive with regard to crime and are willing to support the police.  In this connection, if more information were made available by the Garda authorities, a number of the difficulties that have arisen in this regard might be solved.  I shall content myself at this stage with just that remark.</P>
    <P>The last matter I wish to talk about is this question of juries.  In this Estimate, I take it, we are merely concerned with juries in criminal cases.  Is that not so?  I have voiced the opinion here before now that the civil juries are largely things of the past, anachronisms.  Certainly in the Circuit Court they were made obsolete by the Act passed some time before the war which made appeal to the High Court take place by re-trial.  The situation then was that in the case of a jury trial in the Circuit Court, the appeal could come to a judge of the High Court, and that it would be discharged in that way.</P>
    <P>I forget how the thing worked out in detail but the point I am making is: in present day circumstances, are juries required in civil cases?  In the days when judges might be considered to have restricted knowledge of the world and merely learned in the law, the theory of having a jury to help them to assess the facts&mdash;I am talking of civil cases now&mdash;may have had a lot to commend it but in modern conditions it is very hard to see what advantage the verdict of a jury will have over the verdict of a judge.</P>

      <P>I will try to avoid it.  I am not advocating legislation.  You would be, you see, because the administration is laid down by legislation&mdash;I admit that, a Cheann Comhairle.  The question of the abolition of juries has been raised here and all I want to say is that it seems that if the ultimate appeal is to a court, the Supreme Court, without a jury, there is not much reason for having a jury.  After all, what do juries do?  They assess damages; they find certain facts.  Would you not, in modern circumstances, get a better level of objective justice in regard to a case from a trained judge?</P>
      <P>Having said that about civil juries, it is a different question in criminal cases.  The idea of trial by jury there is that the man is tried by his equals and the guarantee of impartiality is that so many men and women banded together in a jury come to a decision and that decision is the guarantee that there is more than one mind involved. The objection to the judge alone finding the verdict is that there is only one mind involved.  I think the problem there is much more difficult.  There is a very strong case for retaining the jury in criminal cases, although jury services are a hard thing and often an imposition on the individual juror and, although juries do occasionally bring in extraordinary verdicts, judges are equally capable of going off the rail on a question of fact.  On balance, therefore, the question is, should juries be retained and, on balance, the answer should be yes, notwithstanding the objections that are there.</P>
      <P>I know that a person looking at it from the administrative side, from the police side, may take another view but it is a very sound principle of law that no man should be deemed guilty until he is proved so, that the presumption of innocence should still be there in our law and the only safeguard of that presumption is either an extraordinarily objective judiciary or a jury.  I should say the only guarantee is both, that you must have an objective judiciary&mdash;and we have that, thank goodness&mdash;and a jury.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Guilty people will get off but there is much less risk of innocent people <Col N="1727" /> being found guilty under the jury system.  Guilty people will get off but it is equally a sound legal principle in a democracy that it is better that ten guilty men should escape than that one innocent man should be wrongfully found guilty.  It is the application of this principle that is difficult here and it may seem contradictory, having said what I said earlier, that the police will find a man discharged in court.  The answer to that is that the rule will make for better police work.  It will certainly make for better detail and discipline in police work as it has heretofore both here and across the water and it would be preferable to have the system as it is than to have a system that could in any way degenerate into a mechanical method of securing convictions, obviating the need for detailed work.  That would be a temptation to the morale of the gardaí themselves. So that, on the whole, where this question arises, it would be better to leave juries and to balance the penalties.</P>
    <P>I suppose we will hear more on this subject and it is a subject that can certainly be debated.  I have not even attempted to answer a number of the points that could be made.  I merely want to point out that what I have said here is in no way inconsistent with what I have said before because the overall objective, whether you are looking at it from the point of view of the police or looking at it from the point of view of the citizen, is the overall good of the community.  If I were to say more, I would be repeating what I have said on the last day and that would be out of order.</P>
    <P>There is one thing that I should say about the Minister and his Department, that it is refreshing to see the constructive thinking that is going on, especially in this part about punishment.  I know the considerable efforts that have been made to take an interest in police problems and to find the correct solution, both from the point of view of the force and the public.  This Department has this creditable record for the year and the Minister as the head of <Col N="1728" /> the Department may well be offered congratulations and the hope that some of the tasks which are being examined and under way will be brought to a fruitful conclusion as quickly as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>In the subject of crime and punishment coming under the Estimate, we can all take our area of particular interest and concentrate on that.  In this broad area of crime and punishment, for which the Minister's Department is responsible, I should like to discuss this evening an aspect of justice which is not often referred to but which I think it important should be referred to.  I refer to the prison service.  I want to refer to some problems that I see arising in the prison service and there are some points and questions which I should like to put to the Minister and I would be interested in his replies and to know his attitude towards them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First of all, it should be said that the task of the persons now involved in the prison service is a far more complicated and demanding job than was the case for those involved in our prison service before the war.  The Minister referred to the increasing need for qualified prison officers, that new ideas about the rehabilitation of prisoners were making more and more demands on warders and that they themselves should match the changed conditions by being qualified to help in the rehabilitation of prisoners.  The question was asked: with whom could we compare the prison officers?  I think the answer is we can scarcely compare them with anyone.  I do not know of anybody else in public employment so subject to the 24-hour clock and to the strains of the prison service as they are.  I know of no other body of men in public employment who receive such little public credit for their work.  In fact, the reverse would be nearer the truth.  The whole weight of propaganda in newspapers and on television&mdash;indeed we do not get many public announcements praising them&mdash;seems to be against those who work in the prison service.  It requires to be said that the kind of <Col N="1729" /> ideas people had about our prisons and prison officers are no longer true. The prison today is a rehabilitation unit where skilled and important work is carried out.  The people who staff this service are not sufficiently recognised, either in their conditions of work or in the general estimation of the importance of their work.</P>
    <P>We should bear in mind that the hours of attendance of a prison officer are quite exceptional in their length. They work a 90-hour fortnight.  One should look at this working period and ask is it really necessary that the prison officer engaged in such demanding work should be employed over this length of time.  There is a main daily shift of eight hours, exclusive of meal times.  This means they work an average of ten hours per day.  They have two meal breaks, breakfast and dinner, of one hour each.  The main reason for these backbreaking hours of work is the actual shortage of staff in our prison service.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister if he and his officials have considered why there is this shortage of staff in the prison service.  Would it be that the conditions of work now obtaining in the service have dropped far behind the conditions obtainable elsewhere in the community?  If this is the case, would they address themselves to the problem without delay?  This period of continuous duty of ten hours per day may be over three, four, 11 or 12 week periods.  Indeed, it is possible under the present system that a prison officer may not have had a rest-day off in over three months.  If it is important to attract the right people into the service, people who should get the opportunity themselves of studying the most up-to-date rehabilitation techniques, surely it follows they will not be got on the basis of the present working week and the rates of pay paid?</P>
    <P>Furthermore, why is it not possible that overtime should not be paid to people with such long hours of work? I understand that in the Civil Service generally if an officer is required to work on his day off, he is compensated by some kind of overtime at <Col N="1730" /> time and a half or double time.  This does not happen in the case of the prison officer unless the man is given time off within a six week period.  We will have to consider overtime payments for these officers in respect of any period they are asked to do overtime work or week-end duty.  While on this matter of overtime work, from what I know of the British prison service, they are extremely careful to see their officers are not overworked to the extent that they have no rest-days off over many months or that they are required, because of shortage of staff, to work week-ends.  They avoid the possibility of their officers being called on to work for long periods in the tension of the prison.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to ensure that the Minister will not allow to escape from his mind the pay and overtime conditions of those in our prison service.  I bring these matters to his attention to get his opinion on these problems, with which, I am sure, he is concerned.  I want to get some assurance that the prison officers' conditions of work and overtime payments will be given priority treatment in the year ahead.  The prison officer is often compared with the psychiatric nurse.  However, at present the conditions of the psychiatric nurse&mdash;whatever room for improvement may be there&mdash;are incomparably better than those of the prison officer.  The Minister should without delay look into the problem of overlong working hours in the prison service, too little time off, and should also have a fresh look at the rates of pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present, due to the shortage of staff, it is possible that a prison officer may be asked to work his rest-day or <Col N="1731" /> to work week-ends.  He can no longer look forward with certainty to planned leisure with his family.  Far more than the criminal he has to look after, he has become a hostage of the prison in which he works.  It is the prison officer's job to maintain his sanity in a rather difficult situation.  If we do not give him time off to renew his energies, we cannot expect him to be on top of his form in dealing with his exacting task.</P>
    <P>Is it not a fact that at present, if because of some domestic problem such as sickness he needs a day off, he has to make individual arrangements with another officer to ensure that he can have it?  Surely we can get a more enlightened way of dealing with this matter?  It should be possible to facilitate an officer if he requires some time off his duty roster. The Minister should try to ensure that each officer will get off every alternate weekend and should not have the experience of working weekend in and weekend out over a period of months. The position is so bad at the moment that there is a shortage of staff.  We are not attracting young men into the service and those whom we are attracting into it are not staying.  If the Minister shows himself to be concerned with the treatment of prisoners and with this problem in its totality, then surely he must be concerned to improve the conditions of the people looking after the prisoners?  Concern for the prisoners must be paralleled with just treatment and adequate conditions for those who look after the prisoners.</P>
    <P>At the moment, we are not getting sufficient young people to come into the service and those who do enter it are, in fact, leaving it as rapidly as possible.  It must follow in the promotion of men to fill the most senior posts in the service that the standards will not be up to the required level if we do not get a sufficient number of suitable people in the first place.  I imagine that the expectations of the young men and women entering the service today are not fulfilled in two vital respects.  There are the long hours of duty which the young person must <Col N="1732" /> consider.  There is no certainty of time off and there are insufficient rest days. There is no hope of any arrangement for alternate week-ends off duty.  This all adds up to the impossibility of the young person who enters the service continuing a normal social life and, with that limitation on his entry into the service, from the very beginning, it is no wonder that we are not getting the proper type of young person to enter the service.</P>
    <P>Would it be true to say that if a young officer in the prison service wants a night off he has to make written application to get it off?  Is this the position at the moment?  I am not quite sure but I should like some enlightenment on whether such a procedure is, in fact, necessary at the moment.  If a young prison officer at the moment is a single man, is he compelled to live within the prison? Is this a requirement at the moment? If they are living outside the prison, is it a requirement that they must be inside the prison by 11.30 each night? If this is the situation, one may fairly ask who is being detained, the warder or the prisoner?  Naturally, a single officer does not wish to return to his place of work before 11.30 on his night off.  If he has alternative living accommodation outside the prison, and even if he is not using the accommodation in the prison service, is it a fact that £1 a week is deducted for accommodation which he is not using?</P>
    <P>The comparable position in Britain is completely different.  At any rate, a living-out allowance is paid to people living outside the prison.  The whole drift in the British prison service is towards encouraging an officer, where possible, to live outside the environment of the prison.  It would not be remarkable to find a desire in those living practically 24 hours a day, working without time off, in the environment of the prison to have their houses elsewhere and as far away as possible from their place of work.  Is it a fact that young officers at the moment in our prison service in Mountjoy, who are living in, find themselves in cells formerly used by prisoners?  Is the accommodation, with some minimum improvements, of the same dimensions as the accommodation previously reserved <Col N="1733" /> for those detained there at the State's pleasure as a result of one crime or another?</P>
    <P>Certainly, I am not one to criticise the improvements made in the lot of prisoners over the years.  This is part of our new enlightened approach to the problem of crime in general.  I suggest, however, that it is extremely important that our concern for the prisoners should be paralleled by an equally strong concern for the conditions of work of those who look after them. If the proper treatment of crime is seen to be one that must be tackled with skill and by trained people, then every possible opportunity should be given to the officers involved in this training and rehabilitation to qualify themselves through the medium of new courses at the university, and so on.  I have in mind their release to attend day courses at the university.  They should be enabled to attend the new courses in sociology in general, and so on, at the university so that the ordinary prison officer is actually given his training in this respect.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the attendance of two senior officers of his Department at the United Nations congress held in Stockholm on the prevention of crime and the treatment of offenders.  Has any report been sent to the practitioners in our prison service on the findings of the two gentlemen who attended that congress or has their report been filed away in the Department? Have the two officers concerned reported back, by any means or process, to the practitioners in the prison service?  Would it be possible that, in the future, the people to be considered for attendance at any of these meetings in Stockholm, Britain or elsewhere, would be the people concerned in the day to day working in our prisons?  I should not, let us say, wish to limit the release of the higher officers of the Minister's Department for such work: I do not wish to deny them a weekend or two in Stockholm, for example. However, if they spend a period abroad I suggest that they bring home a report and pass the information back to the ordinary Joe Soap in the prison service.  This is the least that we could expect of them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1734" /> The Minister referred to the hostel opened in 1964 for prisoners and quite rightly he is proud of this situation.  I consider that equal priority should be given to the important problem of the accommodation of officers who are compelled to live in.  They should not have to occupy merely the same cell dimensions as, previously, prisoners were compelled to occupy. They should be given the opportunity, with an allowance, to live outside the environment of the prison.  If this Victorian rule exists that they must report back to the prison before 11.30 on each night off, then I ask the Minister to consider this matter without delay.</P>
    <P>If a hostel for prisoners in Mountjoy was opened in 1964, it should have been followed, if not simultaneously, by the opening of special quarters for single officers who live within the prison.  Surely decent accommodation for single officers is equally important?  Perhaps the Minister, when referring to the many arms of his Department, might spare some time to inform the public more fully than they appear to be informed at the moment of the rather tough job prison officers have to carry out, although I know it does not fall within his terms of reference.</P>
    <P>Whilst many people today welcome the improved attitude towards the proper treatment of crime and the rehabilitation of criminals, there appears to be a note of laxity growing up in the press and on television, where crime is considered as a sort of Robin Hood type of occupation which appears to elevate the criminal into a kind of hero in our modern society.  Recently I saw on the Telefís Éireann Late Late Show a man whose chief claim to fame is that he got out of more prisons in England than any other person.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already referred to an important matter, and I am sorry to have to emphasise it, but I think it important that it should be emphasised. Are we so hard up in the matter of getting suitable people into our prison service that there are absolutely no recognised standards of entry to this service?  Surely there is something illogical here?  There is something illogical, in that we accept the fact that people who come in at one end of the scale under conditions which are so unattractive, may not be the proper people. Surely there is something illogical in reducing all standards at commencement and expecting people of high standards to emerge for higher jobs? Perhaps the Minister and his Department would give this their very earnest consideration at an early date.</P>
      <P>I understand the status of this service is so low at the moment that there are, in fact, posters displayed in all our employment exchanges looking for prison officers.  If there is an urgent need for prison officers, surely the matter should be seriously inquired into?  Perhaps the Minister could set up an inquiry by appointing some civil servants and prison officers&mdash;perhaps like the two or three who went to Stockholm&mdash;who would look into the problem and see why our staffing position is so low at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand the Minister has invited some Deputies to visit Mountjoy.  I hope that if any Deputy goes to Mountjoy, <Col N="1736" /> at the pleasure of the State, some improvements will be made in the conditions of the staff before this takes place.  The Minister should ensure that higher civil servants visit Mountjoy more often so as to see whether there can be improvements in the Victorian conditions there.  I would suggest that some of the diehard traditionalists in the Minister's Department should be combed out or sent somewhere for a rehabilitation course with regard to the priorities in the prison service.  I have no doubt that civil servants may amass a great deal of knowledge in their years in the Department of Justice.</P>
    <P>I would suggest to the Minister that he should be aware of this problem and see that his Department is up to date on it.  He should allow no artificial hindrance in his Department to the winds of change and he should ensure that there will be better treatment for our prison staff, following which the morale will be better.  All I am saying is that the morale in the prison service is very low and that it will be improved only provided conditions can also be improved.</P>
    <P>If morale among the staff is as low as I suggest it is, then, equally, a big problem will be the actual maintenance of discipline in the prisons. We cannot expect that this discipline will be maintained by a staff whose morale is as low as we accept it is. Shortage of staff, arises because of long hours of work, low rates of pay and lack of acknowledgment by the Minister's Department as to the importance of the prison officer.  There is a lack of public knowledge of the Victorian conditions in which a single officer must live.  If the prison officer is a man who has to be fully trained and if he has reached the full status of this office, we cannot treat him as a juvenile or as some one tied to the prison, by out of date conditions.</P>
    <P>In an examination of the conditions of work of those involved in our prison services, we should also consider the conditions of the women involved in those services.  Theirs is a task dealing with women prisoners which is an arduous and unpleasant job.  They are employed under the same bad conditions <Col N="1737" /> of work as I have outlined for the male staff.  I should like the Minister to state whether it has been found possible to retain the female staff at full strength.  As in the male sector, does it also happen that there is a shortage of female staff?  Has the Minister an answer to this and does he propose to take steps to improve the position so as to attract staff?</P>
    <P>Would the position be that there have been resignations over the past year or two in the female staff and is it the position that there have been resignations in the male staff also? Have these resignations been confined to young men or are they common to all grades?  The more we can see the prison officer as a social worker in a civilised job, the more we must see his or her status is enchanced by proper training and better working conditions, we will then be going in the right direction in improving the morale in the present service.  An improvement in morale is possible if we carry out all the improvements which the Minister can effect.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister has it in his terms of reference to do something about this conspiracy in the press which appears to aim itself directly at the people who man the prison service, suggesting that here we have people who are tyrants in their own way.  The situation here is that none of these people, man or woman, has any protection against those unfair attacks from outside.  I suggest that the Minister should consider&mdash;and this is something which he might also consider in relation to the police where a policeman is unfairly attacked in the press or elsewhere&mdash;the kind of review board that was suggested for New York, where officers in either the police or the prison service could have a chance of answering such criticisms and that they should not always be seen to be at the receiving end of unjust and inaccurate criticism. People in our prison service should have some means of answering their critics who appear to be very strong in the press and also on television, in contributing to this general picture which sees the criminal as a kind of <Col N="1738" /> Robin Hood and the prison officers, the people who are paid with the taxpayer's money and are the upholders of the law, as some kind of squares to whom the community does not owe any thanks.  The Minister should look at this.</P>
    <P>There is another point in regard to our prison service.  I remarked on the lack of morale.  It is important that justice is seen to prevail in the matter of people serving sentences in Irish prisons.  I should like to ask the Minister a question and ask him to answer it as fairly as he can.  Would it be true to say that those who come from better-off sections of our community find themselves out of prison faster than those who come from working-class homes?</P>

I admit I stand open to correction.  It was an impression I had on the basis of some experiences that have been brought to me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I will drop that then. If the Minister thought there was anything in it, I would have asked him to reply to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like the Minister, if he can, and I think it is in his own interest that he should do so, to tackle the problem to which I refer.  I have, to the best of my ability, avoided the more sensational aspects of the problems that come within the coverage of his Department.  Crime is the subject of sensationalism in our press.  One may chase several hares and take many lines of territory here.  My line of territory <Col N="1739" /> and what I am concerned with is an attempt to get more action taken and my feeling is that the people in our prison service at the moment are not getting fair recognition of their work and redress of their grievances seems to be closed against them.  It is time we re-evaluated their work.  If, in industrial employment, it is seen to be necessary to have job evaluation which will evaluate the job in accordance with the needs of the time, surely it is time we re-evaluated the job that a prison officer must do in 1966?  Surely the re-evaluation should result in better conditions, better treatment of these officers, a better recruitment system which would create a larger pool of qualified people to call on?  If their conditions were better, if their accommodation were looked into and proper allowances given to them, it would be money well spent and would surely be an important item in seeing that the prison service is staffed by suitable people.</P>
    <P>I had meant to say something on the Garda Síochána but I think other Members will be covering that.  I shall just make one observation and the Minister can answer it one way or the other.  It appears to me there is a real problem for the Garda Síochána in the years ahead in that they appear to be becoming mere slaves of the motor car in our urban areas.  I do not know what period of a garda's time is allocated to the parking of cars, traffic guidance and all the problems the increasing use of the motor car creates, but it seems to me there is a grave danger that the community will begin to regard the garda as a kind of traffic warden.  It seems the community is being extremely unjust in expecting the police force to do all this and to be absolutely on its toes in the detection of crime.</P>
    <P>They will have to ask themselves whether they want the present situation to continue, in which the Garda Síochána in most of our cities and towns are becoming traffic wardens rather than policemen, or whether the time has come when we must reconsider what the policeman's job should <Col N="1740" /> be in relation to the motor car.  Should we in fact try to bring in auxiliary people, part-time people, to look after the motorist and free the policemen of this problem?  It seems that he is at the beck and call of one section of the community, the section having motor cars, and that the traditional role which the community is supposed to call on him to play must suffer as a result of so much time spent with problems connected with the automobile.</P>
    <P>I do not know what expenditure is involved but it seems to me we run a serious risk of complete maladjustment and misrepresentation of what the duties of our police force should be. Are they to be seen more and more in this guise of serving the needs of the motor car in our cities and towns? We should look at this situation in the near future and decide one way or the other what we want in this connection because it appears to me that the budget for this Department will reach astronomical limits unless we come to some decision.</P>
    <P>There is one arm of the law to which I contribute more than many other individuals&mdash;the £1 on-the-spot fines. It is a very efficient service, unfortunately for me.  Would it not be possible for people with bicycles, motorcycles and other two-wheeled vehicles, when they transgress the law in a traffic matter, to benefit by, or at least to have the option of an on-the-spot fine rather than the method at the moment where a working man can find himself having to take a day off work because he has to appear in court?  Surely the convenience of the law which is at the disposal of motorists in regard to their penalties should also be at the disposal of the people who are still stuck with bicycles? Would the Minister consider this possibility?</P>
    <P>In conclusion, the Department of Justice and its top officials would, in my opinion, be doing an extremely valuable job if they looked into the conditions in the Irish prison service. While we must respect people who have expert knowledge of their subject, <Col N="1741" /> we must bear in mind that the change has been so dramatic in the treatment of criminals in recent years and there has been such a rush of innovations that roles have changed in this matter of treatment of crime and the prison officer who a few years ago was regarded as somebody who kept people in jail is now seen to be more or less a rehabilitating agent in the treatment of prisoners.  In this situation of the enhanced importance of his role today, his conditions should be related to this new status.  It is my argument that his status today does not get the kind of recognition, either in his conditions of work or his pay, that it should.  It is my contention that the shortage of staff is due to the unattractive conditions of employment and my contention also that we are not, in the more demanding conditions of today's prison service, giving the prison officer a chance to do a good job in the interests of the community as a whole.</P>

      <P>There are some things, which may not be so bitterly contested by Fine Gael, to which I should like to refer now.  I have noticed a great lack of uniformity on the part of the courts in imposing fines and sentences. In a district court in Tipperary, for example, a certain fine or penalty will be imposed in a certain case.  In another district court, there will be an entirely different penalty for what looks like the same offence.  That seems to be the pattern all over the country. Again, some district justices like to <Col N="1744" /> pontificate and to lecture the public, defendants and plaintiffs.  That is not their business.  A court should dispense justice and it should be a uniform type of justice.  In one part of the country the fine for not having a light on one's bicycle may be 2/- or 5/-; in another part of the country it may be £1.  Parking offences are treated in the same way.  Has the Minister any power to ensure uniformity of penalties? People are rather perturbed over this. Some years ago I heard some Minister for Justice state that there would be consultations between justices of the district court under the Principal Justice in an effort to hammer out some kind of agreement, but that agreement has not been hammered out.</P>
      <P>I know one particular part of my constituency in which extraordinary sentences have been meted out, the like of which is not found in any other area.  As a result, when a defendant knows he is to come up before District Justice X, he will submit a doctor's certificate, if he can get one, and keep on postponing his case until this particular justice, who is noted for his attention to a certain type of offence, is out of the way, on holidays, golfing, or for some such reason, so that District Justice Y will hear the case. Justice Y's views are known and his judgments are not as harsh or severe as those of the ordinary occupant of the bench in that particular area.</P>
      <P>Another matter to which I should like to refer is the granting of bail to prisoners.  Most criminals are aware that no matter what the Garda say about the matter, if they have recourse to a superior court, the High Court or the Supreme Court, they secure freedom on bail until their offence is tried and, in the meantime, they are at liberty to continue&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCarty" hpid="Mr. Carty Mr. Carty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carty</NameTxt>
      <P>This is something the Minister for Justice, if he can, should legislate for, because these crimes often continue unabated until the original offence comes before the justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem of juvenile delinquency has been mentioned in the course of <Col N="1745" /> the debate.  Opinions are divided as to the cause of juvenile delinquency. Some of them are believed to be social; I think most of them are parental, and blatant exploitation by juveniles is practised in the country at present. They are allowed to go into off-licence shops to purchase drinks, to consume this liquor at parties, in clubs and in such places.  I know, of course, that wonderful work in the field of rehabilitation of youth is being done and great credit is due to the organisers responsible for these clubs and this training; but if we want to stamp out juvenile delinquency, somebody will have to establish social centres for these young people so that they can meet, under proper supervision, and enjoy themselves.</P>
    <P>I met a German social worker recently who was amazed to see so many youths in our big centres standing at corners and ganging up in cafes and so on.  Now, while I express no great admiration for the Germans, I think he had a point.  He said: &ldquo;You must have juvenile delinquency in this country if you have no places for these young people to go, if there is no place for them to amuse themselves under proper supervision, because, if they are allowed to congregate in these places&mdash;gaming establishments, et cetera&mdash;you are bound to have trouble&rdquo;.  They have the same situation in the United States of America, where serious criminal gangs are recruited from young people who congregate in places similar to those to which I refer.</P>
    <P>The present-day teenager has come in for a lot of criticism, much of which, I think, is unfounded.  I have seen a programme on television&mdash;I think it is &ldquo;Teen Talk&rdquo;&mdash;and it is noticeable that many of these young people are highly intelligent, very articulate, far more articulate than many of us here and better able to express their opinions, whether or not their opinions agree with ours.  We should have some sympathy for these young people; somebody should see they are guided along the proper lines, should see to it that they have proper places for amusement, so that full use may be made <Col N="1746" /> of their undoubted talents.  Of course, many of us get annoyed when we see their long hair, and I am one who might be naturally annoyed at that, and their fanciful dress, but these are only passing phases.  Basically, the youth of today are just as good as any generation before them.</P>
    <P>I think most Deputies will agree with me in what I am about to say now in relation to criticism of gardaí all too frequently in courts today, especially by some learned judges who should know better.  I do not want to mention specifically any judge but there was a case recently&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelCarty" hpid="Mr. Carty Mr. Carty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carty</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not refer to that but there was a case recently in which a very learned judge of our courts made very strong criticism of the conduct of a garda on duty.  Attacks of this kind on members of the Garda by judges appal me.  They should not be made, especially at the level at which this particular attack was made, and I feel sure that somebody somewhere should be in a position to tell him that he is doing no good for the Garda force and certainly not promoting the confidence of the people in this excellent Force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The detection of crime and its prevention, where possible, are in many cases due to a good spirit, if it exists, between the local gardaí and the community they serve and, in particular, to the esteem and common sense which the local sergeant displays.  Indeed, good crime detection, and prevention &mdash;which is more important than detection&mdash;are, in most cases, due to a good spirit between the people and the Garda, and especially to the character and ability of the local sergeant. If you have a good sergeant in a community, who establishes good relationships with the people of the community <Col N="1747" /> he serves, and with members of the Force, you will not have much crime in that area, but if you have a Garda sergeant, with gardaí serving under him, who is intent on getting cases and on getting his gardaí to fill their books with one charge after another, all calculated to irritate the local people, how can you expect that when serious crime breaks out, the people will co-operate with the Garda in detecting it?</P>
    <P>There should be co-operation and willingness to assist in every way possible. This should be two-way traffic. The Garda should not lean on people for minor offences, and lean on them heavily as they oftentimes do, and the people themselves should always be eager and anxious to help the Garda who have a difficult job to do.  There have been too many instances of failure by the public to assist the Garda in difficulties.  I think that is due to a bad spirit engendered by the Garda by their conduct in some cases.</P>
    <P>It is my belief that there are many young gardaí who come out fresh from Templemore, or wherever they are trained, and who are qualified only to learn like teachers, if I may say so, who come out of training colleges and who need a number of years before they get the feel of things, and get experience.  In their first few years in the Garda, they should be helped and encouraged by older members, members who have learned the hard way, and who have learned how to bring out the best in the younger men.  Apparently, too, there have been cases where officers of the Garda have not done what they should have done, with rather serious results.  When cases of that kind crop up, it is the duty of the Minister to find out why things like that should have occurred, and prevent them from taking place again.  I will not labour that point, because if I did I think people could be identified, and that I do not want to do.</P>
    <P>I should like to make a suggestion to the Minister that he should have in his Department a public relations officer.  Many other major Departments <Col N="1748" /> have public relations officers who aim at putting the view of the Department before the people, at explaining policy, and seeking co-operation. If that is essential in a Department like the Department of Labour, it is far more vital in a Department like the Department of Justice.  Laws are passed and people are asked to do certain things.  A public relations officer should tell the populace why a certain law is necessary, and why the people are expected to and should co-operate.</P>
    <P>Earlier on I was asked by Deputy L'Estrange to quote the Article of the Constitution to which I referred.  It is Article 40 which states:</P>
    <P>Provision may be made by law to prevent or control meetings which are determined in accordance with law to be calculated to cause a breach of the peace or to be a danger or nuisance to the general public...</P>
    <P>If LFM meetings do not fall into that category&mdash;especially ones that are held in centres such as Galway&mdash;I will say no more.</P>

O'Higgins and others condemned was the action of a number of private individuals organising themselves by force of their voice and disorderly presence to prevent an orderly meeting proceeding. This was an utterly deplorable incident and one that it would be better for the moral standards of this country to be forgotten.  It was just as wrong for people to do this in the Mansion House or in Galway, as it would be for any group of West Britons to go to a meeting of Connradh na Gaeilge and <Col N="1749" /> behave in the same way.  When you have members of the Government condemning one section of the community for behaving in that way, and encouraging others, you are doing untold damage to the moral fibre of the country.</P>

So long as the Irish language, and all that is decent in this country, are upheld by these people who behave in such a disorderly manner, they are doing untold harm to the cause they pretend to befriend.</P>
      <P>That is not the only worrying thing about this debate, and that is not the only worrying remark from the Government side of the House.  The Minister is the man who is supposed to balance the scales evenly.  He started this debate, and in so doing indicated his attitude to the newspapers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We will hang the Parliamentary Secretary again.  I am now dealing with the Minister's remarks. The Minister criticised the newspapers for giving what he considered to be an undue amount of publicity to the incidence of crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dunne and Deputy O'Leary from the Labour Party agreed with me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister then attacked the journalists and newspaper editors and proprietors.  He said they did not give the same attention to arrests of individuals for the crimes which they had previously publicised, that they did not publicise the convictions to the same extent as they did the original crimes.  The Minister has a right, and no matter how awkward it may be, a duty to respect the rights of individuals.  The mere arrest of an individual does not amount to a conviction: the fact that some person is brought to a Garda station and charged with an offence is not a conviction of that person, is not a condemnation of that person, and it would be entirely wrong if the newspapers were to abuse their right in regard to any individual <Col N="1751" /> at that stage by giving the impression that he was guilty before he was convicted.</P>
      <P>If the Minister for Justice and the Government want to change that basic principle of common justice, let them bring in legislation to do it and let us do what other countries have done, say that people are guilty until proved innocent.  I do not believe the Irish people want it that way and I think journalists are to be praised rather than condemned for the manner in which they respect the rights of individuals. It is not infrequent to find individuals and families who are involved in some unfortunate incident being concerned about the embarrassment of publicity.  I suppose that is one of the punishments for having done wrong but it is not a punishment which innocent people should be made to suffer.  Yet the Minister condemns newspapers for not imposing such suffering on innocent people.  If the Minister wants co-operation from the press, he should seek it without stabbing the newspapers in the back.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>On another occasion the Minister was being censured in the House by one of his political supporters, Deputy Vivion de Valera, who condemned the Minister because of his inactivity in relation to the frequency of stabbings and the use of <Col N="1752" /> flick knives and other such dangerous instruments.  The Minister said the situation was not as bad as Deputy de Valera suggested it was and the newspapers were again blamed by him.  He condemned them for giving publicity to the outrages of these individuals. On that occasion we in the Fine Gael benches defended the right of newspapers to give publicity to these things.  We said the newspapers were doing no more than discharging a duty, doing a great public service in bringing attention to these incidents. Now, because of the proper publicity given by the newspapers to such incidents, we have a Minister for Justice convinced of the need to bring in legislation to deal more effectively with this appalling problem in our midst.</P>
      <P>It is fair to suggest that if the Minister had not been embarrassed into introducing this legislation by the action of the newspapers, the protection such legislation will afford would not be provided.  It is something the Minister ought to think about in relation to the question of publicity, because the prosecution case is heard before the defence.  Our evening newspapers, which carry a far greater proportion of crime coverage than the dailies, are obliged, because they are running against time, to give greater publicity to the prosecution side than to the defence.  The newspapers are not to be blamed for this.  The only way they could ensure against it would be to give the defence the following day, but stale news is no news.  The newspapers are bound by the dictates of time and accordingly the prosecution in our criminal courts in Dublin gets far greater coverage than the defence. The Minister may find that a particular crime is better headlined than another but, taking one thing with another, the prosecution get much better reportage than the defence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is in the nature of things, just as Members of the House know that Deputies who speak in the early part of the day tend to get better coverage in the newspapers than those who speak in the closing hours.  This will <Col N="1753" /> happen as long as our newspapers are fresh with news and we all prefer that to having newspapers report events days or weeks afterwards.</P>
    <P>I share the concern of other Deputies in regard to the prison service, the personnel in that service.  For years the Government remained deaf to pleas in the House and elsewhere about the growing discontent in the Garda Síochána, about the bad wage structure, bad conditions of service, and it was only when matters reached crisis level, when we were about to have a national strike and the Minister was thereby embarrassed, that the day was saved by a high ecclesiastical authority and justice was done to the Garda Síochána at a belated hour. There is a danger that we may reach the same crisis level in the prison service unless something is done in the near future to improve the wage rates and conditions of service and the status generally of officers in the prison service.</P>
    <P>Theirs is perhaps one of the least pleasant of occupations.  I venture to say there are few tasks in the public service more unpleasant than the task of a person whose duties are carried out within prison walls.  We condemn people to prison as punishment for offences committed by them, and to condemn free people to work in a prison in order to earn a living is to impose on those free people the least pleasant of tasks.  I believe, therefore, prison officers should be compensated and I ask the Minister to ensure that before things go too far, the conditions of service of prison personnel be vastly improved.</P>
    <P>Most of those men are people of great ability, of great tact and integrity, and if we are to maintain the high standard in our prison service the men must be paid in accordance with the high standards we demand of them. Other countries which neglected properly to pay their prison personnel paid the price in indiscipline, in escapes and in other unfortunate developments.  I do not think the personnel in our prisons are likely to err in the same way as those in other countries but we should <Col N="1754" /> not ask them any longer to suffer the conditions in which they are now living.  I again earnestly urge the Minister to deal with this problem immediately.</P>
    <P>I had no intention of contributing to the debate, were it not for the outrageous performances of the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach.  These performances should not be allowed to go without condemnation because to my mind, they are indicative of a very dangerous trend on the part of the Minister and the Government.  The Minister referred recently to the question of publicity for the use of flick knives and for people on unofficial strikes.  He treated both groups as being deserving of the same condemnation.</P>

      <P>I suppose it is indicative of modern conditions that practically every Member speaking on this Estimate stressed the crime aspect and I suppose every Member, speaking from experience, is worried about this matter.  The Minister has carved out a niche for himself by reason of the fact that he piloted through this House the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) Bill.  Many years ago associations were formed for the purpose of giving the people the right to buy their ground rent from the landlord. Many of the landlords were of the absentee variety.  In this city, and elsewhere, the landlord was like a feudal king wielding tremendous powers over the people.  I want to congratulate the Minister particularly on piloting this particular Bill through the House.  He has certainly carved out a niche for himself in history.  One person said to me that if this Party did nothing but introduce this Bill it has certainly more than justified its existence.</P>

    <P>I notice the Minister is considering amending the law in relation to malicious <Col N="1755" /> injuries.  This is such a complicated matter that it will take tremendous examination before the Minister can bring in an equitable scheme whereby innocent people will not have to pay for acts of vandalism perpetrated by thugs and blackguards.  I suggest to the Minister that in framing legislation to cover this matter, an effort should be made to require insurance companies to pay their contribution. It is well known that should some vandal or drunk smash a plate-glass window the insurance company will not pay if there is any possible way of getting out of it.  The amount of the damages will be levied on the rates of the particular city or town. We all agree that some persons, such as widows or elderly persons, cannot afford to pay insurance and there should be some protection for them against vandalism in the form of a claim on the local authority.  It would be a good thing to put some such scheme into operation.  At the same time, this whole matter will have to be examined very carefully in order to provide a really equitable system.</P>
    <P>I join with Deputy de Valera and other speakers who spoke on the prison warden service.  Indeed, it often seems strange to me that we get any good out of that service at all.  The picture of a warden with a turnkey going around has run its course and in this modern day we need men of great ability to do this job.  They must be very dedicated men to take up this particular type of work.  I feel the Minister is with us here in asking that those men and women be given the highest possible remuneration and the best possible conditions.  We must face the fact that if we do not provide such conditions we will not have such a service in a very short time.</P>
    <P>The Garda play an important role in the life of the nation.  Everyone pays tribute to them and sometimes complain about them but overall the people appreciate the tremendous job of work they are doing.  At the same time, it has often been said, particularly about people in the city here, that when a garda is attacked the <Col N="1756" /> people will not go to his protection. If a garda is attacked by some thug, the people just stand around.  This is true to a certain extent.  At the same time, in any row in any city or town, you might not physically be able to interfere.  You might do more harm than good by doing so.  The fact is that most citizens do not want to get mixed up in this type of thing.  They do not realise they have a duty to perform.</P>
    <P>I believe the vast majority of people would interfere in such cases if they knew the most effective way to do so. Very often the most effective way to interfere is to run to the nearest kiosk and summon extra gardaí.  If a person has to testify in court in such a case, he may lose a day's work and the compensation paid by the State is not all that generous.  Therefore, by carrying out his duty the man is penalised. This is a matter which the Minister could examine.  Many of our people cannot afford to lose a day's pay when they are witnesses in such cases.</P>
    <P>The ban-gharda, in my opinion, are not used for the purpose for which they were set up.  Dublin Corporation were one of the main bodies who agitated for years to have this force established.  They were in a position to know the conditions in the city where women were needed.  I worked for many years down at the docks.  I recall one instance in which some dockers prevented a young girl from committing suicide.  They rang for the gardaí.  The gardaí very quickly sent down four very big men.  They were kind men but there was a terrified look on that girl's face when she saw herself surrounded by four very big police officers.  At the time I wrote and suggested that women gardaí should have been used.  The Minister said that he would look into this matter.</P>
    <P>I cannot see why ban-ghardaí are not employed solely in cases where women and children are concerned. You often see them looking at motor cars and telling people to move on. They were not established for that purpose.  I hate to admit that there exists in this city a very great social problem with which a certain amount <Col N="1757" /> of vice is associated.  At our docks, the same as in other cities, young girls are taken on some of the foreign ships. Some of them are forced on board by thugs.  The gardaí have tried to stop this.  On a number of occasions conditions were so bad that the Dublin dockers refused to work on a ship because so many girls were on board. They were all cleared off by the police. There are people in this city who are making money from such vice.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the tremendous amount of work done by the gardaí in the dock area but more could be done. I urge the Minister to increase the number of ban-ghardaí.  They can deal with this most important social work. As I said before, the ban-ghardaí deal with traffic offences and they should not be doing this work.  They are more social officers than law officers.  We must press to have the force extended and put them on more of this type of work.</P>
    <P>The Minister is being accused, wrongly, I think, of berating the newspapers for sensationalism.  I suppose the people running newspapers are very anxious to get news.  I deplore the action taken by newspapers in regard to some occurrences.  I recall one particular case in the city which got tremendous headlines when the people were first accused.  They were brought to the first hearing and then the case suddenly disappeared from the newspapers. I am not saying that my morbid curiosity was aroused by this, but the fact is when this case was dropped, there were all sorts of rumours.  One of the people involved in this case was a man known in public life who was duly named.  I consider the papers did a great wrong in, first of all, publicising the matter and then dropping it.  Today most people are against the Establishment, in whatever sphere they are in.  The case I mentioned was dropped, even though the people involved were named in the first instance, but the public soon forget that.  I would not say that the newspapers are sensational; certainly they are much less sensational than the cross-Channel <Col N="1758" /> papers and that is something to be thankful for.</P>
    <P>The Minister is also responsible for the censorship of films and literature but today the censorship of films is rather out-dated because a person may switch on his television set and see any film without censorship and this is something we must examine.  The cinema is losing its role as a cheap form of entertainment and it may be that censorship is not so necessary now.  The Minister could, however, extend the grading system.  Let adults see whatever pictures they want to see, but for heaven's sake, protect the younger people from soul-destroying propaganda.  I should like to pay tribute to the members of the Board who censor books.  They must have a frightful task reading all the bilge that is published, especially across the Channel.  The Board is often attacked by the lunatic fringe who shout against the censorship laws.  I do not know why they do that.  It is only a section who do it and they generally pretend to be the <i>avant garde</i> of every agitation. The more senseless the agitation the more these people back it up.  I should like to see some new method being brought in in regard to extending the censorship of books, not necessarily to ban them.  The position is ridiculous because somebody at the customs may see a book that has been banned and confiscate it.  While under the law he has the right to do that, it does not seem sensible that a person who has not been appointed a censor can undertake to censor a book and prohibit its being brought into the country.</P>
    <P>The fact that the Minister has to deal with no fewer than six Votes points to the magnitude of his task.  Each of the six Votes is very important.  A number of speakers have referred to the time involved for garda in chasing motorists for parking infringements.  We must admit that that is true and I suggest that the Minister should imitate Dublin Corporation and bring in a system of traffic wardens.  I was one of those who proposed the scheme of traffic wardens for children going to and coming from school.  We introduced this scheme because <Col N="1759" /> a number of children had been killed or injured near schools and the garda refused to patrol these areas for us.  While the system is costing the people money, nobody begrudges it because since the system was introduced, no children have been killed or injured in places where a warden was on duty.  In other cities, they have traffic wardens who are not policemen and whose job it is to deal with parking offences.  This releases the police for their primary work, prevention and detection of crime.  It has been proved that the more affluent society becomes, the more lawbreaking it becomes also. There are countries in which people have everything they want from a material point of view but in which there is a frightful crime rate.  At home the young people who are apprehended for crimes come not only from the poorer types of homes but from all classes.  I urge the Minister to consider introducing this traffic warden system because the great thing about it would be that the Garda would then be able to devote their time to preventing and detecting crime.</P>
    <P>There are a number of items in the Minister's Estimate which could perhaps be dealt with by other Departments and some day we may get down to the task of examining which of these could be so dealt with.  This would leave the Minister more time for more serious work.  I welcome the Minister's announcement that he proposes to bring in legislation to ban the sale of offensive weapons.  This is very necessary but simply banning them will not settle the matter.  The cure is to be found in the homes and in the schools, and that is why I suggest that there are some aspects of the Minister's work which could be done by other Department, as, in this instance, the Department of Education. They could bring home to the young people that not alone is it illegal to carry a knife or other offensive weapon but that good citizens do not do that kind of thing.  If we could get this across, we would have less crime and better citizens.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Minister mentioned the high crime detection rates <Col N="1760" /> and we can congratulate the Garda in this regard.  It is easy to criticise the Garda and to say that they did not catch everybody but how many people go free because people refuse to co-operate with the police?  Very often people do not co-operate with the Garda because of our history and because years ago to be an informer was looked upon by decent people as being what it was.  However, we have had partial freedom for over 40 years and in their own interests people will have to re-examine their attitude.  It must be brought home to the people that not to co-operate with the police &mdash;say, in the case of a criminal who has beaten up a watchman and who is going scot-free&mdash;is more despicable than to inform and do their duty.</P>
    <P>We frequently hear references to teenagers but they are probably no better and no worse than we were when we were teenagers.  The ridiculous dress of some years ago was just as bad as it is today.  It is no offence to dress in this way but some people condemn these young people because they adopt this modern dress.  I was speaking to a young fellow with a beard and who dressed in this fashion and he said he did so as a protest. He did not know what he was protesting against but it was against society. As I said before, most people feel that it is the modern thing to be against the Establishment and we must ask ourselves why people feel that way. Perhaps some day somebody will get down to the task of examining why good citizens will not help a garda in distress or give information leading to the arrest of wrongdoers.  This happens not alone in Ireland but in other countries but perhaps, being a small country, we feel it more.  If one does not know the garda on duty one probably knows somebody related to him.</P>
    <P>Some years ago a coloured student was attacked in the streets and badly beaten up.  I occupied another position at that time and the students brought the matter to my notice.  They said this happened because of the man's country of origin.  I told them that was not so, that these thugs would have beaten up any man no matter what his colour. <Col N="1761" /> They accepted that but could not understand why, as one man lay on the ground and as the thugs kicked and injured him, nobody interfered.  They said that would not happen in another country.  It would happen in other countries. We have always been very careful to protect minorities, and if we see one of the minority being kicked almost to death with nobody intervening there is some deep reason for this.  I do not altogether accept that the explanation lies in our history.  We must instil respect for the law and the idea that if somebody breaks the law, he should be punished and made pay for it.  Very often people who are sentenced come and tell you afterwards that they are not guilty or that their families will starve if they are sent to prison.  I admit that I have approached the Minister on behalf of some such people.  This is something I do not like doing but I must say in fairness to the Minister that he has always examined these cases carefully and where he has refused to intervene I respect him for his attitude.</P>
    <P>As another speaker said, we must not make our prisons rest homes.  If a man does wrong, he must be punished. People say that there is no deterrent but I believe that the possibility of being caught prevents people from doing many things.  We must show that the law is impartial and that it is very powerful and that if a person commits a crime he will almost certainly be caught.  Yesterday, a justice sentencing two boys for a crime said to them: &ldquo;Do you know you could have been hanged for this at one time?&rdquo; That was a deplorable remark.  I do not know what power the Minister has over the judiciary but a reminder to some of them of the importance of maintaining respect for the courts might be useful. Perhaps this man had spent a long day on the bench dealing with wrongdoers and was fed up, but the remark was certainly regrettable.  It does not give people the confidence in the courts that they should have.  We have a long way to go before we can build up general respect for the law.  This type of utterance only holds us back.</P>
    <P>Before concluding, I wish to say that I know the Minister has been <Col N="1762" /> doing certain work for juveniles sent to St. Patrick's.  Very often in the country one hears people say their son is there for a very minor misdemeanour but he is associated with people much more depraved.  While I have every confidence in the administration, I wish it were possible to improve on the position.  I suppose it is very hard to prevent the association of different types of prisoners.  Possibly we shall never get round to it but I should like to see Mountjoy, with all its frightful memories, cleared away. The appearance of the place is depressing from the outside.  From the point of view of modern treatment of prisoners, it would be better if we got rid of that place and had a building which would be a place of punishment but would not be so degrading.  In the meantime we must try to bring it home to both law-abiding citizens and others that Mountjoy and our other prisons are institutions supported by our society that must be maintained so long as there are wrongdoers among us.  If everyone had proper respect for the law we would have fewer people in prison and a much happier society.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheridan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be very brief. Instead of making a speech I want to appeal to the Minister in respect of something that affects my constituency and, indeed, other parts of the country. I am sorry that the Minister for Transport and Power is not present also.  I appeal to the Minister for Justice to take the Garda Síochána off the duty of interrogating drivers of lorries concerned in the transport of livestock.  I see no reason why people earning an honest living and doing a good job for the country should be subjected to so much interrogation.  Whether the gardaí are deputed for this work by the Minister or by somebody else we find them at certain points with notebooks and pencils questioning lorry drivers.  At times one would think they represented the Gestapo and not the Minister for Justice.  They question the drivers as if they were criminals. I hold there is no justification for this in respect of people who are engaged in the haulage business and especially in the haulage of livestock.</P>

      <Col N="1764" /> Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann is of opinion that in view of the steep rise in the cost of living and the difficulties created thereby for all pensioners, all pensions should be increased.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. T. O'Donnell Mr. T. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>When I reported progress on Wednesday evening, I was referring to the terms of this motion. The motion draws attention to the difficulties and problems of the most needy section of our community, those who in the declining years of their lives are condemned to a desperate struggle for survival on pensions which are totally inadequate to provide in many cases even the barest necessaries of life. It is a disgrace that after 44 years of self-government, so many thousands of our citizens should be treated in this manner.  This motion in the name of the Fine Gael Party draws the Minister's attention to the plight of these unfortunate people and asks him to take action.</P>
      <P>The time is now long overdue when the whole question of pensions should be completely reviewed.  There are compelling reasons for a change of policy and attitude, and the formulating and drafting of a new pensions code is a matter of extreme urgency. Ways and means will have to be devised to ensure that all pension scales are related, on an equitable basis, to the cost of living.  This is the only way to ensure that our pensioners will be enabled to spend the declining years of their lives in the degree of comfort to which their long years of service to this State justly entitle them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt whatsoever that a wide variety of the pension schemes we have in this country are loaded with unjust and unnecessary conditions and qualifications.  I doubt if there is any other country in the world which has such a complex system of pension schemes.  Other Deputies who spoke on this motion on Wednesday evening last went into detail regarding the <Col N="1765" /> inadequacy and complexity of various types of pension schemes.</P>
    <P>In regard to old age pensions which, perhaps, embraces the largest category of pensioners in this State, we have had in the past two years a new development in so far as the means test is concerned.  In the 1965 Budget a differential was introduced: whereas prior to that anybody whose means did not exceed £62 was entitled to the maximum pension, in that Budget this was reduced to £26.  In the first Budget of this year, a further distinction was made when the increase was given, and unfortunately, due to bad public relations or deliberate propaganda, most old age pensioners were led to believe they were getting the increase, whereas only those pensioners who were completely destitute qualified for it.  As far as I can gather, only one in every seven pensioners qualified for that recent increase.  These additional means tests which have been introduced in the last two Budgets were a bad idea and were completely unjustified. All categories of old age pensioners and certainly those whose means do not exceed the original figure of £52, should have received whatever increases were granted in the recent Budget and, indeed, these increases were small enough.</P>
    <P>Garda pensioners were the subject of a Private Members' motion here a couple of years ago.  It is very difficult to unravel the approach to the question of Garda pensions.  I understand that there are six different rates of pension being paid to the same grade of retired gardaí.  Of course, I know that there is a rate applicable at the date of retirement. There are strong grounds for reviewing the position and working out a system which will overcome the injustices in the scheme.  The Garda Pensioners' Association and Garda pensioners in general are completely dissatisfied with the pensions payable.  By virtue of the trojan service which they gave to this State in its formative years, retired gardaí are entitled to much better treatment than has been meted out to them.</P>
    <P>Other Deputies have referred to Old IRA pensioners and have deplored the <Col N="1766" /> fact that in this year of 1966, which was to all these people a very special year, the Government did not make some recompense to them for the scandalous manner in which they have been treated.  Many of these people who helped in the struggle for freedom are now advanced in years.  Unfortunately, many of them are in very poor circumstances.  I suppose every Deputy has had occasion time and time again to make representations on behalf of these people.  I want to protest against the rigid manner in which the means test is applied in the case of applicants for special allowances.</P>
    <P>Another category of pensioners who have been suffering under serious difficulties are CIE pensioners.  We discussed their problem at length on a Private Members' motion a few weeks ago.  There are over 1,000 retired transport employees in receipt of pensions of only £1 per week.  The Minister for Transport and Power justified this on the grounds that on reaching the age of 70 years, these men qualify for the old age pension.  Their CIE pensions are then reduced from £2 11s 3d to £1.</P>
    <P>There are numerous other examples I could give but I do not want to detain the House by referring in detail to the various categories of pensioners. It must regretfully be admitted that there is this complexity and inadequacy in the matter of pensions and I appeal, therefore, to the Minister to accept the motion and to take whatever steps are necessary to help the many thousands of unfortunate persons to whom the motion applies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EileenDesmond" hpid="Mrs. Desmond Mrs. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to join in the appeal made by Deputy O'Donnell and other Deputies who have spoken on this Fine Gael motion.  I do not think it should be necessary to appeal to any Minister to increase the amount of pension on which our aged people are forced to live.  It must be obvious to every Member of the House and, indeed, to the Minister, that the meagre allowances paid to these people every week is not in any case adequate to meet the cost of living as it is today. We in the Labour Party have always agitated for increased pensions and when we got the opportunity in the <Col N="1767" /> Budget of 1965, we voted with the Government for the additional taxation to pay a reasonably increased old age pension.  We were disappointed to find the introduction of the new means test, to which Deputy O'Donnell has referred, a new and even more rigid means test than had previously been operated.  The aged are the one section of the community to which this exceptionally rigid means test seems to be applied.  It is a very poor reflection on our society that we should treat in this very shabby, mean manner, elderly people who have given their lives and their services to the State.</P>
      <P>It has become the practice in the past two years that November brings despair and disillusionment to hundreds of pensioners such as old age pensioners.  Each November Deputies from all sides of the House must be flooded with appeals from these disillusioned people, people to whom even 5/- this year has meant a tremendous amount.  People in this House who have considerably bigger incomes might not value 5/- a week but I know from my experience of these people and from my conversations with them, that 5/- to an old age pensioner represents something very important indeed, something on which he or she might depend and on which they might budget for little increased comforts. These people have not the comforts they require.  Those managing homes must know that the amount of pension old age pensioners receive is not adequate, that, in fact, it can be spent on one item of budgetary expense in the average home.  Personally, I cannot see how any old age pensioner living alone can provide for fuel and food, not to mention clothing, on the meagre allowance.  I do not think it should be necessary for any of us to rise here and appeal to a Minister to accept a motion such as this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is just one item that I want to refer to in connection with widows' pensions. Widows' pensions are, of course, totally inadequate, particularly noncontributory pensions, but I want to refer to one aspect of widows' pensions, that is, the discontinuance of the children's <Col N="1768" /> allowance when the child reaches 16 years of age.  We, particularly in latter years, have been agitating for reasonable and equal opportunities in education.  Last year a £30 relief from income tax was provided in the case of persons liable to income tax in respect of a child who was continuing education. Quite different treatment is meted out to widows who, even with the allowance, could not possibly afford to maintain their children at school after the age of 16.  In fact, they are told that education or any other comfort in life is not for them or their children.  At 16 years of age, the children of widows are expected to earn their own living.  In the case of those widows who, by great sacrifice, do try to get further education for their children beyond the age of 16 years, they must do it without any assistance whatsoever and the meagre 10/- children's allowance is discontinued at that age.  Any reasonable Minister or any reasonable parliament must see that this represents injustice towards the weaker sections of the community.</P>
    <P>During the past year, when English pensions were increased, it brought a certain amount of happiness and relief to those persons here who were in receipt of such pensions but that happiness and that relief were very short-lived. No sooner had they got the increase than the Irish Government stepped in and took from them portion of their Irish pensions.  The whole attitude towards pensioners is out-dated. They certainly cannot live today on what they are being asked to live. It applies to all classes of pensioners and people on fixed incomes who cannot meet the rising cost of living. It should not be necessary to drag this matter on.  I would add my voice to the voices of other Deputies in appealing to the Minister to accept this motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We of the Fine Gael Party tabled this motion because we are conscious of the fact that pensioners are finding it extremely difficult to meet the cost of living at present. We are less impressed by the statistics furnished by the Central Statistics <Col N="1769" /> Office, indicating the official cost of living, than we are by the daily acquaintance we have with the personal difficulties of pensioners.  A fairer assessment of the rate at which pensions have progressed will be found by comparing increases in pensions with increases in wages paid to people who are currently earning.  That is a better way of assessing progress, if we can properly call it such, in the pension rate than by comparing pensions with a sometimes meaningless figure of the cost of living.</P>
      <P>An indication of how futile a reference to the cost of living figure can be was given recently in the House, when, in relation to proposals to increase rents, we were told the effect of the increase would be to send up the cost of living index figure by only .2 of one per cent.  The fact that it may, spread over a whole nation of 2½ million people, produce an increase of only .2 of one per cent does not answer the problem facing an individual pensioner who finds that many of the goods and services he once was able to command are now beyond his reach because the purchasing power of his pension has been drastically reduced.  That, we fear, is what has happened in recent years.</P>

    <P>To give even a modicum of justice to pensioners of all kinds, both social welfare pensioners and public service pensioners, we should have a minimum of 20 per cent increase all round in pensions.  We have in recent years experienced national rounds of wage increases.  If these are justifiable, as I believe them to be, it is also justifiable to call for and insist upon national rounds of pension increases. The manner in which a considerable period has been allowed to elapse between increases in wages and increases in pensions has done less than justice to our pensioners.  In most cases, even after compelling pensioners to wait for a long period after wage increases, we gave them ultimately a smaller percentage than that given to people still working.  That is unfair to the pensioners who survived the timelag which <Col N="1770" /> the Government have permitted.  But what is grossly unfair is that many pensioners have gone to their eternal reward before even the miserable increase was given to them.  To us in Fine Gael it seems proper that the State should in future, in assessing the cost of any national wage increase, simultaneously assess the cost of giving a similar percentage increase to pensioners. The only way in which we can accord fair play and equal treatment to all sections of the community is to give it to all of them at the one time, whether they be pensioners or workers.</P>
    <P>In his contribution last week, the Minister indicated what we all know, that is, that certain increases in pensions were given in recent years.  The Minister mentioned, for instance, that the last time pensioners were compensated was in relation to the cost of living in February 1964, the date of the ninth round wage increase.  That is true for many pensioners, but not for all, unfortunately.  That is now almost three years ago.  There has been a substantial rise in the cost of living since then, triggered off primarily by indirect taxation which falls, most unfairly, on pensioners and people on fixed incomes, many of whom did not receive compensation in the various Budgets which increased the levies the Government imposed on the necessary expenditure of pensioners.  On this account, what was given almost three years ago has been taken back by the State.  The result is that pensioners are not in as good a position&mdash;I speak relatively&mdash;as they were in 1964.</P>
    <P>Even in 1964 and earlier we were told, at a time when money was plentiful, when it was spent and misspent on advised and ill-advised projects, there was no money there for pensioners.  But now we find, in a situation in which the Government, for the first time, are prepared to confess that something more should be done for pensioners, that it cannot now be done because the money is not available.  It is most unfortunate that at the time when money was plentiful, the Government did not do what they ought to have done. <Col N="1771" /> Not only is the plight of the pensioner miserable but a number of public assistance pensioners in recent times have had new means tests applied to them.  Last year, for instance, we had a new standard of assessing old age pension benefits introduced, when we saw the paltry sum of 10/-a week taken into account.  Any person who received more than 10/- a week found he was deprived altogether of the much-vaunted increase in the old age pension last year.  This year we applied an even more stringent means test.  If a person was not a statutory pauper, not completely destitute, he was deprived entirely of the paltry increase in the old age pension this year. The result is that, while all our old age pensioners were led to believe they could anticipate an increase of 5/- on 1st November this year, if they survived until then, in fact less than one-seventh of the old age pensioners have got the increase the Government boasted about.</P>
    <P>What is the position in relation to old age pensioners who over the past 2½ years have received no increase whatever, notwithstanding the increase in the cost of living in the meanwhile? An indication of the growing hardship on pensioners will be found in the substantial increase in the number of appeals this year to welfare officers, that is to say, appeals which are made by people who believe they are entitled to benefit despite rulings that they are not so entitled or, if they are entitled to benefit, that they must get less than the maximum.  The average number of appeals for several years was in or about 2,300 per annum in relation to a 12 month period.  But this year the number of such appeals in a ten month period has increased to 3,600.</P>
    <P>This is a very worrying figure.  It is indicative of the more stringent application of the rules.  I suppose one cannot properly say at any time that the rules should not be applied&mdash;if they are there, they should apply&mdash;but I think this figure is also indicative of the fact that pensioners are obliged, because of their dire circumstances, to take every possible <Col N="1772" /> step to get even a small increase in their pensions.  This has led them to refuse to accept the decisions of the social welfare officers and has compelled them, because of dire necessity, to make their appeals to superior officers, even though we know from experience that the possibility of getting such appeals through is extremely remote.</P>
    <P>We in Fine Gael do not pretend that we can have a better scheme of pensions or larger pensions without increased contributions from employers, employees and the State.  However, we would have to accept in this country that we have a clear obligation to our own people to give such increases and to accept the burden which such increases would impose upon the community.  Unfortunately, in the past five years, the share of the national cake, what we call the gross national product, received by the public assistance beneficiaries in this country has almost halved and this at a time when, if not for the good of our own people, which is our first obligation, we ought for other reasons of governmental policy to be taking a step in the other direction.</P>
    <P>In the six countries of the EEC, with which we are led to believe we shall at some time be associated, the economic weight of the social system &mdash;that is, of providing pensions and other social benefits&mdash;ranges from 14.3 per cent of national income in the Netherlands to 18.1 per cent of the annual income in Luxembourg.  We cannot pretend for one moment that we are anywhere near giving such a share of the national cake to our pensioners. We have not got even one-third of the way.  Unless we do it, it seems that it will be impossible for this country to be associated with the EEC, if it were decided for economic reasons that it was desirable to be associated with that community, because, in addition to the economic obligations of the community, there are also clear social obligations which are just as stringent as the economic ones even if they are not spelled out in as great detail in the Rome Treaty.</P>
    <P>The Rome Treaty provided, in the <Col N="1773" /> Preamble, that the signatories pledge themselves &ldquo;to ensure the economic and social progress of their countries by common action in eliminating the barriers which divide Europe,&rdquo; and &ldquo;to direct their efforts to the essential purpose of constantly improving the living and working conditions of their peoples.&rdquo;  In a statement on social security in the EEC, by the Director for Social Security and Social Services in the Common Market Commission, we read the following:</P>
    <P>The social provisions of the Treaty may appear less numerous and, taken as a whole, less detailed than the economic provisions, but this cannot place in any doubt the ultimate social purpose of the Rome Treaty.  Quite apart from the texts, this social purpose is inherent in the Treaty, for the establishment of a common market cannot be an end in itself and can only be justified, in the last analysis, if the economic prosperity we expect from it is fairly shared among all social groups...</P>
    <P>We in this country are not fairly sharing our own limited prosperity amongst all social groups and, because of that, we in the Fine Gael Party believe there is an overwhelming obligation on the Government to increase all pensions.</P>
    <P>In our motion, we did not endeavour to confine our exhortations to particular pensioners.  We feel that a great deal of injustice has been done over the years to various pensioners because we have linked their individual pensions to individual wage rates and to individual predicaments.  We know this is wrong.  Pensioners must be treated as a large and growing proportion of our community and must be given incomes sufficient to maintain their standard of living today.  We should like to see the establishment of a social commission which would assess the needs of such pensioners today, not related to what they may have earned in the past, not related to what the State may have paid to people in similar categories 20 or 40 years ago but related to what they actually need today.</P>
    <P>I think we can learn from what is <Col N="1774" /> happening in Europe in the countries which provide better pensions and better social welfare services.  We find that in all the six countries of the EEC there are national committees upon which sit employers, workers and administrators. One of our drawbacks in this country is that we have not got such well-informed committees assisting or superintending the administration and improvement of our social welfare services.  We depend upon a limited number of administrators to suggest policy improvements and all that is put into competition with the many Departments of State which make demands upon the national Exchequer. This we believe to be wrong.  We shall not have a well-informed social code in this country until such time as we improve the system.</P>
    <P>There are particular categories of State pensioners deserving of our special consideration.  One of these sections are the Garda pensioners.  They are unique in that, when they are members of the Garda Síochána, they make contributions to their pension fund.  Other civil servants have these contributions paid for them by the State.  The members of the Garda Síochána, who have to retire at an age earlier than the age applicable to other servants of the State, find that, over the years between their retirement and the time they &ldquo;shuffle off this mortal coil&rdquo;, the value of their pensions considerably diminishes.  There is a crying need for a substantial improvement in all Garda pensions.</P>
    <P>We in the Fine Gael benches are unanimous in calling on the Government to improve all Garda pensions and to make a special effort to bring all of them up to an equal level.  This idea that we still apply here of paying men who retired ten years ago less than we pay a colleague of theirs who retires today is certainly not admissible on any ethical ground.  It is difficult to justify the old contention that pensions are merely postponed pay but if we accept that old contention then I think we must accept the obligation that if we postpone pay to individuals by allocating it, instead, to pension funds we have a clear obligation to maintain the value of that postponed pay.  If the <Col N="1775" /> State or society depreciates the value of a man's pay then the State has a clear obligation to ensure that the services and goods a pensioner can buy should not be diminished because of the depreciation in the value of money.</P>
    <P>It is because we consider that the standard of living of pensioners has seriously declined that we believe the Government have a clear obligation to increase pensions.  We are not at all impressed by the Government's statement that they have not got the money to do this.  We recall that, although it is some 19 years since we in Fine Gael called upon the Government of the day, in 1947, to increase the old age pensions, the Fianna Fáil Party went into the lobby, and, to a man, refused to increase them.</P>
    <P>The Government changed and the pensions were increased overnight.  The national finances were not, as a result of that, in as unhealthy a position as they are today, nor do we believe that the finances of the State will ever become unhealthy by reason of the State fulfilling its obligations to old age pensioners, and to pensioners of all kinds.  Indeed, the Government who fail to attend to the needs of pensioners wil certainly fail to discharge their primary duty by distributing the nation's wealth as equally as possible between all sections of the community so that none suffer hardship.  At present most pensioners suffer hardship.</P>
    <P>Because we are convinced that this hardship is growing, we tabled this motion.  It is an effort to awaken the conscience of the Government of today into doing something for those people. We do not accept that improvements in pensions must await the annual Budget.  Supplementary Budgets have been introduced for much less deserving purposes than giving pensions to the needy section of our people.  On that account, we urge the Government not to delay any longer in providing a substantial increase in all pensions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>On Wednesday evening of last week when the Minister for Finance was speaking here, he expressed the view that the debate on this motion should relate only to State <Col N="1776" /> pensions and that if it was intended to discuss other than State pensions, it was his colleague, the Minister for Social Welfare, who should be here. The terms of the motion are:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann is of opinion that in view of the steep rise in the cost of living and the difficulties created thereby for all pensioners, all pensions should be increased.</P>
      <P>That is clear enough.  One can understand the Minister for Finance being anxious to say that somebody else should carry the can for him.  The money must come from the Department of Finance and, therefore, he is the correct Minister to answer the charges made in this House.  I intend to refer to Social Welfare pensions and State pensions because I believe this motion relates to both.</P>
      <P>So far as Social Welfare pensions are concerned, I would like to refer particularly to the non-contributory pensions.  It was announced here, in answer to a question last week, if my memory serves me correctly, that there are 111,438 people drawing non-contributory old age pensions and of those, 10,070 got an increase of 5/- per week. The plain people of this country, the old and the poor, have decided that there is no point in communicating with Fianna Fáil Deputies on this matter.  If there is not, then the Fianna Fáil Deputies should be as well aware of the situation as we all are, particularly we in the Labour Party.  I, personally, have received bundles of letters from people who say they have seen in the papers that they were entitled to 5/- a week increase in old age pensions from 1st November and that they did not get it. When they went to the trouble of writing to the Department of Social Welfare, they got a reply stating they had been assessed at £2 12s per year, that is, 1/- per week.  So we now have a new means test in social welfare.  Those assessed at 1/- per week are not entitled to draw full non-contributory pensions. I assume the same applies to widows' pensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of the letters written were anonymous, which would suggest that they were written by well-known Fianna Fáil supporters who for one <Col N="1777" /> reason or another, did not want it to be known to a member of the Opposition that they wrote to complain of the fact that they had been codded by the Government.  One letter included a lot of cuttings from the evening papers, particularly the <i>Evening Press.</i></P>
    <P>They all followed the one theme: &ldquo;Why were we told we were getting 5/- and why did we not get 5/-; we have been codded.&rdquo;  A number wanted to know what the Labour Party were doing about it, what we were doing in the Dáil?  The Minister for Lands, here present, will remember that we have again and again, when the 1/- means test came up, raised the matter in the Dáil.  We honestly believe that with this 5/- increase, there should not have been a new means test created.  It was a horrible thing and, in fact, it was a confidence trick on those unfortunate old people.  I do not know whether the Minister and the Government are as well aware of these things as I am. Perhaps they are not; perhaps they do not go into the same type of houses as I do.  I do know that 5/- for somebody who is getting slightly over £2 a week is an awful lot of money.  The fact is that they have not got the 5/- per week, which, they say, they were looking forward to.</P>
    <P>It is no answer to say that we gave so much last year and so much the year before and that the Coalition, or inter-Party, or what have you did not give as much.  That is no use to the old age pensioner or to the widow.  It buys no bread for them.  I honestly think a bad mistake has been made by the Government in this matter.</P>
    <P>In so far as the question of increase is concerned, Deputy Ryan when speaking here made a mistake which the Government have made again and again.  Indeed, I might say, successive Governments have made this mistake. It is that when there is an increase in the cost of living and there is a general increase in wages it is sufficient to give the same percentage increase to the old age pensioner and other types of pensioner and say: &ldquo;You are getting as much percentagewise as the workers <Col N="1778" /> outside.&rdquo; Twelve per cent to 12½ per cent on his wages to the farm worker means £1, which he got.  What is 12½ per cent of the 42/6, even if they did get it? Some people do not seem to appreciate the fact that percentagewise it is not right to compare one with the other.</P>
    <P>There is another thing which I think has been overlooked by this Government and by previous Governments. When the old age pension was first introduced for persons at the age of 70 in 1909, the pension was 5/- a week. If an old man and his wife were both drawing the pensions&mdash;and, incidentally, the means test was £26 a year, not 1/- a week&mdash;they could draw the old age pension of 10/- a week for the two.  The farm labourer's wages at that time was an average of 9/- a week.  The farm labourer's wage now, according to the Minister for Agriculture last week, is £9 0s 6d a week.  What contributory old age pension, even with this 5/-produces roughly half that for two people?  Even if they got the increase in contributory old age pension, a man and his wife would still have only slightly more than one-half a farm worker's wages.  Surely that is not progress, that is not advance?  We seem to forget, more so than anywhere else, that the workers of today are the pensioners of tomorrow and the pensioners of today are the people who were working a few years ago and who had not the good sense to ensure when they were working that there would be a decent pension for them.  They know it would be only a matter of time until they passed out of the pension class.</P>
    <P>This is a matter which is so serious that I believe what Deputy Ryan said about the cost is right.  It does not matter a damn where the money is got; money to right this wrong must be produced.  I remember distinctly the situation here at the start of the Emergency when a Budget of £6 million was introduced for Defence. The Emergency was declared and overnight the Budget was jumped to something around £25 million.  There was no difficulty.  The money was produced <Col N="1779" /> and the country did not go bankrupt.  I believe this is a national emergency for many of these old people who find it impossible to live on what they are getting.  This is something which people who are not close enough to those affected do not seem to appreciate.  Does the Minister know or is it known that an old age pensioner, the same as anyone else, who buys a cwt. of coal pays 14/7 for it&mdash;14/7 out of his £2 2s 6d a week?  When he has that bought, and he requires at least that to keep a little heat in him for the winter period, he does not have very much left to buy food, clothing or other necessaries.  This is a matter which must be faced and the sooner the Government face it the better.</P>
    <P>As far as the State pensioners are concerned, there is a situation here which should not have been allowed to arise.  A few years ago the Minister's predecessor or the Minister before him &mdash; I think it was Deputy Dr. Ryan &mdash; announced in this House that it was proposed within a reasonable period to give parity to the State pensioners with those who were retiring at that particular time.  This gave great heart to the State pensioners.  They felt at last here was somebody who would see that justice was done to them.  Of course, subsequently it was not done. Then there was a statement made to the effect there was no money and a further statement that the promise was never made and right along the line until now nothing is going to be done.</P>
    <P>For some extraordinary reason, the worst hit of those people, the people who would require the largest increase to bring them up to the level of present pensioners are the Garda pensioners.  I stated on the Estimate for the Department of Justice now before the House that the pensioners who are leaving the Garda service now are people who are entitled to the very best the State can offer them because they were the people who helped to create the State. They helped to create and to make possible the civil law of this country. For that reason, I feel they are entitled to a lot more than they are getting. <Col N="1780" /> Take all State pensioners, Army pensioners, Civil Service pensioners, pensioners of local authorities, and in every case there is this disparity between the man who retired ten, 12 or 15 years ago, who was pensioned off at the rate operating when he retired, and a man who might not have half his qualifications retiring now from the same service and possibly the same job.  He will have, according to the number of years later it is, anything up to 50 per cent, 60 per cent or 70 per cent more pension than the man who went out some years ago.</P>
    <P>If the Minister for Finance a few years ago felt it was right to promise that these people should get parity and be brought up to the present rate, then the present Minister should have another look at that because, as in the case of Social Welfare pensioners, it is all cod to talk about giving the same percentage increase to the State pensioners, as the workers get when they get an increase of eight, nine, ten, 11 or 12 per cent on existing pension.  It is simply a drop in the ocean compared with what they would get if they got the same increase as the people who are still working.  If the Minister is not prepared to go so far, the very least he can offer is parity with those who are at present retiring.</P>
    <P>I have an instance of an old man who was employed as an overseer by a country council.  He had very long service and retired nearly 14 years ago. When he retired, he got what was the maximum pension at the time&mdash; £3 10s. 0d a week.  He is now a very old man.  The overseer who succeeded him and who had very much shorter service as an overseer but had approximately the same service with the council as he had over the years on other employment in the council has retired. That man's pension, living next door to the man who retired 14 years ago, is almost £8 per week.  I am sure the Minister will agree that there is something wrong with the system which allows that sort of thing to happen. Since they are pensioners and in most cases paying for their pensions down through the years, there is not a reason in the world why they should not be <Col N="1781" /> brought on some type of parity with the people who are now going out.</P>
    <P>A number of discussions have taken place between people representing the State pensioners and the various Ministers and on one or two occasions the people have come into this House to discuss with various Deputies and with the Minister himself and his predecessor this whole question.  The extraordinary thing is that when the interviews take place, it appears that it is possible to have something done for them, but as soon as they go, that possibility disappears and the unfortunate pensioners are no better off than they were before they came in.  As Deputy Ryan mentioned, a table of comparison was issued in 1964 and it showed the position clearly.  If the Minister has not got that table, I am sure it is in his Department and could be pulled out from wherever it has been collecting dust.  It points to the fact that the Garda pensioners were the people who were getting the rough edge of the stick and would require to to brought up to parity with other groups.  I think the Minister would do well to look at it because the position has not changed since except for the worse, because when increases are given to State servants, the gap is widened considerably.  I would ask the Minister to have a good look at this because I think the time has come when he must, and this Government or some Government must, make arrangements to allow parity to the people who went out before now with those who are going out at the present time.</P>
    <P>A number of people want to speak and it is coming towards the end of the time.  Therefore, I shall conclude with an appeal to the Minister for Finance to talk to his colleague the new Minister for Social Welfare, and try to persuade him, even at this late stage, that the people of this country are not prepared to accept the assessment of a means test of one shilling per week to prevent those who are entitled to an increase in pension from getting it and that in the case of an old person who is living with a son or daughter, brother or sister, just living in their house, buying his or her own food, cooking his or her own food and attempting to exist <Col N="1782" /> on a non-contributory pension, it is just not good enough to tell them: &ldquo;Your lodging is worth 1/- a week and you are not, therefore, entitled to the 5/-.&rdquo; That is actually what is happening and I do not think any Minister for Social Welfare or any Minister for Finance can boast about a Christian attitude on the part of those who operate this system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to supplement the arguments advanced in support of this motion.  Many of the detailed aspects have been discussed by other speakers and I do not wish to repeat what has been said already, but I should like to urge the Minister, on the assumption of his present portfolio, to have a fresh look at the situation. The method by which pensions are calculated is the familiar one of pension based on rate of pay at retirement. In the main, that method covers State and semi-State employees, such as Army, Garda, teachers, civil servants and so on.  That method was reasonable enough probably when the system was originally introduced because, at that time, the cost of living was more or less stable and, if there were variations, they were both infrequent and slight.</P>
      <P>In the post-war period, we have become accustomed to a continuous and rapid decline in the value of money consequent on the rise in prices, with resultant difficulties for retired personnel. There is an obvious case for reconsidering the whole system now, the basis of calculation and the method of awarding pensions.  This matter was considered by the interdepartmental committee and certain recommendations were made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the course of the debate, reference was made to the various pension increases given.  The first Pensions Increase Act was, I think, in either 1949 or 1950.  Since then, at irregular intervals, and without any clearly defined criteria, there have been pension increases, mainly in response to pressure of opinion in Dáil Éireann. Different Governments have introduced Pensions Increase Acts.  In all these cases, the increases have lagged considerably behind the actual rise in <Col N="1783" /> the cost of living.  Undoubtedly bringing pensions up to the rate of pension payable at the current date of retirement would naturally cost a considerable amount.  For that reason there are two points which must be considered: the method of financing pensions and the method of contribution by employers, employees and the State.  These methods must be reviewed.  Leaving that aside for the moment, I believe there would be public support, and it could be justified, for increasing taxation in order to meet the claims of retired personnel.</P>
    <P>We have had references to various categories of State pensioner.  There are a number of semi-State bodies and the one that comes to mind as the most glaring example from the point of view of pensions is CIE.  The pensions in many cases are deplorably low.  There is a very unfair arrangement in that some pensioners, who are declared redundant, are entitled to a substantially higher compensation than those who serve out their time.  In addition to that some pensioners complain that some of those who were declared redundant were subsequently re-employed and are apparently entitled to both redundancy compensation and to being put on the payroll.</P>
    <P>There should be a more equitable method of assessing CIE pensions.  In many cases the pensions are based on an outmoded system introduced originally in respect of the staff employed by the old Great Southern Railways. What makes it even worse is the fact that a number of CIE pensioners, who are many years retired, some as long as seven and eight years, have not yet had their superannuation determined. Apparently there is some difficulty and the Minister for Transport and Power proposes to introduce amending legislation.  Whatever pressure can be brought should be brought on the arbitrator to complete and make final his award.  The difficulty is that, although people are drawing some pension, they cannot make a settlement in relation to a widow in the event of death.  Indeed, some pensioners have died without ever being able to do that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1784" /> So far as State servants are concerned&mdash;Army, Garda, civil servants and others&mdash;I have here an example which is, I think, quite typical.  This person says: &ldquo;I retired in July, 1961, and since that date the only increase I have received is the nine per cent increase operative from August 18th, 1965.&rdquo;  There are many similar cases. As has been pointed out, a person who retires the day after the operative date is substantially better off than the man who retires the day before.  Generally, a period of some months elapses, in some cases a year, but in certain cases only a month or two.</P>
    <P>The position of pensioners who thought they would be awarded the recent increase in respect of social welfare is most unsatisfactory and has given rise to a great deal of dissatisfaction. The percentage entitled to the increase is infinitesimal, something like two or three per cent.  The other case that occurred this year was the reduction made in the amount of pension by the Department of Social Welfare in respect of pensioners who received certain increases from the British Ministry of Pensions.  In fact, what has happened is that the increase granted by the British Ministry of Pensions&mdash; or whatever the appropriate ministry is &mdash;has been offset by a corresponding reduction here by the Minister for Social Welfare.  Therefore, I would suggest to the Minister that this matter be reviewed in its entirety.  There was a great deal of evidence accumulated in this report, comparisons were made and information assembled of what has been done in other countries.  Some of them adopted certain systems, others adopted other systems but there is a general movement in many European countries towards an upward revision of pensions, based on an automatic adjustment on the cost of living, similar to that which applies in respect of serving personnel.</P>
    <P>There is another consideration: this operates more harshly against persons who have retired for some time than those who have just retired and who find that their successor&mdash;even though he serves a short time afterwards&mdash;gets a wage and salary adjustment and, consequently, retires on a higher pension. <Col N="1785" /> The longer a person is retired, the less likely he or she is to get employment; the older they get, the worse their position becomes.  When they retire initially, some get part-time jobs but the longer they are retired, the less fit they are physically and mentally. Consequently, the fact that a person lives a considerable time as a pensioner means that, economically, he is much worse off than had he died shortly after retirement.</P>
    <P>I believe, therefore, that the present method of financing pensions should be reviewed on the basis of reconsideration of the method of calculation and the contributions paid in respect of pensions.  There is also the other important consideration&mdash;to which reference has been made in the course of this debate&mdash;of outside bodies.  With few exceptions in my time, I think there was only one&mdash;maybe that is a slight exaggeration&mdash;but there were certainly very few firms in the city of Dublin, pre-war, operating a pension scheme and there was generally one notable example; that of Messrs. Guinness.  Since then, pension schemes have become much more general, because of a revised attitude in all democratic countries to social welfare considerations and to the adoption of a welfare state approach to these matters. Nowadays also pensions trusts formulate and make available, on the basis of contributions from firms as well as from workers, pension schemes which facilitate the provision of pensions and make their payment possible. Of course, the earlier people enter these schemes, the more beneficial for themselves and, in many cases, these schemes have been introduced only when people were relatively advanced.</P>
    <P>I believe all these aspects of the matter, as well as the question of making an effective immediate increase in respect of the State pensioners, should be considered.  Some pensioners have the advantage of having families or relatives who are in a position to contribute to them.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> The Fine Gael Party put down this motion in order to try to extract from the Government a measure of justice for all pensioners in receipt of pensions out of moneys provided by the Exchequer&mdash;old age pensioners and State servants.  I suppose it would really be too much to expect that the Government would this year do the right thing by these pensioners, but we certainly expected we would get some sort of a satisfactory assurance from the Minister for Finance that there was a new approach to the question of pensions for State servants&mdash;that the pensions of these people would have parity with current pensions or the current cost of living.  Therefore, it is a source of considerable disappointment to learn that the Minister for Finance, who has just taken over, apparently intends to pursue the old policy of giving to these pensioners whatever is left, without any real regard to their interests or to the increase in the cost of living, or current salaries or pensions.</P>
      <P>That is my interpretation of the Minister's statement when he said here last Wednesday, and I quote from volume 225, of the Official Report at columns 1486 and 1487:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My predecessor stated when he was speaking in this House on the 18th July 1962, that what we have <Col N="1787" /> been endeavouring to do in relation to pension increases is to disburse whatever money it may be possible to make available within the limits of the Budgetary conditions, to make good the depreciation in the value of the money caused by the rise in the cost living, and any further steps which it may be possible to take will be in that same direction, subject also to Budgetary consideration.</P>
    <P>In other words, these pensioners are not to have their pensions increased in order to bring them up to current pensions or in order to compensate for the increase in the cost of living.  They are not to have that done by right.  They are to have it done only if there is any money left when the Minister for Finance has looked around to see on what he will spend money.</P>
    <P>I say that is not good enough and it is particularly alarming that we should have such an expression from the Minister for Finance because, in this country, State servants must depend for their increase in pension upon the Minister for Finance who has power, under a recent Act of the Oireachtas, to increase or adjust their pensions by regulations.  In most countries in the world, State servants have their pension rights tied to current pensions or to the cost of living.  We, apparently, are determined to fall in line with Great Britain, against all the other countries in the world, to refuse to confer on State servants the right to get an increase in their pensions when the salaries of the positions they vacated are increased or when the cost of living increases.  I say that is not good enough and it is a deplorable state of affairs that the new Minister, whom we might regard as &ldquo;Mr. 1966&rdquo;, should have seen fit to come into this House and  out the old theme again that the pensioners will be looked after within the limits of the Budget, if the money is there.</P>
    <P>I think most emphatically&mdash;and I have thought it for years&mdash;that it is not good enough for the Minister to say that State pensions are fairly generous when considered in relation to civil <Col N="1788" /> pensions, pensions paid to people in industry and commerce.  The Minister is hardly fair when he tries to get away on this case.  As Deputy Cosgrave has pointed out, pensions in private employment are a comparatively recent innovation, with the exception of large employers of standing and generosity like Messrs.  Guinness and Co., whilst State servants have always, as a matter of right and condition of employment, been entitled to pensions on retirement. The first Superannuation Act was enacted in this country as far back as 1834.  It is time we got automatic machinery within the framework of the superannuation code to do justice to those people.</P>
    <P>The Minister also made the point&mdash; I do not really know what force is in it &mdash;that in this country the pension is calculated on the last year of service, whereas in other countries the pension is calculated over a number of years. That may be so, and it may not be so, but it certainly does not prove anything, because if the Minister wants to go on and fall entirely into line with other countries, he will find that in this country the pension of a State servant is about 50 per cent of the salary, whereas in other countries it varies from 75 per cent to 78 per cent of the salary.  In countries such as Austria, Belgium, France and Denmark, the pension is between 75 and 78 per cent of the salary at the time of retirement. Therefore it is not good enough for the Minister to throw in this red herring about the salary being calculated on the last year whereas in other countries it is calculated on three years.</P>
    <P>The Government have a bad record so far as doing justice to State servants is concerned.  They were in power from 1932 until 1948, and they never introduced during that period one solitary measure increasing the pensions of State servants.  It was not until 1950 when Mr. Paddy McGilligan, then Minister for Finance, introduced&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): The Minister wanted to get away from the old age pensions.  I will leave the old age pensions on the note that it is a shabby confidence trick to publish in the papers and over the mass media of communications, in April and again <Col N="1790" /> in November, that there was an increase of 5/- a week in old age pensions, without qualification, when it turns out that only one in seven got it. That is something about which the Government cannot be proud.</P>
      <P>In 1959, there were 5,068 State pensioners; 56 per cent of them were getting less than £200 a year; and 1,042 were getting £100 a year or less. The position has not materially changed since.  As I said, the most alarming part of it is the Minister's general approach.  If he had said: &ldquo;We have no money this year but as soon as we get the money, we will do the decent thing by the State pensioners,&rdquo; we might not agree but we would understand his case.  Last Wednesday he said he proposes to continue the policy which his predecessor enunciated in this House some years ago, that they will proceed to do what they can within the limits of the Budget; in other words, if there is anything left the pensioners will get it.  That is not good enough.</P>
      <P>I should like to deal with the question of Garda Síochána pensions which was dealt with by other speakers. There is one particular aspect with which I should like to deal, that is, the way in which Garda widows have been treated.  They were left on miserably small pensions, but the climax was reached in 1964 when the Minister thought fit to give them an increase of 10/- a week in their pensions, and the net result of that operation was that their non-contributory old age pensions were reduced by 25/-a week.  On the one hand, the Minister gave those people an increase of 10/-a week, and on the other, their widows' pensions were reduced by 25/- a week, leaving them with a net loss of 15/- a week.  That calls for an explanation from the Minister and from the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Party intend to press this motion to a division, because we do not think the Minister has made any case against it.  We do not believe the Minister has given any indication to the House that he intends to change his attitude in the years to come. <Col N="1791" /> Indeed, it is very depressing to find that when we have a new and comparatively young Minister for Finance, he comes in here and brings no new thinking in this particular sphere into his Department.  He says he is prepared to adopt and to follow the unsatisfactory policy of his predecessors.  This year so far there has been no adjustment whatever in the pensions of State servants.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and indeed I thank Deputy Ryan and others for their constructive contributions.  The heat was generated at a later stage but certainly Deputy Ryan, Deputy Dillon and Deputy M.J. O'Higgins made very effective contributions, as did also Deputy James Tully, Deputy Dunne and Deputy O'Leary of the Labour Party.  There were, too, some contributions from the Fianna Fáil benches in the same constructive spirit.  This is as it should be on an Estimate of this nature, which relates to matters which all Parties, despite the heat of by-elections, would wish to see discussed in a sane and sensible manner in order to achieve the proper balance that needs to be achieved, in order to ensure that the effective administration of justice is continued.  I take it that it is a basic principle on the part of all political Parties that we do seek to achieve the proper balance necessary to ensure that the common good and the individual's liberty are at the same time guaranteed.</P>
      <P>The main point made by a number of Fine Gael speakers was in regard to the recent incident in the Mansion House concerning a meeting called by the Language Freedom Movement. I should like to state&mdash;and indeed there is very little need for me to state it&mdash;that freedom of assembly and freedom of speech are fundamental rights guaranteed in our Constitution, in our laws, and as long as I am Minister for Justice and our Government are here, and I am sure this would apply if another Government were here, these basic rights will continue to be guaranteed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The facts surrounding this particular incident in the Mansion House were such as to indicate that at the point of time when the meeting was taking place indoors and organised by a particular organisation, which apparently decided to hold this meeting without being able adequately to control <Col N="1805" /> it, in that situation it would have been disastrous for the Garda to have intervened.  The whole purpose of the police force is to preserve public order and to prevent breaches of the peace. Certainly in regard to any public meeting this would be the purpose of the Garda but in regard to any indoor meeting of this kind, the Garda, as a matter of practice, and of wise practice, do not move unless they are specifically asked to do so and my information is that they were not asked to intervene at this meeting.  I have checked on this matter since Deputy Byrne was speaking last week.  The Garda say that in the interests of public order and of preventing breaches of the peace, if they did happen to move in, they would, in the circumstances of that particular time, have added further to the disturbances already taking place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. P. Byrne Mr. P. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am constrained to make the remark&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to prevent any heat in this discussion, but as it did occupy so much time in the debate, I am constrained to reply to it.  In any matter of an internal meeting of this kind, organised by the Language Freedom Movement or any other language organisation, or by a political Party, or by anybody, it is the basic duty of the people who organise it to steward their own arrangements, to organise their own meeting.  At no stage was it ever regarded as the duty of the police force, here or in any other country, to go into an internal meeting of this kind and steward that meeting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. P. Byrne Mr. P. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister if he is accepting my word that at the request of the Language Freedom Movement, I asked the Commissioner of the Garda, on the afternoon before the meeting was held, on the previous day, to ensure that law and order would be observed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>On that aspect, the Garda are rightly reluctant in any way &mdash;and this is normal police practice in police forces elsewhere&mdash;to go into <Col N="1806" /> territory which is outside the public sphere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. P. Byrne Mr. P. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is accepting my word?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not doubting the Deputy's word.  We are all interested in preserving the rights of individuals and of associations and of people to organise themselves if they wish and the Garda are rightly reluctant to interfere in any way which would suggest that they are stewarding internal arrangements of a particular body.  I think it is one of the facts of life in a democracy that if a particular person or organisation proposes to have a meeting indoors, then it is incumbent on that person or organisation so to organise the meeting by way of stewarding, by way of proper supervision of people admitted, to ensure that the meeting is held in an orderly way. It is only when a grave breach of the peace or serious offences or assaults are threatened, that the police decide to move.  Indeed, in the particular circumstances, there was no obligation on the police to move and because of the rowdy situation which developed and in the tempo of that particular time, if the police had moved in, matters would have been far worse.</P>
      <P>I refer to that matter at some length in order to put it into its proper perspective. Deputy Dillon and some speakers became a little hysterical about the whole thing.  You have these indoor meetings but it is a matter for the police force to maintain public order outside, and it is a matter for the people organising these meetings to maintain order inside.  If they are not able to do that, they are not an effective organisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of other points were raised during the debate.  Deputy Carty and some other speakers spoke about the lack of uniformity in regard to penalties imposed in the District Courts.  In the past few years, we have invested the President of the District Court with certain responsibilities and in this regard meetings may be held by the Justices of the District Court with a view to achieving a reasonable degree <Col N="1807" /> of uniformity; but you are up against another basic principle in the Constitution, and one in all Constitutions where laws operate in a free way, that once justices or judges are appointed, they must have judicial discretion in sentencing.  One cannot regulate the actions of justices in regard to penalties and the discretion they exercise.  At the meetings they have, they throw around their own ideas in an effort to achieve a degree of uniformity.  That is one of the purposes of having a President of the district court to convene meetings. To seek to regulate the matter in any way further than that would be contrary, I think, to the basic principles of our law and the Constitution.  But I agree with Deputy Carty and also with other Deputies that greater uniformity of penalties is to be desired. There is no question about that.  I suggest that District Justices and other Judges should bear in mind what has been said in the House on this matter of public policy because it is important that public confidence be maintained in the courts.  It does cause some erosion of public confidence if the public see disparity in penalties.  I am quite sure most members of the judiciary are aware of this but it is all to the good that it should be raised in the Dáil and emphasised that a degree of uniformity is a desirable objective and that we have gone as far as we can to ensure it by having these regular statutory meetings of district justices over the past few years under the chairmanship of the President of the District Courts.  I am convinced from my own examination of the records that a considerable amount has been done in the direction of uniformity since this procedure was adopted.</P>
    <P>Another procedure that has come under fire in the House is the procedure of ministerial prerogative.  The right to examine petitions and rectify a disparity or a wrong is also a factor in ensuring a reasonable degree of uniformity.  Some people criticise this executive function and say it should not reside in the Minister for Justice.  I would defend it to the end whether I or any other Minister for Justice is <Col N="1808" /> here.  It is proper that the Minister for Justice should have that ultimate decision in respect of a petition where he sees disparity in regard to penalties. Judges are human as well as everybody else and having examined the file and having referred the matter back to the judge and to the police for their comments if the Minister takes the view that there should be some rectification of the penalty imposed, I think that right should reside in him in the interests of ensuring a reasonable degree of uniformity so that the balance is held as far as possible and no injustice arises.</P>
    <P>A number of practical suggestions were made regarding the administration of the criminal law.  I mentioned in my opening speech that I have a very substantial Bill on the stocks at present. We hope to have this published in the New Year.  It is concerned with a wholesale reform of the criminal law, investing the police with new powers in regard to search and arrest but at the same time making these matters subject to the courts; rationalising the various powers which are very vague at the moment and not clear either to the police or the public; rationalising police powers regarding finger printing, bringing in new sections to deal with crimes of violence, in particular with offensive weapons.  All of this was generally welcomed in the House and we shall have this legislation in the New Year.</P>
    <P>A particular matter mentioned which I am examining with a view to incorporation in this legislation is the rather novel idea of making the offender pay the victim compensation in circumstances where that is warranted and where the compensation can be accurately assessed in lieu of a fine or imprisonment.  This is an attractive idea.  I am very attracted to it: it obviously attracted other Deputies also. But there are difficulties regarding the administration of it.  Some of these were mentioned by some Deputies.  An obvious difficulty is the difficulty of administration in regard to collecting compensation, whether it should be by way of instalments or otherwise.  Another difficulty also was mentioned by <Col N="1809" /> Deputy O'Higgins, whom I now see coming into the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Higgins said that while the idea attracted him, also it could be regarded as favouring people who could afford to pay compensation to the victims against people who might not be able to afford the compensation and would therefore have to go to jail instead of paying compensation for an offence.  It is an idea that I am having examined and I am hopeful that we will come up with something on this particular aspect.</P>
      <P>Deputy Carty raised the question of bail and we are examining the bail procedure which exists at present which I do not consider to be as effective as it should be.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cluskey and Deputy Tully mentioned the question of juries and jurors and I remarked across the House to Deputy Cluskey, I think, that we were aware of the anomalies which have arisen in this respect over the years on two counts (a)  the very limited classes that fall to be called for jury service and (b)  the inadequate amount that jurors are paid when they forfeit their day's pay or week's work or business on this account.  On both of these aspects of the matter I have had a report from the Committee of Inquiry into Court Practices and Procedures which I am examining.  It is being very thoroughly examined at present and again I hope to have legislation dealing with this subject in train in the New Year in a reform of the whole juries legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was glad to hear Deputy Dunne, and Deputy O'Leary, agree with my point of view in regard to newspapers, radio and TV.  I do not want to start any row with the communications world.  I have always had reasonably good relations with them at personal and official levels but far from being in accord with Deputy Ryan, who suggested <Col N="1810" /> that I had in some way stabbed them in the back&mdash;to use his own phrase this afternoon&mdash;I think it is a good thing that we should air our views in this House and that we should have an exchange of opinions, the way I look at it and the way other Deputies look at it.  One thing I am very worried about and it has been brought out very dramatically, particularly in the US recently, that is, the imitative effect that over-highlighting crime certainly does have.  While reporting is legitimate and a very good thing, over-highlighting a crime undoubtedly has had this effect as figures here and in other places show, that a few days afterwards you find other people committing the same type of crime.  There was a classic example of this recently in the United States in the form of very serious paranoid murders where one found repetitions of them once the first had happened in Texas.</P>
    <P>This does happen as a result of excessive reporting of crime.  We find a definite pattern that if a certain type or form of crime is highlighted on television or in a particularly popular film or in newspaper headlines this type of crime tends to be repeated in the following weeks.  That is why I mention this point in all seriousness. How to reconcile the legitimate business of the communications world with this particular aspect of the matter is something to which further thought must be given.  It is important that the whole question of crime reporting be kept in perspective and if a crime occurs, if that is given appropriate publicity, it should not be too lurid, and if there is an arrest there is no need to mention the name of the person who has been apprehended. The story of the apprehension should be given a reasonable amount of publicity to restore confidence among the public.  If a particularly bad crime takes place and it gets publicity and there is no follow-up in regard to any arrest having taken place, there is public disquiet because the public are under the impression that the police are not effective in getting their man.  In fact they are getting their man.  Our detection rate at 70 per cent <Col N="1811" /> is the highest detection rate in Europe and is not much short of twice what the British detection rate is.  There is no reason for complacency in that, but at least it is good.  My duty here as Minister for Justice in charge of our police force is to emphasise that fact and to suggest to the public that if certain criminal matters attract an inordinate amount of publicity and if they do not see in the papers any follow-up on that, it is not the fault of the police.  In 100 per cent of these cases there is a follow-up; the person is apprehended in 70 per cent and in a great number of these cases there is a conviction.</P>
    <P>The question of traffic offences was the subject of considerable discussion here.  As Deputies know, the Road Traffic Bill is now ready for discussion in the House.  It will be the responsibility of the Minister for Local Government. It is one of those areas of administration where the Minister for Justice has a function and the Minister for Local Government has a function. It has been suggested that it should be entirely the responsibility of the Minister for Justice, but the planning of our road networks is a matter for expert planning engineers and these are people who are with the local authorities throughout the country.  For that reason it was thought better to leave it to the Department of Local Government.  We confine ourselves to the enforcement aspect.  It is the enforcement aspect that earns all the kicks and causes most of the comment.</P>
    <P>On the aspect of enforcement one point was mentioned here and I am very glad to say it is covered under the new Road Traffic Bill.  I agree that it is an anomalous situation that guards and their officers who are highly skilled people in the business of crime detection should have their time taken up in dealing with minor traffic offences. This arrangement is not suited to the needs of either the traffic or the crime position today.  Under the new Road Traffic Bill we are seeking statutory authority for the recruitment and appointment of traffic wardens.  It is hoped to recruit retired Garda or Army personnel for this purpose.  Ex-members <Col N="1812" /> of the Garda force and possibly ex-members of the Army would be in a position to do the basic work that is involved in applying parking tickets and dealing with other minor offences.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope it is not intended to economise on this.  I agree with the Minister's view that the question of having wardens should be looked into, but it would be a mistake to regard it as a purely secondary occupation and simply to pay pensioners a few pounds to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The full statutory functions and powers that apply in regard to this at the moment will remain.  These people will be empowered to deal with minor traffic offences, parking offences, particularly, so as to relieve trained manpower that at the moment is detailed for this comparatively minor sort of offence in order that they may apply themselves to duties more appropriate to a police force.  We in the Department of Justice pushed this idea and I, in particular, was very anxious that this idea be incorporated in the Bill.  You can rationalise the position much better by having the police force fully geared for work which is appropriate to a trained, disciplined organisation.</P>
      <P>Another matter which is being dealt with under pending legislation is the question of abandoned cars which has become a menace in recent times. Mention was made of the importance of having clearways particularly in regard to traffic coming out of major centres.  That has already gone into operation.</P>

      <P>In deference to Deputy Tully, we might try the Belfast road.  Another important point which was mentioned by Deputy O'Leary was in regard to extending the system of fines on the spot to minor offences other than parking offences.  This is part of a recommendation which has come to hand from the Committee of Inquiry into Court Practice and Procedures, and we are also covering that under pending legislation.</P>

      <P>The original proposal for fines on the spot for motor cars was discussed fully here.  Arguments were advanced for and against, but I think there is a whole range of offences of that kind&mdash;Deputy O'Leary mentioned the absence of a front or rear light on a bicycle&mdash;in which this principle could be further extended.  I think there is validity in this suggestion. I know there is a theoretical argument that nobody should be penalised in that arbitrary fashion, but it is a minor offence and although there is a theoretical injustice caused, if you like, in this arbitrary imposition, there can be far more injustice in taking a person away from his work and having him hanging around a court all day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank Deputy James Tully for his remarks about the motorcycle patrol. This is my own idea, that we should extend the motorcycle patrols considerably, as we have done.  We have probably doubled them in the past 12 months with the idea of having these patrols available on busy roads to act as a deterrent as well as for the purpose of apprehension.  The very fact that we have these clearly visible Garda motor cyclists moving along the main trunk roadways will act as a deterrent to excessive speeding and road misbehaviour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes; that is another day's work.  The Deputy was very strong about this point of motorcars moving too slowly, and rightly so.  They can sometimes be a greater menance than speeding motorists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Another point on which some emphasis was laid by Deputy Dillon and Deputy O'Higgins was the question of the Garda foot patrols.  I should like to emphasise here that there is no question of abandoning the Garda foot patrol, for the police foot patrol in any country remains the basic way of keeping in touch with the people in the area in <Col N="1815" /> which the patrol is taking place, keeping in touch with potential offenders and with the situation generally.  I would regard the mechanisation of the Force in the way of increased motorcars, increased motorcycles, increased radio communication, as ancillary to the man on the beat.  Sometimes the view is taken that there is in some way conflict between the two approaches. There is not.  In fact, they both mesh in together and there has been no diminution of the number of men on the beat in this city.  What we seek to do by having motor patrols and motorcycle patrols feeding into them is to make them more effective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to interrupt the Minister&mdash;perhaps he is going to deal with it&mdash;but I was not confining my references to the city.  I fully agree with what the Minister is saying regarding the city.  I was thinking in terms of the old-time push bicycle used by the garda, in the rural areas particularly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Well, at the same time, they still have their push bicycles in rural areas.  There is to be no diminution in push bicycles either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is that a squad car or motorcyclist going through an area can cover ten times the ground but the garda is not getting himself acquainted with the area in the same way as the man on the beat could.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt about what Deputy O'Higgins says and the man on the beat still remains and is very important.  Even though we have had a lot of improvements since police forces were first formed, the man on the beat still remains basic to the whole situation.  In the United States, Britain and here, the man on foot is basic to the whole situation.  He is in touch with the area; he is in a position to get information, in a position to know really what is happening. I grant you that.  What we are doing is to make his work, particularly in the <Col N="1816" /> bigger urban centres, more effective by bringing in a new system of two-way personal radio links-up.  We have had various trials over the past 12 months in this regard.  We have tried various sets.  We have had discussions with our counterparts in Britain with a view to deciding what is the most effective way of doing this.</P>
      <P>We have now come down on the side of a particular set which will enable the ordinary garda on the beat, with a pocket set that is hardly visible inside his tunic, to maintain direct contact with the patrol cars assigned to his area and with his own station.  We have a complete radio network established in Dublin and in a number of provincial centres&mdash;about 14 country towns and cities.  In Dublin, we are augmenting it by the purchase of about 150 of these personal radio sets as a start.  At the moment they are on purchase and 150 men on the beat, inside the next month or two, will have this two-way direct radio control with the Garda motorcars in their area and with their own home station.  This will be an additional strength to the man on the beat.</P>
      <P>The only danger heretofore, particularly in urban centres, has been the isolation of the policeman on the beat from his comrades or from the station. With this means now, direct communication can be established within seconds of something happening.  The 150 sets are a start.  I should like to see it extended so that throughout the whole State, and especially in the bigger urban centres, we will have this system adopted which has proved successful in other centres throughout the world. One man on the beat will be able to establish direct communication and will no longer feel isolated from whatever support he needs in dealing with a particular situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This has been a very long debate. There is one point that occupied a certain amount of time today.  A number of Deputies, particularly Deputy O'Leary, referred to it.  It is the question of prison officers.  The point was made that in some way they were being neglected.  I should like to pay tribute to them here.  That is the first <Col N="1817" /> thing I want to do.  They are doing an excellent job.  I should like to correct one wrong impression which may have been created.  Deputy O'Leary, perhaps on wrong information, seemed to think that there was some difficulty in recruiting prison officers.  We have no difficulty about recruiting either male or female officers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, we have no particular difficulty there.  I grant that there may be other points that the Deputy mentioned in regard to conditions of work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and the time they must come in and the need for a written request before getting permission to go out.  I understand that at the moment there are conciliation council proceedings in regard to their terms of service and I would prefer not to comment now and to see what emerges from that.  I do know that there is conciliation and arbitration machinery operating in regard to the prison service.  The rates of pay are settled through this machinery.  There is a Prison Officers' Association that has acted on behalf of the officers concerned.  The rates of pay issue has been settled but there are a number of questions, many of which were mentioned by Deputy O'Leary, concerning their conditions of service and these are actually under consideration under the conciliation machinery.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will see what emerges from the conciliation proceedings. I agree with Deputy O'Leary that it is important that the morale of this Force should be high and I would certainly be concerned if there were any question of its not being high.  I will certainly look into it.  The morale of the Garda force is quite high at the moment and I should like to see an equally high morale attained in the prison service also if that were not so.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Higgins referred to the whole question of the Garda linking up with youth clubs in order to prevent any form of juvenile delinquency.  This is going very well.  The system of having juvenile liaison officers has been extended outside Dublin to a number of country towns.  These officers are co-operating with various Church and social agencies.  It is a matter that has to be handled delicately because it is a field in which the Garda should not move too quickly because it is a field where voluntary effort by people who wish to dedicate themselves should be paramount.  The Garda like to come in and help.  The system is going very well and, as I said in my opening speech, the success rate has been quite high in this respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think there are too many more points that need to be covered. The work of the Adoption Board was referred to particularly by Deputy Cluskey.  He raised certain points of detail in regard to its administration which I will have examined, but I do not think it would be practical to do what he suggested in regard to the establishment of regional boards.  At present the Adoption Board are working quite well.  They are moving out from Dublin and have hearings in Cork and elsewhere.  I should like to take this opportunity of congratulating them on the excellence of the work done in the past 12 months. It is a considerable social achievement that over 1,000 homeless children have been allocated to parents who look after them as their own which they then become.  It is one of <Col N="1819" /> the most heartening developments that have taken place in Ireland in the past 50 years.</P>
    <P>I was glad of the mention on the part of all Deputies of the credit due to the Garda force.  I should like to emphasise again how important it is that the public should be equally aware of the importance of the Force in preserving law and order.  There are, perhaps, now and again instances of the relations between individual members of the Force and the public going wrong.  I investigate any complaints that come to my notice, and the record is very good.  The Force is held in high esteem.  I am very thankful for the various complimentary references made by Deputies in this respect.</P>
    <P>There was one matter mentioned which again is the subject matter of pending legislation, that is, the proposed amendment of the criminal injuries code.  This is the subject matter of an interdepartmental committee report.  I am having the whole question of the criminal injuries code examined at the moment with a view to legislation. The point was made&mdash;it is a very valid point that has been argued out over the years&mdash;that it is wrong, certainly on a straight look at the problem, that where insurance cover exists local authorities should have to bear the burden of compensation in the case of malicious injuries.  This is a matter which was mentioned in the committee report and is one in respect of which I hope to have proposals before the Government in the near future.  It also concerns other aspects of the malicious injuries code which require reform.  It certainly does appear&mdash;and it is my view, too&mdash;that in any case where insurance cover is in existence it is wrong to burden local authorities with compensation for which an insurance company should be made liable and in respect of which an insurance policy is in existence. That is just one aspect of the general field of criminal injuries I should like to mention.  It would be part of proposals, I hope, in regard to complete reform of the code.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1820" /> Another aspect which was mentioned in this respect was the question of a member of the public going to the assistance of a garda.  Again, this was the subject matter of recommendations in that report that, where this did happen and where a member of the public was injured or suffered damage in any form by reason of assisting a garda in a particular matter of public importance, where a crime or something of that nature was involved, there should be some statutory right residing in that member of the public to recover compensation for whatever injuries or damage were suffered.  This is also a matter to which I am giving attention in connection with the proposed reform of the criminal injuries code.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I have covered most of the points.  It was a very long debate, but I think we have pretty well covered everything.  It was mentioned in regard to the Reform of Juries Bill that we are extending the classes of people who qualify.  This will include women as well.  Deputy Cluskey made a strong speech yesterday about women's rights.  While somebody else said subsequently he was more theoretical than practical, I think there is a good deal to be said for giving women the same rights as men in this respect, even though in many cases women may not welcome having to go on to juries away from their domestic duties.  However, as a matter of principle it is something with which I agree.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two points of view on it.  They were put yesterday.  The debate in general has been very constructive.  If I have <Col N="1821" /> omitted any points made by Deputies &mdash;there were quite a number of points made in this respect&mdash;I will be glad to deal with them afterwards in the way of correspondence or discussion. It is important in the administration of justice that we keep up with the changing situation in regard to law and the needs of our society.  As I said in my opening speech, at the moment we are interested in the whole field of enforcing court judgements not alone between here and Britain but between here and every Western European country with which we will be associated in the Common Market.  This is an example of the sort of law reform which takes into account the political situation into which we are going.  In general that is the sort of thinking I should like to see all the time in the Department of Justice to ensure that law reform takes place in accordance with the changing needs of the people in our society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our great political objective at present is to secure entry into EEC. For that reason I feel that our laws should move in that direction as well. It is going to be important, if we hope to have close trade, economic and social relations with European countries, that our court judgements and court orders would be equally effective throughout the countries with which we are associated, and that theirs are equally effective here, in order to facilitate the freer exchange of trade, economic and social objectives.  I mention that as just one example.  That is why I feel in regard to every field of legal reform we must always ensure that we keep in touch and require that legal reform take cognisance of the nature of our society today, but that we do not change just for change's sake.  If we do have legal reform, such as the present Ground Rents Bill, which is with the Seanad at the moment, the legal reform proposed in regard to the reform of the criminal law to which I have referred, the reform of the courts in the new Courts of Justice Bill or the reform of the jury system in the Juries Bill, any legislation of reform in the coming 12 months will be legislation dealing with practical aspects which can improve the administration of law <Col N="1822" /> for the benefit of the citizen, and such improvement will be in accordance with the needs of our society today, and the sort of society we are moving into in the years ahead.</P>

      <P>Tá sonraí i dtaobh obair Roinn na <Col N="1824" /> Gaeltachta ar fáil anois sa <i>Leabhrán Eolais</i> a foilsíodh ar na mallaibh agus tá súil agam go mbeidh an leabhrán sin ina áis mhór do Theachtaí a bhfuil ceantair Ghaeltachta faoina gcúram acu.  Faoi mar a léirítear i ndeireadh an leabhráin, caitheadh £824,510 anuraidh faoi scéimeanna na Roinne agus, sa tsuim sin, bhí&mdash;</P>
      <P>£229,995 do scéimeanna tithíochta, £189,820 do scéimeanna feabhsúcháin sa Ghaeltacht,</P>
      <P>£188,145 do scéimeanna cultúrtha agus sóisialacha,</P>
      <P>£56,550 d'eagrais Ghaeilge agus £160,000 do Ghaeltarra Éireann.</P>
      <P>Bhí caiteachas na bliana anuraidh roinnt mhaith níos airde ná caiteachas aon bhliana roimhe sin.  Tugtar an méid a caitheadh faoi gach ceann de na scéimeanna ar chúpla leathanach sa leabhrán.</P>
      <P>Nuair a bhí Meastachán na bliana seo caite á ullmhú dhá bhliain ó shin cuireadh isteach £50,000 le haghaidh scéim áirithe feabhsúcháin ach, faoi mar a thárla, níorbh fhéidir dul ar aghaidh leis an scéim i rith na bliana agus ní raibh cead ag an Roinn an soláthar sin a chaitheamh ar bhealaí eile.  Lasmuigh den tsuim sin, áfach, caitheadh gach pingin dá raibh ar fáil sa Vóta: £907,512 glan-iomlán an chaiteachais anuraidh agus tá beagnach £100,000 níos mó ná sin i Meastachán na bliana reatha&mdash;a théann thar £1,000,000 den chéad uair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá an soláthar le haghaidh na dtithe Gaeltachta ardaithe go dtí £250,000 i mbliana.  Ba mhór an dul chun cinn a rinneadh anuraidh i gcúrsaí tithíochta. Tógadh 198 dteach nua, feabhsaíodh 314 eile agus cuireadh saoráidí sláintíochta&mdash;uisce, séarachas, seomra folcaidh&mdash;isteach ina bhformhór mór. Cuireadh méadú speisialta le haghaidh cuairteoirí le 50 teach agus tógadh 16 cinn de sheallaí saoire i gcaitheamh na bliana.  Le seacht mbliana anuas tógadh beagnach 1,200 teach agus feabhsaíodh suas le 2,000 eile agus, d'fhonn gur fearr a d'fhéadfaí freastal ar chuairteoirí, cuireadh méadú speisialta le breis agus 200 teach agus tógadh 43 shealla saoire agus 4 bhrú; íocadh ós <Col N="1825" /> cionn £1,200,000 i ndeontais agus ós cionn £50,000 in iasachtaí sa tréimhse sin.</P>
    <P>Soláthar £206,000 atá againn do na scéimeanna feabhsúcháin sa Ghaeltacht i mbliana i gcomparáid leis an tsuim £189,820 a caitheadh orthu anuraidh.  Tá mioneolas faoi na scéimeanna uile sa leabhrán a luaigh me cheana.  Ní miste a rá go bhfuil feabhas curtha ar na deontais fhorlíontacha le haghaidh athinmheachan talún agus foirgnimh feirme agus go bhfuil an deontas uasta dúbailte i gcás taitneamhactaí ilghnéitheacha.  Chomh maith leis sin ba mhaith liom tagairt ar leith a dhéanamh do na scéimeanna nua a tugadh isteach den chéad uair i mbliana.</P>
    <P>Nuair a bhíonn iascaire sásúil sa Ghaeltacht ag lorg bád iascaigh ón mBord Iascaigh Mhara agus nach acmhainn dó iomlán na héariaise íosta a chur síos, tig leis an Roinn anois teacht i gcabhair air agus deontas suas go 80 faoin gcéad den éarlais a chur ar fáil.</P>
    <P>Nuair is mian le hiarratasóir cáilithe teach gloine aonair a thógáil dó féin sa Ghaeltacht, is féidir leis an Roinn anois deontas dhá thrian den chostas a íoc leis.  Ní gá feasta gur ina ngrúpaí i dteannta a chéile i limistéir áirithe a thógfar na tithe gloine: tógadh dhá ghrúpa mar sin roimhe seo, i gCois Fharraige, Co. na Gaillimhe, agus i nGort an Choirce, Co.  Dhún na nGall &mdash;tuairim 100 i ngach ceantar.  Beidh comhairle theicniúil ar fáil tríd an tseirbhís chomhairleach áitiúil i gcomhar leis an Roinn Talmhaíochta agus Iascaigh d'fhonn a chur ar chumas na gcuradóirí barraí éagsúla a shaothrú.</P>
    <P>Is fada atáimid ag iarraidh an chomharaíocht&mdash;comhar na gcomharsan&mdash;a chur chun cinn sa Ghaeltacht, mar is deimhin linn go bhféadfadh comharchumainn dea-eagraithe mórchuid maitheasa a dhéanamh, go háirithe i gcúrsaí talmhaíochta agus iascaigh.  Anois is féidir leis an Roinn deontas reachtála, suas go £2,000 sa bhliain ar feadh cúig bliana, a thabhairt do chomharchumann Gaeltachta. Ina theannta sin, tig linn deontais, de réir tuillteanais an cháis, a chur ar <Col N="1826" /> fáil do chomharchumainn áirithe le haghaidh foirgneamh agus gléasra.  Níl an chomharaíocht ach ag tosú go fóill sa Ghaeltacht ach tá muinín agam go rachaidh sí i méid agus i neart i gcaitheamh na mblian atá romhainn.</P>
    <P>Tá cosúlacht ar an scéal go bhfuil forbairt mhór i ndán don chuartaíocht sa Ghaeltach ó tharla gur ansin atá cuid de na háiteanna is áille sa tír. Ní beag an tairbhe do mhuintir na Gaeltachta a dtéann de dhaoine ar saoire sna tithe chucu agus, dá bhrí sin, tugtar cúnamh ar leith faoi Achtanna na dTithe (Gaeltacht) chun seomraí breise a chur leis na tithe. Ní leor chor ar bith an roinnt bheag óstán agus tithe aíochta atá sa Ghaeltacht le freastal ar ghnó na cuartaíochta feasta.  Anois, áfach, nuair a thugann Bord Fáilte Éireann deontais chun óstáin, tithe aíochta nó saoráidí eile do chuairteoirí a fheabhsú nó a chur ar fáil sa Ghaeltacht, tá ar chumas na Roinne deontais fhorlíontacha a thabhairt i gcásanna ina ndéanfar an bhainistíocht ar chuma a rachaidh chun leasa don Ghaeilge.  Más Gaeilgeoirí na hiarratasóirí beidh deontas forlíontach na Roinne ar chóimhéad le bundeontas an Bhoird.  Ba mhaith linn, ar ndóigh, go mbeadh oiread Gaeilgeoirí agus is féidir ag triall ar an Ghaeltacht mar chuairteoirí.</P>
    <P>Is chun forbairt eacnamíoch na Gaeltachta a chur chun cinn a tugadh isteach gach ceann de na scéimeanna nua atá luaite agam tá dóchas agam go n-éireoidh go maith leo uile.</P>
    <P>Soláthar £223,250 atá againn do na scéimeanna cultúrtha agus sóisialacha i mbliana i gcomparáid leis an tsuim £188,145 a caitheadh orthu anuraidh. Tá sonraí i dtaobh na scéimeanna seo fosta i leabhrán eolais na Roinne.  Is ar an deontas £10 a chaitear beagnach leath an airgid.  Tá feabhas curtha ar an scéim sin i gcaoi is go bhfuil an deontas ar fáil anois bliain níos túisce i gcás daltaí a shroicheann sé bliana d'aois idir 1 Iúil agus 1 Eanáir.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis an scéim liúntas do dhaltaí Gaeltachta a chónaíonn as baile fad a bhíonn siad ag déanamh chúrsaí oiliúna ceadaithe eile, is maith liom é a bheith le rá agam go bhfuil <Col N="1827" /> na liúntais ar fáil anois ag cailíní chomh maith le buachaillí agus go bhfuil siad méadaithe ó £100 sa chéad bhliain agus £50 sa dara bliain go dtí £140 sa chéad bhliain agus £110 sa dara bliain agus go bhfuil liúntas nua £50 curtha ar fáil sa tríú bliain.  Tá súil agam go mbainfear tuilleadh feidhme as an scéim seo feasta.</P>
    <P>I gcás an chúnamh taistil do dhaltaí meánscoile agus gairmscoile, tá 18 meánscoil agus 16 ghairmscoil ag fáil tairbhe na scéime agus thuill ós cionn 900 dalta cúnamh fúithi sa scoilbhliain seo caite.</P>
    <P>Tá líon na ndaltaí a théann go dtí an Ghaeltacht faoi Scéim na Scoláireachtaí Saoire ag dul i méid i gcónaí agus i mbliana tugadh amach ós cionn 8,000 deontas scoláireachta dar luach £5 an ceann.  Chomh maith leis sin caitheann idir 300 agus 400 dalta in aghaidh na bliana téarma scoile sa Ghaeltacht faoi Scéim na Scoláireachtaí Cónaithe, is é sin an scéim faoina gcuireann an Roinn scoláireacht £20 an dalta ar fáil trí choistí aitheanta. Maidir leis na scoláireachtaí saoire sa Ghaeltacht a bhronntar mar dhuaiseanna ag Feiseanna, tá an deontas a thugann an Roinn méadaithe go dtí £15 an scoláireacht.</P>
    <P>Ní leis an Ghaeltacht amháin, ar ndóigh, a bhaineann an fheidhm atá ag an Roinn i dtaobh cabhrú le caomhnú agus leathnú na Gaeilge mar ghnáthurlabhra.  Dá chomhartha sin, tugtar deontais chun cabhrú le&mdash;</P>
    <P>nuachtáin agus tréimhseacháin a fhoilsítear i nGaeilge agus, faoi scéim a feabhsaíodh go mór ar na mallaibh, nuachtáin áitiúla a léitear sa Ghaeltacht agus a fhoilsíonn nuacht reatha i nGaeilge,</P>
    <P>gearrscannáin le tráchtaireachtaí i nGaeilge, agus</P>
    <P>eagrais Ghaeilge éagsúla&mdash;ar a n-áiritear Comhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge, Conradh na Gaeilge, an tOireachtas agus An Chomhairle Náisiúnta Drámaíochta.</P>
    <P>Tá tábhacht ar leith i saothar na n-eagras Gaeilge agus táimid ag cabhrú leo chun a gcuid oibre a dhéanamh le héifeacht agus le heagar. <Col N="1828" /> Ní miste a lua gur glacadh le bunreacht nua do Chomhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge i mí Márta seo caite ina leagtar síos gurb &ldquo;é is feidhm don Chomhdháil na heagrais Ghaeilge agus cairde eile na teanga a thabhairt le chéile ar mhaithe leis an gcuspóir náisiúnta an Ghaeilge a athbheochan&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Faoi mar is eol do Theachtaí, is é Gaeltarra Éireann an príomhghléas atá ag an Rialtas chun gníomhaíochtaí eacnamaíocha de chineál tionsclaíoch a fhorbairt i ngach limistéar Gaeltachta. Faoin Acht leasaithe a ritheadh anuraidh tá de chumhacht ag Gaeltarra dul i bpáirtíocht le tionsclaithe a bhfuil eolas teicniúil agus teacht ar mhargaí acu, scaireanna a ghlacadh i gcomhlachtaí agus deontais mhóra a thabhairt chun tionscail oiriúnacha a fhorbairt.  Chomh maith leis sin, tig le Gaeltarra deontais suas go £2,000 a thabhairt chun miontionscadail shomhaoineacha a chur chun cinn sa Ghaeltacht gan dul i bpáirtíocht leis na daoine ina mbun.  Ó bhí mé ag caint anseo cheana faoi chúrsaí Ghaeltarra, tá stiúrthóirí nua ar an mBord&mdash; daoine a bhfuil cáil orthu i gcúrsaí tionscail agus riaracháin &mdash; táthar tar éis Bainisteoir Ginearálta a cheapadh agus tá feabhas curtha ar an eagraíocht i gcoitinne.</P>
    <P>Tá dóchas agam go dtiocfaidh leis an mBord ní amháin na príomhthionscail atá acu&mdash;an bréidín, na hearraí lámhchniotáilte agus na bréagáin bhoga&mdash;a fhorbairt go mór ach go dtiocfaidh leo fosta tionscail nua a bhunú as a gconlán féin nó i gcomhar le tionsclaithe eile agus go n-éireoidh leo ar na bealaí sin fostaíocht a chur ar fáil do bhreis mhaith daoine sa Ghaeltacht.  Tá súil agam go mbeidh tacaíocht le fáil ag an mBord ón Dáil, ó mhuintir na Gaeltachta agus ó gach aon duine ar mór aige an tír agus an teanga.</P>
    <P>Ba chóir gur léir, óna bhfuil ráite agam, ó na sonraí atá curtha ar fáil againn i Leabhrán Eolais na Roinne, ó na scéimeanna atá feabhsaithe agus tugtha isteach againn i mbliana agus ó na Meastachán atá faoi bhráid na Dála, go bhfuil tréaniarracht á déanamh <Col N="1829" /> againn chun leas eacnamaíoch, sóisialach agus cultúrtha na Gaeltachta a chur chun cinn agus chun cabhrú le caomhnú agus leathnú na Gaeilge mar ghnáthurlabhra.  Is ar éigean is gá dom a thuilleadh a rá ag an bpointe seo faoi na seirbhísí atá i gceist sa Mheastachán ach, má bhíonn eolas breise ina dtaobh ag teastáil ó Theachtaí, déanfaidh mé mo dhícheall é a chur ar fáil dóibh.</P>

      <P>Cloisimid an óráid chéanna ó bhliain go bliain, gan d'athrú uirthi ach anseo is ansúd. Nílim sásta ar chor ar bith leis an méid atá déanta ag an Roinn seo ó 1956, an bhliain a chuireadh an Roinn are bun. Níl ann im thuairim anois ach codanna de Rannaí eile&mdash;an Roinn Oideachais, an Roinn Rialtais Áitiúil, maille le Bord Iascaigh Mhara agus mar sin de.</P>
      <P>Níl an Ghaeltacht ag dul chun cinn.  Níl méadú ar bith ar líon na ndaltaí a chuireann isteach ar an deontas £10 agus nílim sásta leis sin. Tá beagnach laghdú de 1,000 nó mar sin le cheithre bliain.  Cén fáth?  Ní dubhairt an Rúnaí Parlaiminte rud ar bith faoin cheist sin.  B'fhéidir go bhfuiltear ag chur isteach ar an deontas agus nach bhfuiltear in ann é a ghlacadh.  Sé mo thuairim gurab í an Roinn Airgeadais a chuir a ladhar fhuar sa scéim sin agus go bhfuil riaradh an deontais faoi stiúradh na Roinne Airgeadais agus nach bhfuil an focal deiridh ag Roinn na Gaeltachta ar chor ar bith.</P>
      <P>Ina fhocal scoir dubhairt an Rúnaí Parlaiminte:</P>
      <P>Is ar éigean is gá dom a thuilleadh a rá ag an bpointe seo faoi na seirbhísí atá i gceist sa Mheastachán ach, má bhíonn eolas breise ina dtaobh ag teastáil ó Theachtaí, déanfaidh mé mo dhícheall é a chur ar fáil dóibh.</P>

    <P>Cúpla seachtain ó shoin, fuaireas mar do fuair gach Teachta eile agus daoine eile nach iad, is dócha, leabhrán eolais faoin dteideal <i>Roinn na Gaeltachta</i>.  Tá gach rud sa leabhrán sin.  Is maith an leabhair é agus tá go leor eolais ann fé mar adeirim. D'fhéachas ar leathanach 20, alt 4 &mdash;Báid Iascaigh.  Bhí mé ag cruinniú <Col N="1830" /> coicís ó shoin i gCuan an Fhóid Dhuibh agus bhí trácht ar Bhord Iascaigh Mhara, ar bháid agus ar iarratasóirí agus ní rabhthas sásta ar chor ar bith. Féach ar na coinníollacha atá in alt 4, mír (2)  den leabhrán:</P>
    <P>Sula gceadófar deontas faoin Scéim seo, ní mór&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  an t-iarratasóir a bheith ag lorg bád iascaigh de shaghas áirithe ón mBord Iascaigh Mhara,</P>
    <P>(b)  an Bord a bheith sásta an bád a thabhairt dó ar théarmaí fruilcheannaigh an Bhoird, agus</P>
    <P>(c)  Roinn na Gaeltachta a bheith sásta gurb í an Ghaeilge gnáththeanga an iarratasóra agus nach acmhainn dó iomlán na héarlaise íosta a íoc.</P>
    <P>Is deacair an rud bád a fháil faoi na coinníollacha sin.  An bhfuair duine ar bith bád in áit ar bith faoin scéim sin go fóill?  Is maith an scéim í ach is deacair bád a fháil fúithí.  Tá an scéim ró-cheangailte le Bord Iascaigh Mhara agus muna mbíonn breis deontaisí le fáil, ní féidir iad uilig a shásamh.</P>
    <P>Nílim sásta ar chor ar bith agus níl muintir Chuan an Fhóid Dhuibh sásta; níl muintir Dhaingean Uí Chúise sásta. Níl eolas agam faoi áit ar bith eile ach b'fhéidir go bhfaighidh an tAire an t-eolas.  Chonnaic mé fógra ins na páipéirí inniu ag lorg stiúrthóirí nua do Ghaeltarra Éireann.  B'shin í an chéad uair a thug mise faoi deara go raibh na fógraí seo i mBéarla.  Is maith an rud é sin mar go dtí seo sílim nach raibh deis ag gach duine a bheadh oiriúnach cur isteach ar na postanna a fógraítear.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to continue to deal with this Department solely through the medium of Irish because in that way it becomes a sort of secret and the rest of the country seems to regard efforts in that direction as efforts to hide something from them, and the people in English-speaking homes are entitled to see in our Official Reports an account of the Gaeltacht because the Gaeltacht of course is being subsidised, to some extent, under different headings from the moneys provided by the taxpayers as a whole.  In any event, as I have mentioned before in this <Col N="1831" /> House&mdash;and in fact it was stated against me at the time I was being appointed Minister for the Gaeltacht that I said it&mdash;I am still an unrepentant bilingualist.  I am all for bilingualism, trilingualism and as many languages as one can possibly have, being reasonable in one's approach towards the use of all of them and prepared to use them properly.</P>
    <P>The Department of the Gaeltacht, as I said, was set up with great hopes for the future of the Gaeltacht.  It was not exactly the kind of Department that I envisaged, although I belonged to the Government who set it up.  I am on record as saying at that time that I believed that the future of the Gaeltacht and the prospect of the language becoming stable, becoming and staying a living language, or even spreading depended upon the economic viability of the people in those areas, and that if these areas were not viable and providing a livelihood for the people in them, then the question of the language became, to them, at any rate, a matter of cynicism and in the case of emigration, in many cases of which we have heard, a positive drawback.  Some of the people themselves have complained about it.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note in relation to, say, Achill Island, which the Parliamentary Secretary visited some time ago, so he knows exactly the places I am talking about, that a portion of Achill Island running from a place he visited, Darby's Point, right down to Saula, as you cross the bridge, is in the Gaeltacht.  When you proceed further down, to Bunacurry and Keel, into the tourist areas, these are not in the Gaeltacht.  The Keel-Dooagh area is thriving and the other areas are not doing that well.  The Parliamentary Secretary must have seen in Augleam and Saula, along that area, the vast number of houses that are closed and people gone way.  That is due to the fact that there was not work there and I think that as a measure of goodwill towards the people in the Gaeltacht something should be provided, not something for nothing, but to give them <Col N="1832" /> an opportunity of earning.  an opportunity of working.  If they do not accept it, then the Parliamentary Secretary, the Government, the Opposition nor anybody else cannot be blamed, but do not keep them in a state of perpetual grouse that something is promised and never comes off.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has visited that particular area with a view to seeing about safe berthing and landing facilities being provided in the area. I know that some time later some people visited it and a survey has been done, but these things take too long, become worn out and people get tired and sad and weary and become cynical of the whole thing.</P>
    <P>On this question of the provision of boats, as I am dealing with berthing and landing facilities, 80 per cent of the deposit is payable by An Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  Many people are dissatisfied with that position: it is too involved.  You are giving Bord Iascaigh Mhara the right to refuse the applicant, assuming he is satisfactory in every way to the Department of the Gaeltacht.  I am certain the Department would do its best to facilitate applicants of that kind, but they have the right to veto.  They have the right to say: &ldquo;He is not the kind of person to whom we should give a boat.&rdquo;  I know of one such application made within the past three weeks.  The man was turned down.  He was an Irish speaker, a fisherman, a person entitled to get the boat and the Department of the Gaeltacht were satisfied but Bord Iascaigh Mhara said no.</P>
    <P>Until this Department becomes completely autonomous, in so far as we can use that word about a Department, until it reaches the stage where it is not relying on any semi-State body or any other Department to do its work for it, it cannot be effective.  It must have responsibility virtually for the whole of the activity in these areas over which it exercises vigilance&mdash;I was going to say jurisdiction but of course it does not.  The Gaeltacht fishing is very important.  It is important in all of the areas that are within the Gaeltacht within the limitations of the <Col N="1833" /> 1956 Act.  I cannot see any reason why major fishing centres could not be started in certain of these areas and helped and promoted in every possible way.  It is the only way to get a bit of activity going.</P>
    <P>One of the methods is the provision of proper fishing vessels.  I do not mean little slips and little bits of board that go out into the sea, and off which you could not commit suicide, as Lennox Robinson said.  I do not mean the old Congested Districts jobs at all.  Considerable effort is being made around the coast in providing these smaller ones but I think there should be major ones built because this is the only hope for the western seaboard.  When I talk about the western seaboard, I include from the tip of Donegal right down to West Cork.  It is true they have a very good one in Killybegs but that does not assist the Gaeltacht of Mayo or Galway, or indeed County Kerry or West Cork.  These major ports cannot cost that much and anyhow we cannot be counting the cost because the Gaeltacht is disappearing, in my view, so rapidly that we cannot count the cost needed in the last effort to save it.</P>
    <P>Gaeltarra Éireann do a good job. They are doing a better job now than they used to do.  I am glad to see in today's papers that they are looking for managers in the separate departments, tweed, linen, knitwear and such things and that they are offering a pretty decent salary, plus a car.  That is a good thing.  It is important to give security to the person coming in&mdash; make sure that person is good and then give him the salary and perquisites that will enable him to stay.  I think that is being done according to the advertisement in today's papers and I am happy about it.  I agree with the Parliamentary Secretary that the new man looking after the affairs of Gaeltarra Éireann is excellent, is well recognised in industry as being a forward thinker and go-getter and I hope Gaeltarra Éireann will continue to prosper as each year passes under his guidance.  I did not speak here last year.  I cannot recall the date but it was a matter of regret to me that Mr. <Col N="1834" /> Fitzpatrick passed away suddenly from Gaeltarra Éireann.  He had such long experience and was doing such a very good job and his work was appreciated all the more by reason of his temporary absence from it.</P>
    <P>Gaeltarra Éireann have had their ups and downs, and are still having more downs than ups, perhaps.  There must be some method of saving money at whatever end it is losing heavily and I hope the Board, as at present constituted, will look into the matter and see to it that these losses will not continue to be losses of the same order more or less year after year.  If it is not possible to reduce these losses and if Gaeltarra Éireann is to be regarded as a social amenity, then that should be reflected in better wages for the people working in the various centres.</P>
    <P>The products of this industry are very good.  They are known all over the world and it is really a pity that some method cannot be found to spread this work further and further in the Gaeltacht areas and even outside them.  I am not a believer in a system of demarcation lines as a result of which people of the same economic standing receive different treatment; one will benefit and another two fields away will not.  I do not think that is right, or equitable, or just.  It is not the kind of way in which we should try to advance the language.  Neither do I think that the way in which various schemes are administered within the Gaeltacht itself is the way to advance the language.</P>
    <P>I have adverted already to the £10 deontas.  That, I think, is governed by the cold hand of the Department of Finance.  So much is allotted and the inspectors go to the various Gaeltacht areas and say: &ldquo;I have so much to give out and that is all I can do.&rdquo;  I came across a case recently in which someone complained: the person who examined her child in a school in the West spoke Donegal Irish and the child could not follow him.  Not alone was the child deprived of the £10 deontas but the entire family was likewise deprived.  This has become a kind of income.  It is looked on as a regular <Col N="1835" /> income during the school days of the children and the situation is very difficult when a child is deprived of the deontas; a child may be shy, or the youngest may be absent and immediately becomes suspect, of course.  The children are deprived of the £10 deontas.  There are other anomalies.  A child gets the deontas every year during his or her school life.  He or she enters for a scholarship to a secondary school, is examined by some inspector and gets less than the required 85 per cent.  What kind of consistency is there in that?  All it means is that expenditure is being kept down all the time.</P>
    <P>These are the things that are irksome and make for a great deal of dissatisfaction in the Gaeltacht.  These are the things I come across in my ordinary work as a Deputy.  Indeed, there is another rule&mdash;I do not know whether it is in the Department of the Gaeltacht or the Department of Education&mdash;whereby, if a teacher, a garda, or even a doctor goes to a Gaeltacht area with young children who attend a Gaeltacht school and become proficient in Irish, those children will not be eligible to enter for Gaeltacht scholarships unless they have spent longer in the Gaeltacht than they did in whatever area they originally came from.  There is no incentive in that kind of thing.  Indeed, it shows a lack of incentive.</P>
    <P>I have known this to happen. Because a child was a couple of months longer in the midlands than she was in the Gaeltacht, she was not eligible for a Gaeltacht scholarship.  I do not like using the word &ldquo;scholarship&rdquo; because the Minister for Education has some sensitivity to it.  But there is no incentive in the sort of situation I have outlined.  It is no incentive to those families who return from England or America and settle down in the Gaeltacht, as they occasionally do, to become proficient in Irish because they cannot gain from that proficiency.  That is the system I see being operated.  I do not know what can be done about it but there <Col N="1836" /> should be some sort of uniformity in relation to interviews and examinations.</P>
    <P>I did not hear a word in the Minister's speech about the provision of light and power in the remoter Gaeltacht areas.  There is, of course, a scheme of bottled gas.  That is all right for an island.  I can understand it there because the cost of cable would be prohibitive. I have, however, come across villages in the Dingle Peninsula and in areas in my own constituency in the Gaeltacht in which there is no electric light or power, mainly because of the high cost of the ESB service charge. Here is an opportunity for the Department of the Gaeltacht to do something to assist these people.  This kind of assistance is what would really impress the people in these areas who are deprived of amenities through no fault of their own.  They have lived there all their lives, generation after generation, and they have kept Irish there.  Surely it is not too much to ask that they should be helped in the way I suggest?</P>
    <P>I do not know whether these people could afford this bottled gas; I think the grant is too small.  It barely covers the cost of installation.  Assistance in getting electric light and power ought to be the real aim.  After all, bottled gas is only an emergency thing.  It is only where some extreme difficulty arises that bottled gas comes into the picture.  Once people were linked up with electric light and power, I do not think they would mind the charges. We have heard complaints recently about the increases in the charges, but I think it is a good service and reasonably cheap.  It should be provided in these Gaeltacht areas and the Department would be helping the people very much if it exerted some influence on behalf of these people with the Electricity Supply Board or used some of its own resources for the purpose of alleviating their plight.  They would appreciate that very much.</P>
    <P>With regard to tourism, the Gaeltacht areas are all beautiful areas. I do not think there is any area that has not got its full quantum of scenic beauty.  There is a lack of motels <Col N="1837" /> and guesthouses and I am glad to note the Department is showing an interest not alone in chalets and guesthouses but also in the erection of hotels proper.  That is really what is needed &mdash;good sizable hotels in these areas, one or two carefully sited and, of course, built by local people, helped by the Department.  I am glad to see that the Department give half as much to such a place in the Gaeltacht area as do Bord Fáilte and, if certain conditions are complied with, they give the full amount.</P>
    <P>It is very hard on the Department; I can appreciate their difficulty in not knowing whether or not these conditions will be complied with afterwards. All they can do is accept an undertaking from people that they will do that and I think now, like the bodies, they should not exercise too heavy a veto at the beginning and should at least give it a try.  If it will not do good one way, it will do good some other way and, while the promotion of the language is a desirable objective&mdash;the fostering of it&mdash;the economic side of things in these areas is also a worthwhile consideration and is probably one of the areas in which they can be assisted.  I think it would be well worth while paying the full grant for a proposed hotel or guest-house even if it only kept a few girls at home from the native Irish speaking areas who would be working there and who would use Irish.</P>
    <P>I understand that in certain other areas in relation to tourism, certain objections to camping sites have been made by people interested in the Irish language that they would destroy the language.  I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary knows of that.  This instance I quote happened in County Kerry&mdash; we are all learning an awful lot about the areas in which we are working at the moment&mdash;but I was quite amazed to find that somebody, an interest from outside with certain native connections, could go into a Gaeltacht area and cause such a fuss as to prevent, or certainly delay, a camping site being built where upwards of 100 caravans would be sited, where they would be buying their vegetables, <Col N="1838" /> spending their money locally on food and helping to develop the place.  It was objected to because it would destroy the Gaeltacht atmosphere of the place.  If we do not allow such developments the atmosphere will go anyway.  It has gone in places with which I am familiar.  The houses have closed and people have gone away because there is nothing there to attract them.  You must take this chance. That is something which will not be confined to those areas for ever.  If this objective of making Irish the spoken language of the people, or at least the language they will all be able to speak either amongst themselves or to people who address them is successful, it will not be confined to those areas alone.  Those areas are certainly a reservoir from which we may draw but they are reservoirs which are rapidly drying up owing to the economic position.</P>
    <P>I came across another example.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will forgive me for talking so much about South Kerry but I came across another example down in the Maharees where a co-op was established, where onions are developed and this is absolutely tremendous.  The people there, around the Castlegregory area, informed me that no influx of tourists, visitors or children would have kept these people in the Maharees but they are now doing extremely well there.  I think the person who told me was a supporter of Mr. Begley; it was probably done when Deputy Dillon was Minister for Agriculture, but that is an example of the economy of a place being boosted, something which was local, something for which there was a local nucleus, a local buntús.  They had their agency for the growing of onions in the Maharees; it was developed, a co-op was started and they are now, I understand, a thriving community.</P>
    <P>There is an area in North Mayo, incidentally&mdash;in the Gaeltacht area too &mdash;which was a very famous place for the growing of early potatoes and, owing to the alleged incidence of black scab about 35 years ago, exports were stopped; these people used to have their early potatoes on the London market <Col N="1839" /> before the Jersey Islands when they were free so to do.  It is probably something the director in the western region should look at and see if it could be developed again, something in which he should take an interest.</P>
    <P>We had a Land Act recently that made provision for the partitioning and fencing of commonages.  About a fortnight ago, I was at a meeting in Augleam in the heart of the Gaeltacht where they have their maps ready, their log splitting done and the Land Commission was going to charge them.  I do not know what exactly it was; Deputy Calleary was there the same night. What struck me, as I am sure it struck him, and as was said by almost everybody&mdash;it costs so much to bring one family up from any of these areas, not necessarily a Gaeltacht area, to Meath or Kildare, and that money could easily be got from that.  The Department of the Gaeltacht has a duty to the people in that area to see to it that the Land Commission fences it properly and to see to it, in that way, that production will be increased because, when people get this addition&mdash;in some cases, ten or 12 acres of land&mdash;it will increase the number of cows and will substantially add to the amount of milk being sent to the local separating station in the area which was set up a few years ago. That is another thing the Department of the Gaeltacht should interest itself in.  It should see to it that the Land Commission do it and that these people are not punished by a very heavy head rent over a period of 35 years for the fencing of these commonages.  It is a big problem and will occur in all that peninsula under the vigilance of the Department of the Gaeltacht.  The director was there that night; he has all the details and I am sure he will give a favourable account of what the people want.</P>
    <P>All the year round holidays in the Gaeltacht are an excellent idea.  Probably the Department could concentrate a bit more on the cookery end in this regard in the local vocational schools, and concentrate, too, on the preparation <Col N="1840" /> of food from the raw materials available.  Nobody wants any&mdash;for want of a better description, I will have to call it &ldquo;shop stuff&rdquo;&mdash;cakes and things bought in shops.  What people want is what the people themselves can have: their own food, their brown bread, milk, potatoes, their fish &mdash;if they can get it locally&mdash;and even the local meat which is famed, of course, in most of those areas.  You have the mutton of Kinbay, the lamb of Aran, and all those things could be well developed and looked after. The danger in regard to the Department of the Gaeltacht is that it is becoming a little bit of everything, but not fully authoritative.  I understand the difficulties in this regard, but someone should make a break from that over these areas, and there should be power to encroach upon other areas of a kindred nature.</P>
    <P>They should exercise the whole power of the Department to carry out all the schemes for which they are responsible.  There is too much overlapping.  The minor employment and bog development schemes by the Board of Works should not have been dropped.  A vigilant Department of the Gaeltacht should have been able to see that that did not happen, or that a substitute was provided that would not cost the people so much.  These are the people for whom the Department are responsible.  These are the beautiful tourist areas, but there are many bad roads.  I know the Department spend money on the roads.  I know they give grants here and there for certain roads, but they should concentrate on the smaller roads and the cul-de-sac roads in the Gaeltacht villages.</P>
    <P>Recently I was in Porturlin in North Mayo, which is Fíor-Ghaeltacht, and the roads were dreadful.  The same is true of many other places.  So far as I can see, the trouble is that the Department has not got any real power. I know that is the way it was set up, but with the passage of time and with the gaining of experience, it is possible that there could be some amendment along the lines I suggest.  For example, Gaeltarra Éireann is a pretty autonomous body at the moment, but <Col N="1841" /> it is probable that after a while it will have far more autonomy.</P>
    <P>There is another matter to which I want to refer, and again I can see the Department's difficulty in this regard. For one reason or another, a schoolgoing child fails to satisfy the inspector and does not get the deontas of £10. The father and mother are native Irish speakers but the child, through no fault of the parents, is not quite proficient. The child is mixing with other children.  That can happen.  The father applies for a Gaeltacht housing grant, and because the child is not getting the £10 deontas, the father will not get the grant.  That is the situation as I know it to be.</P>
    <P>I can understand the link, but it is a very severe punishment on the parents, just because the child fails to reach the standard of proficiency required. It is fair enough if the child does not get the deontas, and if it is a just examination, but why punish the father if it is not his fault?  I fail to see how it can be his fault in an average household where the father and mother speak Irish, but if for some reason which cannot be attributed to them logically, the child does not qualify, it is a very big fine if the father does not get the housing grant.  That is a very big punishment because it can amount to £900 between the grant and the loan.  They may be living in bad housing conditions.  It may also be that if he applied for it the previous year he would get it.  That is where it is illogical and unreal.</P>
    <P>I understand that it is a tie-up and I appreciate the reason for it, but I think the tie-up should be used only to facilitate the housing people.  They should be able to say: &ldquo;Here is a case where the child gets the deontas&rdquo;, and give the grant straight away.  If the applicant has a schoolgoing child who does not get the deontas&mdash;and some schools do not go in for this as much as others&mdash;the inspector turns it down. I do not think that is just, or right, or fair, and I should like the Department to have another look at it.  If the father and mother are proficient, and if a lack of proficiency on the part of the children cannot be attributed to <Col N="1842" /> them, they should get the housing grant.  We must house these people. We cannot punish them for technicalities of that kind.  I know this to be quite common in my own constituency. I have shoals of letters about it. Nothing can be done under the present regulations, but the regulations should be relaxed or not operated as rigidly as they seem to be.</P>
    <P>All in all, Deputies and the public should be grateful to the Parliamentary Secretary for going to the trouble of getting out this booklet.  It is an extension, I suppose, of the idea of getting out a booklet about social welfare showing the people what their rights are and what advantages are to be gained by knowing about the various schemes and plans for their betterment. I wonder if a copy of this booklet has been sent to the principal teachers in the Gaeltacht schools, and to the priests in the areas, and the local councillors. Those are the people who should be equipped with this kind of knowledge.  I made a similar suggestion in relation to the booklet on social welfare, and it is even more important that this booklet should get into as many hands as possible in these areas.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether it is since the last debate on this Estimate that the new secretary has come to the Department. I should like to welcome him to it.  I should also like to express my regret on the retirement of Mr. Glynn, the assistant secretary of the Department, who brought to it a great fund of knowledge from his Land Commission experience, and a great knowledge not only of Irish but of the people in the Gaeltacht from whom he came himself.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I wish this Department better and better luck.  I hope it will continue to prosper and get more money from the Government, and get down to some of the things I have suggested and which I hope will be accepted: major fishing places, more tourism, less rigidity with regard to housing grants, particularly where the parents are proficient, and above all, have their stiúrthóirí examine local conditions to decide how best they can <Col N="1843" /> make a particular area more viable economically by using local raw material and by directing the people's energies more in that direction.</P>
    <P>As I have said, this is not a Department which creates any great revolutionary changes from year to year.  There may be a change of a few pounds but the same speeches are heard.  This is necessarily so.  It is a small Department, not an easy one to work, one in respect of which none of us should be satisfied with the progress made during ten years.  Greater allocations should be made to this Department.  One must think of how difficult it is to get a £10 deontas for a Gaeltacht child, how difficult it is to get a few pounds grant for somebody in the Gaeltacht.  These are our people. In these terms we must think of the ease with which we can give out hundreds of thousands of pounds to projects, the success of which may not be assured.  We must decide that the economic viability of our own people in the Gaeltacht communities is something we should never neglect.</P>
    <P>It is for that reason that I urge the Parliamentary Secretary and the Department to exercise their influence with other Departments, particularly when they are about to introduce legislation or make regulations on matters affecting the Gaeltacht areas. The greatest vigilance must be observed by the Department and the Parliamentary Secretary in this respect. If he does so, his efforts will meet with good results.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lindsay, I think, put his finger, perhaps unwittingly, on the key to the problem of the Gaeltacht and the restoration of the language when he said that this Estimate follows a pattern long laid down.  It does not represent any revolutionary departure <Col N="1844" /> from previous procedures and he inclined to the view that that is necessarily so.  I should like to take issue with him on that.  I wish to say of the administration that for people who so loudly and at times vulgarly assert their love of the language, there appears to me to be nothing in this Estimate to give any hope of great advances from the present position of what can only be described as stagnation in relation to the revival movement.</P>
    <P>All of us appreciate very well that it is imperative that national policy should be so designed as to entice, to induce, the largest possible number of people, particularly the young people, to remain in the Gaeltacht areas.  Quite apart from the language question, we have a duty to endeavour to reconstruct the economy of these areas which have been notoriously depressed for many decades.  There is a double obligation on us to foster the prosperity of the Gaeltacht as evidence of our earnestness in the matter of the language revival and, as I say, it does not appear to me that this Estimate or the Government's policy hold out any great hope of improvement in the position <i>vis-à-vis</i> the language and the economic advancement of the people who live in these districts.</P>
    <P>I have long felt that the only sure way in which people living outside the Gaeltacht areas can be brought to practise the language is by affording them an opportunity of living for some period, no matter how short, even a holiday period, in a Gaeltacht area.  It has been found in practice throughout the world that the best way of learning any language is to live among the people who speak nothing but that language.  I appreciate it is not a feasible proposition to suggest that the entire population outside the Gaeltacht areas should be moved in but it surely is a reasonable idea that a Government, if they are in earnest about the propagation of the idea of our Gaelic language and culture, should facilitate in a far greater degree than they are now doing holidays in Gaeltacht areas, from Donegal to Dingle, in West Cork <Col N="1845" /> and indeed in Meath, for the largest possible number of our children so that they may live among those who use the language as the natural vernacular.</P>
    <P>There has been no real effort in this direction, in my view.  The Gaeltacht itself and the idea of revival have been used during the years as a device for attracting votes and it appears to me that this Government, this Administration, have accepted the position that they can do little or nothing more than has been done in the past in regard to the Gaeltacht areas.  It would have been of very considerable interest if the Parliamentary Secretary had indicated what the population trends are in so far as Gaeltacht areas are concerned. Is it not a fact that the young men and women of these areas, despite what is set out here in these pages, are left, in the main, in regard to grants and so on, with little alternative to the emigrant ship and this quite aside from the economic history of migration which we all know has been part of the history of the country for so long.  Is it not a fact that large numbers of people born into households where the Irish language is the natural language, the language of the cradle, grow up to manhood or womanhood and then must take the long road to Britain as their generation has done before?  In many cases they are lost forever to this country.  Is it not a fact, in other words, that all the talk which has gone on in regard to the language revival ultimately depends for its validity upon the economic conditions of the people who live in those areas?</P>
    <P>It is accepted that certain steps have been taken to try to promote horticultural activities, such as the glasshouse scheme and so on.  Those do not appear to have been sufficient to stem the flow of emigration to which I have referred.  In fact, nothing which has been done so far has really made any impression on the steady drain of population from the Gaeltacht areas.  The population trends are not revealed in the Parliamentary Secretary's statement. It would have been useful if they were because we would then have been able to examine just what has <Col N="1846" /> happened as a result of Government inactivity over, say, the past quarter of a century.</P>
    <P>I feel that if we are to save the language&mdash;most people in this House will agree that that is very desirable and most people in this country have the same view that it is desirable that we should not turn our backs on our cultural heritage&mdash;there must be a revolutionary approach to this whole question.  There must be an assembling of energy and idealism to attack the problem.  The people, for too long, have been led into a situation wherein there has been bred a cynicism about the language.  For too long they have been encouraged, by what has been said around them, in the view that there was a certain exclusiveness, a certain amount of what might be called mandarinism, by which I mean that limits were set to the number of people who were given the full opportunity to learn the language.  For too long the people have been looking at the situation and, as I say, they have been, to some extent, disillusioned by those who preach revivalism.  There must be a new approach entirely if we are to achieve any success and if the language is not to die.  The approach has to be based, necessarily, on the level of the people living in the Gaeltacht areas and the people who are getting their living there.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the desirability of giving the children of the nation, who never meet a native speaker, the opportunity of living for a time in the Gaeltacht. This is something which the Department of Education could very well have a hand in.  I agree with Deputy Lindsay that it is not sufficient merely that this small Department should be saddled with the entire task.  If success is to be achieved in the matter of the Gaeltacht and the revival of the language, it will need the co-operation of every Department of the Government. It will need the development of a fire and zeal among all the members of the Government.  Unfortunately, I see no sign that there is any anxiety to develop such a zeal.  The Gaeltacht is trotted out as something for use at election times.  I am not at all convinced it is <Col N="1847" /> not being used here today even in that sense.  We know it has been referred to by Deputy Lindsay with regard to South Kerry where there are Gaeltacht areas.  It may be thought that by having this matter discussed here certain electoral advantages will accrue tomorrow week.  Whether they do or not is something with which I am not concerned.</P>
    <P>We need to attack this whole problem, as I have said, with considerably more energy.  I ask the Parliamentary Secretary, whom I have no doubt is sincere in his desire to see the language revived, and probably in his desire to do his best for the Gaeltacht, to try to develop co-operativism among his Government members towards this end.  Co-operativism is mentioned in his statement as the probable solution of the economic problems in the Gaeltacht. There is a need for it in the Cabinet as well as in the Gaeltacht so far as this matter is concerned.</P>
    <P>It is a good thing that the question of a co-operative movement is mentioned. The statement of the Parliamentary Secretary suggests that there are hopes for its development in certain districts in the Gaeltacht.  We on these benches have been talking about co-operativism all the days we have been here.  Those who went before us from the days of the foundation of the State talked about the ideal of co-operative effort and indicated the view that only by this method could the distressed areas of this country make any economic progress.  For many years, the whole idea was denigrated and reviled, when it was not ridiculed.  There were those who said you cannot get Irish small farmers to agree to the extent of forming a co-operative.  Those who examined the problem in detail in the past saw that the only method of trying to deal with the economic conditions which exist in such profusion along the west coast can only be based on getting neighbour to co-operate with neighbour because of the peculiar facts of agriculture in those districts and the historic poverty <Col N="1848" /> and means of production with which those areas have been associated.</P>
    <P>In my few words on this Estimate, I do not lay claim to being an authority on this matter.  I have not had the opportunity of spending much time in the west of Ireland but I have met a great number of people from the west of Ireland and I have spent some little time there.  Most of the people from the west whom I met I met on building jobs and in the factories in Britain when I worked there.  They were Gaeilgeoirí ón gcliabhán and I have some little appreciation of their problem. My simple comment on this statement is that it is not enough from this Government. Much more is called for, much more is needed, and if it is not forthcoming, then the inevitable process which seems to be under way will be inescapable, and that is something which none of us who is sincere about the ideal of the language want to see, the disappearance of Irish and the eventual total disintegration of the Gaeltacht areas.</P>

      <P>Deireann Dream an Lucht Oibre go bhfuil siad ar thaobh na teanga ach ní bhfaighimid mórán cabhrach uaidh sin.  Is deacair an rud atá le déanamh agus obair an-mhall atá ann.  Ní mór dúinn gan dul róthapaidh ach ins na blianta atá le teacht tá súil agam go mbeidh feabhas ar an scéal agus go bhfeicimid an athbheochan.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil leis na Teachtaí a labhair ar an Meastachán seo.  Dúirt an Teachta MacLoingsigh agus Teachtaí eile nach raibh siad sásta leis an méid atá á dhéanamh.  Más é a bhí i gceist acu nach bhfuil dóthain á dhéanamh, aontaím leo ach caithfidh siad a admháil go ndearnadh a lán i rith na bliana seo caite.  Níl aon dabht mar gheall air sin.  Ní leor dar leo an méid a rinneadh ó bunaíodh an Roinn agus níl siad sásta leis.  Níl mé féin sásta go dtí go mbeidh forbairt eacnamaíochta na Gaeltachta ar aon chéim leis an bhforbairt in aon chuid eile den tír.  Beidh a fhios ag gach duine a léann an leabhrán atá curtha amach agam go bhfuil mórán á dhéanamh; ach nílim sásta leis an méid atá déanta agus táim i gcónaí ag iarraidh níos mó a dhéanamh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá sé le feiceáil go bhfuil scéimeanna ann i mbliana nach raibh ann bliain ó shin.  Feicim daoine i mo cheantar féin nach eol dóibh i gcónaí cad iad na deontais atá le fáil acu. Sin í an chúis ar chuir mé an leabhrán seo amach.  Tá súil agam nuair a bheidh an leabhrán sin scaipthe&mdash;agus Tá sé á scaipeadh faoi láthair&mdash;go mbeidh eolas iomlán ag na daoine faoi na deontais go léir atá le fáil. Tá súil agam fosta go mbainfidh siad <Col N="1851" /> níos mó úsáide as na scéimeanna atá ann nuair a bheidh an t-eolas sin acu.</P>
    <P>Labhair an Teachta MacLoingsigh mar gheall ar an Deontas £10.  Is é an riail atá ag baint leis sin go gcaithfidh an Ghaeilge bheith mar ghnáththeanga ag muintir an tí.  Caithfidh tú d'aigne a shocrú faoi riaradh scéime den saghas seo.  Má bhítear ró-bhog ní chomhlíonfar cuspóir na scéime.  Is chun cabhrú leis an nGaeilge a choinneáil á labhairt sna tithe a ceapadh an scéim.</P>
    <P>Dúirt an Teachta go raibh daoine ann ar diúltaíodh deontas faoi Achtanna na dTithe (Gaeltacht) dóibh de bhrí nár thuill na páistí sa teach an Deontas £10, cé go raibh an Ghaeilge ag na daoine féin.  B'fhéidir gur fíor é sin ach sílim go gcaithfimid a admháil má labhartar Gaeilge i dteach mar sin go mbeidh líofacht ag na páistí chomh maith leis na tuismitheoirí.</P>
    <P>Thagair an Teachta MacLoingsigh do na rialacha maidir le deontais a chur ar fail d'iascairí.  Dúirt sé go raibh an scéim casta.  Ní shílim go bhfuil.  Ní dóigh liom gur cheart dúinn mar Roinn coinníollacha nach mbaineann leis an nGaeilge a leagan síos a chuirfeadh isteach ar scéim atá á riaradh ag Roinn eile Stáit.  B'fhéidir nár íocadh aon deontas go dtí seo faoi Scéim na mBád Iascaigh toise nár ghlac an Bord Iascaigh Mhara le hiarratasóir éigin.  Ach ní bheadh ar ár gcumas a rá an mbeadh iarratasóir faoin scéim oiriúnach ó thaobh na hiascaireachta de agus, mar sin, fágtar faoin mBord Iascaigh Mhara an taobh sin den iarratas a mheas.</P>
    <P>Maidir le cúrsaí cuartaíochta, tá a fhios againn a thábhachtaí atá siad ó thaobh na Gaeltachta de.  Tá na háiteanna is deise sa tír sa Ghaeltacht agus ba mhaith liom dá dtéadh tuilleadh daoine go dtí an Ghaeltacht chun a laethanta saoire a chaitheamh ann.  Táimid i gcónaí ag iarraidh ar eagraíochtaí ar nós Conradh na Gaeilge, Comhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge agus ar eagraíochtaí eile a bhfuil <Col N="1852" /> baint acu leis an teanga daoine a chur go dtí an Ghaeltacht ar a laethanta saoire.  Is léir an bhéim a chuirimid ar an gcuartaíocht nuair a fheicfear tuairisc sa leabhrán seo ar na deontais atá le fáil, cuir i gcás, deontais le haghaidh seomraí breise, deontais le haghaidh seallaí saoire agus na deontais nua atá á gcur ar fáil le haghaidh tithe ósta, tithe aíochta agus mar sin de.</P>
    <P>Má éiríonn leis an bpolasaí atá ag Fine Gael, tá eagla orm nach mbeidh an líon mór páistí a théadh go dtí an Ghaeltacht ag dul ann a thuilleadh.  Ní thig le páistí an Ghaeilge a labhairt ná grá a bheith acu don Ghaeilge mura dtéann siad go dtí an Ghaeltacht.  Is cuid de na daoine óga sin a chuidíonn go mór ina dhiaidh sin leis an nGaeilge a chur á labhairt ar fud na tíre.</P>
    <P>Labhair an Teachta Ó Duinn í dtaobh comharchumann.  Nuair a bhí mise ag dul thart sa Ghaeltacht, b'fhacthas dom nárbh fhéidir forbairt fhiúntach a dhéanamh ó thaobh na talmhaíochta gan na comharchumainn seo a bheith ann.  Ba léir chomh maith mura mbeadh daoine a mbeadh fios a ngnó acu i mbun na gcomharchumann go dtitfidís as a chéile.  Ar an ábhar sin, d'aontaigh mé deontas £2,000 in aghaidh na bliana a thabhairt; bainisteoir a fhostú chun comharchumann a reachtáil is mó a bheadh i gceist.  Tá an £2,000 sin le fáil ag comharchumann ar feadh cúig bliana agus ina dhiaidh sin ba chóir go mbeadh an comharchumann in ann seasamh ar a bhonnaibh féin.  Tá roinnt rialacha ag baint leis an scéim agus tá siad sa leabhrán. D'fhéadfadh sé seo bheith ar cheann de na scéimeanna is fearr a cuireadh riamh ar fáil sa Ghaeltacht; tá súil agam go mbainfear an úsáid is mó is féidir as sna Gaeltachtaí uilig.</P>
    <P>Labhair an Teachta MacLoingsigh i dtaobh comharchumann na Machairí agus chomh maith is a bhí sé ag dul ar aghaidh agus go mbeadh sé sin mar shampla ag na daoine ar mhaith leo comharchumann a chur ar bun. Dúirt an Teachta gurb é an Teachta Diolún a chuir tús leis.  Ní chuireann an chaint sin ionadh ar bith orm&mdash;nuair a bhí mé ag taisteal sa Ghaeltacht, gach bóthar a bhí á <Col N="1853" /> dheisiú agus ar thug mé deontas ina choinne dúradh gurbh é an fear thall a rinne é.</P>
    <P>Luaigh an Teachta MacLoingsigh ceist na gcimíní atá á scrúdú ag Coimisiún na Talún.  Níl an scrúdú sin críochnaithe go fóill.  Táimíd i gcomhairle leo i láthair na huaire.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil.  Is léir dom cibé forbairt a dhéanfar sa Ghaeltacht i gcúrsaí talún, iascaireachta, tithe gloine nó aon rud eile den chineál sin, go gcaithfimid forbairt a dhéanamh ar an tionsclaíocht chun na daoine a choimeád sa Ghaeltacht.  Is é an rud is tábhachtaí ar fad na daoine óga a choimeád.  Sin é an fáth ar chuir mé an oiread sin suime i nGaeltarra Éireann ó thosach. Thuig mé go raibh na daoine ag brath ar Ghaeltarra Éireann chun obair sheasmhach a chur ar fáil.  Ar an ábhar sin, rinne mé no dhícheall na daoine is fearr a fháil le cur ar an mBord: ceapadh ceathrar nua i mbliana.  Is daoine iad a bhfuil taithí mhaith acu ar thionsclaíocht agus ar chúrsaí riaracháin; daoine iad a chuaigh ar aghaidh go maith sa saol iad féin agus a thuigeann déantúsaíocht ó thaobh táirgeadh agus díolachán.  Sílim go n-éireoidh leo agus caithfidh éirí leo mar, mura n-éiríonn leo, beidh sé iontach deacair an Ghaeltacht a choinneáil beo.  Chomh maith leis sin, ceapadh bainisteoir ginearálta nua agus mar a dúirt an Teachta MacLoingsigh tá fógra sna páipéir i dtaobh postanna eile i nGaeltarra Éireann.  Dúirt sé go raibh siad i mBéarla inniu, ach bhí siad i nGaeilge dhá uair roimhe sin chomh maith.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá gach rud á dhéanamh chun Gaeltarra Éireann a chur chun cinn.  Ní féidir linn bheith ag tnúth le míorúiltí, <Col N="1854" /> le go mbeidís ábalta na hathruithe uilig atá ag teastáil uainn go léir a dhéanamh go gasta.  Cibé sceal é, tá mé cinnte, leis na daoine atá i mbun riaracháin, go n-éireoidh linn obair sheasmhach a chur ar fáil do chuid mhór daoine sa Ghaeltacht agus aontaím le gach duine a dúirt gurb é sin a rud is mó ar fad atá de dhíth orainn faoi láthair.</P>
    <P>Labhair an Teachta Ó Maoildhia i dtaobh Cill Rónáin.  Is é an rud a tharla sa chás sin ná go raibh rud amháin molta ag Oifig na nOibreacha Poiblí agus rud eile ag teastáil ó na hiascairí. Bhí mise ag iarraidh an dá dhream a thabhairt ar aon aigne agus b'iontach deacair é sin a dhéanamh.  Sin é an fáth a ndeachaigh an £50,000 ar lár anuraidh.  Is féidir liom a rá anois go mbeidh an t-airgead agam an bhliain seo chugainn chun obair a shásóidh na hiascairí a dhéanamh.</P>
    <P>I dtaobh an choláiste Gaeilge a luadh, ní bhaineann sé sin díreach liomsa.  Caithfidh an Roinn Oideachais an coláiste a aithint sula dtagaimse isteach sa scéal.  Maidir leis an Taibhdhearc, tá atheagrú ar siúl ina thaobh sin i láthair na huaire.</P>
    <P>Sílim gur fhreagair mé gach pointe a cuireadh os mo chomhair agus déanfaidh mé mo dhícheall na smaointe fiúntacha a nochtadh i rith na díospóireachta a chur i gcríoch.  Táim iontach dáiríre faoin obair atá le déanamh. Nílim ag labhairt ó thaobh na polaitíochta de.  Tá gach iarracht á dhéanamh agam chun an Ghaeltacht a chaomhnú.  Sílim gurb é Gaeltarra Éireann an gléas is fearr chun an aidhm sin a bhaint amach.  Sin é an fáth ar chaith mé an oiread sin ama i rith na bliana ag lorg comhaltaí don Bhord.</P>
    <P>Vote put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Wednesday, 30th November, 1966.</P>
