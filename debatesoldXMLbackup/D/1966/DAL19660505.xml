    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Lynch) Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to bring within the confines of a single enactment the law relating to income tax. The fact that the Bill is intended as a purely consolidating measure requires that it does not in any way alter existing law.  This has often meant preserving unchanged the language of old enactments although in some places it has been considered permissible to seek an improvement on the original wording.</P>
      <P>The Bill, as framed, embraces the Income Tax Act, 1918, which is the basic enactment, together with the Finance Acts 1919 to 1965.  It takes account also of the various adapting orders and enactments which affect the body of income tax law.</P>
      <P>The Bill is expressed to operate from 6th April, 1967, and in order that it may embody income tax legislation in force on that date, it is proposed to move amendments on Committee Stage which would enable any relevant provisions of the Finance Act, 1966, to be incorporated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is, I believe, the largest ever <Col N="1344" /> to come before the House and I trust that the Standing Committee on Consolidation Bills, to which I will propose the Bill should be referred, will not find their task too onerous.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a purely consolidating Bill and, accordingly, it is not open to us to suggest any amendments in the income tax law as such on the motion today.  It would be wrong, however, to let the occasion pass without saying that while the Bill is a consolidating measure, and while it will, one hopes, do something to ease the jungle of tax law in having it all in one volume, so to speak, at the same time, it will not do anything to ease the burden on those who have to pay tax, those who have to pay tax to the tune of an extra 8d in the £ by reason of the Minister's recent imposition.</P>
      <P>One would have hoped that this Bill would have been brought in in an atmosphere in which there was some reduction in taxation rather than the increase, already onerous, which the Minister for Finance announced in his Budget and the threatened increase which he has also announced, but which he has been most careful to say will not come before 1st June.  I do not think any Minister for Finance has ever been so cynical with the public as the present Minister was in that regard the other day.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill has been circulated to the Members of the House under the heading Income Tax Bill, 1966 <i>(Certified Consolidation Bill).</i>  We have a large number of people paying income tax and if any one of these people, with few exceptions, were to get this Bill, what would he make of it?  I have been agitating here for years that measures such as this, affecting the public, should be in readable language.  Unfortunately, as Deputies can see, this Bill is more than an inch in thickness.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not in any <Col N="1345" /> kind of readable language and if the people were to get it into their hands, they could not make sense of it.  I believe this House and the Minister responsible should send out in some kind of concise fashion what is contained in that Bill.  There is a wanton wastage of words in this measure&mdash;all this old jargon which should be finished with: whensoevers, wheresoevers, whereases, so on and so forth.  It is about time the procedure was changed.  The Front Bench senior counsels of this House could not understand this measure, never mind others of us who have not the same brand of intelligence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking the Minister and the House that there be some Committee, possibly the Committee on Procedure and Privileges which exists already, to deal with this question and change the whole system. The draftsmen responsible for drafting these Bills are continuing the old system which obtained when we had a foreign Government here.  The Irish Government have taken over that system and I am urging the Minister, in the case of future Bills, particularly those dealing with such an important item as income tax, to change the old system of drafting in such a way that we can all read it and, having read it, understand it.  We have all read this Bill and it is very difficult to understand. I am pressing on the Minister the desirability of making a change in the drafting of Bills in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask one or two questions about procedure. I am in entire sympathy with the observations made by Deputy M. P. Murphy.  The jungle of income tax law has become so fantastic now that there is no living creature who knows his way through it.  I am ready to prophesy that when we pass this Bill, nobody in this House will understand it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Most certainly not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1346" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That a democratic parliament should get itself into that position is something about which we all ought to ask ourselves a question. We are not exceptional in this, however. The British House of Commons and the Congress of the United States have fallen into the same trap.  As Deputy Murphy has said, this is a matter which now affects everybody earning more than £6 a week.  Yet the situation is that our enactment, affecting his everyday life, is of such character that no living creature in the country can understand it.  The Minister now consolidates it, which, on the whole, is probably a good thing to do.  I wish he were in a position to say he looked forward to this act of consolidation as the departure point for an entirely new approach to income tax, with a view to its radical simplification. The fact is that on the basic Act of 1918, we have, over the past 50 years, piled up a vast superstructure of amending legislation, orders, regulations, et cetera, which now provides a jungle through which not one per cent of the population of this country can find its way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to ask these procedural questions.  I understood when we established this procedure for the consolidation of Bills, the Bill was presented to the Consolidation Committee with a certificate from the Attorney General stating it represented the law as of the day on which it was presented to the Committee.  But now the Minister speaks of moving amendments to this Consolidating Bill on Committee. Where are those amendments to be moved?  Are they to be moved in the Committee and is it permissible to insert amendments in the Committee? I thought the purpose of the Committee was simply to check, on behalf of both Houses, that the certificate of the Attorney General was, in fact, correct and that the Consolidating Bill did not change the law.  I fully appreciate that what the Minister has in mind is that, after we have dealt with the Finance Bill of 1966, he wishes to insert in the Consolidating Bill any changes which may be made in the law.  How will he do that?  What is the procedure?  Does the Attorney General issue a separate certificate in <Col N="1347" /> respect of amendments submitted to the Committee and are the amendments incorporated in this Bill?  Are they inserted in this House or are they inserted in the Committee?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>As the House is aware, the Bill is expressed to operate as from 6th April, 1967, and, since it was apparent that by then the income tax law would have again been changed to what it was up to 1966 and what it will be in 1967, I specifically checked whether it would be permissible to move amendments to include any change in income tax law effected by the 1966 Finance Act.  I was informed it would be in order to do so.  I must confess I do not know fully exactly what the procedure will be but I expect that the Committee dealing with the Bill will have power to accept amendments as long as it has been certified by the Attorney General that these amendments do not change the law as it will have then stood.  Therefore, when and if the Finance Bill of this year comes into operation, the Attorney General will then be in a position to certify that the law in relation to income tax is such that it can be incorporated in this Consolidation Bill.  I am sorry I cannot fully answer the Deputy's question but I am assured, on specific inquiry, that this will be possible, in accordance with Standing Orders.</P>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Murphy's suggestion that there is a jungle of income tax law&mdash;that is true, of course, and I readily admit it.  There is also a jungle of a lot of other legislation which affects many people but, at least, consolidation is a step in the direction of simplifying access to the law as it stands.  Unfortunately, in consolidation, we can do nothing by way of amendment of the existing law but it is a step in the right direction to have it all in one volume or one enactment. There is, of course, another step, codification, which I take it, generally, would mean rationalisation of the law as it stands.  I do not know to what extent codification can change existing law.  At least codification is possible but only after consolidation in the case of a Bill like this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1348" /> In reply to the point made by Deputy Sweetman, the Deputy has a habit of accusing people of callousness but he does it so often one wonders if he does it with his tongue in his cheek.  I think Deputy Sweetman knew well the circumstances in which 1st June was mentioned the other day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>When asked when the Supplementary Budget would be introduced, I repeated that I did not know if it would be necessary but, if it were, I would have to do so.  I must say I thought I heard a suggestion from the other side&mdash;&ldquo;Would it be before 1st June&rdquo;&mdash;and, realising the significance of 1st June, I said it could not be before 1st June, even if I wanted it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I answered what I thought was a suggestion.  It may be that the stenographers did not hear it. I thought I heard it and that was the reason I used 1st June.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister read the Attorney General's certificate so that it will be on the records of the House?  It has not been circulated with the Bill.  I know it is in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i></P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That it is expedient that the Income Tax Bill, 1966, be referred to the Standing Joint Committee on Consolidation Bills; and</P>

      <P>I would like a little further clarification from the Minister. I think I am the only member of a previous Committee of this nature who did not participate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not appear before that Committee.  There was a certificate from the Attorney-General saying that there was no change in the law.  Supposing there are amendments which the Minister envisages may be necessary as a result of the 1966 Finance Act, is it the Minister's intention to appear before the Committee or will those amendments be presented?  If the amendments are presented, by whom will they be presented?  Will it be by the chairman or will there be a certificate from the Attorney General? Those changes merely represent changes effected by the 1966 Finance Act.  Can either Deputy Sweetman or the Minister who participated in the other Committees&mdash;I think Deputy <Col N="1350" /> de Valera also took part&mdash;inform the House what the procedure is?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dillon should recollect that in the case of the Fisheries Bill, the Committee which actually sat was the inheritor of the work of previous abortive Committees. I think I was chairman of the first one which was dissolved as a result of the general election.  Approximately half of the work was done under that Committee. I think there may have been another Committee which was abortive, before the second one to which the Deputy is referring.  In that Committee I can imagine the sections all went through but my recollection is that we took it section by section and that any member of the Committee who wished interrogated from the point of view as to whether the wording was introducing any change.  We were very fully briefed on that Bill and one could compare it for oneself section by section. Why can that not be done on this particular Bill?  I know it is a little more difficult to understand but I do not see why the same procedure cannot be followed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>My recollection is that that Committee sat as a Committee but that it took a decision in the very early stages.  I am speaking of the first Committee.  I think Deputy de Valera is not quite right when he says he was chairman of the first Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps it was the second Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the first Committee took a decision, whether by Standing Orders or by its own volition, that the Assistant Secretary of the Department of Agriculture, as he then was, who was in charge of fisheries had the right of audience for Deputy Dillon who was Minister for Fisheries. He and the other officials went through the Bill section by section.  We queried the permanent officials in relation to whether the consolidation was a true consolidation.  In fact, I can remember that we had a discussion lasting two days regarding gins and traps and that it went on for ages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1351" /> I think the second Committee agreed at its first meeting to take as read all the sections which the first Committee had already dealt with.  The last Committee did the same thing.  My recollection is that there were 49 sittings of those Committees, each of them lasting for about three hours.  That was not as big a Bill as this one.  Perhaps some of the language in the Bill was much older because the Bills were long before 1918.  I think during the course of that Bill there were amendments to the law and those amendments to the law were incorporated in the consolidating measure.  I cannot remember whether they were actually incorporated during the progress, so to speak, of one Committee or whether a new Committee took them into account.</P>
    <P>This is the second time this Bill has appeared.  I think the first Bill appeared about 15 months ago and it of course had not got the Finance Act, 1965.  This one has it.  My recollection of the other Committees is that after the Committee produced the amendments, the Attorney General's certificate was obtained as the last act, so to speak.  At that very last date, the law was as set out in the Bill. Anybody would be optimistic if he thought that any Special Committee would be able to deal with this consolidated measure before the 1966 Finance Act was enacted.  Much though I dislike it, the Minister must have a 1966 Finance Act and I hope for his sake he gets his 1966 Act before this is dealt with by the Standing Committee because if it is done carefully, it will take an awfully long time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Sweetman's recollection is correct.  Here I should like to pay a tribute to the memory of a very fine public servant, the late Mr. Rushe, was was Assistant Secretary in charge of Fisheries.  The fact that he represented me on this Committee carries with it the implication that no amendments were moved.</P>

I asked the House to bear in mind that we have evidence before our eyes that those countries that have elected for a socialist system of government have not produced, not succeeded in producing, the Utopia they confidently forecast.</P>
      <P>Without going into the ideological foundations of Russia or China, at least we can say that Russia has given 40 years' full scope to a full-blown socialist economy and, dwelling exclusively for the moment on the economic consequences of that, we have the evidence before our eyes that after 40 years' operation of that system in an area which must be one of the richest in the world, stretching from the borders of Poland to Vladivostok, the people of Russia would be hungry today but for the fact that they can depend on the resources of the great free enterprise nations of the world&mdash; Australia, Canada and, indirectly, the United States&mdash;to provide them with the very food to feed their people which they have been unable to produce themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe in a system based on free enterprise in which the profit motive is not regarded as disreputable, because I believe that without the profit <Col N="1354" /> motive, decent employment cannot be provided, decent social services cannot be provided and individual liberty, in the last analysis, cannot be preserved. I do not want a system in which we all become servants of the State and I think the time has come when we ought to ask ourselves are we moving in that general direction here.  Some of our colleagues hopefully point to what they describe as socialist economies in Europe and say that they have worked successfully without destroying individual liberty and without precipitating a general lowering of the standard of living.  One of their principal object lessons is Sweden.  Sweden has called itself a socialist democracy for 30 years but there is no country in the world in which capitalism and the profit motive are more ardently promoted and protected than in Sweden.</P>
    <P>Of course it is true to say that our real difficulty is to learn to ask ourselves what do we mean by socialism. It is a word that has now become so blurred by general usage that people can mean almost anything when they use it.  What I am concerned to preserve is parliamentary democracy, individual liberty and the right of law-abiding citizens to earn their living as independent men and women without being beholden to the Government for the time being for their right to live in their own country.  I imagine the Government will claim that they subscribe broadly to these sentiments but acts speak louder than words.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to answer categorically now to the House and the country what he proposes to do about the situation his Government's policies are producing in the country.  The Minister has now committed himself to a policy of price control.  He assures the country that he aspires, in a remarkable process of conversion, to an incomes policy.  It is a very short time, not 12 months, since he was declaring an incomes policy to be a figment of disturbed imaginations among the Opposition.  He was campaigning most energetically to prove it was impossible. I do not believe it is impossible.  It is extremely difficult.  I remember being asked at a public meeting in Ballina <Col N="1355" /> what would happen if the trade unionists did not collaborate, and what sanctions did I advocate in order to make them do it.  My reply was that if I needed to employ sanctions, the incomes policy would have failed.  I do not believe you can, in a free society, impose sanctions to compel men to work.</P>
    <P>I am not much interested in what happens if we abandon freedom for some alleged economic end.  I am not so sure these sentiments are shared by all Deputies, particularly on the Fianna Fail benches.  I detect a horrible intellectual tendency among some of them to say: &ldquo;We would sooner be rich than free.&rdquo;  If that tendency should grow, the time has come to examine our consciences.  That is not what our fathers or our grandfathers wanted. They wanted to be free, whatever the cost.  If the new doctrine is to be, &ldquo;we want to be rich rather than free&rdquo;, we should examine where that dialectic leads.</P>
    <P>It is because a change in that mode of thought is being promoted in this country that I have ventured to say in this House, and I now repeat that, that the economic policy of this Government is not only placing our economic independence in jeopardy but placing our political independence in jeopardy as well.  I want to remind Deputies, if they regard that warning as extravagant, that it is less than 12 months since I said in this House: &ldquo;Beware lest the road you are travelling does not send the Government hawking the credit of Ireland throughout the world and finding no takers.&rdquo;  When I gave that warning, a great many Deputies, including Deputy Moore, I am sure, were shocked that such words could be spoken in this House, but they have lived to see that happening, to see the Government of this country go to the United States of America to seek a loan at a very onerous rate of interest and find there were no takers.</P>
    <P>How vital is this question of profits? We are all concerned to provide additional industrial employment for our people.  I recalled last night that it was Deputy Sweetman who inaugurated exemptions from income tax and <Col N="1356" /> corporation profits tax for industrialists who provided extra exports.  It was the late Deputy William Norton, God be good to him, who first introduced the concept of the Industrial Grants Act.  Now we have reached a stage in which we have one of the largest industries in the country pointing out that as a result of Government action the profits derived from their operations in a stated period last year were of the order of £400,000, and that in the corresponding period of this year, their losses were of the order of £100,000.  The firm I refer to which elected to have that statement published in the newspapers are Goulding's, the fertiliser factory.  What are we going to do about it?</P>
    <P>One thing is perfectly certain. Neither that firm nor any other firm can go on indefinitely trading at a loss. We have, therefore, two alternatives. We can either take them over and run them at a loss, charging the loss to the Exchequer as we do in regard to CIE and almost every other Government operated industry or enable them to earn profits.  So far as I am aware, every single industry operated by the Government is run at a loss.  It is quite true that the ESB operate on the basis of paying their interest and loans charges, but they are in the happy state of being able to fix the rate for electricity, and the public have to pay whatever is requisite to discharge the loan and interest charges the ESB have to meet, to finance the capital they use in their programme of generation and distribution.</P>
    <P>It is perfectly true that Bord na Móna ordinarily breaks even, except for seasonal losses.  Bord na Móna, a Government-operated industry, simply cut the turf, determine what the cutting of the turf costs, and charge it to the ESB; the ESB pay them and put it on the cost of electricity.  I need not go into the financial situation of Irish Shipping, but in common with many other companies, they are losing loads of money.  CIE, apart from the sale of rails to countries in Africa and elsewhere, are losing loads of money. I could go down the whole list, but I should like to ask the Minister does he intend to add this fertiliser industry <Col N="1357" /> to that list and, if the list grows longer, who will pay the losses?  At present we are finding the money to pay the losses out of the profits of individual <i>entrepreneurs</i> who are earning profits. If we make individuals who are making profits unprofitable and take them over, where will we get the revenue to pay for the losses in the enterprises which we have converted from profit-earning enterprises into loss-earning Government-operated industries?</P>
    <P>The Minister may say to me: what do you propose?  Do you propose to raise the price of fertilisers?  In fact, we all know that having carted off the farmers in Black Marias until there was no more room for them in the Bridewell, and having declared that nothing on God's earth would ever alter his inflexible resolve never to talk to anyone who was conducting himself in such a way as to justify his removal in a Black Maria, and in the Minister's words &ldquo;to talk to no circus clown performing outside Leinster House,&rdquo; the Minister for Agriculture is now beyond in Government Buildings conversing with them most industriously.</P>
    <P>The purpose of their discussion is to explain to the Minister for Agriculture that agriculture has become uneconomic and agriculture has become uneconomic because their costs have increased to a point which leaves them no margin of profit on their sales.  One of the essential raw materials of the agricultural industry is fertilisers and so if you increase the price of fertiliser &mdash;unless you want to crucify the farmers altogether&mdash;you will have to increase the price of agricultural produce. If you increase the price of agricultural produce, you increase the cost of living, and if you increase the cost of living, you will have to have another round of wage increases and the losses will grow bigger, or else you increase the cost of the farmer's raw materials and the cost of food and the cost of living and you can go dancing around that maypole until everyone gets dizzy and the community collapses.</P>
    <P>These are fundamental facts which nobody cares to face.  That is what inflation means.  Once you start on that dizzy dance, there is no ending.  It is <Col N="1358" /> the Government who started that dance and it is the Government who are responsible for telling us how they propose to control it.  I told them in this House two years ago that if they put on the turnover tax, they would launch this country into a dialectic of inflation that would bring us to the edge of the abyss.  I fought that issue in North-East Dublin and defeated the Government. In Cork and Kildare, the Government proclaimed that it was all an illusion, that there was plenty for everybody, that everybody ought to have a substantial increase.  Naturally when the responsible Government of the country certified that this was so, the electorate accepted that view and they triumphantly won these two elections. Then we had the subsequent elections and the general election and now we are in the situation that the Government, having solemnly proclaimed for all to hear that the economic foundations of the State would be utterly undermined if there was any increase in wages or salaries in excess of three per cent, have, with equal publicity and equal solemnity, declared that they approve of the Labour Court recommendation that there should be an increase of some six to seven per cent.</P>
    <P>Both statements cannot be true. They were either dealing in falsehood when they spoke of the three per cent or else they are dealing in falsehood today.  Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party know that.  I want to ask the Minister for Industry and Commerce when the Government expressed their approbation of the recent finding of the Labour Court, were they telling the truth then or were they telling the truth when they told the House that anything in excess of three per cent would uproot the foundations of the State?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is more important than that because the people down the country are asking: &ldquo;Are we governed by frauds?  Could you believe the gospel from their lips?&rdquo;  What they say on Monday they deny on Tuesday and what they avowed on Tuesday, they <Col N="1359" /> repudiate on Wednesday.  Not only are they a weak but they are a bewildered Government.  I would not mind if they were tottering if we could totter them and get rid of them but there they are sitting on their majority and the trouble is that this Government no longer believes in being honest.  I am sorry to say when I am asked down the country what are they up to, all I can say is that I do not think they know themselves; they are living from hour to hour, from day to day, contradicting themselves when it is expedient to do so and hoping like Mr. Micawber that something will turn up.  That is a disastrous state for this country to be in.</P>
      <P>Now, I put the problem of Goulding's squarely to the Minister and I think he must answer but there is a much graver problem.  Goulding's is an enterprise largely concerned with the Irish market.  Of course we know that it has very intimate connections with Imperial Chemical Industries and certain foreign industries, but there is another large firm in this country traditionally associated with the best employment provided in Ireland, that is, Guinness's Brewery.  Guinness's Brewery have always paid the highest rate of wages paid in this country.  They have been directed that they are not to change their prices.  I do not believe, whatever direction they get, that Guinness's will ever pull up their sticks and clear out of the country.  However, what we ought remember is this: when I was a child, every drop of Guinness's stout that was consumed in every part of the world was brewed in the city of Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have seen in my lifetime a large part of Guinness's business transferred from this country to Great Britain.  I have seen in my lifetime, out of the profits earned by that establishment, a practically completely new brewery built in this city, because practically every square yard of Guinness's Brewery has been reconstructed, rebuilt and brought up-to-date in my lifetime.  Out of profits, mark you; not out of Government grants.  Now, Guinness's can expand their business as they grow, either in Dublin or in <Col N="1360" /> Great Britain.  Are we going to create a situation in this country in which that company will simply announce: &ldquo;There will be no more expansion in Ireland.  We are going to expand where earning profits has not become disreputable&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>I give these two cases in point because these two companies have themselves publicised their own problem. Ordinarily, we do not choose to refer to individual enterprises by name in this House but both Guinness's and Goulding's have publicised their own problem and stated their dilemma.  I am putting that dilemma to the Minister. What does he propose to do about it?</P>
    <P>It is astonishing to me the confusion that exists in the minds of many people when we speak of a wages and incomes policy, the confusion that arises between the earning of profit and the distribution of dividends.  A wages and incomes policy, as I understand it, means that you ask wage earners, salary earners and sharehouders for a specific period to exercise restraint in order to relieve the strain on the national economy.  But the fact that you ask the dividend earner to exercise restraint does not mean that you ask every business in the country to become inefficient for the period of restraint required.  But it does mean that you say to a number of business enterprises: &ldquo;If a large surplus of profit threatens to emerge owing to your growing efficiency in this period, after providing for the necessary sinking funds and maintenance of your factory, consider the devoting of at least part of those profits to reducing prices to the consumer so that that contribution of reduced prices to the consumer will make it easier for the trade unionists and salary earners to accept less than they had hoped to secure by industrial negotiation for this limited period while an incomes and wages policy is necessary.&rdquo;  Unless you are prepared to say that, unless you are prepared to do that, it is all eyewash to be asking trade union leaders to go down to Liberty Hall or Marlborough Street and ask their members to exercise restraint.</P>
    <P>But at the other end of the rainbow <Col N="1361" /> it is utter insanity to imagine that you are setting the trade unionists in Liberty Hall and Marlborough Street the right example by saying to the firms that employ them: &ldquo;We are going to bring in a situation in which you cannot earn profits.&rdquo;  That is not the appropriate <i>quid pro quo</i> which an industrial <i>entrepreneur</i> ought to be called on to make in a wages and incomes policy. The hallmark of success, the hallmark of industrial enterprises contributing to the national welfare, is the size of the profits they earn, provided they operate in open competition, pay fair wages and maintain decent standards. But the amount of profits for distribution to shareholders should be restrained if we expect wage and salary earners to exercise restraint.</P>
    <P>I believe the root of this whole evil goes back to the turnover tax.  But that is not the end of the evils.  It strikes me there is a mentality developing in this country which has come to regard the distributive trades as in some sense disreputable.  If that is so, then a large part of the population are engaged in disreputable activity.  I have been engaged in the retail and wholesale distribution businesses all my life. I regard them as a very essential and important element in the economic life of the country, without which the economic life of the country would come to a standstill.  It is true that in Russia, in a socialist state, distribution is carried on by the government.  I understand that in Russia the GUM controls every retail distribution centre. But the GUM is in fact not only a trade and distribution unit; it is an instrument for taxing the consumer. Prices rise and fall in the GUM at the government's whim.  They raise the revenue of the State on clothes, food and the other essentials the people have to buy.  In a free economy, retail distribution is carried on by the shopkeepers of the country.</P>
    <P>I want to warn the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I remember well when his Government brought in the turnover tax.  I remember well saying, speaking from the Front Bench because I was then Leader of the Opposition: &ldquo;I can tell you what this tax will do to the retail trade of this <Col N="1362" /> country.  It will destroy ultimately every family business in this country. It will hand over the retail and, ultimately, the wholesale distribution of goods to large foreign combines who are coming in and taking over.&rdquo; Was I right?  Is that not so?  They are moving in steadily and wiping out the small individual shopkeeper.  I beg of Deputies to ask themselves the question in time: what sort of society do you want?  Do you want to wipe out every small businessman in this country? Do you want to close down every family business in rural Ireland and in our cities and towns?  If you want that, you are going to precipitate a social revolution of a most radical kind.</P>
    <P>Leave out the social aspect of it altogether, immensely important as it is.  Do you want large British combines to come in here for no other reason than to collect the profits on distribution and transfer those profits to Great Britain?  Is that economically desirable from the point of view of this country?  I do not say it is so undesirable that we should prohibit it, but I do must emphatically say that it is economic suicide to promote it.  That is what is going to happen.  It is happening before our eyes at present.  Whether you can arrest it or not now is open to doubt.  But the turnover tax, which converted the retail distributors of this country into tax gatherers, is wiping out the small individual traders and delivering retail distribution more and more into the hands of powerful international combines who, with their vast financial resources, can move into this country, skim the profit and take it away.</P>
    <P>That is an undesirable development socially and economically.  It is one to which the Minister should turn his mind.  I am asking him for a specific answer to the problems I have outlined, which are by no means confined to Goulding's and Guinness's alone because they are being reproduced in a number of other industries. But they are typified by the situation arising in Goulding's and Guinness's. That arises from the fact that the Minister says: &ldquo;You must bear the increased costs.  You must not increase <Col N="1363" /> your price.&rdquo;  The difference between your costs of operation and the price you get for your goods is your profit. The Minister says: &ldquo;I am not interested in that profit.  You must pay the increased costs.  You must not increase your prices and the profit is your problem.&rdquo;  He reaches the point that he converts a profit into a loss.</P>
    <P>I want to put it to him that he is not entitled to wash his hands at that stage and if he does, he will destroy the whole economic foundations on which this State rests.  I will say particularly to my friends of the Labour Party: if we destroy profits, we destroy the source from which employment is paid for and the social services are financed; and as we destroy employment, we promote emigration, and the emigrants who go are the productive elements in our society who leave with us the children and the old who need social services.  The very people who are capable of earning the profits to pay for these we are forcing out to Birmingham, London and elsewhere.  Let us face it: the British are eager to get them.  They are facing a situation of full employment and their most acute problem is to loosen the tightening knot of labour scarcity in Great Britain. The productive elements of our society, the boys and girls between 18 and 30 years of age, are being drawn into a powerful vacuum in Great Britain.  I suggest to the Minister for Industry and Commerce the policy he is pursuing is pushing the productive elements of our community into the vacuum which is already pulling them out of this country and into Great Britain.</P>
    <P>There are certain other specific matters I should like to raise with the Minister.  I have a problem in my constituency. In most constituencies in the country, if there is a prospect of industrial development of one kind or another, we all lend a hand and do what we can to make straight the path of the industry that is coming in.  That is customarily the situation in County Monaghan, but there was one industry in Clones that became the special prerogative of the Minister for Transport and Power.  This was going to be his <i>chef d'oeuvre</i> and Deputy Dillon was to stay a thousand miles away.  A nod <Col N="1364" /> is as good as a wink to a blind horse and I said &ldquo;If that is the way this industry is to be effectively promoted, I am quite prepared to stand far off and let the wizard boy perform his miracles and provide the employment necessary.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Ernetex was born and we were going to employ 1,200 people in Clones.  The wizard boy was going to get grants like manna from heaven.  Right enough, they got a very substantial grant of £86,000.  That was a pretty dazzling performance.  I was delighted to hear my neighbours in Monaghan were going to do so well.  The wizard was up laying corner stones, turning keys and opening doors and he nearly went up on the roof to put on the chimney for us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>He wants to keep his seat.  He lost it in Westmeath and he is going to lose it in Monaghan in the next general election, but that is another day's work.  Anyway, he was all over Ernetex and he did not come empty-handed.  He managed to get grants amounting to £86,000.  We were all dazzled by this performance.  Then to my amazement somebody told me one day in County Monaghan that Ernetex was bust.  I said: &ldquo;That could not be.  They have just got a grant of £86,000 and the Minister for Transport and Power, who must know what is going on, declares it to be a gold mine.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have the greatest sympathy with the fact that Ernetex blew up.  However, there is an unfortunate Monaghan contractor, a man who is trying to earn his living, a most ardent supporter of the Minister for Industry and Commerce. He was induced to enter into a contract to build this factory because the wizard boy was its patron and he knew what was going on and said there was unlimited money and everything was high, wide and handsome. This unfortunate man entered into a contract for over £40,000 to build the factory.  He built the factory and employed sub-contractors; they were putting in electrical installations, plumbing, and I could not tell you <Col N="1365" /> what not.  The net result of it is that this contractor is going around with a bill in his hand for £12,400 that he cannot get out of anybody.  He is told there is a liquidator in, and the liquidator will not pay him.  That is a great hardship.</P>
    <P>I understand that so effectively did the wizard boy operate that there is still a balance of £15,000 of the grant approved which is not yet issued.  I understand the situation to be that when the balance of the grant is issued to the liquidator, it may be used to pay debts due in France, Great Britain and elsewhere.  May I suggest to the Minister for Industry and Commerce that this is a matter in which he might legitimately intervene and I shall acquit him here and now&mdash;&mdash;</P>

We do not want to give a free grant to a liquidator to hand over to the residents of France, Great Britain or somewhere else.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I am surprised to hear the Minister say it is not legitimate. I understood he had discretion in regard to grants and could put the matter before the House.  If a Minister proclaims in a rural area like west Monaghan that everything in the garden is lovely and induces a small local contractor to enter into a heavy commitment in order to complete a factory which a Minister of the Government declares to be a gold mine and in respect of which he gets a grant of £86,000, it seems a great hardship that that man has to wind up with a bill for £12,000 due out of a total contract of the order of £40,000, and the sub-contractors are waiting to get paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister can do anything in this specific case. I hope he can; I think he could if he put his mind to it.  But at least we can make sure that other contractors will not fall into the same misfortune.  I believe that, in respect of the balance of the grant due, the Minister should attach a condition that it will issue only on condition that it is used for the purpose of the building and not <Col N="1367" /> for the general purpose of the liquidation of the liquidator's debts.</P>
    <P>I want now to raise another point. One of the great difficulties about dealing with the Government is that nobody is reponsible for anything and everybody is responsible for nothing. There is a factory now being established in Carrickmacross.  The local development company have succeeded in getting a French combine to set up a factory there to manufacture tiles and ceramics of one kind or another. In the same area, the Carrickmacross Urban District Council and Monaghan County Council have been trying for two years to get sanction from the Minister for Local Government to proceed with a housing scheme because there is an acute shortage of houses in the area.</P>
    <P>I shall be asking a question next week of the Minister for Local Government as to whether his sanction will be available for the scheme but I want to put it to the Minister for Industry and Commerce that, if the houses are not built in Carrickmacross, the industry will not long survive because, if there are no houses for the workers to live in, the factory cannot possibly expand or thrive.  The plain truth is the factory was brought there at the time on the understanding that there was abundant money available to build houses where houses were needed and that it was the policy of the Government to match housing to the industrial development in the area.</P>
    <P>I am happy to say I believe the ceramic factory is now irrevocably committed to being erected in Carrickmacross but I most urgently press on the Minister that he has a clear duty to press on his colleagues, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Local Government, that there is no use urging the establishment of factories if, when people have done so, it is discovered there is no housing in which to put the workers.  The particular situation that obtains in Carrickmacross is one urgently demanding that sanction should be forthcoming for the housing scheme proposed by the local authority in the area and the finance necessary to carry it through should be provided.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1368" /> I do not like to be leaning on the Minister's sore spots, but surely the Minister feels that the time has come to redeem his undertaking to tell this House and the country when are the aeroplanes going to be manufactured in Potez?  There is this immense factory standing on the Rathcoole road, which is to manufacture aeroplanes.  I do not know whether or not they are going to manufacture aeroplanes but we have been looking at the factory for a long time and I have seen no propellers and no wings going in.  I thought the aeroplanes would be roaring out by now, but I have not seen any propellers or wings carried in.</P>

      <P>We must all learn to creep before we run.  That is quite agreed.  But flaps and ailerons after four years is a very modest reward for the substantial investment that has been made.  I believe we have a very large accumulation of oil heaters sitting below in Galway and nobody can be blamed that there are not plenty of oil heaters.  The problem is nobody wants to buy them.  I believe the Valor Oil Company have gone out of business in Great Britain because nobody wants oil heaters and this is the time at which we launch out in a big way to manufacture oil heaters in Ireland. Give the devil his due, the Potez oil heater is a very efficient heater. Whether it is a saleable commodity or not is another day's work, but I think the Minister has an obligation to give a realistic appraisal of the situation on the Rathcoole road and I want to say to him now that nobody will regard it as realistic to say that, after four years, some ailerons and flaps have come out of the factory.</P>

      <P>A little progress is a welcome thing.  This shows again the incomparable value of Parliament and I think the Minister for Industry and Commerce and I may exchange mutual congratulations in this regard.  We have acted on the admirable precept of lighting a little candle rather than crying in the dark and it is a very valuable constitutional reform to secure an undertaking from one member of the Fianna Fáil Government that important policy pronouncements will not here-after be made at dogfights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one last matter in relation to which I want to say a word to the Minister for Industry and Commerce. It is one of the extraordinary anachronisms of this country that employment exchanges have in fact become unemployment exchanges.  I have always felt that employment exchanges should have as their primary function the matching of men and women to jobs.  The function of the manager of an employment exchange-mark <Col N="1370" /> you, they are called employment exchanges&mdash;should be to be on the lookout for suitable men in search of jobs and on the lookout for jobs to meet the requirements of men registered at the exchange.  But, through an extraordinary dispensation, I regret to say that the employment exchanges are part of the responsibility of the Minister for Social Welfare.  Is that not odd?</P>
    <P>We have allowed this concept to grow in our minds here in Dáil Éireann that what we originally called employment exchanges have, in fact, become a branch of social welfare as unemployment exchanges.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce was put up yesterday to make a grand speech.  He was going to open four employment exchanges in four centres in the country.  Does anybody realise that we have in every area of the country what ought to be employment exchanges but what, through some extraordinary foible, have come to be generally accepted in the North of Ireland as &ldquo;the bureau&rdquo; and in the rest of the country as unemployment exchanges.  I shall not trespass on the patience of the Chair or of the Minister by urging reform by him in respect of these employment exchanges which have come to be known as unemployment exchanges.  However, seeing that he is about to set up four more himself, would the Minister mind telling me this?  Has he now accepted the idea that the employment exchanges are, in fact, unemployment exchanges and that it has become necessary to set up four new institutions under his Department, to be known as employment exchanges, in connection with the manpower policy?  I suggest to him that, instead of setting up four new establishments, he should get the employment exchanges to do the work for which they were originally designed, that is, to provide employment for those who go there.</P>
    <P>Has the Minister ever been in an employment exchange?  Have you ever, apart from the Bridewell behind the Four Courts, been in a more depressing place than the employment exchanges in the city of Dublin?  Were <Col N="1371" /> you ever in the one down in Beresford Place?  If the Minister is accepting responsibility for this manpower policy, which I thought we always had but which I now discover is a complete innovation&mdash;I understood we had a huge organisation all over the country operating a manpower policy but the Minister, apparently, has discovered that such an organisation does not exist at all&mdash;might I suggest to him that, instead of rushing off and building four or five new ones, he use the ones that are there already?  Some of them are nice.  There is a fine employment exchange in Clonmel.  If they were all of that standard, I think people would go to them.  If they were staffed by people who felt that their primary duty was to get jobs, and not to distribute industrial unemployment benefit, I believe they would do the job the Minister has in mind probably more effectively than these four or five centres he will now set up.  The local employment manager knows the area where he works and knows the people in it.  He knows the duds and he knows the good men who really want work.  If it were made clear that the manager of the employment exchange was seriously trying to match men to jobs, ordinary employers would be much more disposed to have recourse to the local employment exchange than they are ever likely to have to some remote institution 50 or 60 miles away from the place in which they are operating at the present time.</P>
    <P>One of the most urgent jobs the Minister should do is to make up his mind, or to get the Government to make up their minds, as to the function of the employment exchange which is to match men with jobs.  If that is so, then it is a matter of real urgency that these employment exchanges should be made attractive, well-equipped and decent places where decent, hard-working, industrious men can go and be properly received as respectable, independent citizens who want work and the right to earn their living.  I can very well imagine such a man at present facing the prospect of going to some of the labour exchanges in Dublin with repugnance and reluctance <Col N="1372" /> because the accommodation provided there reminds one of the old workhouses, of the bad old days.</P>
    <P>I believe there is in existence, through the labour exchanges, a network which could provide employment for a great many people, if it were properly used.  One of the great dangers of our present situation is that anything that catches a headline in the newspapers or on the radio or on the television is regarded as preferable to some real concrete proposal that works.  Now, it is much more exciting, from the point of view of news, to announce a new manpower policy and that we are to build new manpower centres here, there and elsewhere in Ireland, that we are to establish new staffs, that this is to be under the Minister for Industry and Commerce. All that is much more newsworthy than to say: &ldquo;We shall decorate, clean, staff and equip the employment exchanges of this country; the Minister for Industry and Commerce will have responsibility for ensuring that they will discharge the function for which they were originally designed, that is, to match men with jobs; the manager of the labour exchange will be asked to work closely with the chief executive officer in the county for which he works in order to help in the retraining of men and women or in the vocational training of young boys and girls, where such training would facilitate the creation of new jobs&rdquo;.  I believe that, if the Minister did that, all the rest of the hullabaloo would probably be unnecessary but of course Fianna Fáil believe in hullabaloo.  I think they would be much better employed engaged in hard work.  Some day, I hope they will recognise that hard work is worth more to this country than hullabaloo.  I do not hope to see it.  Courteous and friendly as the present Minister for Industry and Commerce undoubtedly is, so long as he remains a member of the present Government, he is no damned good. If he ever shakes off their disreputable shackles, I would hope he would make a valuable contribution to the public life of this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose it is natural <Col N="1373" /> that, in this debate, practically every speaker has referred to industrial relations. The Minister has made it crystal clear that he is prepared to do everything in his power to promote harmony in industrial relations.  I want to compliment the Minister on his behaviour during some recent difficult months when relations were not of the best.  By his very attitude in showing how anxious he was to help he created a good impression, and at the same time, he never panicked.  On one occasion when I had to approach him with some workers during a strike, I was impressed by his intelligent handling of the situation and without any publicity or any fuss, he found the basis for a settlement.  I want to compliment him on his report which covers such a wide section of our economy.</P>
      <P>Some may say we are exaggerating the seriousness of the industrial relations situation at present but when we see the OECD report and find that we are at the bottom of the list for good relations, it is time to examine the position and see how we can erase the image of us that has been created abroad by this report.  I worked for many years on a factory floor and like most others, I graduated to something better.  Although I speak from experience I do not intend to lecture anybody but to comment on the situation in the hope that it will help to bring about the state of affairs we would all wish to see.  In this country of fewer than three million people, we have a glorious opportunity of showing that we can build up our economy so that it will offer full employment to our people, at the same time safeguarding the dignity of man.  Being free, we accept as individuals that we have a duty to each other and to the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the greatest causes of bad relations in industry is that management will seldom take workers into their confidence.  In most of the big concerns, if you are on the factory floor, you are simply a number on a punch card beside the clock; in some cases even the names do not appear. It is this terribly impersonal handling that makes workers dissatisfied.  Any firms that do enjoy good relations with <Col N="1374" /> their workers&mdash;and there are many of them&mdash;will tell you that the secret is that their workers, even those doing the most menial jobs, are made to feel that they are individuals and count for something and are not just numbers on the payroll.  The more progressive firms plan ahead and take the workers into their confidence.  They say: &ldquo;We want to do this: we cannot do it unless we get your co-operation.&rdquo;  There is one factory in this city which I think has never had a strike.  It employs about 700 men and pays very good wages.  When I spoke to the personnel officer and asked him how this was achieved, he said he did not want to use a cliché but it was simply that they treated the workers as human beings.</P>
    <P>Human beings are no more perfect than managements and a man may be offhand and down tools.  It is then a case of how that situation is dealt with. On the one hand, you may say that any man who sets out to describe all workers as angels and all managements as devils is heading for trouble.  In Ireland today there is an opportunity to recognise that we have a tough time ahead and we are not alone, as every country is facing the same thing.  I listened to Deputy Dillon acting as a prophet of gloom.  He does neither himself nor his Party much good by forecasting dire happenings.  I could indulge in recriminations about what his Government did when in power but it would not serve any purpose.  I will say to the Fine Gael Party that Fianna Fáil will not run away from their responsibilities as Fine Gael did on two occasions when given the chance of power as a minority Party. Twice they broke in disorder and chaos and ran away and left it to Fianna Fáil to clear up the mess.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>And Labour were equally guilty at that time.  Deputy Dillon began his speech after a remark by Deputy Larkin about profit.  He seemed to think that Deputy Larkin suggested there was something immoral <Col N="1375" /> about profit.  Nobody believes that and I do not think Deputy Larkin meant it that way.  Deputy Dillon went on to give us a treatise on how sacred profit is.  I am not a socialist; I believe in free enterprise and I agree with Deputy Dillon when he mentions the United States as the greatest capitalist country in the world, a country that gives most of its workers the highest living standards.</P>
      <P>Again, in regard to industrial relations, some change must be made.  We hear the people in Abbey Street saying: &ldquo;It is 1913 all over again.&rdquo;  But I think these are people who are causing a lot of trouble, people who are anti-trade union.  I know that there are people in this city who are anti-trade union and anti-everything and are causing trouble.  There is one individual who is not a member of a trade union but who has been involved in three strikes. Neither was he employed by the firms involved in the strikes.  I am glad to see that at least three trade unions have spoken out against these people. Last week when we had pickets on, I was glad to see that some of the agricultural men were on the watch for undesirable elements seeking to use any cause to create trouble.</P>
      <P>I wish to pay tribute also to some trade unions who, even though they may have taken strike action, on three recent occasions limited picketing to the sections involved and thus allowed other workers to continue in employment without passing pickets.  That shows these trade union leaders are responsible men striving very hard to achieve good industrial relations.  Could we, by agreement, put an end to wildcat strikes?  I defend to the last the right of a worker to strike or picket but I do not defend the wildcat strike which causes real suffering, not perhaps to the management, apart from the money they may lose, but to those involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be said that it is all right to talk here but that these things happen.  I was involved on at least one occasion myself in a wildcat strike. These things happen very quickly.  At one minute the factory is working <Col N="1376" /> normally and then something blows up, a man is dismissed or suspended for doing something wrong, and immediately the workers all walk out. The union men are sent for and come along and generally it is fixed up in three or four hours.  But that is three or four hours of production lost and it does not help towards better relations. We should impress on all concerned the need to be on guard against all such happenings and how essential it is to prevent them so that we can present a better image to the outside world and make ourselves better off by striving to have better relations between management and workers.</P>
    <P>I remember Jim Larkin very well. He was the prime mover in 1913. People say: &ldquo;If the men who went out in 1913 were alive today, what a different country we would have&rdquo;.  My people were Larkinites and I remember Jim Larkin in his later days being abused by people, including workers, just as the Minister is being abused here today.  I do not believe in waiting until a man dies to give him support or to pay him homage.  While Jim Larkin was alive, I supported him. There was something great in him.  If he were alive today, he would be abused as the Minister is being abused this morning or as anybody in authority is abused.  Larkin strove all his life after 1913 for industrial relations.  I heard him being abused because he would not take the popular line.  He had sufficient courage to stand up to his abusers.  Today we have to stand up to those people who are causing trouble in this city, faceless men who have no allegiance to anybody, whose only object is to cause confusion.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael speakers have attacked the efforts of the Government to attract new industries here.  I find it difficult to follow them.  The Minister has said, at page 4 of his brief:</P>
    <P>Projects with foreign participation accounted for about 60 per cent of the capital investment and nearly 70 per cent of the employment involved.  At the end of 1965, 49 new factories having an employment potential of about 4,500 persons and estimated investment of £29.1 million, were under construction.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1377" /> The majority of the new undertakings established here in recent years are based on production for export.  This is illustrated by the value of industrial exports, which in the past year was over 150 per cent above the corresponding 1958 level.</P>
    <P>Most of the Fine Gael speakers seemed to gloat over the fact of a factory failing.  If a factory fails, it would seem that is something to be thankful for.  No wonder they are a minority Party and always will be. How can they expect people to support them?  They talk about a just society but they gloat over the failure of a factory.  There must be casualties. Their attitude is on a level with saying that because people die under surgical operations, doctors should not operate. In any free society there will be casualties. At the same time, I am sure every care is taken, when foreigners apply for industrial grants, to have the projects thoroughly investigated.  If they are not investigated, and I have no reason to think they are not, there is something wrong.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon blames everything on the turnover tax.  That is utterly ridiculous. On a previous occasion I asked Deputy Dillon if by some mischance he were returned to power, would he abolish the tax.  He gave an evasive answer and did not say if he would or would not.  He suggested that the turnover tax was responsible for the growth of chain stores here.  I was not in the House when the turnover tax was introduced but I know the position in the city.  I remember being invited to open a huge chain store.  I certainly refused to do so.  That was before the turnover tax was imposed.  These people have built many markets here since.  We may deplore the chain store age we are living in but we have to face the fact that we are living in it and that chain stores were in being long before the introduction of the turnover tax and will continue in existence. The tax also will continue because no Government will ever repeal it.  Let us stop being hypocritical about those things.</P>
    <P>The Government have been criticised for their failure to get credit <Col N="1378" /> abroad.  Every country in the world has credit troubles at the moment.  Consider how Great Britain has been able to carry on.  It is not so long ago that Britain appealed to the whole world, to West Germany, to the United States of America and to France, for money to bolster their falling £.  In the interests of Europe, those other free enterprise countries came to the aid of Britain.  We, as the Minister has stated, have not got a God-given right to prosperity.  It is up to ourselves to achieve prosperity.  It entails tremendously hard work.  If we could have a breathing space of six months or a year free from industrial troubles, the people would have a more prosperous country and by our own efforts we would have built it up.</P>
    <P>Our whole history is marked by our hope for foreign aid.  I am one who welcomes investment of foreign capital in this country.  We must have it if we are to progress.  Capital is not an end in itself.  It is simply a means of helping us to build the economy so that we can have full employment for our people in their own country.  I should like to see a change in the attitude of people towards strikes.  There are many strikes taking place in semi-State organisations which we, the people, own.  That must be changed.  In very few cases is the employer a member of the Ascendancy.  Fifty years ago, employers may have represented the Ascendancy.  The people, by their efforts, have built up industries, some of which are a great credit to the country.  Therein lies the blueprint of progress.  As I have said, I am not a socialist but I do believe that if free enterprise fails in any sphere, it is the duty of the State to provide the services or industry.  We have done it in the case of Aer Lingus, the ESB, Bord na Móna and a hundred others.  That is my form of socialism.  Where free enterprise cannot do the job, the State must come in.  That is not an original idea.  Every Deputy agrees with it.</P>
    <P>I want to conclude by making the plea that both management and labour will strive even a little harder than they have been doing to come together so that we will not be at the head of the strike chart in the OECD Report.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcAuliffe" hpid="Mr. McAuliffe Mr. McAuliffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McAuliffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dillon referred to one very important point, namely, that the Minister for Industry and Commerce should negotiate with his two colleagues in the Cabinet, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Local Government, as far as the housing situation is concerned in order to protect already existing industries. I refer to this because at the present moment, as a member of Cork County Council, I am aware of the position in a progressive town in East Cork.  The town of Mitchelstown has made great headway over a long number of years. Mitchelstown Co-operative Society is a very prominent creamery, manufacturing cheese.  They proposed to erect a bacon factory.  I am led to believe that a housing problem will confront those who are operating these industries in the very near future.  Manpower must be available for an industry and can be available only if there is sufficient housing in the neighbourhood.  We are in the situation at the moment that Cork County Council are not able to meet the demands in this line for lack of finance.  I would ask the Minister to use his influence with his colleagues in the matter.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer to the protection of our existing industries, and in particular to one very important industry, that is, Irish Steel Holdings. I am led to believe that over the past two years a considerable amount of unemployment has been created by men being laid off by Irish Steel Holdings at Cobh, County Cork.  Why this should happen is a mystery to me.  The Minister's colleagues in the Dáil, not so long ago, and my own colleague in East Cork, Deputy Corry, reminded this House that we had British manufactured steel coming into this country and being used here.  I was amazed just like other Deputies when we attended, during the past 12 months, with the Minister for Transport and Power, the opening of a new store at Mallow, to find out that the corrugated iron used in the erection of that store was made in England.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mallow is less than 30 miles from Cobh where Irish Steel Holdings exists and it is strange to think that the Department of Transport and Power <Col N="1380" /> could not use Irish manufactured steel in the erection of a store at Mallow for CIE.  There is no doubt about it because marked on every sheet of iron is &ldquo;Made in England&rdquo;.  This iron did not come into this country 30 or 35 years ago.  It came quite recently and was used recently, under the direction of the Minister for Transport and Power, in the erection of that store.  In addition to that, it is only 12 months since I saw lead pencils marked &ldquo;Made in England&rdquo;, being used at Mallow platform by CIE officials, despite the fact that in Fermoy we have an important industry run by Faber-Castell engaged in the manufacture of lead pencils.  These pencils are apparently not good enough for use by CIE.</P>
    <P>In addition to this, it is a well-known fact that many of our cups and saucers and cutlery in general use by the Department of Defence at the present moment are made in Japan. If you go into any of the canteens and look at the bottom of a cup or saucer, you will find &ldquo;Made in Japan&rdquo;.  Surely if we have a desire or ambition to protect Irish industries, the one thing we should do is make quite sure that every State and semi-State concern will utilise the products of the industries existing at the present moment.</P>
    <P>I am asking the Minister for Industry and Commerce to make sure that he will use his good offices with his colleagues to ensure that our industries will be given ample protection by the Departments who have the opportunity to protect them.  It is scandalous at the moment to think that we have a few hundred men laid off in the town of Cobh by Irish Steel Holdings and no effort being made for their re-employment.  At the present time this is very important to the town of Cobh.  The majority of the people employed in Irish Steel Holdings live in the town of Cobh and I am asking the Minister to let us know what his views are on this major industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Dr. Hillery) Patrick J. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Dr. Hillery)</NameTxt>
      <P>Many of the matters raised in this debate will be answered in pending legislation.  Today we have on the Order Paper the Industrial Grants (Amendment) Bill which raises <Col N="1381" /> the question of industrial estates and expansion of adaptation grants legislation. Next week I hope the Industrial Training Bill, 1965 will be circulated to Deputies with an explanatory memorandum.  This will widen out the picture as drawn here by the Parliamentary Secretary yesterday and will perhaps encourage Deputy Dillon to see more in the Manpower Authority than the decoration of employment exchanges.  I have discovered since he spoke today that some of them have been decorated and have been made quite comfortable.  I was going to compare them with the banks but that might not be appropriate at the moment.</P>
      <P>With regard to industrial relations legislation, when I referred to this I intended it to be just a passing reference to indicate to the House that this legislation has gone to the stage of development as far as my thinking, the general opinions given to me and broad decisions by the Government are concerned. I did not intend to get involved in any debate before the introduction of the legislation itself.  We have sought the comments of the people most concerned with these proposals. There is some idea, not clearly articulated, about reluctance on my part to come along with this legislation.  It is certainly not a reluctance.  The preparation of this legislation requires more thought than any other material I have brought before the Dáil.  It is not the simple act of brilliantly cutting the Gordian knot and letting things take their course.  We are dealing with human problems, and if there is delay, it is for no reason other than that we are trying to establish co-operation in this community, that we as a community are faced with problems and we must try to solve these problems in co-operation with one another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other idea of those who would rush this legislation through the House is that the Bill itself will be a panacea, a sudden cure for all our ills.  Industrial relations legislation will go as far as this Government think it should go in providing machinery in which a democracy can solve the problems which arise in the field of industry. <Col N="1382" /> The problem is to seek solutions to the common problem, while protecting the rights of the interests involved and preserving the interest of our democracy as we know it.  Most people have by now given mature thought to the role the Government should play in the field of industrial relations. There is a whole range of roles from the extreme of regimentation, which is neither possible nor desirable here, to the other extreme of total <i>laissez faire</i> and see what happens.</P>
    <P>We have seen governments in other countries go from one extreme to the other&mdash;the regimentation of the authoritarian society to the passive attitude of the more liberal community. We know from our own experience that Irish people will not be regimented.  All our past history indicates to us that it would be very foolish to try to force people to agree to solutions which they do not accept. This does not mean, of course, that we accept the opposite, that we let everything happen and stand idly by and see what the result will be.  I think we are all satisfied that we must have certain common aims to improve our national prosperity and achieve our national aims.  There are so many conflicting sectional interests in the field that the Government must exercise their influence, and this either morally or statutorily, and act as a co-ordinator and a guide in the national interest. This is what our position is.  We have created machinery and we intend, if we can, to improve upon it so that the free negotiation which we accept as a principle can take place and take place without doing too much damage to the common good.  Recently, with this machinery available, the Government have from time to time stated guidelines of principles which should influence both workers and employers in their dealings with each other.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon said that when we commented on the Labour Court's guidelines we were changing our minds about the three per cent guideline which had been established by us on the basis of the best economic advice available.  The very statement of that principle of three per cent was what we considered the duty of the Govern <Col N="1383" /> ment at the time: to guide, for the common good, the negotiations which were going on.  It was based on the best economic advice and was submitted for the opinion of an independent body representative of many sections of the community and certainly of both the employers and workers.  It was suggested that, when the Labour Court came along and set out guidelines, which the Labour Court in its wisdom saw, not from the economic standpoint but from the point of view of industrial unrest and the prevention of industrial unrest, we had changed from the principles we laid down.</P>
    <P>If I may read a paragraph from the comments issued by the Government on the Labour Court's guidelines, it will explain what our position was:</P>
    <P>The Labour Court statement does not invalidate either the statement issued by the Government on the 8th March, 1966, or the reference to income increases made by the Minister for Finance in his Budget statement. It remains true that if income increases, which in the aggregate exceed the rise in national production, are not offset by improvements in productivity, it will lead to inflation of costs and prices, make our goods and services more expensive and hard to sell, and bring about a risk of loss of production and employment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, it does invalidate it.  That is merely an expression of opinion.</P>

I refer to that <Col N="1384" /> because the Deputy made some reference to it when speaking of the inadvisability of having a professional man in this chair.

      <P>I was speaking about legislation which is coming.  We will leave this legislation for industrial relations because the House will have a chance of discussing it as soon as possible and the delays, if there are any, are due to the mature consideration being given by everybody to the solution of the problems.  I hope to introduce that legislation before this session ends but consideration of it by everybody involved has already begun.</P>
      <P>Legislation is pending, too, for Córas Tráchtála Teoranta and many of the points raised about exports will be dealt with then.  At this stage I should like to comment on the announcement of the forthcoming removal, in November, of the British temporary charge on imports.  I welcome, of course, the certainty our producers now have that this will be removed on a particular date.  Irish industry will be encouraged to renew the trend of exports which was so encouraging to all of us in recent years.  An earlier removal of this would have been more welcome, as the temporary charge on imports was, and continues to be, a serious handicap to Irish industry.  I will continue the market development schemes in operation while the temporary charge is in force.</P>
      <P>The certainty of its removal is welcome but the fact of its being there at all was, as I have said, a most unwelcome and serious handicap to Irish industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Budget Speech of the British Chancellor of the Exchequer yesterday, he described certain further measures which he considered necessary to add to those already in force for the solution of the British balance of payments problem and the strengthening of <Col N="1385" /> sterling.  The measure he has taken, which affects us, is the introduction of a voluntary restraint on direct investment here by British firms and on the portfolio investments of institutional investors.  This restraint also applies to Australia, South Africa and New Zealand.  We heard of these proposals beforehand, on Saturday, and the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance made immediate strong representations to the British Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer for the exclusion of this country from the arrangement.</P>
    <P>It was pointed out to us that Ireland has a strong interest in the success of the British measures to achieve balance of payments equilibrium and that failure to achieve the British objectives would have far more serious long-term reactions on Ireland than any effects which would result now from the voluntary restraint proposed.  It was also pointed out that Australia, the country principally affected, had acquiesced in the proposals; that it would be extremely difficult for Britain to justify the exclusion of Ireland, a non-Commonwealth country, when the flow of capital to Ireland was the same as the flow to New Zealand, a Common-wealth country which had acquisced also in these proposals.  It was pointed out also that it was unlikely that the restrictive effect would be significant and that the restraint would not last for more than a year or two.  They agreed, however, to have further discussions about the effects of the programme on our economy.  We have impressed, and will continue to impress, on the British authorities the importance of our being able to secure adequate capital to sustain a high rate of growth.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that the effects of these proposals on the Irish economy will be at all serious.  It may, however, be necessary for the Industrial Development Authority to review their immediate programme for promotional activities in Britain.  I might add, and I think the Minister for Finance has already suggested, that the proposals and the situation which may arise from them call for increased support <Col N="1386" /> by Irish investors for domestic development. There is need for a special effort now for increased savings for investment within this country.</P>
    <P>Industrial development was dealt with widely throughout the debate.  As I announced, we are having a complete re-appraisal of the programme and this is being done by an international firm of consultants who do this work for many countries.  I think Deputies can await that re-appraisal and any proposals for new measures which will arise out of it.</P>
    <P>There were some suggestions such as having a nominee on the board of an industry to which we are giving grants, or having Irish nationals on the board. My comment on that would be that we are trying to attract industry, and to encourage people to set up industries here, to expand here the industries they have in other places.  We have to face pretty strong competition from other countries with industrial development programmes, and it is unreal to think of saying to these people: &ldquo;We will put a curb on you; we will make sure you do not fail; we will make sure you will not trick us.&rdquo;  We are trying to attract industries, and in this, Foras Tionscal and the IDA are being exceptionally successful, considering how careful they have to be, and how hard they have to compete with other people.</P>
    <P>The failure of companies was also spoken of.  That failure is not due to Government policy.  The failure of any firm is due to commercial reasons.  If you say: &ldquo;We will have no firm set up unless we are guaranteed success&rdquo;, you will have no firms set up.  If Government policy is to be judged on the after-life of these firms, it should be judged on the success of individual firms, on the expansion of those which are successful, and on their increasing exports performance which I mentioned when introducing this Estimate. As I said at that time, the losses in public money are negligible compared with the benefits in terms of employment, export markets and general economic advances.</P>
    <P>Deputy Donegan struck a few blows but they did not all land on me.  I did <Col N="1387" /> not feel them anyway.  One that was taken up afterwards was that the giving of grants to industries which later failed was influenced by Government Ministers who wanted to get factories in their own constituencies.  I have no doubt that every TD wants to get an industry in his own constituency and will do everything he can to get one, but I have information here which shows that the number of failures in the period of office of the other Government was proportionate to the number of failures in our time.  If it was due to Ministers interfering in our time, then it was equally so during their time.  However, I am more charitable, and I believe no one interferes excessively.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Who chalked the failures on the scoreboard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>To say that Foras Tionscal will give grants because of pressure from Minister is a reflection on the integrity of the Board of Foras Tionscal, and it is a reflection on the commonsense of the promoters of industry to suggest that they would invest enormous amounts of money and go to some place where a Minister sends them.  I hope I have said enough to dismiss the idea that Foras Tionscal are influenced by Minister.  If more needs to be said, I will say it.  The story is the same whatever Government are in office.  The failures are there to be seen.</P>
      <P>The House might be interested in knowing about these failures.  Since the industrial development programme began, 22 firms failed, representing £915,915, or seven per cent of the total paid for ordinary grants.  Of those 22, nine were or are being acquired by other firms, leaving 13 firms which might be called outright failures.  The amount of the grants paid to those 13 was £499,432, representing 4.1 per cent of the total grants.  The total number of grant-aided industries was 282 so that 13 failures represent 4½ per cent of those set up.  There were 22 failures, but nine factories were acquired by other firms so, in fact, there were really 13 complete failures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1388" /> As I said when I was introducing this estimate, the benefits so far outweigh the financial losses that we must be prepared to face the risk of losing some money.  In fact, most of the time my worry is not about the money but about the disappointment to the workers, but of course, no one can guarantee that every commercial venture will be a success.</P>
    <P>There was one point I would have made if I wanted to be argumentative about failures.  The time to say that you should not set up a factory is before the factory is set up.  I can find no record of Deputy Donegan or the Fine Gael Party objecting to the Potez project when it was first announced.  I remember many years ago there was a surgeon in a certain city.  He never gave his opinion until after an operation and then he said: &ldquo;I thought so&rdquo;. He developed a great reputation as a diagnostician.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the statement I said I would give to the House, the position about the Potez industry is not such as would allow me to make a definitive statement.  As I said in answer to a question in the House last week, at the moment it would be inappropriate to make a statement about discussions which are going on at the present stage.  The position has not changed, but I will inform the House about it as soon as I can do so.  Deputy Dillon raised the point that this might happen during the long recess.  You cannot have it every way.  If there is any information available before we rise for the long recess, I will let the House have it, and if not, I will inform the House when we meet after the long recess.</P>

      <P>When you are over there, you can claim credit for success. You can say that the home manufacturers should be dealt with more favourably by the Minister, but in the next sentence you can say that the foreign manufacturers should be given tax free access to the home market. That would blow the home manufacturers sky high.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were many points raised by Deputies which I shall answer.  I am sorry one Deputy saw fit to make sweeping allegations of inefficiency on the part of civil servants.  The efficiency of the Department is the responsibility of the Minister and if there is any inefficiency in it, he is accountable for it.  I can assure the Deputy that this is a matter which is constantly in the Minister's mind.  The nature of the task makes it just impossible to carry inefficiency in a busy Department.  I do not want to make a statement about the Civil Service.  All I want to say is <Col N="1390" /> that the sweeping statement made by the Deputy is, of course, not true.</P>
    <P>I have already told Deputy Dillon that the Gardiner Street and Werburgh Street men's employment exchanges have recently been decorated.  The women's employment exchanges are not so good.  The Parliamentary Secretary referred to four new replacement offices.  He meant that new replacement offices are being provided within the employment exchanges. These will be segregated from the employment exchanges proper and will be specially decorated and comfortably furnished.  It is not intended to have any counters or grills, to have open spaces but to provide privacy by having partitioned areas.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon felt that you just cannot get a man until you have a job which he can come into.  I said in the House recently that with the changes in employment, we just cannot pick the man for the job.  We will have to train him first.  If he is already trained in a job which has disappeared, we will have to retrain him for another job.  The services which the Parliamentary Secretary is handling will cover vocational guidance and training as well as replacement.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell asked about the type of men who will be officers.  They will be appointed at deputy manager level and will be retrained in up-to-date techniques which are being practised at the moment in OECD countries. There will be replacement centres in the cities of Cork, Galway and Waterford as well as in Dublin.  The Deputy also asked me to minimise the incidence of redundancy.  Employers will be expected to adopt a humane approach in dealing with this.  Everything will be done to prevent redundancy by means of internal transfers, early retirals and normal wastage.  As employers have to pay lump sums when there is redundancy, this will discourage them from making cruel decisions or causing unnecessary hardship.</P>
    <P>I had a look through the report of An Foras Tionscal to see if it could be true that the IDA were concerned <Col N="1391" /> with large industries only.  I find, on looking through this report, that from the size of the grants, most of those are smaller industries.  This is just another sweeping statement that is not accurate.  The same Deputy who mentioned that said there was no organisation to help small industries.  It might not be known that the Irish National Productivity Committee run a special service for small and medium sized industries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister mean there is a bigger number of smaller industries helped or a greater amount of money given?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>The point made was that the bigger factories were receiving more money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It was the increased amount of money the Deputy was referring to.  He said it was far greater for the bigger industries but that there was a bigger number of smaller industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy O'Connell was talking about the raising of capital and the issuing of licences for the export of skins.  I said to him at the time that this was a matter for the Department of Agriculture.  Those licences are freely issued by the Department of Industry and Commerce on the production of evidence from the Department of Agriculture that the dead meat which appertains to the skins is for export.  I want to say that 100 per cent of the skins belonging to the export meat trade are issued on licences once the evidence is received from the Department of Agriculture. Some percentage of the skins for domestic slaughter are allowed but this is a temporary measure.  I am quite sure the Deputy will appreciate the control is to protect employment and industry at home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon was worried about allowing the State to take charge of all of us.  This is something which anybody who has given thought to the situation developing will remark on. I do not want Deputy Dillon to get away with the idea that the Government <Col N="1392" /> are causing more and more State intervention.  As I said somewhere recently, there is often a very convincing case made for less extensive State activity but more disturbing is the insistence with which people clamour for greater State activity.  This means intrusion in their lives.  I do not know what can be done about it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon argued up to a point, and then left it in the air, that if you exhort people, everything will go right, that if you tell people to do things, they will do them.  That is not my experience and I am sure if Deputy Dillon were in Government, it would not be his.  Therefore, certain measures are necessary.  He spoke about price control and its effects.  He said we had told manufacturers: &ldquo;You cannot make profits&rdquo;.  What we set out to do, and I think we are doing it successfully, was to prevent people passing on every cost to the consumer.  There must be other ways of absorbing increased costs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dillon said that, of course, the answer might be to let them increase their prices.  But then Deputy Dillon said you cannot let them do that because it would put up the cost to the farmers.  He cannot have it both ways.  I have not told them they cannot increase their prices.  I have said that in this situation, with a spiral of prices and costs, they shall not put up their prices without giving thought to it and without our having something to say about it.  Neither did I say I would let them put up their prices.  I said: &ldquo;I shall examine it&rdquo;, and I set up a Prices Advisory Body. I think it was right to set up a body to see if they are justified in putting up their prices.  If the Advisory Body says they are justified, then their prices will be put up.</P>

      <P>In relation to Tynagh, the information I have given is information the company made public.  It is available to any Deputy.  Any additional information is confidential and I could not give it here.  I am not in a position to confirm Deputy Tully's estimate of the state of Tynagh.  I have no reason to disagree with him. There has been a marked influence on some foreign prospectors, who are <Col N="1395" /> well informed in these matters, by the discoveries at Tynagh.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer to our ratification by legislation of the Geneva Convention on the Continental Shelf.  All I can say is that if there are delays it is not merely a minerals matter.  The Convention covers fisheries, pollution of the water, navigational hazards and other matters involving a number of Departments.  It is only recently that the comprehensive proposals have come to us.</P>

      <P>Only some European countries have ratified the Convention, including Britain, Denmark, France, the Netherlands and Portugal.  The absence of legislation has not prevented exploration so far and I gather that some exploration has begun.  We want the legislation to make regular the availability of facilities and to enable this State to grant rights.</P>
      <P>The question of factory inspectors was mentioned.  A report on this matter is published annually in accordance with the Factories Act and gives details of the number of inspections and of the number of prosecutions taken against owners who failed to comply with the provisions of the Act.  It is the aim of the inspectors to inspect factories each year and this is being achieved in 95 cases out of 100.  Many factories are re-visited when the inspectors consider it necessary.  In the year ended 30th September, 1965, 11,570 premises came within the scope of the Act and the total number of visits was 16,748.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think the comments made on the inspectors and their activities were quite fair.  The inspectors wish to enforce the provisions of the Act only to ensure that accidents are prevented from taking place.  Their advice and guidance is frequently sought and, of course, freely given.  If any Deputy wants particulars of the number of prosecutions and so on, they are available in the report of the factories inspections.  I would say that the inspectors&mdash;and I mentioned this to the House before&mdash;have time and again expressed disappointment with <Col N="1396" /> the slow progress in setting up safety committees within the factories.  These could appreciably help in reducing the incidence of accidents.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dowling mentioned gimmicks in advertising and the protection of housewives from these gimmicks. The law as we have it protects a person against being sold short weight. If a substance is advertised as something, then it must be that.  Further protection, by making it obligatory on people to describe what is in packets, is something which the House has asked me several times to introduce.  I have told the House that we are keeping this under observation.  The pressure on the staff available to me, and the priorities which I have, would not suggest that I should go ahead at this time with this legislation and I think we will have to depend on the consuming public becoming a little more critical of the great claims made by manufacturers and sellers of goods. Deputy Dillon says that these big combines coming into the retail trade came in because of the two and a half per cent turnover tax.  This is an old fallacious argument&mdash;<i>post hoc ergo propter hoc,</i> anything that happens after an event is because of it.  That is the only comment I will make except to say that the Government are keeping an eye on the acquisition of retail outlets by people outside the country and this, too, will be constantly renewed and reviewed by the Government.</P>
    <P>As I said when starting, any questions which have been raised and which I have not dealt with now, will be dealt with by legislation which is pending in the near future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Dr. Hillery) Patrick J. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Dr. Hillery)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main proposals of the Bill are, firstly, to provide for the establishment and administration by An Foras Tionscal of industrial estates, with factory premises for renting, in development <Col N="1397" /> centres and, secondly, to continue in operation for a further period the scheme of enlargement and adaptation grants to assist industrial undertakings in preparing for free trade conditions.</P>
    <P>To take the first proposal&mdash;Deputies will have seen the Report of the Committee on Development Centres and Industrial Estates and the statement of policy indicating the Government's attitude to the proposals in the Report. For the convenience of Deputies I might recall that it is the intention on completion of the regional surveys being undertaken by the Minister for Local Government to identify development centres in each region.  Meanwhile, it is proposed to proceed with the development of industrial estates at Waterford and Galway.  The necessary powers to enable An Foras Tionscal to establish and administer industrial estates are contained in section 4 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I should like to make it clear that the identification of development centres and the setting up of industrial estates is not intended to involve the discouragement of industrial development at other locations where there are no industrial estates.  The Government have already indicated in the policy statement to which I have referred that the dispersal of industrial activity throughout the country, where this is economically feasible, yields important social advantages, and that, in the administration of the industrial grants scheme, the location of industries in other development centres will be encouraged.  It is confidently expected, however, that the development of industrial estates will attract thereto industries which might not otherwise have been located in Ireland at all but for the facilities offered at these estates.</P>
    <P>It is also proposed in the Bill that An Foras Tionscal should be empowered to make available, at reduced rents, factory premises situated in industrial estates administer by An Foras Tionscal and also to make grants available towards the reduction of rents for factory premises situated in what may be termed private industrial estates. This power is inherent in the provisions <Col N="1398" /> of section 4 in relation to estates administered by An Foras Tionscal and a specific provision is made in section 9 in relation to estates in the other category.  When factories are made available at reduced rents it is the intention that the reduction in rent would not be more advantageous to an industrialist than the amount of a grant which he would have been given under the existing legislation.</P>
    <P>I am sure that the House will agree that the industrial grants scheme which has been in operation for a considerable time and under which assistance is provided in appropriate cases to industrialists who build their own factories, has been an important factor in the progress so far achieved in industrial development.  I am satisfied that the provision of factories on inindustrial estates at attractive rents will represent a significant extension of the range of incentives available for industrial development and, therefore, should stimulate activity among industrialists contemplating industrial projects that are suitable for location in an industrial estate.</P>
    <P>Under the existing legislation the aggregate maximum expenditure provided for in relation to grants which the Minister for Industry and Commerce may make to An Foras Tionscal is £30 million.  It is not proposed to increase this amount, at least for the time being.  Section 3 of the Bill proposes, however, to increase from £20 million to £30 million the aggregate amount of grants An Foras Tionscal may make for industrial development.</P>
    <P>It is also proposed, in section 5, that An Foras Tionscal should be empowered to recruit staff for the administration of industrial estates.  As the type of work involved will be more akin to commercial activities than normal Civil Service procedures, it is desirable that An Foras should have this power so as to ensure flexibility in staffing arrangements both in the administrative and technical spheres.</P>
    <P>Deputies will recall that in March last, I had the &ldquo;Report on the Progress of Industrial Adaptation&rdquo; prepared and presented to the House. <Col N="1399" /> This report sets out in fair detail the steps which have been taken to prepare industry for the coming of freer trade.  It also indicates that in many respects the work of industrial adaptation is far from complete.  However, the failure of some firms to seek assistance and the lack of progress in certain directions mentioned in the report may be due to the uncertainty that had obtained regarding our future trading relations.  This uncertainty has now been largely dispelled and it is to be hoped that more firms will urgently apply themselves to the task of adaptation.</P>
    <P>The legislation which enabled An Foras Tionscal to assist firms by way of special grants, not exceeding 25 per cent of cost, expired on 31st March, 1966.  The Government feel that if the impetus towards adaptation which has been generated is to be maintained and strengthened the continuation of the grants scheme is necessary and one of the purposes of this Bill is to extend the operation of the scheme to 31st December, 1967, as provided for in section 2 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Up to 31st December, 1965, some 600 firms had formulated adaptation proposals representing a capital investment of over £55 million.  In addition, as is indicated in the report, the adaptation councils have been applying themselves to the solution of the various problems highlighted in the reports of the Committee on Industrial Organisation.  The council in some industries have achieved quite good results.  Others have not as yet made any real impact on the wider aspects of adaptation&mdash;joint marketing, training, etc.&mdash;which involve cooperation between individual firms in the same industry or in related industries.</P>
    <P>There is an urgent need for a great burst of activity in these aspects of adaptation&mdash;equally urgent, I would say, with the need for progress in physical adaptation by way of modernisation of equipment, expansion of premises and the like.  I am confident that the desired progress will be realised as I think it is fair to say <Col N="1400" /> that industry is now far more aware of the need for adaptation measures than it was when the legislation was first introduced.  This, of course, is hardly a matter for surprise.  The conclusion of the trade agreement with Britain brings us to the threshold of free trade and it is only the most ostrich-like mentality that could in present circumstances ignore the need for drastic changes in all aspects of industry.  Evidence of the new and more realistic outlook is afforded by a sharp increase in the number of applications for grants received in the quarter ended 31st March, 1966.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to delay the House by going into the matter too deeply as the report which I have mentioned is up-to-date and covers the ground in a most comprehensive way.  I would, however, like to repeat what I said in a foreword to that report &ldquo;It is clear that much has been achieved; it is also clear that more remains to be done. Action cannot now be postponed.  Now is the time for an all-out effort to ensure that what has still to be done will be tackled with energy and completed with speed&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Bill for the approval of the Dáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter of extreme gratification to the Fine Gael Party, who in company with the Labour Party were responsible originally for setting up this legislation for industrial grants, to find that the Government have now acceded to our request that there should be changes in this legislation.  Following the period 1956 to 1957, when at the outset this legislation was opposed by the Party now forming the Government, experience showed the necessity for change. Year after year, and in particular in the past two years when we demanded this change, the Government were behaving with the stolidity of a bullock and the inflexibility of a mule.  Today it is pleasing to find there is a step forward and that in fact what we have been demanding from this side of the House, while not granted completely, has been acceded to in part.  We do not think the Government have gone far enough in this amending Bill but we <Col N="1401" /> will support it as far as it does go.  We feel good will come from it.</P>
      <P>I want, however, to refer to one change in relation to adaptation grants which is not a step forward but a step backwards.  The first announcement by the Government of adaptation grants brought with it the statement that these grants would be subject to a time factor.  The idea was that the Minister's lá na scolb would be immediately with us rather than that the manufacturers would have a long time in which to delay and find themselves caught out by conditions of freer trade either in the Free Trade Area or the Common Market.  This was a good idea but the date set was an incentive rather than a fact.  We knew people could not either physically or financially complete their adaptation by that date and it was felt all along there would be an extension of it.  In the extension we now have in section 2 of the Bill, we also find a change.  Originally, those seeking adaptation grants, who had not the application completed in detail but wished to proceed, were allowed to proceed with the adaptation work and take the risk of having their grants approved or rejected.  The position in the new legislation is that in fact the adaptation work for which an application is made cannot be retrospective to 1960 but must refer to work to be done in the future.</P>
      <P>I believe this restriction is brought about by the shortage of money at present so far as the Government are concerned. I hope it will be removed. There are companies who find themselves in the position of knowing that as free trade with Britain becomes a fact they will either have to adapt quickly or find themselves put out of business.  A detailed application for an adaptation grant can take as long as 12 to 18 months to produce.  People have to deal with their architects and engineers.  They have to select the particular type of machinery and get quotations for it.  It is amazing the amount of delay there is at present in getting these prices and getting the whole thing on paper.  From that point of view, section 2 is to a certain extent restrictive.  It is something that can be looked into in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1402" /> I welcome the suggestion that industrial estates are to be set up elsewhere than in Shannon where they are a success. The interesting point&mdash;it is no more than an interesting point now&mdash;is that Shannon was set up to create air freight.  The last figure I saw in relation to this was that only 18 per cent of the products of the factories there were in fact going out by air.  I would like to see more of it going by air.  However, so long as the factories are operating and employment is being created, the good being done is quite sufficient in relation to the expenditure involved.  It is an indication that the right decision has been made in going to other centres of industrial growth to set up industrial estates.</P>
    <P>The figure for air freight at Shannon is surprising when you analyse it.  It may have improved since.  When you take into consideration that one of the factories there is a computer factory and the other makes radio and television components for America, it is extraordinary that the figure is so low. However, if the industrial estate at Shannon is a success, we should proceed along these lines.  I would suggest that Shannon has succeeded better than the system of individual grants.  Of course, these must be there also because you cannot send every industrialist to an estate like an Indian reservation if he wants to go somewhere else; but at the same time the system whereby factory bays are built and remain the property of the Government and the system outlined by the Minister today whereby the grant is given to the factory in the form of reduced rent show the flexibility that was not there up to now and which we on this side of the House were demanding so vociferously.</P>
    <P>This question of setting up centres for industry is something that can cause a very considerable amount of local political agitation and is something for which the Minister can find himself under severe criticism.  I would much prefer if, instead of workers emigrating from Leitrim to Birmingham, they could go to an industrial estate in Sligo.  Where there are ten or 12 units of industry in the same place, one <Col N="1403" /> can help the other.  I remember being in Birmingham on one occasion trying to get an industrial machine which was delayed and which was holding up production very seriously.  I was in the office of an executive in a factory where grain dryers were being manufactured. That executive was in the position, in relation to component parts which he himself was not manufacturing, to pick up the phone and ring fellows called Bert, Joe and Fred with whom he discussed to what football match they were going on Saturday and where he would meet them for a point on the way home from work, and he could get these component parts moved up in the queue in that factory so that sufficient machines could be produced.  That is one of our difficulties, inherent in the fact that we are not a large industrial nation.  It is a great advantage to an industry when there are other ancillary industries within the estate all being able to ring up and help one another so that production and delivery schedules can be adhered to.  I believe industrial estates are one of the excellent moves forward which should have been made years ago.</P>
    <P>Ownership of the factory by the Government is something I entirely support.  If a <i>bona fide</i> manufacturer comes here with the intention of setting up a factory, putting in his own money, the Government can give him a grant in the form of reduced rent or give part of the grant in cash and give the rest of the grant in the form of reduced rent.  If he is a <i>bona fide</i> manufacturer, he would welcome that situation.  In the event of production stopping the factory would revert to the Government and there would be an opportunity of re-starting production by leasing the factory to some other manufacturer and thus keeping employment in the district.</P>
    <P>I could give an example of this.  The Minister said I was taking credit for it, but I was not.  Something I said at a meeting was picked up and, willynilly, an announcement was made. I am sure it has happened to the Minister also.  However, this has been guarded against in the particular industry <Col N="1404" /> I have in mind.  No matter what side of the House we are on we are keeping our mouths shut, and announcements are being given to us all at the same time.  I refer to the GEC factory in Dundalk and the happy situation that has developed with Emerald Isle at Shannon.  There was a long period when this factory was lying empty and when we were in the position of having our shekels on a racehorse and hoping it would come home.  We would be on something like the favourite if the Government owned such factories and if they were freely available and if we could guarantee the goodwill, that was obviously there with the GEC, to get something elsemoving within the factory.  When production stops in a factory it should be possible for the Government and Foras Tionscal to move in and get it started again.  It is fortunate that down in Louth this happy situation developed of itself through the goodwill of the vacating company.  This is excellent, but again we should not be put in the position of having our shekels on a racehorse.  We should be in the position of owning the factory and giving the industrialist the advantage of reduced rent.</P>
    <P>This step forward is being copied from British legislation.  There is nothing wrong with copying the other fellow's good things.  The Minister can see how it operates and if it succeeds with the other fellow, there is the chance it will succeed with him.  This has been copied from legislation in Britain which was set up when the shipbuilding industry declined.  Particularly in Lancashire, in the northern part of England and Scotland, the establishment of industries was encouraged by the leasing of factories at low rents.  This is also being done in Northern Ireland with considerable success.</P>
    <P>This is the sort of flexibility we need, particularly when we consider the situation of the Minister for Transport and Power, who was described here this morning by Deputy Dillon as the wizard boy, in regard to what happened in Clones, the £12,000, and the legal situation of the Minister for Industry <Col N="1405" /> and Commerce.  I agree with the Minister there has to be risk but it horrifies me to think of that happening in a place like Clones, particularly having regard to the position of the Minister for Transport and Power in that area at the moment.  It makes one realise that the other system of renting space is far better.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>This was a very different situation in that the wizard boy, the Minister for Transport and Power, was very insistent that Deputy Dillon should go away and stay away. Deputy Dillon, being the gentlemanly kind of person he is, went away and stayed away, and now all the poor man has to do is to get the £12,000 back for the builder of the factory.</P>
      <P>I wish to talk about the question of grants for new factories in any place in the country, outside presumably those procured by the manufacturer himself.  As I said, the degree of flexibility that could exist in the giving of grants and loans simply does not exist.  The only flexibility, prior to the introduction of this Bill, is the flexibility whereby a grant can be converted into the interest factor in the repayment of a loan.  That can be done in conjunction with the Industrial Credit Company and it is a good thing. That is the only degree of flexibility and the factory premises are largely used by the manufacturer for the purpose of getting money perhaps from the commercial banks.  Very often they are mortgaged.  That is all right so long as there is success.  When there is failure, it is both embarrassing and annoying for the Minister to find himself under criticism here, with the green grass growing around the doors of the factory and the Minister unable to do anything about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want now to suggest a few ways in which more flexibility could be introduced. The Minister in his reply on the Estimate said that if there were freedom from income tax on goods for home consumption, that would affect <Col N="1406" /> competitors producing a like article. That is quite true, but there are instances in which this would not be the pattern.  Mention has been made of an aeroplane factory on the Nass Road. That factory would produce only aeroplanes and aeroplanes are not produced by anybody else.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Are not produced&mdash;full stop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>No one here is buying aeroplanes.  Suppose Guinness's and Goulding's bought executive aircraft, if there were freedom from income tax on the profits of those aircraft, then the Minister could leave the money with the people concerned for the relief of Potez or as a grant towards the establishment of a new industry. That is from the sublime to the ridiculous, but there are many products which are not made by anybody else and there are many products which are being made for the first time.  One could not do this with electrical products because you have GEC and EI and Philips.  One could not give freedom from income tax for home production in alleviation because, if one did, one would place them in a better position <i>vis-à-vis</i> their competitors. But there are products in relation to which this could be done and this degree of flexibility would be very valuable.  It would be one way of giving grants to a responsible firm without handing out large sums of money for the building of factories, factories which do not belong to the Minister and which may lie idle for years unless one has the goodwill I mentioned this morning in a specific case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has made no reference to the grading of grants and to the giving of the highest percentage of grants to those industries prepared to manufacture from raw materials freely available here.  A factory established here to process the raw material from the land is far more valuable than a factory which has to import its raw material.  That is not to say there should be a severe disincentive to industries importing raw materials but we have not yet succeeded here in <Col N="1407" /> processing our agricultural produce to the degree to which we should process it and exporting it to the great centres of population.  Erin Foods are making an effort in that direction but it is no secret that profitability is in question there.  I hope it will be successful.  I would wish that every possible effort would be made by the Government to encourage this major effort capitalwise and every other way.  There does not seem to have been any great attempt at that.  Indeed, where an effort has been made, it is regrettable that there have been a few failures.</P>
    <P>Grants should be graded and the greater grant given to those prepared to manufacture from native raw materials.  We must also have a much greater examination of opportunities abroad.  That is very necessary.  Córas Tráchtála are doing a good job and the Minister indicated in his Estimate that there will be an examination by a specialist firm of our industrial potential.  We would also need a very specialised and comprehensive report of opportunities abroad particularly in relation to goods which have their roots in native raw materials.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned failure.  He mentioned 13 firms that had failed, representing four per cent and a sum of £499,000, and he suggested there were as many failures under the interParty Government.</P>

      <P>I do not want to find myself at variance with the Minister. Maybe I was a little hard on him a couple of days ago and I should make amends.  I should like to know who produced this scoreboard.  The question is what have been chalked up as failures?  The Minister indicated that failures amount to £499,000 or four per cent.</P>

      <P>I do not accept that. The Minister is mixing up the Undeveloped Areas Act with the Finance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act of 1956 and the Industrial Grants Act of the same year.  That is not a valid comparison. The best thing we can do is, I suppose, to part company on that. The figure of £499,000 is not a factual figure.  Chalked up on the scoreboard, there has not been any industry about which a final decision has not been taken: I do not know.  However, if you are to count up on the scoreboard of failures in the £499,000 cases where finalisation has not taken place, if you chalk up the Clones factory where the unfortunate contractor is waiting for £12,000&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I want to know if the file is not closed, which is exactly what has happened when the Minister produced his figure.  It is not counted up as a failure because, if such were so, a far greater sum than £499,000 would be involved.  We, on this side of the House, are quite prepared to accept the risk but we suggest that the degree of failures has been too high. The flexibility which has, in part, been injected into the grants and encouragement of industry by this Bill, is good. We suggest it is not good the whole way and that, in fact, inflexibility in the past was the cause of the high degree of failures.  If the Minister had designed this three or four years ago and introduced the degree of flexibility he is introducing now, these failures would be far fewer.</P>
      <P>The Minister says we are like the surgeon who never gives an opinion until after the operation.  Then he produces another medical term in the next sentence.  He refers to his diagnosis of the industrial grants situation. We do not want a diagnosis; we want a remedy.</P>

      <P>With regard to the Potez factory and the Minister's reference to the surgeon who never gives an opinion until after the operation and his assertion that he did not hear us say there should not have been a factory when it was first suggested, may I remind him that we on this side of the House are not on the inside and are not responsible for the situation?  It is the Minister's responsibility.  I will give him full marks for this: it is a sign of a good Minister when he accepts complete responsibility for his Department. However, it is his responsibility and nobody else's to see to it that the decisions made are right and proper. It is our right and our duty to say now: &ldquo;This does not look as if it will be a viable proposition.&rdquo;  However, it would not be right nor would it be proper or correct of us, when a project is first mooted and when we know no more than we see in the <Col N="1410" /><i>Evening Herald</i> or perhaps in the <i>Evening Press,</i> to produce opinions while the Minister and his advisers in An Foras Tionscal and other places have files available to them on the subject as thick as their wrists.  We are not meant to be soothsayers and fortune-tellers or to decide whether an industry is good, bad or indifferent, judging by the scanty knowledge an Opposition may have.  It is the Minister's pigeon: he can shoot it.  It is not ours.  It is our duty merely to comment on legislation and to suggest other legislation which it is felt should be introduced; this we have done.</P>
      <P>This measure is half the way we have to go and, in that context, we welcome it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be very brief because I think the subject has been very adequately covered by the Minister and Deputy Donegan.  Of course we approve of the decision now taken in the Bill before the House. However, there are a few matters on which I should like to comment. It does appear that the Minister is now attempting to come into line with Northern Ireland and to regain the position we had when we were able to compete because, over the past six or 12 months, Northern Ireland was, in fact, swiping industries which might have come here but for the change in the legislation down there.  I hope this will remedy the position.</P>
      <P>I am rather disturbed about the situation regarding industrial adaptation. As the Minister now says, there is a big upsurge in applications from people who want to adapt their factories. Is the Minister satisfied that present finances will be adequate for requirements?  Is there a danger that there will now be a rush by people to do something which they should have been doing for some years past but particularly in the past six months? The Minister may find himself in financial difficulty in this regard.  The matter requires immediate attention if that is so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While it is all right to talk about the success of the Shannon Development Area, which is at present being considered, the Minister will need to be <Col N="1411" /> very careful that, in putting the accent on this type of development, he does not perhaps accidentally affect existing industry.  We do not want to see any more ghost towns.  Because of the setting up of a development area, we do not want to see workers and industry being channelled away from areas where their families have lived for many generations.  There is a danger of that if the matter is pursued too far. The Minister will have to be very careful about the siting of these industrial areas.  I know that the temptation to plant one of them in out-of-the-way places where there is no other type of employment must be very great.  The Minister should make use of the information which was made available as a result of an OECD survey which proved, a few years ago, that, no matter how well an industry may be established in an out-of-the-way place, there is a great danger that, because of lack of social amenities to which workers and, indeed, the management of the factory have been used and because of the extreme difficulty in getting proper housing accommodation, unless a town is built up around the actual industry, that type of industry is inclined gradually to close down.</P>
    <P>It is true that in France, Germany and, indeed, in a number of other central European countries, in particular, quite a number of industries closed within a period of two to three years of their start, even though it appeared at the time of their initiation that they were bound to be successful.  The only possible explanation was that they were in such an out-of-the-way place that the people were not prepared to stay there.  Because of the high incidence of unemployment in this country, it may be felt that perhaps that cannot happen.  While we agree with Deputy Donegan's theory that if you cannot find a job in Leitrim, then the next best thing is a job in Sligo or elsewhere, nevertheless, if the Government continue with the system of setting up industry they should, as far as possible, try to keep the people to be employed there in their own area.</P>
    <P>I entirely agree with the sentiments of Deputy Donegan about the accent on native material and particularly <Col N="1412" /> agricultural material.  I mentioned on the Minister's Estimate, and I repeat, that the big trouble in this country is that we have been trying to set up industry mainly with working materials which have to be imported, manufactured and re-exported.  If we can use native materials and particularly try to use the products of the land, including fruit, vegetables and other crops, and timber, there is some hope of success and there is not the danger of an upset abroad which may close down these artificial factories which have been set up in many places and which do not seem to survive.</P>
    <P>There are certain very notable exceptions but in general there is far greater hope for industries based on native material.  The Government should not be ashamed to subsidise them, if necessary, until they get a good hold.  It is too bad that some of those in existence do not seem to be going so well.  There must be some solution to the problem.  The management or somebody else must be making mistakes.  It is too bad that the beet sugar industry does not seem to be going well, that the beet acreage and production seem to be dropping unless we import certain types of raw material.  If the Government are really serious about industrialisation, they must find a solution for the ills of existing industries.</P>
    <P>Another point I should like to make is that attention must be given to numerous small industries, particularly in rural Ireland, that have been carrying on with a small labour force and small output for a long time.  Sometimes it is a business that has been in the family for generations and they have not been able to increase output or labour content because they cannot get money.  One criticism I have of Foras Tionscal is that they seem to be very careful about assisting people like this who want to improve their industry and employ more and more men.  The number of forms sent to such industrialists, the queries put to them and the investigation carried out before eventually they get a stencilled letter telling them that for one reason or another, they do not qualify&mdash;all this is a poor encouragement to people <Col N="1413" /> attempting to improve themselves and their families and provide work for the neighbouring workers anxious to find employment.  An effort might be made in this Bill to reverse this tendency and change the emphasis.</P>
    <P>While County Louth, for instance, has been particularly successful in getting industries, County Meath does not share that good fortune.  The other day I spoke about the strong Deputies, strong backbenchers and strong Opposition members, and that applies very well here because in Louth we have the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister and an active Deputy in Opposition and Louth has got&mdash;and I compliment them on it&mdash;quite an amount of industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy himself not active?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>But I would need the assistance of an active Minister and perhaps an active Parliamentary Secretary to achieve what I want.  We had an opportunity some time ago of getting a fishmeal factory in Mornington and for some reason it became literally bogged down, although even the land was bought and everything seemed to be going well. Even Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries in neighbouring counties were making statements about what they were doing to get it established. But it seems to have disappeared. Perhaps the Minister would try to have used to a greater extent, as was mentioned earlier, the produce of the sea.</P>
      <P>I still believe that if we are to give assistance grants to industrialists outside the country, the onus should be on the Government to insist on having a nominee of the State on the board running the company because so far the pattern has been that those people are able to do what they like and apparently no report is made to the Department and eventually they move off and the first information the Government have of the position is when notification is sent that the factory is closing down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not intend to delay the House any longer.  I agree that the intentions <Col N="1414" /> of the Bill are good and I hope the results we get when it becomes law will be equally good.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I also hope the intentions are good and that the results will be better.  As regards siting of industries in my area in Galway, I should like to add my word of commendation and assure the Minister that this will get full co-operation from the people of Galway.  The matter was discussed recently in connection with city planning and I had the pleasure of proposing its acceptance, with one reservation which I should like to bring to the Minister's attention.</P>
      <P>The site is on the east bank of the Corrib and there is quite a large labour force on the west bank and we have only a few bridges cluttered up with traffic at present.  Must we bring that volume of labour across town day in, day out because that is where you must get a lot of labour from?  While accepting that heavy industry should be sited as is proposed and accepted by the corporation, the Minister and the Department should bear in mind the importance of bringing the mountain to Mahomed instead of bringing Mahomed to the mountain.  That could be done by siting some light industries on the west bank of the Corrib.  There is great trouble with traffic in every city and we shall only aggravate the situation by putting all our eggs in one basket.</P>
      <P>I have seen factories open with a flourish in my own town and I have seen them close without as much as a wink.  I feel the Minister should have some grip on these industries.  He should put somebody on the factory floor to see how the money is being spent.  Were we just shovelling out money to foreigners who came here and disappeared overnight because we had no grip on them?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy were as long in public life as I am, he would know what I mean.  Closings of this kind cause a lot of suspicion among the workers and the air of suspicion is bad for the future of industry.  There are complaints from long-established industries in my area&mdash;I can give my young friend a good deal of information on this if he wants it&mdash;who have applied for grants to renovate their factories and were turned down.  They felt the only thing against them was that they are Irish.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very suspicious, especially as they have seen so many foreigners come and go.  They themselves were allowed to close down, even though they used Irish raw material. Such things are allowed to happen.  I welcome the renting of factories because I feel we have a certain grip on these industries and can tell them to get out if they are failures and we can hope to replace them.  As it is, we have not that grip.</P>
      <P>It is amusing to recall that the Minister for Transport and Power, in replying to a question I raised in this House in connection with the Potez industry in my constituency, said the reason for their difficulties was that the winter was too mild to sell oil heaters. Surely it is not when the winter is there that we buy oil heaters?  I am not decrying this industry because they are producing quite a good article but there was a failure, and I should like to point out to the Minister that he should have somebody on the floors of these factories so that we would know what is happening.  There was a flop in regard to salesmanship.  That is where the industry failed.  They piled the stuff up.  There were 38,000 of the finest heaters that could be got but there was no sale because of failure in that respect.  I am glad to note that they hope to make a start on a newer type of burner.  I wish the factory well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1416" /> As far as Galway is concerned, I can assure the Minister that while I am on a local body, he will get every co-operation because there was never more need for industry, having regard to the continued strain on the mailboat train day in, day out, leaving Galway. Young men have been asked to come home to work in some of the factories in Galway.  They broke up their homes in England and came back and had to break up their homes again and return to England.  These men will not come back again while such things are happening.  I should like the Minister to ensure that where money is given, it will be properly spent for the common good.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join in the welcome on behalf of the people of Galway for this decision of the Government to set up industrial estates. It has been a very wise choice to select Galway as one of the areas for the setting up of these estates initially. The availability of labour in the city of Galway is quite small but there is a large labour potential in the area within a 30-mile radius of the city.  The success of the estates would bring back to the city many emigrants who are now working in industrial areas in Manchester, Birmingham, Coventry and Liverpool.  It is a pity that these young people have to go away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have suggested on other occasions, every encouragement should be given to the development of growth centres and Galway has proved over the last ten to 15 years that it is a natural growth centre and a place where money can be wisely spent, where there is a great chance of success because the right type of people would be attracted to live there.  It is a nice place in which to live, having every modern amenity, without being too big. This is important if you have to try to hold executives and other people in a district.  Galway has the amenities for every class of person who would like to come in and work there.  Certainly, those who have come from America, Germany and other continental countries have been very pleased with Galway. These reasons may seem small but they are very important when a <Col N="1417" /> man is moving his family in order to set up in a new place.  Persons who have come there have always settled in with the people of Galway very easily and have been very welcome there.</P>
    <P>The setting up of these industrial estates will help to eliminate a lot of red tape attached to applications for industrial grants and also a lot of the ground work which must be carried out.  When a man decides to set up a factory in an area such as Galway, he has to purchase a site which must be in proximity to water and sanitary services.  Such services must be available and must be adequate.  Otherwise, the cost of development of the site will be very expensive.</P>
    <P>Design construction and other such work and especially dealings with Government Departments tend to delay, sometimes for three or four years, before a factory can get into production. I know several cases where people have fought shy of involving themselves in such complications and rather than set up in Galway and other places outside Dublin have not set up at all.  The industrial estates are the answer, where ready-made factories are available and all a person has to do is to decide to set up a factory and the premises will be rented to him, with all services laid on, and he can be in production as soon as the machinery is installed.  In the other cases that I have mentioned that may not happen for three years from the time of the initial decision to set up a factory.  The time taken to instal the machinery may be six months, making a delay of three to four years before actual production can start.</P>
    <P>I would again appeal to the Minister and his officials to try to be of far greater assistance and to be more willing to adopt business-like methods when dealing with business people and not continually to quote regulations to them which, as I said on the Estimate, are absolutely meaningless to a man who feels that he is wasting time dealing with Government officials when it would be much better for him to be in his factory looking after his workers and keeping up production schedules and trying to meet order dates.  A great deal of time is wasted <Col N="1418" /> dealing with import licences and reexport licences and applying for grants. There is a great deal of red tape.  It would be of great assistance if some decent effort were made to get down to work.</P>
    <P>The Minister has stated that there would be a tendency in connection with these industrial estates to attract industries which might not be located in Ireland at all but for the facilities offered at these estates.  That statement is rather dangerous and I should like the Minister to explain it further when he is replying.  If that type of wording is given into the hands of officials they will say, &ldquo;This factory would be here anyway and we will not allow them into the industrial estate.&rdquo;  They read some of these statements too literally, drawing only one meaning out of them, not being flexible.  I would hate to think that industrial estates were being set up only to attract industries which otherwise would not be located in Ireland.  There are in Galway several progressive industrialists, people who over the years have developed markets, expanded production, installed new machinery, increased employment, on very small sites.  I have gone through many of these factories and find that they are piecemeal, men working in one shed, other men working in another shed and finding it difficult to produce as economically as some of their opponents in business can produce in modern factories.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to let me know whether those industrialists who are already in Galway and who find themselves hampered by the smallness of the sites that they at present occupy will be considered if they make application for a factory bay when the estate is ready?  Are the Government prepared to rent these factories to such people whom we know to be efficient and to be manufacturing goods which are marketable and who could possibly double their output and employment if some assistance were given to them by way of renting these factory bays to them?  I want to know, are our own people to be denied these modern facilities?  Are they being made available only for foreigners?</P>

      <P>The Deputy has already made his statement.  I should like that point to be answered by the Minister, if at all possible.</P>
      <P>There is another which I also mentioned briefly on the Estimate for Industry and Commerce.  A decision was made to set up an industrial estate in Galway.  What do we find?  The job of designing the estate was given to a firm on the east coast of Ireland.  I do not want to specify the particular place. Probably Dublin.  I am not sure.  That was a terrible blunder, a type of blunder that has been going on for far too long.  It is time some change was made.  If qualified professional people living in the west of Ireland are to be overlooked in the matter of important projects, a great deal of the talk about assisting undeveloped areas would not seem to make sense.</P>
      <P>We have put up with this for some time.  We are determined to make a stand on it now.  The men who live in the west of Ireland are competent and highly qualified and their competence cannot be questioned by anybody.  Their buildings and work are there for everybody to see.  Why should they be overlooked when they are rearing families in the west of Ireland?  However, when the big plum comes, it is handed over to people living on the east coast.  I would ask the Minister to consider this seriously because we will continue this pressure until we see the result of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he is aware of the growing recession in the private building sector which is likely to result in a severe fall in employment during the year; whether he is contemplating the introduction of any measures which would restore the volume of private house building; and if he will make a statement outlining his plans to meet the present situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaugeBrennan" hpid="Mr. P. Brennan Mr. P. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that in recent months there have been indications of a slackening in the rate of grant allocations for new private houses.  According to my Department's records, however, activity is still at a high level as evidenced by the fact that the total number of grants for new houses fully paid in March-April this year was 1,223 which is equivalent to an annual rate of over 7,000 houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amount of capital for house purcation <Col N="1423" /> chase loans provided by the Government in 1965-66 was £4.39 million.  The amount provided in the current financial year is £4.85 million.  In addition the amount provided this year for State grants for private housing is higher than last year.  These figures represent record provisions from public funds for these purposes.  In addition, I have been notified by the principal lending agencies engaged in housing finance that the amount of capital they hope to provide is about £11.5 million in the current year compared with £11.3 million last year.</P>
    <P>In effect, therefore, the provision of capital for house purchase loans from these sources in the current financial year, amounting to about £16.35 million as against £15.69 million last year, should be sufficient, other things being equal, to finance output at or about last year's record level&mdash;especially if, as I have requested them, local authorities give priority to the financing of new, rather than old, houses from their allocation for house purchase loans.</P>

In the main, what he says is that we have the same level of financial assistance as last year but the fact is there is a standstill in housing in different parts of the country.  Whilst Dublin is not yet in a serious position, we can already see signs of a slackening.</P>

Does he appreciate the fact that no matter what transport system is laid on at Donore, most of the pupils at present attending the Knockcommon school will attend the school closest to them which would be very far from Donore?

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Before Question Time, I was making the point that the services of professional people in the west of Ireland should be availed of when large schemes are being built in the west of Ireland.  I could give an instance of a young man setting out on his career.  After getting his leaving certificate and his matriculation he decides to become an engineer or an architect.  He may come from a well off family or from a very poor family because we have excellent educational facilities in the West, and education is denied to no one living in the city because the university is so near.  He chooses which career he wants to follow, qualifies, probably gets some experience abroad, and then has to decide where he will set up in Ireland. At the moment he would be a fool to set up west of the Shannon, because these jobs are always given to professionally qualified people who have set themselves up on the east coast.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have to travel 132 miles to attend the Dáil.  One gets the impression that <Col N="1434" /> some of the people in this House feel that Ireland ends at Chapelizod.  It does not.  When I am there, I have still 130 miles to travel before I get to Galway.  My reason for making this case, and for probably labouring it, is due in some way to the difficulties that have arisen already over the industrial estate in Galway.  I refer to the difficulty in siting it.  An outside firm has been appointed which must travel 132 miles to see the site for the first time.  If we had a local man he would know it without leaving his office.</P>
    <P>Now they have decided that the ground where they were asked to try to put it is not suitable; that it is uneven. To anyone in the city of Galway, that is a ridiculous statement, and especially in view of the heavy earth-moving machinery that is available, it is no obstacle whatever.  The worst feature is that a road passing through this site is also being given as an excuse for not availing of this site at Mervue.  Everyone in the city of Galway knows that this road is not important and should be taken away if it is interfering with the development of this site as an industrial estate.  As well as that, they are now going to the Headford Road side of the town which will bring the estate a mile away from the biggest housing estate, and heavy road or rail traffic to and from this proposed estate will have to go across the city and interfere with city traffic.</P>
    <P>These things would never have arisen if a person who knew the environment had been dealing with the matter.  They could be thrashed out in one day.  Now letters have to go up and down between Galway and Dublin, and things are held up for weeks and weeks.  We badly need industrial employment in the city.  We feel it is a shame that our young people have to go away.  We do not want that situation to continue.  We welcome this move.  The Government cannot solve every problem, and they are going a long way towards solving this, but we would be much further on the way to solving it if local people were employed on this scheme.  At no time has their competence been questioned.</P>
    <P>I should also like to welcome the <Col N="1435" /> extension of the time limit for the adaptation grants up to 31st December, 1967.  I wholeheartedly agree with the Minister's statement that many people did not take this too seriously, but with the signing of the Free Trade Area Agreement between Ireland and Britain they began to see things more clearly. I hope this will spur them on to avail of the adaptation grants despite some remarks made by another Deputy from the city of Galway of a different political persuasion from mine, that firms in Galway turned down adaptation grants.  I wish to say that this is not the true position.  I have spoken with those people.  Their only complaint is the difficulty in negotiating the grants.  A great amount of time-wasting procedure goes on before the grant is sanctioned. If this could in some way be speeded up, it would eventually improve our production and create more employment in the country.  There is a great wastage of time in Government offices which causes a great wastage of time and money at factory floor level.</P>
    <P>I would like to repeat something which I said on the main Estimate, that is, that special emphasis must be laid on raw materials when people are being enticed to set up factories in Ireland.  I can give the case of somebody coming in here to make pots and pans out of aluminium.  They must import sheet aluminium and the only employment is in the factory itself. We should use raw materials which we have in our own country, particularly agricultural products.  This would give greater employment in the country itself because you would have employment once the seed goes into the ground.  This would then double the employment for the same export figures.  This is very essential but it has not been emphasised enough.  It does not seem to have been recognised so far.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of industrialisation to be considered, particularly in view of the fact that an industrial estate is to be set up in Galway, is the tremendous importance which should be attached to the fishing industry.  Anybody who has made a study of the fishing <Col N="1436" /> industry knows that the biggest section of employment is not out in the boats catching fish; it is in the factory on the land where the fish is processed. We have at the moment 15 boats operating from the harbour of Galway. Most of them just come in to deliver their fish.  We have a fish factory on the shore which employs well over 70 boys and girls.  The employment in that factory is twice the employment on the sea.  If emphasis could be laid on developing those products which we can produce here in Ireland, particularly agricultural products, greater employment would be given.  It is employment which counts as far as everybody is concerned.  It is only fair to say that.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister is anxious to increase employment through industrialisation. There was a small point mentioned by Deputy Coogan and I would like to say something about it. He referred to the setting up of the industrial estate on the west bank.  He must have missed the whole point.  In an industrial estate, all the factory buildings are grouped together for good reasons and not scattered all over the place.  We do not want the industrial estate on the west side of the Corrib because we have a far greater industry there.  We have the tourist industry in Salthill on the west side of the Corrib.  I would like the Minister to forget about the suggestion made by Deputy Coogan.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Donegan raised the point as <Col N="1437" /> to why retrospection which was in the original scheme for adaptation grants is not now included.  The answer is that retrospection was necessary because the announcement about retrospection was made some time before it was possible to have legislation passed.  Since it was urgent to encourage manufacturers in industry generally to start at once, retrospection was included in the legislation to allow for work done before the legislation came in.  No such condition exists now. Everybody should be aware that 31st March was the last date for applications and the fact that we have extended it for some applications of retrospection makes it difficult in deciding, especially when the work is finished a long time ago, what the adaptations are for normal renewal.</P>
    <P>I think the House is generally agreed on the value of premises for renting.  I am quite convinced that this is an added incentive to industry.</P>
    <P>Deputy Molloy has some worry with regard to whether local professional men will be employed by the industrial estate in Galway.  There may be other industrial estates and it is natural that the general overall planning should be the central function.  The people locally are already aware that what work can be given locally will be given.  I do not think the Deputy would expect to have all this type of work decentralised, especially when it is part of a major scheme.  As I say, any work that can be given to the people locally will be given.</P>
    <P>Deputy Molloy said that industries in Galway were being handicapped, with regard to grants, by red tape.  If the Deputy has any examples of some unnecessary red tape, I should be glad to hear of them.  We must have some regulations in law with regard to those matters.  I am sure the Deputy will, on reflection, realise that most of the limitations we put on imports are for the benefit of employment here at home and for the protection of native industries and native employment.  All the Deputies who spoke referred to the use of native raw material and about the amount of grants given.  An Foras Tionscal has regard to the amount of employment given and the use given to raw materials.  I would like <Col N="1438" /> to say that Deputies speak sometimes as if we are rejecting factories based on raw materials, as if we are selecting factories solely on the basis of imported raw materials.  This is not so. We select factories which have a good chance of success, particularly based on raw materials.  I think this covers most of the points raised.</P>
