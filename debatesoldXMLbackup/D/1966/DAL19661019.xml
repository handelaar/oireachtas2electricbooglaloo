      <P>The examination of the draft amended pension scheme in consultation with the Minister for Finance, as provided for under section 44 of the Transport Act, 1950, has now been completed and I am authorising CIE to publish in the press the usual statutory notice of intention to amend the scheme.  On expiration of the statutory period for submitting representations and subject to any such representations that may be received, I propose to make the necessary Orders confirming the amendment.  I should say that the Orders, when approved, will have retrospective effect to April, 1963.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>No specific proposals of this kind have been received in my Department.  As the majority of countries including Ireland have subscribed to the International Air Services Transit Agreement under which their airlines have the right to land for non-traffic purposes in the airports of participating countries, no prior permission for use of Shannon as a refuelling stop would be required in most cases.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power what progress had been made by Bord Fáilte with their farm holiday scheme; and if he can, from experience to date, indicate the future prospects of this particular type of holiday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The promotion of farmhouse holidays was introduced by <Col N="1527" /> Bord Fáilte in 1964 when 64 farmhouses offering 240 bedrooms were included in the Board's list of supplementary accommodation.  The progress of the scheme to date can be judged by the fact that for 1967 there will be 230 premises on the farmhouse list with almost 1,000 bedrooms.  Bord Fáilte expect that by 1970, 600 farmhouses will be providing almost 2,500 bedrooms for holidaymakers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not have off the cuff the rotation of the inspection work that takes place.  I would have to let the Deputy know.  The Regional Tourist Board's managers and staff are looking for this accommodation and send lists to Bord Fáilte, and Bord Fáilte send their regular team of inspectors around the country, but the date on which a particular inspector might arrive in a given area I would not know.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not think it desirable for Bord Fáilte to introduce a scheme of special grants to farmers who are willing to provide accommodation of this type?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The scheme of accommodation grants has been extended in recent years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Irish Estates Limited was wound up late in 1964 but its wholly owned and controlled subsidiary company Irish Estates (Construction) Limited continues to operate, its name having been changed to Irish Estates (Management) Limited and its ownership and control having been transferred to the Irish Life Assurance Company Limited.</P>
      <P>The directors of the management company are its secretary and two officials of the Irish Life Assurance Company, none of whom served as a director of Irish Estates Limited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Messrs. Griffin, Lynch and Company who were the auditors of Irish Estates Limited from the date of its incorporation continued to hold that position until the company was wound <Col N="1529" /> up.  They have also been the auditors of Irish Estates (Management) Limited since its incorporation as Irish Estates (Construction) Limited and they continue to hold that position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware that a child, who is legally adopted under the laws of another country, is treated as a stranger in blood for the purposes of estate and legacy duty; and if he will consider amending the law to cover such cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Adoption is not relevant to the question of estate duty. The rate of estate duty is determined solely by the value of the total estate passing on death.</P>
      <P>The rate at which legacy duty or succession duty is chargeable is, however, determined by the relationship of the beneficiary to the predecessor. For the purpose of these duties a person adopted under Irish law is treated as lawful issue of the adopters.  Adoption under the laws of any other country has not this effect.</P>
      <P>I do not propose to introduce amending legislation on the lines which the Deputy appears to have in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister received any representations in the matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot recall that I have and I have not been notified that any representations are on record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not consider, where a person has been adopted abroad by people resident abroad and who later become resident and domiciled here, recognising the adoption for the purposes of legacy and succession duties?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The adoption laws differ in other countries.  Our adoption laws are very stringent.  If the adoption laws in the foreign country were very loose and capable of changing the relationship between the adopter and the adopted, there would be a complication so far as the rights of succession <Col N="1530" /> and intestacy, for example, would be involved, and therefore unless there was a code in the foreign country exactly similar to ours, it would be difficult to apply the same rights in respect of legacy and succession duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the position is that where a person has been adopted under the laws of another country and the adopting parents come to reside here and want to pass an estate subsequently to the adopted child, they are liable for the full duty and do not come under ordinary legacy duties?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so, but legacy and succession duties are chargeable only at the rate of one per cent and affect estates only in excess of £15,000. Lineal ancestors of the property owner who dies are relieved of the one per cent duty under a recent Finance Act.  I am suggesting to the Deputy that the one per cent obligation is not a very onerous burden for a person who is adopting a child under foreign laws.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely it would be ten per cent if the adoption is not recognised?  It is bound to be ten per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that, irrespective of the amount involved, there would be discrimination against the child adopted under the laws of another country? Surely he would agree that this is most undesirable?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty is that adoption laws abroad are not the same as ours, which are very stringent, and I think the Irish people would want them that way.  It could be that the relationship would be changed under some foreign laws and that would have effect on the adopter and adopted at the time of succession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister say in such a case if such a child could be readopted under Irish law?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a provision whereby under section 39 of the Finance Act of 1960 a person under a <Col N="1531" /> certain age could not be adopted legally in this country and that provision could apply abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>At the passage of the Act only?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, at the passage of the Adoption Act.  That is true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that it would not be necessary to interfere with the Adoption Act and that an amendment of the Finance Act would cover this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I expect that would be the case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">

      <P>Is the Minister aware that Cork County Council invited tenders for the Clonakilty scheme last February and that these tenders remain unopened in the council offices at Clonakilty, due to the fact that the <Col N="1534" /> Minister made it clear that money would not be forthcoming for the implementation of this scheme?  Is he also aware that, so far as the other schemes are concerned, they have been approved by the council's technical advisers and that his statement is just an excuse for not implementing the scheme?  Surely, in view of the Minister's statement last week that large schemes approved by his Department would be executed and that there would be no hold-up as far as money was concerned, he will now release the Clonakilty scheme for which tenders were received last February?</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that the county council made a special request in the case of the Clonakilty regional scheme, which is a very big one, for approval for the commencement of work on it this year? Probably the scheme will be spread over a number of years and further money might be made available in next year's and the following year's Estimates.  Would the Minister not agree, having regard to the fact that contractors at great inconvenience and expense tendered for the scheme, which is to cost over £½ million, that it is only fair that their tenders should be opened and considered?  Would he consider giving the council approval for the scheme financially?  The Minister is not replying.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he is aware of the unreasonable increase in rents of houses by Offaly County Council under a scheme of rent revision; and that in many cases increases were in the region of £1 to 30/- per week; if he will take action in view of the poor circumstances of many of the tenants who find that the houses are not worth the severe rents now charged; and if he will conduct a public inquiry with a view to cancellation of the increases notified to the tenants, as otherwise they will have to leave the houses and no other accommodation is available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that Offaly County Council, at a meeting held in June last, approved certain proposals in relation to the rents charged for 98 houses let on graded <Col N="1537" /> rents and 36 houses on fixed rents and confirmed this decision at a meeting held earlier this week.</P>
      <P>In so far as the houses let on graded rents are concerned, the council's decision was to the effect that the rent payable by each tenant should be based on his current income rather than on his income as at the date he was first appointed as tenant.  The proportion of income which tenants are required to pay in rent under the graded scheme is, in general, less than one-tenth.</P>
      <P>In so far as the fixed-rent tenants are concerned, the council's decision was to transfer them to a similar scheme of graded rents.</P>
      <P>Under existing law, my consent is required only to the decision of the council in regard to the fixed-rent tenants, and, in this connection, I am drawing their attention to the statement in my Department's circular letter of 30th March last that in cases where a revised rent would represent a large increase in the existing rent of particular tenants, the rents might be adjusted by stages over a period until the appropriate point on their rental scale is reached.</P>
      <P>I do not consider that any grounds exist for holding a public inquiry into this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>As already <Col N="1541" /> announced, I had a discussion earlier this week with the British Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food about trade in livestock and meat.  The prices for Irish store cattle, store sheep and store lambs fattened in the UK and for exports to the UK of 25,000 tons of Irish carcase beef and 5,500 tons of Irish carcase lamb per annum are already linked to the guaranteed prices payable to British producers. These arrangements, which cover the bulk of our exports of cattle, sheep and lambs in all forms to Britain, provide a valuable measure of support for market prices here even when, as has recently been the case, the international market for cattle and beef may be weak.</P>
      <P>At my meeting with Mr. Peart we discussed the causes of the weakness of the market and considered the possibilities for the future, which it is generally accepted offer good long-term prospects for beef.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>As we have guaranteed to give to the British market so many head of cattle each year, does the Minister not think it reasonable that in return we should have some guaranteed floor price for such supplies and does he not consider that the fact that there is no guaranteed floor price is responsible for the present disastrous situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The corollary to our undertaking in the Free Trade Agreement to use our best endeavours to supply 680,000 head of cattle each year to the UK market is that the three months waiting period was reduced to two months, thereby linking the Irish store animal as closely as possible to the British guaranteed payments system.</P>

While prices next spring will depend largely on export market conditions at that time, they will, of course, benefit from our export support arrangements, namely, the subsidy on export of carcase beef and lamb to Britain, which supports the prices of fat cattle, sheep and lambs here, and the link with the British Fatstock Guarantee Scheme which supports the price of our store cattle, sheep and lambs.</P>

I suggested this was something the Commission in Brussels must have regard to, the very serious disruptive effect of these tariffs and levies imposed by the EEC countries on traditional suppliers of livestock products like us.  I would hope that regard would be had to our vital interests in this matter by the Commission in Brussels and by the governments of the member countries.  This is why I regard the concession by the German Government in taking, free of levy and duty, 2,000 of our cattle <Col N="1546" /> under the Interzonal Arrangement, as a very important and significant concession.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>As already announced, the purpose of my visit to Spain last week was to discuss agricultural trade matters with Spanish Ministers with particular reference to market prospects for Irish exports of cattle and beef.  During my visit to Madrid, I had useful discussions with the Spanish Minister for Commerce and the Spanish Minister for Agriculture on trade prospects and as a result I am satisfied that Spain will provide a continuing and expanding import market for beef.  The <Col N="1548" /> Spanish system of purchasing; which is operated through a State agency, presents some problems but if these can be overcome and provided that we can meet the price terms quoted by our competitors, there is a reasonable chance of securing some business.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasOHara" hpid="Mr. O'Hara Mr. O'Hara">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not make a more clear-cut statement on his visit to Spain?  The reply he has given is very vague.  Does he not recall that quite recently when I put down a similar question and I told him that cattle and sheep were unsaleable at fairs he said the question was a stupid question?  In view of the thousands of marchers in this city today, does the Minister now realise that my question was not a stupid question, as he alleged?</P>

      <P>The awarding of these scholarships is a matter primarily for the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the second part of the supplementary question, I have had discussion with the students directly and I do not think this facet was unduly worrying them. The position is as stated.  I quote from the minutes of the meeting of the Vocational Education Committee that in November, 1965 they decided that that would be the final year for that type of scholarship.  Then we were informed by the principal officer of the committee that the former scheme which was replaced was considered by the committee to be an unsatisfactory one because it provided that pupils who obtained the highest marks, irrespective of whether they succeeded in reaching a satisfactory standard or not, were awarded scholarships.  There was great objection to this in the past and this new scheme seems to have got more or less universal acceptance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is aware that no part of the grant is paid until the full investment by the private side has been made.  Therefore, the question of relating the grant to the progress made by the industry is not as simple as it may appear.  The estimated progress is calculated on a certain investment.  To attain that investment, the private side must put in all its own money, and then the State puts in its money.  As will be clear from the reply, there are certain stages for the State investment.  The question of whether any more money will be paid depends on whether the firm is entitled legally to be paid it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I was remarking last night that it appears to me that the only satisfactory way in which we can deal with social welfare is, once and for all, to depart from this hit or miss attitude to it.  We should rescue the entire subject of social welfare from eve of poll messages and from the hurly-burly of politics and put it squarely as a priority of Government policy.  To do that, it is essential to tabulate the problem in all its complexity, at first at any rate.  Other countries have developed their policy fully in social welfare and framed their policies to deal with it on a comprehensive basis.  Our policies do not correlate with each other and do not add up to a comprehensive system of social welfare.</P>
      <P>It is only a few years since social welfare was discovered by our conservative Parties&mdash;who, up to then, had turned a very blind eye on it&mdash;to be a rich field for vote-catching.  Our present social welfare arrangements are due much more to this vote-catching potential than to a social conscience on the part of the Government.  Until some years ago, there was general agreement among the major political Parties in this House that the foundation of our social welfare system should chiefly be the concern of the family.  In other words, the family was to be the unit most concerned with looking after the welfare of its members in old age or in childhood.  For many years, we attacked that idea.  We suggested that this attitude was fundamentally dishonest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us consider a family of five or six children where the wage is £10 a week, or less.  Such a family could not be expected to look after an aged grandfather or grandmother.  We suggested that it was the State's job to look after its citizens who are in distress. We must map out at what point in his lifetime a citizen most needs State help.  One point is old age and here we suggest that the present limit for old age pension purposes should be <Col N="1563" /> reduced.  At 65 years, a person is as old from the point of view of earning his living as any civilised society would deem him to be.</P>
    <P>We consider that there has not been sufficient examination of the life of the average family to graph the points at which such a family would need State help.  Health is a factor which comes into this question of social welfare and the facilities the State should provide in that connection.  I find that such a general examination of the points at which an average family needs State help has not yet been made in this country.</P>
    <P>Sometimes one hears talk of the poverty that exists in our midst.  Until we make a comprehensive examination of all factors of social welfare, we shall not be enabled to overcome these areas of poverty which exist in Dublin city and in other parts of the country.  It is astonishing that some people still affect to be surprised when they come across people in our community who appear to be literally starving, who are going without the necessaries of life and who apparently die without the comfort of friends or unnoticed by their neighbours. Such events are still too common in our country.  Until we mount a national campaign against poverty, it will remain the lot of many of our people.</P>
    <P>One cannot take up a newspaper any day without reading a report, for example, of an old person who has died without any friends or concern as to his or her fate.  That sort of thing can happen in a large country but it should not happen in a small country such as ours where we pride ourselves that the bonds of intimacy and of our rural background are not conducive to such a state of affairs.  That such things can happen in a small country such as ours is a disgrace.  We can understand the position in large industrialised societies which, by their very nature, are anonymous and in which citizens may not have the traditional good-neighbour policy towards one another, but it is quite astonishing that in a small, intimate country such as ours we should have this problem. <Col N="1564" /> It is astonishing that we do not know where these pockets of poverty occur in our community.  I suggest that there is need for a real wind of change to blow through the corridors of Social Welfare.  I suggest that there is need to develop a new attitude towards this problem in order to banish for all time the idea that social welfare carries with it the taint of relief.</P>
    <P>Social welfare should be seen to be the citizen's right.  Social welfare, properly understood, should connote a redistribution of the national wealth for the benefit of those most in need. Looking at it from that point of view, one sees it as an essential part of modern government policy but, until we co-ordinate all the bits and pieces of relief policy formed over the years, all the conglomeration of reliefs under the term social welfare, this problem will never be solved in a decisive fashion.  I should like to see social welfare lifted out of Party politics and removed entirely from the arena of Party politics, changed completely from what it has been in the past&mdash;a staple diet for politicians needing election. It is sad to have to say that, but it is true that social welfare has been a rich vote&mdash;catching device; all the candidate has to do is to refer to social welfare services, to widows and to orphans.</P>
    <P>I should prefer to see social welfare treated as a matter of serious Government policy.  I should like to see those unfortunates in our community in need of State assistance listed in order of priority and I should like to see agreement reached that these are the people who need this kind of help. Other countries have done that.  The communities we hope to join in the future have done it.  It is an unhappy position for us to discover that the only country with which we can claim parity from the point of view of our social welfare system is Portugal and Salazar's Portugal is surely not the country with which we would like to see ourselves compared.  At the moment it is the only one with which we can claim parity.</P>
    <P>Many people have queried over the past year this incomprehensible discontent  <Col N="1565" /> on the part of wage-earners and they have asked why they march and why they are involved in so many industrial disputes.  One of the elements in all this discontent is the knowledge on the part of these wage-earners of what is happening to their fathers and mothers in their old age. These old people have to survive on social welfare benefits and it cannot be expected that wage-earners will have any great loyalty to the society in which they live when they see the way in which that society deals with the aged.  There is a certain callousness in the present manner of administering social welfare.  When the wage-earners see the aged and the young treated as political stratagems in order to gain votes at election time, they cannot be expected to have any great allegiance to such a society.</P>
    <P>If we want to see the aged and those who are no longer engaged in productive work and the very young in receipt of their proper share&mdash;I have to use this much-abused term&mdash;of social assistance, some machinery will have to be devised whereby pensions and benefits will bear some relationship to the rate of increase granted to wage-earners and other pensioners. The Government talk about an incomes policy.  If there is to be such a policy, it will have to permeate every stratum of our society and pensions will have to bear some relationship to the salaries and incomes of other sections in the community.  The streets are full of marching men demonstrating about their incomes. The pensioners cannot march but that does not mean that we should not be aware of their plight and that we should not be engaged in evolving some solution to their problem.  At the moment under the present system they are looked upon as second-class citizens whose need is to be measured by the need of the Government in power for votes.</P>

There are larger questions that impinge and there is need to bring larger issues into our administration. However well the present system is administered, it is not the answer to tackling the real problem.  The way in which we have been tackling it is not satisfactory and will never provide a solution.  I suggest there should be a global outlook at the problems, leading to a comprehensive policy, and perhaps more money being made available.  If the Minister needs <Col N="1567" /> more money, if there is need for more taxation to provide more money for the Minister in order to enable him to help these particular people in our community, my Party will certainly not be reluctant to vote for such extra taxation.  But we will never solve the problem until we carry out a real examination.  The real objective should be an all-out war against poverty in our community.</P>

      <P>I will not delay Deputy Fitzpatrick.  Listening to Deputy O'Leary last night, I thought I would go along with him on many points. Like him and like most members of the House, I believe in the redistribution of national wealth in the fight against poverty until such time as we have abolished poverty.  Deputy O'Leary admonished what he called the conservative Parties in this House for their inattention to the old age pensioners.  I have no desire to make a political speech but I would remind Deputy O'Leary that his socialist Party gave the old age pensioners 2/6 in three years.  If that is the Labour Party's idea of socialism, I would prefer the Fianna Fáil type of socialism any time.  We have to realise that we have poverty and no matter what Party we are in, it is our duty to wage war on it until we have abolished it. We also have to appreciate what moneys are at our disposal and see how we can build up the economy so that we can pay adequate old age pensions to those who qualify for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dowling said last night that non-contributory pensions should be paid at 65 and this would be a good start towards paying pensions at an earlier age.  I would appeal to the Minister to consider this suggestion carefully.  I hope that next year he will be able to tell us that he can do this. I want now to refute once and for all Deputy O'Leary's suggestion that the <Col N="1569" /> State can do everything in this matter. We know that the State cannot do everything.  We are also reminded that in socialist countries the highest suicide rates are to be found among the more affluent groups of society.  We have been told that this is also the case in England and that the higher suicide rates are not in the poorer sections.</P>

I know that this pension, and the contributory pension, is pretty low and we look forward to this Party's tradition being maintained next year by an addition being granted.  I agree with the Deputy that we must examine the whole structure of our social services to see if we are making the best use of the moneys available to us.  About one-third of our Vote will go on administration and therefore the pensioners will be deprived of that amount.  We profess and believe in the Christian philosophy and teaching and therefore the onus is on us to act in accordance with our beliefs.</P>
      <P>I hope that we will never see the day when the State will take over all the social services.  It can play a very vital part and can ensure that nobody will starve to death, but if we are to bring the true Christian spirit to bear, it must be left in large measure to the charitable societies which are doing such tremendous work.  We must guard against the socialist tendency of regarding poor people as numbers on a Government file.  Many of these people feel that they are not wanted and they take a very poor view of the society in which they live if that is allowed to happen.  They should be made feel that they are wanted.  As members either of this House or of the public, we have a duty.</P>
      <P>Our first duty as Deputies is to explain to anybody in need what the State is prepared to give him.  It has been stated that people in need of help do not know what they can qualify for.  There is a booklet issued by the Department giving this information but Deputies who visit poorer areas know that these people do not read that booklet.  I know that Deputies do explain to the people what they are entitled to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we have to realise is that the greatest need in our society is an expansion of our social services.  If the State cannot do this, then we have all to shoulder our part of the burden and ensure that no person will want <Col N="1571" /> for food, housing or clothing.  We should remember that we have made tremendous strides and we should go on to seek a solution to these problems, not in a socialist sense, which has not brought happiness to the people who live under it, but under a philosophy which we would carve out for ourselves and by which the individual would be treated as an individual and not as a number on a card.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention a matter which was raised last night and which does not really come within the ambit of this debate, that is, the case to give old age pensioners subsidiary allowances such as free bus travel and so forth.  Dublin Corporation pressed for free bus services for old age pensioners and blind pensioners a few years ago. I was on the deputation which went to the management of CIE about this matter and they said they could not do it.  They suggested that higher pensions should be paid to the people and then they could afford to pay for their bus services.  That may be one answer.</P>
    <P>We have always felt that a man or woman who has reached the age of 70 probably served the country well and therefore deserved whatever comforts we can afford to provide. Whether we should give him higher pension in order that they can afford to pay for these services, or whether CIE should give them the free services and then be recouped by the taxpayer is not really the point.  We say that they are entitled to these services and either the Department of Social Welfare or CIE should say: &ldquo;All right; we recognise your right to this concession and we will give it&rdquo;.  CIE would probably say that they would lose money and would look for an extra subvention, but I do not think that anybody would quibble at the extra, small subvention if it were being used to provide these people with free travel.</P>
    <P>I did suggest to the Minister that through the use of good publicity he could ensure that the old age pensioners knew what they are entitled to. <Col N="1572" /> Any public representative spends all his time explaining to people what they are entitled to.  Perhaps we are not the best people to do it but the Minister could by use of our charitable organisations and newspapers bring home to people what they are entitled to and let them know that there are extra benefits to be obtained apart from the pension itself, such as rent allowance.  It would make the lot of our old people happier if we had those interim benefits before we get down to having a really comprehensive social policy for our old people.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister for the work he has done in the past in relation to recipients of social welfare.  I hope that in his statement next year he will go outside the fields he has already been in and ensure that the benefits will at least allow old age pensioners and blind pensioners to live in frugal comfort.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> Deputy Ryan, on behalf of this Party, dealt with the inadequacies of the present social welfare payments and put before the House our views and policy on social welfare.  I intend to confine my remarks to endeavouring to help the Minister to improve the condition of the social welfare classes within the framework of the present legislation until such time as the desirable standard of social welfare payments advocated by Deputy Ryan are brought about.</P>
      <P>I should like, in the first place, to deal with the question of old age pensioners and to put before the Minister some of the problems and difficulties which have come before me, both in my capacity as a Member of this House and in my professional capacity and to suggest to the Minister a relaxation in or a more sympathetic interpretation of the regulations under which the present scheme is operated.  A short time ago it transpired, in reply to a Parliamentary Question here, that contributory old age pensioners are not entitled to collect their pensions once they leave this country.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> They are not entitled to collect their social welfare benefits if they go to reside in the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man or Great Britain, properly so called.  I was glad to hear the Minister admitting&mdash;&ldquo;agreeing&rdquo; is, perhaps, a kinder word&mdash;that this was an undesirable state of affairs and that he intended to look into this particular problem and remedy it.  I hope he will alter the regulations in the immediate future to deal with that.</P>
      <P>Having said that, I want to deal with non-contributory old age pensioners and non-contributory widow pensioners.  It is a fact that a non-contributory pensioner or a person in receipt of a non-contributory widow's pension who leaves this country and goes to reside in England, or even Northern Ireland, immediately forfeits his or her right to a non-contributory pension.  If we consider the implication of that for a moment we will come to the conclusion that it is unfair and we will come to the conclusion that the non-contributory old age pensioner or the widow in receipt of a non-contributory pension, in certain circumstances, and indeed in most circumstances, should continue to enjoy the pension if resident with relatives outside this country, in Great Britain or Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many old age pensioners in this country who have lived here all their lives.  They have brought children into the world and reared those children.  Those children have since emigrated to Great Britain through no fault of the parents and through no fault of their own to get a living.  I am not saying that in any critical manner. I am putting it forward to the House as a fact that cannot be denied.  Very often the children marry and settle down in Great Britain.  Until they marry they come home frequently, a couple of times a year perhaps, but when they marry, settle down and rear <Col N="1574" /> families in England their visits home are few and far between.  We very often have the widowed mother or father of such children as I speak of living at home in his or her declining years.  That parent is perhaps living in an isolated part of the country.  He or she would very much like to go to reside with those children in Great Britain where the parent would be regarded as a member of the family and would be treated accordingly.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Irish child is married to an English person.  The father or mother certainly does not want to go there to become an object of charity or be treated out of charity by the child.  The parent does not want to go there as a pauper.  It would be only reasonable, in such circumstances, that the parent should continue to draw the non-contributory old age pension abroad, certainly until such time as he or she qualifies for an old age pension in the other country.  I think it only requires an amendment of the regulations to make what I suggest possible.</P>
    <P>This might, in the long run, effect a saving to the Exchequer here because in many cases, especially in the case of the old age pensioner, when such a person is left at home here there is nobody to look after him or her. That person becomes lonely and usually has to go into the county home becoming the responsibility of the local authority.  That certainly costs the State much more than 47/6 a week.  This is a point which should be looked into sympathetically, both from a Christian and from an economic point of view.  I believe this problem about which I speak follows from the fact that there is considerable emigration from this country.  There always has been and probably always will be.  The proposal I speak of might not be so successfully advocated in the case of another country but it is something which, as I say, stems from emigration, and the fact that the old people are left at home is something that should be seriously considered and something done about it.</P>
    <P>The next point I want to make also arises on old age pensions.  According to the regulations as they stand at the <Col N="1575" /> moment, a right of residence, support and maintenance reserved in favour of a person who transfers his farm to his son is valued at the small sum of 1/- a week or 52/- a year.  Admittedly, up to the present time, that was equivalent to placing no value on it.  It did not deprive the transferred owner from being entitled to the old age pension at the maximum rate.  But we know under the Social Welfare Act which the Minister put through the House this year, and which provides for a further increase for certain old age pensions, as from next month this 1/-a week will become very important. Small and all as it is, it will deprive the farmer or other person who transfers his property to his married son from receiving the additional 5/- a week provided by the recent Act.  I think I am correct in that.  The 5/- a week which will come into force next month will not do favour to any old age pensioner who has any income whatever.  Therefore, it will deprive the farmer, or other person who transfers his property to his married son or daughter, from receiving this additional benefit.</P>
    <P>I think that is undesirable, and for a few reasons.  If it is only valued at £2 12s, it should be excluded altogether. But, old people being what they are, like to get the last penny that is coming to them, or what they think is coming to them under this Act.  I fear that a right of residence, support and maintenance will deprive these old people of the maximum rates of old age pension and will encourage them not to reserve any such rights in their favour.  That is undesirable because it will leave these old people at the complete mercy of a son and, let us face it, of the daughter-in-law. This is a very important and a very risky business.  The probabilities are that they will not reserve any rights for themselves at all and will take the chance.</P>
    <P>It is refreshing to find an old person coming in to transfer his farm to his son.  You ask him is his son married and you are told he is.  The next thing a prudent solicitor will ask is: &ldquo;How are you getting on with the daughter-in-law?&rdquo;<Col N="1576" /> It is very refreshing to be told everything in the garden is lovely, and in a great many cases everything in the garden is lovely.  But in other cases it is not so and things do not go well. The person who has transferred to a son who is not married cannot prudently take the risk of not reserving a right of residence for himself.  I think the Minister is encouraging him to take that risk under the present regulations. I would strongly appeal to the Minister from long experience of dealing with these matters to exclude this right of residence, support and maintenance from means altogether.</P>
    <P>I do not ask the Minister to give the full rate of old age pension to people who have other incomes in the bank or in the post office, and so on.  If they have not a right of residence, support and maintenance, they should get the full old age pension whether it be 47s 6d a week or 52s 6d a week, or whatever it is.</P>
    <P>I wish to draw the attention of the Minister to what I will describe as the widows' one-third under existing law. In a great number of cases we find an applicant for a widow's pension or a widow applicant for old age pension granted a very small pension because her husband died intestate, because the title of the family farm has not been put in order, and because she is deemed in law to be entitled to one-third, although for all practical purposes, it is the son who is running the farm who reaps the benefit of income arising from the farm, who works the farm and who earns the income. Indeed, under the regulations as at present operated, we can find that not alone is the widow assessed with one-third of the farm to which she might be held to be technically and legally entitled, but in many cases I have come across cases where she is deemed to own one-half of the farm because the registered owner might have died leaving a widow and, say, four children. Three children may be in America and one boy and the mother are at home. According to the Social Welfare Act as at present operated, the mother and the son are in occupation of this farm and they are equally entitled to the <Col N="1577" /> earnings of the farm and to the income from it.  That, of course, is not the case. If the son were to be treated like that, he too would join the rest of the family in America.  The son is the man who is regarded as the owner.</P>
    <P>Indeed, there are cases, as I know, where, unfortunately, the son at home and the mother are hardly on speaking terms.  The mother has a very bad time and, still, for the purposes of these regulations, she is deemed to be in receipt of 50 per cent of the income of the farm whereas the world and his wife and the neighbours know she gets her meals out.  That is another point the Minister might look into and operate less rigidly and with more sympathy.</P>
    <P>The next point I want to come to also concerns the granting of old age pensions.  Old people are like children. They are very impatient and it goes very hard on them to be kept out of something to which they consider they are entitled.  This is understandable because they are living on borrowed time, as they say themselves, and their lives are running out and the matter of a few weeks or a few months is indeed a big consideration to them and is a substantial portion of the life that may be left to them.  I think, therefore, that everything should be done to eliminate delays and to try to overlook technicalities for the purpose of doing so.</P>
    <P>It used to be, I think, that when a deed from the father to the son was executed the pension was paid subject to checking in a reasonable time that the deed was stamped and I think in certain cases the Department did not insist on registration where there were practical difficulties in the way of registration.  The Minister knows, and I am sure his advisers know, that the title to many farms in rural Ireland is in a mess, that it has not been dealt with, especially in the smaller farms. Perhaps in the wealthier counties like Tipperary, where farms are worth many thousands of pounds, more care is taken with the title, but in places like my constituency, where farms remain in the family for generations and where they are of little value, the <Col N="1578" /> titles have been neglected and to perfect them is both a tedious and an expensive procedure.  At present the regulations, instead of being relaxed in this particular field, have been tightened up.  Not alone will the pension not be paid now until the deed is stamped but there must be evidence that it has been lodged for registration.  As the Minister knows, it cannot be lodged for registration until the title of the transferor is in order.</P>
    <P>I think that when the deed is executed and produced to the social welfare officer the pension should become payable immediately and the social welfare officer should check up on the situation in, say, three months to see that the deed has been stamped. It does take a little time to stamp deeds and get them through the Valuation Office and that sort of thing. If, in three months, the deed is not stamped, then there might be a case for suspending the pension until such time as it is stamped.  I feel that if there is satisfactory evidence from a solicitor or such person that there is difficulty in the way of completing registration of the deed that requirement should not be insisted upon.  I certainly cannot be accused now of advocating work for the legal profession. I do think that where there are difficulties or where it would lead to expense registration should not be insisted upon.  Once the deed is stamped, the pension should be paid immediately, subject to revision after three months, if the deed is not stamped, and if there are difficulties in the way of registration, it should not be insisted on.  I put that to the Minister as a reasonable proposition because it is pathetic to see old people behaving like children who are waiting for Christmas to get a top or behaving like children who are being deprived of something which they consider they should get.</P>
    <P>I feel there are undue delays also, not due to officers in the Department but due to the regulations under which they are working, in the payment of disability benefit.  The Minister has taken over portion of the workmen's compensation code.  I know <Col N="1579" /> it has not come into force yet, but when it does, injured workmen and insured people, who are ill will be completely at the mercy of the Department of Social Welfare.  We all come across cases where people are deprived of their social welfare benefit for seven, eight, nine or ten weeks and are forced to depend on the paltry home assistance they get from the county council, and then a cheque for £70 or £80 comes along.  I had a case only this week where an injured workman who had been held not to be entitled to social welfare benefit received through me a cheque for £80.  I submit to the Minister and to the House that that is evidence of undue delay.</P>
    <P>I know it may mean some new machinery for dealing with these cases. I wonder whether wholetime officers, wholetime medical men in the Department are the best people to deal with these appeal cases.  I feel that an arrangement could be made whereby the county surgeon or the neighbouring county surgeon would attend at a clinic over a couple of weeks and decide these matters.  His certificate should be accepted.  There will have to be something done about that to minimise these delays because they are not fair and can and do cause hardship. The case I have mentioned where the man got, I think, £80 odd in respect of a couple of months compensation is not good enough.  It is too long to keep a man waiting and I suggest to the Minister for his consideration that these things should be decided by resident medical men in the locality, certainly in the county.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I should have dealt with the matter of children's allowances being payable to families who emigrate when dealing with payment of old age pensions abroad.  At present if a family who are in receipt of children's allowances emigrate because the head of the family finds that he cannot get work here, immediately they go to England or wherever they go, they find that the allowances are cut off.  They do not qualify in England until they have been there six months. We should continue to pay the allowances <Col N="1580" /> until the family qualifies for children's allowances after six months abroad.  I do not think that is an unreasonable request.  It is something that arises from the problem of emigration which is peculiar to this country.</P>
    <P>The final point I want to deal with unfortunately also relates to emigration. I do not think the responsibility of our Department of Social Welfare or our Minister for Social Welfare should end when our boys or girls get on a boat to go to England.  Our responsibility to those people does not end there.  It is possible for children of 15 or 16 years of age to buy a one-way sailing ticket, go to England and, as far as this country is concerned, we wash our hands of them. I am not saying that in any offensive way.  Again, it is a cold fact which cannot be contradicted, but I do not think our responsibility to them ends there.  I do not want to go on record as creating the impression that any considerable number of our emigrants go to the bad when they emigrate because I do not think they do.  A big percentage, and the vast majority, of them make good abroad and are a credit to the country that reared them but there is the percentage who, principally because I suppose they did not get the proper upbringing at home for one reason or another and were not fit to emigate, fall by the wayside.</P>
    <P>We have in England and in the city of London some Irish organisations doing a wonderful job of work looking after our emigrants who were not fitted to emigrate and who reclaim and rehabilitate those who fall by the wayside. I could refer particularly &mdash; it is only right that tribute be paid to it in this Assembly&mdash;to the Irish Centre in London which is being run by a couple of Irish priests and which could not fail to impress anybody who visited it. Although it may have its difficulties, our Department of Social Welfare should do something to look after the emigrants, first of all, the young emigrants who should not have been allowed to emigrate and, if we cannot prevent them from emigrating, we <Col N="1581" /> should keep in touch with them there at Government level, at Departmental level, or at official level.  In my opinion, we should have, in the city of London and other large English cities where a great number of Irish people go to work, welfare officers attached to the Irish Embassy in London and to our consular offices in England.  I do not think that is outside the responsibility or sphere of influence of the Minister for Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>I have been in London and have had an opportunity of visiting the Irish Centre, about which I have spoken, and of speaking to people there.  I know these charitable organisations in England would welcome assistance from the Minister's Department.  The Minister should take up this question with the Irish Centre and with other charitable organisations in London and discuss with them how best he can help them.  At the present time the only assistance the Minister will give, or, I suppose, can give, under the regulations to any boy or girl in England who falls by the wayside is to pay his or her fare back home.  I understand he goes that far or, if the Minister's Department does not do it, some Department does it&mdash;perhaps it is the Department of External Affairs or some other Department.  I understand there is some sort of regulation or arrangement to that effect.</P>
    <P>I say we should establish welfare officers there to keep in touch with the young people who should not have been allowed to emigrate but who, in fact, did emigrate.  In addition, he should keep in touch with the emigrants who fall by the wayside.  It is not any answer to say there are probation officers in England, that there are probation officers supplied by one Department of State or another in England, because these people, kindly as they may be, cannot be expected to understand the Irish temperament or, indeed, to have a great lot of sympathy for people whom they might regard as having gone over there to get a living and then break the laws of the country.  They cannot be expected to have a lot of sympathy for them.  I should like to finish on <Col N="1582" /> that note and strongly urge the Minister to do something about it.</P>

      <P>It is generally agreed in the House that the Social Welfare Estimate is one of the most important which comes up for discussion. Much ground has been covered by the different speakers in this debate and much play has been made with the difficulties which confront the people who mainly benefit under this Estimate, the weaker or unfortunate sections of the community.</P>
      <P>I must say at the outset, so far as regulations go&mdash;whilst I do not agree with them&mdash;there is good co-operation between the Department, Members of this House and the public at large who have reason to make representations and who have reason to complain about one question or another so far as their applications are concerned. Dealing with the question of old age pensions first, non-contributory and, indeed, contributory as well, it is now some 56 years since pensions for such people were introduced.  It seems very peculiar to me that over that long period, even though standards have improved very much in the meantime, the age limit for old age pensions has not changed.  I know it is a difficult question.  It needs a good deal of money to bring about a change but surely the time is at hand, in the year 1966, for the Government of the day and, particularly, for the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is not my intention to get into conflict with the rules of the House, but that is a question which the Minister should bear in mind when he is formulating legislation to deal with it in the future.  He should consider changing the age limit. I do not intend to labour the point but I am well aware that this would cost money.  It is quite all right to say that we must do this or that.  Everyone appreciates that such a change would need a big annual Estimate to discharge the cost, but I think a case is there for it.  These people should be treated the same as those who enjoy golden handshakes or gratuities&mdash;call them what you will&mdash;at 65 years.  The Minister is a reasonable man and I think he would be only too anxious to do this if he could convince his colleagues and the public to agree to such a proposal and make additional taxation available to implement it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The regulations governing applications for non-contributory old age pensions leave much to be desired. They certainly do not measure up to my requirements or to the requirements of many Members of the House.  At present, except in a straightforward <Col N="1584" /> case where there are no means or where there is little need for an investigation, a peculiar position obtains in the investigation of these claims.  Unfortunately&mdash;and I emphasise the word &ldquo;unfortunately&rdquo;&mdash;the social welfare officers in making their investigations assume that every applicant is dishonest, untruthful, unreliable and trying to get money by fraudulent means.  That is the first assumption made by the social welfare officers. There are also cases where applicants who had some money when they reached the age of 70 and handed it over to members of the family, had their applications held against by the pensions officer.  They rejected the assertion that they were genuine transfers and claimed they were for the purpose of getting an old age pension.  They recommended against the applicants and their recommendations were upheld invariably by the appeals officers.</P>
    <P>I intend to deal with this in a more elaborate way.  The Act was amended 17 or 18 years ago and to a great extent that met our requirements so far as farmers and landowners were concerned.  On the assigning of a holding, that income was not held against an applicant.  There was no question about the holding being assigned in order to get a pension to which the applicant might not be entitled.  But if a man saves a few thousand pounds during his lifetime and hands it over to his daughter Mary, his son Jimmy and his son Jack, the pension officers claim that he is giving the money to his family in order to get a pension.</P>
    <P>Surely we try to get these people in the winter of their lives to hand this money over to their families even earlier to help them.  Many members of the family are married and have children who have grown up and reached secondary school age and they need the additional money.  This type of thing could very well lead to some of our old people holding on to their money until they die.  I think that is undesirable.  This works very smoothly so far as the assigning of farms is concerned and it is pleasant to note the change that has taken place since that legislation was implemented 17 <Col N="1585" /> years ago.  Nowadays almost all farmers are quite willing and anxious to hand over their farms when they reach the age of 70.  That was not the position some years back.</P>
    <P>What applies to farmers assigning their holdings should apply to people who assign money, and it should also apply to the assigning of business premises.  There are a number of small shopkeepers, and if they assign their shop or their premises to an unmarried member of the family, the pension officer holds against them and recommends that they should not get a pension. He takes into account the income from the shop as if they still owned it. If a small shopkeeper on reaching the age of 70, assigns his business to a member of the family, the income from that business should not be taken into account just because the son or the daughter who got it was unmarried. The law should be changed and the same regulations should apply to anyone handing over a small business premises as apply in the case of farmers.  The best way to illustrate this is to mention a case in point in which I think the decision of the Department was completely unfair and unjust.</P>
    <P>In my constituency there is a family with little means.  The father who was getting a pension unexpectedly got a legacy of some thousands of pounds. There are nine members of the family, eight of whom are married.  When he got the legacy, he deemed it fair and just to divide it among the members of his family.  He lost his pension.  The pension officer from the Department said he had got this legacy, that it was in his name, there was no mention of the family, and that now that he had assigned the money to his family, he must do without his pension.  He said the man had assigned the money in order to circumvent the pension law and to hold on to the pension.  That was grossly unfair.  That man should be commended because of the fact that when he got this money unexpectedly, he transferred it to his large family to enable them to help their own young children.  Surely instead of being penalised and losing his pension of £2 7s 6d a week, that man should have <Col N="1586" /> been commended for passing over the money, particularly having regard to the fact that he was almost 80 years of age?</P>
    <P>Surely regulations like that should not exist?  I am also saying that there should be a complete change in the regulations having regard to the role which Deputies play in making representations about non-contributory old age pensions.  Why should not the same regulations apply as applied when I became a Member of this House? Then any aggrieved old age pensioner or pension applicant could approach any Member of the House, give the facts of his case, and we were able to meet the appeals officer deciding the case and bring factors to his notice that might not have been mentioned in the social welfare officer's report.  We could discuss the matter with him and get a decision.  That has been changed: Deputies are denied the right to approach the appeals officer.  Surely in such cases Deputies were acting in a capacity similar to that of solicitors in the courts of justice?  Why should they be denied that right?  There is no justification.  Years ago I pointed this out here and objected strongly to the change.  When we had the right to approach the appeals officers, the situation was much more satisfactory. We could put up various facts relevant to the case and we could get a decision there and then.  Now our only way of making representations is through correspondence and what could be called a contact man.  This is completely out of place and should not be tolerated by Members of the House.</P>
    <P>The present Minister did not make the change, as it was brought in before he became Minister for Social Welfare, but he should look again at this regulation and have it wiped out and give Deputies the right of approach they had in the past.  I remember that at that time social welfare officers' recommendations were varied in at least 50 per cent of cases but there is little variation today.  It is assumed the officer's recommendation is correct and should stand.  If that were carried to its logical conclusion there would be no need for appeals officers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1587" /> I want to put it strongly and forcefully that we should revert to the previous position as regards making representation about non-contributory old age pensions.  I hope that when the Minister is replying he will comment on this matter.  I think there is no defence for the change of regulations made some years ago.  In appeals concerning unemployment and disability payments and unemployment assistance, Deputies have the right to go along with the applicant and others to see the appeals officer.  If it is lawful and right in those cases, why should this right be denied in another case? The number of cases may not be great but there are several old aged persons not getting any pension at present or getting only part of a pension, who, if this regulation did not exist, would be getting either a full pension or part pension as appropriate. I know of them in my constituency and I am sure one can find them throughout the country.  Deputies are elected, just as the Minister is, and why should they be deprived of the right of making representations to an official of the Department?  I do not blame the officers of the Department because a previous Minister, for some reason, changed the regulations.  This is going beyond what should happen in a democratic country.</P>
    <P>We have been told by various speakers&mdash;and quite rightly&mdash;that old age pensions are inadequate but in saying that one must realise there are different types of recipients.  We have a man depending entirely on his pension, with no other income.  You have another who is living with his family on a farm or in a business house and who has other sources of income in that the family provide for him or for his wife.  Such people may not be dependent entirely on pensions and possibly an amount such as is given at present is reasonable in their cases, but I think the day has come when, no matter how difficult it may be, we must make distinctions.  We must help the old people entirely dependent on pensions for their livelihood.</P>
    <P>The City and County Managers' Association made an order which is <Col N="1588" /> being implemented by every health authority that old age pensioners should not qualify for any part of the disablement allowance.  It is the Minister's duty to address himself to this. When this ruling was questioned in County Cork, a legal report was that local authorities are empowered, in accordance with legislation passed here to grant disablement allowances to needy old age pensioners who qualify for them.  It is entirely wrong that legislation enacted here to benefit sections of the people should be side-stepped by county and city managers. No Government could stand for that. Why should such people cut across the legislation of this House?  I asked the Minister to consider this question as I am sure he will agree that many of these old people would qualify for such allowances, if they were available. The answer of the managers' association is that they can get home assistance in exceptional cases if badly off, but many people do not like in the last years of their lives applying for home assistance.  The name does not appeal to them and we should not impose on them the obligation of applying for assistance but we should give them the allowance which was provided by this House for disabled persons who qualify for it.</P>

      <P>Some of the committees give written reasons why they recommend variation of the welfare officers' decisions.  I want to know from the Minister, for the last available period, how many applications were varied on appeal.  I feel sure the number is very small.  I now come to the question of unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance.  I stated here during the years that here, with such a limited population and so many essential schemes to be carried out, such as road work, drainage, land reclamation and afforestation, there is scarcely need to pay such benefits. What is needed is an inter-departmental committee which would be responsible for providing employment and which, through co-operation with local councils, would provide work locally when redundancies become imminent as a result of local schemes being completed.</P>
      <P>I feel sure that the workers of South West Cork are no different from those in other parts of the country and that 99 per cent of them would much prefer to have employment, to be out doing work of a productive nature, to running along to the labour exchange or to the Garda station signing for benefit or for assistance.</P>

At the present time the regulations provide that if a person does any work he is to be punished for it by being deprived of unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance. It is undesirable that in order to quality for such benefits a person must lay off work completely.</P>

      <P>My contention is that this money could be put through a different channel, providing payment for work done instead of unemployment benefit and assistance. Is the Minister sneering?  What does he see wrong with that suggestion? Is it not our aim to have all our men and women gainfully employed? Is it not our aim to have all our people dependent on public employment for their livelihood, employed continuously?  Surely the Minister for Social Welfare, the man responsible, should get together with his colleagues in the Department of Local Government and in the Forestry Division to promote schemes which would give gainful employment.  What he is doing now is subsidising unemployment.  Is that not quite clear?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of unemployment benefit, we have this infamous clause in the Act which precludes a person in receipt of £2 a week.  Such a person is deemed to be gainfully employed. As a result, we have small farmers and small shopkeepers and others engaged in limited self-employment denied the benefits of the Act.  The Minister will say that because a man earns a few pounds a week he is employed within <Col N="1591" /> the meaning of the Act.  What will a couple of pounds a week do for a man living with a wife and family on a small holding?  That man is deprived of benefit under the Act.  I ask the Minister earnestly to review that regulation. I asked him a few years ago and because of that he made some variation in respect of licensed vintners who, until then, had been excluded from benefit.  We all know that many small publicans in the country have very little.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see why such people should be deprived of benefit.  In the case of publicans and small shopkeepers, the wives run the businesses and the husbands are available for any periodic employment that may offer.  The same applies in the case of small farmers: the wives can do the necessary jobs around the place for most of the year and even in season the husband could still manage to take occasional employment outside the farm.  If he does so now he is precluded from unemployment benefit.  I agree that there should be some means test but disagree that it should apply in this way.</P>
      <P>I shall take the Berehaven Peninsula as an instance.  There, the incomes of small farmers are very low and we have a number of people denied the benefits to which they are entitled because the Act precludes them.  Until we have fuller employment and more money available for schemes in such districts the people in them need unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance.  Without such benefits the people in such districts cannot live. Therefore, I hope the Minister will bear in mind the need to very the clause in the Act which precludes such people from benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of disability allowances, I cannot see why the Department insists on applicants producing <Col N="1592" /> weekly certificates.  If the medical officer is satisfied that an applicant is likely to be incapacitated for a minimum period of three months, why not give him the certification covering the three monthly periods instead of imposing on him or on a member of his family the weekly obligation of going along for this medical certification? Where circumstances warrant it, the Minister should review that regulation.</P>
    <P>I am particularly interested in the assessment of means in the case of applicants for non-contributory widows' pensions.  Deputy Fitzpatrick referred to some of the regulations governing the assessment of means for this pension as it affects farmers.  Take a farmer's wife with four or five young children who is residing on a holding carrying 11 or 12 cows.  She would not have a hope of getting a pension under the existing regulations.  When application is made for such a pension, the social welfare officer assesses the income for the previous year, forgetting, to my mind, that there is a complete change so far as that holding is concerned. In the previous year, the husband may have been in perfect health. He was running the farm and transacting the farm business at fairs and marts.  On his death, that is gone by the board, particularly when it is a man in middle age who dies and, in many cases, dies unexpectedly.  The wife must make changes or, alternatively, she must employ labour to carry out the work formerly done by her husband.  That is not taken into account or is not taken into account sufficiently by social welfare officers.</P>
    <P>Most of the farmers' wives who apply to the Department of Social Welfare for a widow's non-contributory pension fail in their application. It is all right for widows with a family whose ages are more than 21, where, on the assignment of the farm to a member of the family, she qualifies automatically and the farm income will not be held against her.  However, in many cases where the children are young and helpless and where the farm could not be assigned to them, the full assessment of the farm is held against the widow and the children combined. <Col N="1593" /> I should like that aspect of the assessment of means to be reviewed.</P>
    <P>Another matter I want to mention is this new system which came into operation a few years ago for assessing means for widows' pensions and old age pensions.  Now there is a variation in the assessment and it can happen that a widow could qualify for a pension of, we shall say, 35/-weekly and on reaching 70 years of age, by virtue of a change in the system of assessment, the widow with some money could have that pension reduced by as much as 15/- weekly.  I have one case in West Cork where a lady on reaching the age of 70 had a social welfare officer re-investigate her means. He found it was similar to that for the non-contributory widow's pension but, in view of the investigation, had to reduce her pension by 12/6d.  I raised this question here but the Minister did not seem to think there was much wrong with it.  Surely the Minister will agree it is unfair that a widow who is in receipt of a non-contributory pension can, on reaching 70 years of age, lose as much as 15/- weekly?  I would ask the Minister to review such cases.</P>
    <P>The Minister should be as liberal as possible in regard to making provision for the different recipients of benefits.  We often hear credit being claimed that one side gave 5/- and another gave only 2s 6d.  However, there seems to be general agreement on all sides of the House that the rates of these benefits, particularly old age pensions and widows' pensions, are too low.  We know that to increase them money must be found and, as pointed out here by Deputy O'Leary from these benches, we in the Labour Party have always supported the provision of additional taxation to meet the funds required to grant such increases.  Therefore, I hope that next year, whoever will be here, there will be a change in some of the regulations, the most important being that in relation to the age limit, although I know this is a dangerous year in view of the shortage of funds in which to mention a scheme such as that which would cost a great deal of money.</P>
    <P>I hope the role which we Deputies <Col N="1594" /> play in our capacity as public representatives, making representations on behalf of these people, will change also and that we shall have full freedom to go along to the deciding officer and discuss with him any case that is brought to our notice and on which we are asked to make representations.</P>
    <P>I appreciate very much that the Department of Social Welfare is one Department that sends along to the applicant a detailed statement of his application.  Where an application is rejected a detailed statement is given of the reasons for its rejection.  That is very helpful.  In other Departments where an application is rejected there is just a formal notification that the application is rejected and no reason is given.  The Department of Social Welfare is to be complimented for giving detailed reasons why applications are rejected.  If the Minister would now change the regulations that hamper the administration of the Department so much he would be doing a very good day's work.  He would have a brighter statement to make here and would find more general agreement in the House when his Estimate arises again in 12 months' time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to preface my remarks with congratulatory words to the Minister on having introduced into this House the largest Estimate for Social Welfare since the foundation of the State, £42,203,000.  It certainly is a colossal sum of money and it shows, beyond yea or nay, the endeavour, the interest and the responsibility of the present incumbent of the office of Minister for Social Welfare, that he has secured slightly in excess of one-sixth of the total Budget for those in the less well-off income group and those people who are depending on the State to supplement their means of living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we consider that social services and social welfare particularly are services that can be very effective in bringing about the proper atmosphere by which the economy of the country can go forward, we realise the worth, not merely in cash terms but in real value as well, of those moneys, having regard to the way they will be <Col N="1595" /> distributed to the weaker sections of the community.  Forty years ago when this State came into being, we had only three schemes of social welfare services, the first of which is now 58 years old, the non-contributory old age pension.  There was the national health benefit service of 1911.  There was a very meagre skeleton on which to build the services we desire and which future development must surely bring about.</P>
    <P>It is to the credit of various Governments in that period that the social welfare services were developed.  The introduction in 1924 of the Blind Pensions Act; in 1933, of the Unemployment Assistance Act; in 1935, of widows' and orphans' pensions and, in 1944, of children's allowances and, last but not least, in 1960, of contributory pensions, reflected the keenness of various Ministers.</P>

      <P>From now on, in a calmer atmosphere, we will be able to plan our social welfare services so that they will be more in line with what will emerge in a Europe in which we will be involved.  We must plan our social services to dovetail with those <Col N="1596" /> of the EEC countries and bring our standards and rates of benefit up so that they will be in line with those available in these countries.  If we are to play an ever-increasing role in the years to come, economically, socially and politically, our social welfare services must be given a wider scope than has heretofore been possible.</P>
      <P>In this sphere, the Minister has shown great awareness which is particularly demonstrated by the Industrial Injuries Compensation Bill which will come before the House shortly and which will replace the Workmen's Compensation Act.  The new Bill will provide many benefits, particularly for those in employment of a dangerous nature.  Heretofore, contributions and benefits were matters solely for the employer and the employee.  Under the new Bill there will be a broader scheme which will cover, not merely industrial injuries, but occupational diseases also. This is of paramount importance to me because quite a number of my constituents are engaged in the hazardous occupation of coal-mining.  Up to now pneumoconiosis was outside the scope of industrial diseases and when a case arose it meant a common law case which involved severe financial strain for the employer and sometimes could not be undertaken by the employee, no matter how just or how right his case might be.  Regrettably, it was made a pawn in the game of legalities and legal representation.  Many people who had just claims were forced to commit themselves to accepting a percentage of the award given.  This will no longer be the case and that is something I welcome.</P>

      <P>If I am to be educated, I think I will go elsewhere.  There is one aspect of social welfare benefits that seems to escape attention in the debate here.  It is that there is an abnormal proportion of people depending on the State.  I refer to those under 15 and over 65.  This is a result of emigration.  It means that those workers who remain in the State support a much higher proportion of persons than would be expected of them in a normal society where emigration is not so high. Therefore, the payments fall heavily on those in employment in this country, much more heavily than is the case in most other countries.</P>
      <P>The State pays over one-third of the total amount of social welfare benefits of one type or another, which is a very high proportion.  This brings to mind what the Taoiseach said as recently as last June regarding social welfare finance, which is a matter which will have to be considered in the future. The Taoiseach said:</P>

    <P>In this country a much higher proportion of the cost of social welfare services is carried by the Central Exchequer than is the practice in other countries.  This has meant that examination of possibilities of improvement of these services has normally been undertaken in connection with the preparation of the Budget and has been limited by a Budgetary consideration.  We think that the time is coming when, in the interest of the further development of these services, the method of their financing should be re-examined in a fundamental way.  If we had to decide that the rate of improvement of these services should be limited by normal revenue buoyancy, this would necessitate the fulfilment of our expansion plans over a longer period of time, longer indeed than we would consider to be appropriate or than the people generally would desire.  It must be accepted therefore that the maintenance of a reasonable rate of progress in these social services, to the extent that they continue <Col N="1598" /> to be financed by the Budget, is likely to involve taxation measures to provide money for them at a more substantial rate than normal buoyancy of revenue might reasonably be expected to provide.</P>
    <P>One thing clearly emerges from this, that everyone who advocates an increase in social welfare benefits of one sort or another must realise that if we are to improve social welfare benefits we must be prepared to pay for them.  Níl aon dul as.  That is a common and cold fact.  It is very easy to advocate in this House that the Minister should double or treble every social welfare benefit payable by his Department without reference to the fact that, in the first instance and in the final analysis, the money must come from the people.  If we are prepared to vote for extra benefits, we must be prepared to vote for the extra taxation to supply those benefits. There is only one method that can be exploited in relation to benefits, namely, the employment of a graded benefits scheme whereby persons in employment would pay according to their wage-earning capacity and, in times of unemployment or sickness, would be entitled to a graded scale of benefits.  If such a scheme were implemented, it would ease the problem in relation to finance and persons earning higher rates of wages and who have higher commitments would be in a better position to finance those commitments and to maintain their families in the normal standard of comfort to which they are entitled should they become unemployed or ill.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann is of opinion that old age and blind pensioners be afforded travel facilities by CIE bus and rail free of charge.</P>
      <P>First, I should like to thank the Minister for expressing his willingness to take the motion at such short notice.  It is a simple motion of less than two lines.  We must consider first with whom we are concerned in this motion. As Deputies are aware, the percentage of old persons in the State is increasing. However, the income of old people is hardly keeping pace with their increase in numbers.  Without impinging on any other Estimate, I should like to deal with the problem of old age pensioners in relation to transport costs.  Fares on CIE have gone up steadily in recent years.  Today the minimum fare in the city is 4d and the fares between the city centre and the outlaying housing estates vary from 10d to 1/- or more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many old people of necessity have to travel.  They may have to travel from the outskirts to the city centre for the purpose of purchasing out of their miserable allowances the necessaries of life at the cheapest price.  Deputies familiar with the city are aware of the fact that normally in the perimeter areas it is impossible for old age pensioners to obtain the necessaries of life at anything like the prices at which they can be purchased in the centre city area.  In addition, we have the situation of the old couple, one of whom may be confined to hospital. There is then the problem of the husband or wife visiting the other partner <Col N="1600" /> in hospital.  It can be said of our elderly people that they are always very concerned about their family and relatives and when these are in hospital endeavour, even at great sacrifice, to visit them as regularly as possible. Then you have the problem arising from their own attendance at clinics or hospitals for treatment.  Even though our dispensary and hospital services may be gradually improving, there is a burden imposed on these old people who have to travel to them.</P>
    <P>The rate of contributory pension for a single old person is 60s a week and 107s 6d a week in the case of a married person.  Every Deputy will agree that people on such an income find it difficult to pay 10d or 1s in bus fares two or three times a week, especially when one has regard to their other necessary expenditure on rent, heating, the provision of a meagre standard of clothing and a reasonable amount of foodstuffs.  The situation is even more tragic in the case of people living in the rural towns.  If a member of their family becomes ill, the nearest hospital may be ten or 20 miles away.  In this case if old age pensioners wish to visit them, they can only do so by relying on the charity of neighbours.  Certainly out of their contributory pension they could not pay the rail fares to make even infrequent visits.</P>
    <P>This is a human problem affecting all these people.  The motion deals with blind persons also and the same general remarks apply.  As I said, the contributory old age pension for a single person is 60s.  For the person with a non-contributory pension, the problem is even more difficult.  In that case the income is 47s 6d per week.  On the basis of the means test, a very high proportion of these people are found to have little or no means. People may talk about the level of rail fares, but I do not think this motion provides the appropriate opportunity to expand on that at any great length.  It has been dealt with on many occasions previously and will be dealt with again.  But the expenditure of every 6d or 1s in fares by old age pensioners should be considered sympathetically.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1601" /> I think of my own constituency stretching from within half a mile of the city centre a distance of ten miles. The old age pensioner living on the outskirts of the city who wants to visit a relative who is being taken care of in St. Kevin's by the Dublin Health Authority will have to pay 1/2d into the centre of the city and another 5d from the centre of the city to St. Kevin's amounting to 1/7d each way. Now, 1/7d may not mean much to a person with £15, £20 or £35 a week but it is a very important sum to a person who, the day after he receives his pension, has nothing to rattle in his pocket.  Consequently, we put down this motion in order to get the opinion of the House on the matter.</P>
    <P>The problem of providing free transport for the old age pensioners and for the blind has been raised many times and objection has been made to it on the grounds of administration.  I suggest to the Minister that if this aspect is thoroughly examined, it should be possible to find a system that will secure some form of pass for free travel for old age pensioners on our public transport, whether it be for every day, three days a week, two days a week or during the valley hours.</P>
    <P>CIE might argue that to provide passes for old age pensioners might interfere with the services at peak hours on the buses.  That argument may or may not be valid but I do not think there is a great deal of validity in it.  I should imagine that the bulk of old age pensioners would be likely to travel during off-peak periods.  Visiting hours in city hospitals are usually in the afternoon or after tea in the evening.  If the old age pensioners want to purchase goods in shops where they can get the most economic rate as far as they are concerned, they would not normally do their shopping at the times when people are going to work in the morning or coming from work in the evening.</P>
    <P>The people in CIE might say in effect &ldquo;Passes would be impossible&rdquo;. That is not a valid argument because for many years some people in CIE have passes on the buses or on the trains, or on both.  The number involved may be few but nevertheless <Col N="1602" /> the system is there.  We often see people on a bus show a pass to the conductor and we are aware, too, that there are season tickets for travel on the railways.  We are not aware that there has been difficulty about checking them.  The problem may be posed that some old age pensioner might lend his pass to somebody else and that some five per cent of the passes might be utilised by persons who are not old age pensioners.  From the financial point of view, I do not think that is a very serious matter or that it would interfere tremendously with the position of CIE because its incidence would be very slight. Furthermore, if CIE arranged for the giving of such services to old age pensioners it might have the effect of encouraging a greater utilisation of the services by other people.</P>
    <P>Every Deputy is aware that it costs from £10 to £14 a week to maintain an old person in a State institution and any effort to secure that people can remain at home would represent a tremendous saving to the State.  Administration should not present any great difficulties.  All it would require would be the designing of a special weekly or monthly ticket or pass.  A ticket could be issued to blind pensioners each month when they go to draw their pension and a pass could be issued to old age pensioners when they draw their pension.  Alternatively, arrangements could be made for the issue to them of a pass which would have to be renewed by themselves at intervals.</P>
    <P>We are concerned not so much with the problems of administration as with the need to secure for our old age pensioners an opportunity to visit relatives in hospital, to attend clinics at a distance from their home and to travel to shops where they can purchase their needs at a lower rate than in shops near where they live.  Every Deputy is aware of the hardships continually suffered by our elderly citizens during inclement weather.  We must feel sympathy for them and do our best to avoid situations where these people have to walk fairly long distances because they cannot afford the bus fares.  Unfortunately, too, the bus fares <Col N="1603" /> have a habit of increasing from time to time, thus multiplying the difficulties for such old people.</P>
    <P>Year by year, the problem becomes more difficult in Dublin city.  Thirty or forty years ago, the bulk of the city was contained, generally speaking, within the canals plus Rathmines, Clontarf and Terenure and one might say that the bulk of the old people were to be found within a confined area.  The city has stretched from Howth, Finglas, Cabra West and beyond, on the north side, to Ballyfermot, Rathfarnham, and so on, on the south side.  The percentage of old people in the new housing areas around our city is also increasing very rapidly. There are many hundreds of cases of old people in hospitals&mdash;surgical hospitals, medical hospitals and geriatric hospitals&mdash;who do not receive a visit from any of their kin or friends because of the inability of their kin and friends to meet the cost of visiting.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that Deputies representing rural areas will tell us the situation is exactly the same in their constituencies.  The only difference is that the cost of visiting in the rural areas is even more prohibitive.  People living in Athlone have to travel to Mullingar to visit people in hospital there.  Knowing the cost of fares, it is quite obvious that there must be financial difficulty.  The same situation occurs in those areas in which there are regional hospitals.  The latest development in our health services is leading to even more institutionalising of people.  Geriatrics may be excellent for the aged but the aged in these institutions miss the most essential thing they should have, namely, frequent visits from their relatives and friends.  These relatives and friends are not in an economic position to visit.</P>
    <P>The classes with which we are mainly concerned are the old age pensioners, both contributory and non-contributory, and blind pensioners.  We ask the House to support our request in this motion for free travel.  CIE may well say that they cannot afford it.  I suggest the Minister should discuss <Col N="1604" /> the situation with his colleague, the Minister for Transport and Power, to find out if something can be done. Perhaps there could be a subsidy from the funds under the control of the Minister for Social Welfare.  It might be possible to provide passes or season tickets of some kind which would secure the objective set out in the motion tabled in the name of the Labour Party.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been said that there is no worse combination than being poor and old.  For that reason I support this motion wholeheartedly. Deputy Larkin has been extremely reasonable in his approach and has even suggested that the facility proposed should be available only during off-peak periods.  Surely it should not be outside the ingenuity of man to provide the free passes he suggests? The motion has been put forward in a most balanced and reasonable manner and it deserves the serious consideration of both the House and CIE. Deputy Larkin said that CIE might not have the money, but the amount involved would be minimal because the amount involved on travel by old age pensioners and blind pensioners is very small indeed.  The old age pensioner cannot afford transport on the rate of pension we give and, therefore, the effect financially on CIE would be minimal.  In fact, the effect could well be nil.  Pass schemes have been introduced elsewhere.  There is one operating in London.  Surely we can provide this very small amenity?  Even if the system proved a little faulty, what matter?  We all know old age pensioners.  We all know people with defective eyesight.  It would be a great charity to give these people this little amenity.  If he were to make a serious recommendation to the Board of CIE I am certain this facility would be forthcoming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are occasions when, if a sug gestion of this kind is made by the Opposition, the Government Party yel across the floor of the House: &ldquo;Why <Col N="1605" /> did you not do it?&rdquo; I maintain the two inter-Party Governments should have done it.  I was not here when the first inter-Party Government were in office but I supported the second as a Member of this House.  I believe we were wrong in not providing this amenity.  Confession is good for the soul.  Everybody is asking for this amenity and nobody is trying to make any political capital out of it and, therefore, if it is of any benefit to the Government, I make the confession freely.  I do so to make it as easy as possible for the Government and CIE to give this little concession.  Of course, there is always officialdom and we all know how completely hidebound officialdom can be.  I do not say this in any criticism of officialdom, but it takes a politician to have his finger on the pulse of the people and to go to the officials and say: &ldquo;You are wrong in this and my recommendation is that you change the system.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>My Party fully support this motion and we do it not in any spirit of taking advantage of the Government or CIE but merely to try to get this much needed amenity for people to whom it should have been given by the Government across the way and by the inter-Party Governments long before this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion calls on the Government to use their influence with CIE to allow old age pensioners and blind pensioners free travel on both buses and trains.  It is very difficult for someone who is not actually in the position of an old age pensioner to realise just how much this could mean to people living on an old age pension. When the average person goes out and boards a bus, his only thought is that this bus will take him to his destination, but, for the old age pensioner, travelling on a bus will in fact require a major financial decision. That is how much this can mean to a person living on an old age pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people for whom we advocate free travel are in two classes: the old age pensioner who by his work has contributed to the welfare and building up of the State since its foundation, and the people who, through no fault <Col N="1606" /> of their own, are afflicted in such a way that it is not possible for them in many cases to earn their livelihood. I do not think it is too much to ask a State body or the Government to afford these people this concession, small from the State's point of view but a major concession from the point of view of those in receipt of these pensions.</P>
    <P>This evening I tried to make up roughly how a person can live on £3 a week&mdash;in the case of the contributory old age pension&mdash;or £2 7s 6d a week, in the case of the non-contributory old age pension.  I came to these conclusions: bread&mdash;three loaves a week&mdash; 4/6; one half-pound of butter, 2/4; one half-dozen eggs, 2/6; one half-pound of tea, 3/-; rent&mdash;the lowest possible under a differential scheme&mdash;say 3/6; two chops per week, one on Sunday and possibly one during the week, approximately 4/-; one half-stone of potatoes, 2/6 approximately; one pound of sugar, 1/8;; a bag of coal, 12/6; soap, 1/-; light 2/-; gas, 3/6; milk 4/4 ½d.  These items amount to £2 13s 4½d.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>He will not.  If one looks at the items which make up the official price index, one finds such items as round steak, rib steak, neck; corned brisket; bacon, streaky rashers; ham, cooked and uncooked, rashers, streaky; fresh pork, fish, eggs, butter, milk, cheese, lard, bread, flour, oat-meal, potatoes, cabbage, onions, oranges, tea, sugar, jam and mixed fruits and marmalade.  There are very many items which are taken into consideration in making up the price index which are not included in my very short list.  A person living either on a contributory or a non-contributory old age pension is therefore at his absolute financial limit just to exist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It does not take into consideration many things which could reasonably be taken into consideration.  I do not think that it will be regarded as unreasonable that a man of 70 years, who is living on the old age pension, having worked in the State for anything from <Col N="1607" /> 40 to 45 years, should want to go and have a pint of stout at night.  I would not think it unreasonable that he should want an odd ounce of tobacco. However, these things are not taken into consideration in the list I read out purely because the money is not there. The man has to decide whether he is going to eat or smoke, and naturally he will eat.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, the wherewithal is not there for the odd drop of brandy.</P>
      <P>Deputy Larkin gave the reasons why people would want to use public transport. In the case of an old couple, one of them may be confined in hospital and the other may want to visit his partner.  It is a dire necessity that he should visit his partner and sometimes the visit has to be made at the expense of a meal, that is, the only way in which the visit is possible is by cutting out one of his meagre meals.  There are other aspects.  It is only reasonable that an old age pensioner should be in a position to take a bus to a place such as Blackrock in the summer and spend an hour at the seaside.  I do not think that the Minister would regard that as unreasonable.  Very often these old age pensioners could be invited out by friends on, say, a Sunday evening&mdash; it would afford them an opportunity of getting away from the one room in which they spend most of their time and they could look at television sitting beside the fire without worrying about how much fuel they were burning&mdash;but very often they find they cannot accept such an invitation because they cannot afford bus fares.  These people have their pride and they cannot explain to their friends that the reason they cannot accept the invitation is that they have not got the bus fare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that Deputies, irrespective of which side of the House they sit on, are human and if they dwell for a short time on some of the points that have been mentioned, they will willingly vote in favour of affording this small concession.  If the Minister wants to introduce this, there are no insurmountable <Col N="1608" /> difficulties in regard to its administration.  I would ask him seriously to consider accepting this motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We can anticipate the Minister's arguments in this matter because this matter has been discussed here before.  In the 17th Dáil, we of the Fine Gael Party tabled a somewhat similar motion and therefore we are only too glad to endorse this motion tabled by our colleagues.  There is the same principle, whether or not the State agency should be used to provide a facility or benefit for the less fortunate members of the community.  If we consider whether or not it is valid for a State agency to do this, I think the answer is a categorical &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.  That being so, we must examine carefully the arguments which the Minister will almost certainly advance to rebut the clear obligation which we consider should be accepted by the State agency in helping the less fortunate members in the community.</P>
      <P>Most likely the Minister will say that the Board of CIE has an obligation to run the company as efficiently as possible on a commercial basis and that it would be improper for it to provide a social service.  CIE are, in a number of respects, already providing a number of social services.  They are already providing, because of obligations which this House has imposed on them, a number of services which, commercially, are unprofitable, which, commercially, are not justifiable but which, socially, are considered as being highly desirable.  Take, for instance, the school service which CIE provide.  CIE provide cheaper school fares during the luncheon break in Dublin and other cities, where children can travel for a penny a journey which could cost up to 4d and 5d and for twopence, a journey, the fare for which would be far in excess of that if they were paying the full child's fare.  If the Minister's argument is a valid one, then CIE should not be providing those cheaper school fares.  In fact, there would be a justifiable outcry if CIE terminated this service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>CIE also provide free travel for children under three years of age. Those are social services which CIE are <Col N="1609" /> providing simply because there is social and national recognition that those services should be provided by a national transport company.  That is not all. CIE, in some cases, are running long distance services, which are carrying no more than school children who are paying grossly uneconomic fares.  There are several bus services, certainly in the Dublin region, running into Dublin daily, carrying nobody but children going to secondary schools.  Those services are running at a considerable loss, commercially, but we consider this is entirely justifiable because it is proper that a State agency should be used to facilitate people reaching their destinations on important business.  I think I am right in saying that the steamer service to the Aran Islands is not profitable.  In fact, I believe it is running at a commercial loss.  Nevertheless, we consider that CIE should run that service.  We consider it right and proper to provide transport for people who are less fortunate than people on the mainland.</P>
    <P>There are several other State agencies which are discharging social duties which are not particularly profitable but which we consider are justifiable. The Electricity Supply Board, for instance, are producing electricity from turf, although to do so is much more costly than to produce it from water, oil or coal; but we consider it is proper that the ESB should provide this service because in doing so, they are doing something which is of advantage to our society and to our nation and which is of advantage, in particular, to those regions of the country where turf is produced.  This, again, is a social function which is being discharged by a State agency which has the same obligations as those which lie on CIE.</P>
    <P>Local authorities provide houses at less than economic rents.  The rents charged are negligible compared with the cost of providing and maintaining those houses for the less fortunate members of the community because again we consider it is socially justifiable that a public authority should provide such a service for those people at less than cost.  Again, apart from CIE, Aer Lingus and the shipping <Col N="1610" /> companies provide cheaper travel rates for students because it is considered desirable that students, who are not earning themselves, should be carried from one place to another at cheaper rates.  We are providing this service for students who are not earning. We are doing so for infants free of charge and we are doing it for all children at rates much less than the actual cost.  All this points to the fact, as the proposer of the motion said, that we should give to the very small percentage of our people in the autumn of their days the advantage of free travel which they had until they were three years of age.</P>
    <P>It would not break CIE to provide this service.  I do not think CIE could possibly suffer any loss if this service were confined to the valley periods, as suggested by the proposer of the motion.  If this service were provided during that time, it is difficult to see what additional cost, if any, would be imposed on CIE in allowing old age pensioners and blind pensioners to occupy seats which would otherwise remain vacant.  Indeed, there is a distinct possibility that by allowing those people to travel free of charge and occupy those vacant seats, they would be accompanied by able-bodied people paying full fare and so CIE could increase their revenue during that period.</P>
    <P>I imagine the proposer of this motion would be prepared, as we in Fine Gael were on another occasion, to accept, if the Minister is not prepared to go all the way and provide free travel, that at least he would provide cheaper travel for those people whom we seek to assist here.  I believe that if CIE even provided cheaper fares for those old age pensioners during the valley periods of the day they would show again in their profits.  It took many years to show CIE that they could make a profit by providing 2d bus fares in the centre of Dublin.  They agreed to do so for a trial period on the recommendation of one of their own bus inspectors.  This showed such tremendous success that CIE have continued the service ever since simply because it means more profit to them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1611" /> We believe that if CIE provided cheaper travel for old age pensioners, their revenue would go up particularly if the concessions were confined to the valley periods of the day.  It is most likely that the pensioners would use public transport during those periods because those are the times they can get about more easily.  I believe the rush hours are beyond most of them. Therefore, CIE have an opportunity to increase their revenue if they provide cheaper travel for pensioners during the valley periods.  If CIE are not prepared to go the whole hog, then they should be prepared to provide cheaper fares for those pensioners during these valley periods.</P>
    <P>We believe this service should be provided, whether or not CIE increase their revenue by providing it.  I have shown that other cheap services which CIE provide are justifiable but I consider that the provision of cheap bus fares for old age pensioners is even more justifiable.  We have the ludicrous situation in which city pensioners are contributing towards the cost of providing travel services for people in rural Ireland.  The city pensioner is obliged to travel frequently by public transport which is subsidising the CIE services in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Minister on several occasions has said that 60 per cent of the Dublin services are uneconomic but he has not, to this day, yet told us which services are not paying and which services are paying.  As I have said to the Minister before, until such time as he enumerates the services which are paying and the services which are not paying, we are not prepared to accept that as a worthwhile statistic.  There are several services here in Dublin city on which run no more than two or three buses per day.  Comparing that kind of service with the service that operates 100 buses is just making a farce of a statistical argument.</P>
    <P>Possibly commercial enterprises could provide services for the old age pensioners free of charge or at lesser rates.  We all commend people to do this.  There are several substantial cleaning firms in this city which clean <Col N="1612" /> old age pensioners' clothes at nominal rates.  There are cinemas which in the afternoons provide cheaper accommodation for old age pensioners.  There are also places of entertainment which from time to time provide free shows for old age pensioners.  All these people are able to do that and they are making a profit.  It should be possible for CIE to provide the same or cheaper services for those people.</P>
    <P>CIE may quite rightly say they test everything by what advantage they get out of it.  Goodwill would flow to CIE from what is suggested in this motion&mdash; the provision of free transport for the less privileged members of the community. This would engender more goodwill for CIE than a change of colours, the changing of destination scrolls and the changing into two languages, neither of which is spoken, I suggest, because they are neither Irish nor English now.  Providing the kind of service recommended in this motion would greatly enhance CIE in the public eye and it is something which they should seriously consider.  This is such a simple suggestion that it would not be proper to cloud it with too many side issues.  I anticipate the Minister's arguments but I hope I have knocked them down before they are put up.  I have to leave the House and I may miss the Minister's contribution but I shall read it with great interest.</P>

      <P>As the House knows, this question has been raised on a number of occasions.  On each occasion while I have been Minister I made it clear that the Government have, since 1957, helped the people by raising the social welfare benefits to the maximum degree.  They have been increased considerably and this motion I would regard as a very natural one in view of the fact that we are all seeking to improve the lot of people with low incomes.  Contrary to what Deputy Ryan suggests, there is nothing wrong in suggesting this form of social service.  It might be provided by CIE. He referred quite rightly to the fact that certain concessions are provided by CIE.  Certain losing services are provided for the sake of the public weal. <Col N="1613" /> There is nothing illogical in the motion or anything wrong with it.  I have sympathy with those who propose this motion.</P>
      <P>The difficulty is the method by which the service can be administered and the numbers involved, as well as the principle of providing a considerable ancillary benefit to recipients of social services as compared with increasing the general level of their social services.  Some Deputies suggested that this was not a serious problem for CIE.  But the motion covers all old age pensioners and blind pensioners in the State.  It goes beyond Dublin and there are 146,000 people receiving old age pensions in the State or nearly 1/20th of the population. Of those, there are 22,300 in Dublin city, so, concessions would be offered to quite a considerable number of people.  Quite obviously, the administrative difficulties involved would be considerable, certainly far greater than in the case of arranging cheaper fares to schoolchildren.  I think, perhaps, Deputies have not realised the problems of CIE if this proposal were adopted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>CIE has actually made a concession to blind persons in necessitous circumstances in Dublin city and in those cases certification of their blindness is effectively proved by the National Council for the Blind. About 900 people benefit from this concession.  The concession is single fare plus one-third for a round journey. It is provided in connection with those using the rail services and in Dublin city bus services.  The resolution, as I have said, goes beyond the concession granted to blind pensioners, of whom there are some 6,000 in the country altogether.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also believe that if this were done there would be a demand for an extension of it to other people.  It would be quite natural that persons receiving disability pensions, who are convalescing, unemployed persons and widows with large families would inevitably <Col N="1614" /> demand increases in the scope of this concession.  I think there would also be a demand for reductions in other services provided through State assistance or Government aids.  It seems to me that when you look at the whole problem it would be better for us to increase the social welfare benefits as quickly as we can in the course of the next few years.  That, again, as everybody knows, depends on an increase in production, an increase in the prosperity of the nation.  The changes that have taken place since 1957 in the levels of social welfare benefits have been considerable and they are due to a growth in the State's national income and to a growth in industrial and agricultural production and all the other services from which we derive our wealth.</P>
    <P>A good deal has been done to improve social welfare services.  The national income has gone up since 1957 by 73 per cent.  The maximum old age non-contributory blind pension in 1957 was 25/- and in 1966 it is 47/6, an increase of 90 per cent.  In the same period, the cost of living has gone up by 29 per cent and the cost per passenger mile of the Dublin city bus services has gone up by 36 per cent, so that although we recognise that the non-contributory pension is not as high as we would like it to be, it may be some considerable benefit to those who live with their families and who are in comparatively better off circumstances. It may be supplemented by private charity and by Dublin Corporation home assistance in the case of people who live alone.  In spite of those factors, obviously we would all like to see it raised but nevertheless progress is being made.</P>
    <P>The non-contributory pension for the poorest class of applicant is up by 90 per cent as against increases in the cost of living of 29 per cent and an increase in the Dublin city bus services of 36 per cent.</P>

That again shows that progress is being made and I would like to see, as I am sure everybody in the House would, the progress continued in future years.</P>
      <P>I have made inquiries to see how far this principle has been adopted in the neighbouring island where they have twice the national income per head that we have here.

      <P>I think I have made the position clear.  This kind of resolution is a very natural one but I think there is a better way of achieving the same objective.  To propose free travel for 146,000 people in the community is something which would lead to many other precedents being created and the best thing is to look forward to the growth of the social welfare benefits under several headings, not only that of old age pensioners, who are very deserving, but also those who have to face the hazards of life and who have a small income and those who, through no fault of their own, have been unable to secure employment.  I should like to see all those people having their benefits increased through the growth in the prosperity of the State and the willingness of the taxpayer to transfer the necessary money for the attainment of that objective.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister has just said, this is a pretty simple motion. It is a recurring motion as he says.  It has been brought up here before and I was very surprised at the kind of answers he gave to this particular motion.</P>
      <P>The Minister's case, in brief, is that this kind of concession will have to wait because he prefers instead an actual increase in the amount of pension paid to old age pensioners from the State.  Now that is a very laudable principle.  The real tragedy about the case of the old age pensioners is that this particular attitude to their plight has landed them with the present low rate of old age pension.  What we ask is that something be done for them in the here and now, not waiting for the national income to increase and not waiting for the lofty things the Minister is talking about but something that can be done here and now to deal with the plight of old age pensioners.</P>
      <P>The Minister has painted an alarming picture of what would happen if this concession were granted because of the well-known charitable instinct of the Irish people.  Other categories of people would look for concessions. He painted a dark picture of people spinning around in buses and people wanting spins on buses and people in Dublin looking for free rides on public transport with the good wishes of Dáil Éireann.  I do not think 23,000 pensioners in Dublin would get on Dublin buses and would not get off.  The experience of those local authorities who have approached this question in Britain is that no such situation has in fact occurred.  It has been the typical &ldquo;no change&rdquo; attitude of those who do not give such concessions that if you give the concession to a particular class, there is no knowing where it may end.  But, in fact, the practical situation in Britain and elsewhere has been that only those old age pensioners who needed this transport used it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No reference has been made to the fact that bus fares have gone up enormously in Dublin in recent years. It is also true that in winter months especially, old age pensioners have to <Col N="1619" /> travel on important errands, to dispensaries or to collect their pensions, and they have at the moment to brave extremely inclement weather because they cannot afford the bus fares to and from their destinations.  One of our suggestions was to utilise Dublin transport in the valley periods.  I fail to see the logic of the Minister's argument that while it is possible to reduce fares for school children, it is not possible to do so for old age pensioners, as if any man or woman of 70 would feel like spinning around on free transport just for the fun of it.  The Minister might, by a flight of the imagination, try to put himself into the position of the man or woman who exists on the extremely small amount given by way of old age pension and try to see how that man or woman approaches life.  It is certainly not getting on a bus and going around to see places.  These people would use this service only when it was necessary for them to do so.</P>
    <P>I would suggest also lowering the level of fares and, in their own interests, CIE could find that such an enlightened policy towards a deserving section of our population would be far more beneficial to their image than repainting their stations or even appointing area managers because we know at the moment this company is in need of holy water from some direction. I would suggest that such a concession to old people would certainly remind the public that there are human beings involved in the administration of CIE because, very often, the public are under the impression that this is not, in fact, the case.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister was sincere when he spoke about the intimate connection between gross national product and the way we treat our old age pensioners.  I know he was being sincere when he spoke about the improvement over the years but I wonder if the time has come when we should not be satisfied to clap ourselves on the back that an improvement has occurred over the years in the case of social welfare.  I wonder, indeed, if the time has come when <Col N="1620" /> we can no longer congratulate ourselves on the idea that some progress has been made in this field because I should like to know&mdash;if this is to be the measure of their improvement&mdash; why the old age pensioners must wait in the queue of other deserving cases as our prosperity increases.</P>
    <P>What will happen to them this year when we are not going to hit any of the targets?  I wonder what pressure will be put on the Government to improve their position this year. Remember that the stomachs and needs of people remain stable whatever the statisticians tell us about the state of the economy.  It would seem to me to be a simple step by CIE, a human step by CIE and it would remind the people once more that CIE is supposed to be their property because we see little evidence that this House or any other democratic power has any check over that company.  I do not see that there would be any abuse of this beneficial move for this section of our community.  I do not see that it would be abused by these people.  It has not been abused abroad or in any of the local authorities in Britain who have brought in this measure and whom the Minister likes to say have so much more gross national product than we have.</P>
    <P>Let us not compare our situation with that in Britain, where their payments are so much in excess of ours and where foodstuffs are so much cheaper than in this country.  Though this is an agricultural country, I would say that an old age pensioner in Dublin finds it much more difficult to live, buy food and other commodities in Dublin than his counterpart in London.  If they have found it beneficial to give old age pensioners this simple concession in Britain, I can assure the Minister the granting of this concession here would not open the gates to anarchy.  I am not in the least bit convinced by the answers the Minister gave here tonight that it would open up a dangerous precedent, that there would be other people looking for the same concession.  The Minister can plead it would be better for a pensioner to <Col N="1621" /> get more at the moment but I think the Minister will agree with me that, looking at it realistically, he cannot say there is any guarantee that there will be any upward increase in their pensions over the next few years.</P>
    <P>I do not know if anybody has carried out any study as to how long, on average, old age pensioners draw the pension but I would say it is a very poor consolation to an old age pensioner to know that there has been a gradual improvement in his pension since 1957 to the present time and to be assured also that in the years ahead, perhaps with the continued progress in our gross national product, there may be other good things in the pipeline for him.  I think we would be showing a greater sense of sincerity by giving this concession now in transport, transport which no old age pensioner uses except for very good reasons, transport which no old age pensioner would use to the extent of the alarming picture painted by the Minister of 23,000 pensioners crowding on to buses in Dublin city.</P>
    <P>I am surprised that his Department, who have been so long requested to bring in such a measure, have&mdash;up to his speech tonight&mdash;carried out no investigation in relation to this request. A responsible Minister tonight gave us the old clichés that it would be a dangerous precedent, that there were too many old age pensioners, that he would prefer to see the money go on to their pensions.  I am surprised that the Department of Transport and Power have done so little investigation in relation to this elementary right of an element in our population whom we are all agreed should be helped. To think that these are his reasons and that he should invoke such reasons to refuse this concession to old age pensioners is, in my opinion, a great tragedy.</P>
    <P>I have said that CIE could do a great deal of good in the public eyes by granting this elementary concession to old people in Dublin and in other cities.  It would be a help to them here and now.  We would have no objection if the Government, in addition, could <Col N="1622" /> improve the general conditions of old age pensioners but they should not plead that they prefer to see these things coming from the State Fund in general taxation; they should not plead this as their preference for excluding the giving of this elementary concession to old age pensioners here and now.</P>
    <P>Especially now, I would appeal to the Minister, with the coming of the winter months in which many old people contract colds, influenza and pneumonia which finally send them to their death, to get his Department to look at this motion once more.  He knows as well as we do that this motion will continue to appear on the agenda of this House until some concession is made to the spirit of this motion.  I would suggest that his Department get down seriously to examining what would be the realistic numbers they could anticipate using these services, whether there is any possibility of reducing fares for old age pensioners, whether there is need that they should be restricted to the valley periods in using this transport in the urban areas.</P>
    <P>They should come out with an honest assessment of how they could meet this problem so that at least we could remove this hardy annual from the Order Paper.  Really, it is a bit late in the day for responsible Deputies, in 1966, when all politicians in this House are committed to greater social responsibility and social justice, to resort to all sorts of fashionable clichés in dealing with the less well-off sections of the population.  It is a bit late to think that a public service&mdash;supposedly owned by the people and supposedly there for the benefit of the people&mdash; cannot be used to give some solace in their last days, some help, some convenience to old people with inadequate payments from the State, facing the winter months in which they will need transport.  I certainly am extremely unhappy and displeased with the reasons the Minister gave for refusing to accept this motion.  I earnestly urge him to get these droves of management consultants, with all this decentralisation of power that has taken place in CIE, around the table and if it means <Col N="1623" /> sacking a few, he should sack them anyway to make way for this concession.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;than Dublin.  Old age pensioners and blind pensioners have to use public transport in the rural areas as well as in the city.  I am very familiar with the city because I spent very many years in it doing business. I have mixed with the very poorest in Dublin down at the North Wall and in the side streets.  I have mixed with the workers and I know their problems. One great problem which they have here as well as in the rural areas is that the pensioners have to travel.  The cost of living is very high for people in the low income groups and they are hard-pressed. We have to consider the value of money today, the increased cost of living and the increased cost of transport. Deputy Cluskey figured out what it would cost a pensioner to live in the city and I thought it was a starvation diet.  He left out many items that cannot be considered as luxury items.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to support the Deputies who have already spoken.  I appeal again to the Minister to reconsider this whole question, and not only to consider free transport for these people in Dublin city but in the rural areas as well.  In my area people have to travel seven or eight miles to collect their pensions and they have to pay pretty stiff fares. The fares have been increased.  This is very rough treatment of people who deserve better.  The majority of the people we are talking about were born before the turn of the century.  Many of the men were the people who laid down the railroads and they did it for a pittance.  That was in the days of <Col N="1624" /> British rule.  They provided our railway stations.  They did the hard work.  Now they are on in years and are getting old and infirm.  We are lacking in consideration for these people if we deny them free transport on the few occasions on which they would be compelled to avail of it.  In fact, it is really unbelievable that our native Government would deprive the weaker section of the community of free transport.</P>
    <P>The Minister made the point that there are 146,000 of these people, but they do not get up early in the morning and travel at the peak periods when the workers are going to work or returning home.  They are inclined to get up at 10 o'clock or 11 o'clock, and if they were provided with free transport, they would avail of it when the seats in many buses and trains are practically empty.  I cannot imagine that they would create any great congestion or any great panic if they were provided with free transport.  I cannot visualise that situation cropping up.</P>
    <P>Here again we have the same kind of Ministerial answer given, the kind of thing we have come to expect when something reasonable is proposed by way of private motion by ourselves or by the Labour Party.  The people opposite want to shoot it down straight away.  They advance that sort of argument to try to beat us down, to try to prove that what we are saying is ridiculous, or is not a sensible suggestion, and cannot be implemented.</P>
    <P>Even this evening the Minister went to the extreme of trying to make us believe that disabled persons would be the next category who would have their hands out for free travel vouchers.  The Minister should know that the majority of people who are in receipt of disablement benefit automatically have free transport to the clinics.  That is the rule in my county wherever it can possibly be provided by the local authority.  If they are not able to go to the clinic or hospital from their own resources, if they communicate with the secretary of the clinic, a voucher will be provided by the local authority. Taken by and large, they are not a class of people who would be seeking <Col N="1625" /> free travel vouchers from CIE because of this proposal by Deputy Larkin.</P>
    <P>When it comes to the weaker section of the community looking for anything, it is amazing how the Government can think up arguments against them.  They know that the people on whose behalf we are speaking are the weaker section of the community, but they are the people this Government always want to reduce to even greater poverty, if possible.  This evening we had a situation in which thousands of pounds were spent bringing gardaí from the four corners of the country on free transport&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to mention a point that has already been referred to many times in the debate.  It concerns the operation of the means test as it is applied to applicants for social welfare benefit.  Its operation is particularly hard in the case of widows trying to establish entitlement to widows' pensions.  I should like the Minister to note that this is particularly so in the case of widows on small-holdings, the type of case where a woman finds herself trying to carry on a farm after the death of her husband. The means, as disclosed by the investigation officer, will be based, particularly in the southern counties, on the produce of milk and so on.  Frequently, in those cases loans have been negotiated by the husband when alive and there is a commitment to repay them, something that cannot be avoided.  Therefore, the income of the widow is not what it appears to be as obtained from the local creamery.  In cases where there is a continuing obligation of making repayment in respect of borrowing by means of which the income of the holding was raised, this should be taken into account by the local investigation officer.  He should also have regard to the amount of money that must be repaid and the fact that the farm must be carried on in the absence of the breadwinner.  Deputy Murphy already referred to this question.  I ask the Minister to consider the operation of the means test and see how the regulations can be modified to make it <Col N="1627" /> more acceptable to people who feel aggrieved in this matter.</P>
      <P>Another section of the community to which I wish to draw the Minister's attention is that composed of very small shopkeepers in villages and smaller towns.  The Minister knows of the growth of the larger shops and supermarts and as a result people who traditionally eked out a living in small shops are now very hard pressed.  It is not much use estimating their means from the sale of goods without taking into account their circumstances otherwise. I found in a couple of cases&mdash; and this was true of elderly widows&mdash; that they had to obtain the goods from the local supermarket and then sell them at a few pence profit.  In such circumstances, we should be able to devise a system of means testing which would be fairer in its operation.</P>
      <P>Specifically, I want to refer to the operation of the scheme which the Minister announced two years ago to provide assistance for people living on small farms in congested areas.  I want to draw his attention to one particular case which is typical of many.  The scheduling of areas has been done on a basis which is difficult to understand. It is hard to see why certain areas, for instance in my own constituency of West Limerick, were selected, while others were not.  I know the line must be drawn somewhere but I cannot understand why certain electoral divisions were included and others excluded. In the main, the position should be that if there are smallholders anywhere, they should benefit, if that was the Minister's intention, to enable them to eke out a living.  The scheme should be uniform in operation and should not be confined to designated areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to refer to the case of a constituent of mine who does not make any secret of his name.  He is Mr. John T. Aherne, Glensherrold, Carrickkerry, who sought and obtained a qualification certificate No. M. 18737. He is a married farmer living on a smallholding with five young children. He was in receipt of the allowance which was applicable to him after a means test.  He felt that this was some <Col N="1628" /> help in enabling him to remain on his holding as others did in that area.  A time came when he got less than 24 hours notice to turn up for work on an emergency employment scheme.  This was at a time of the year when he had cut his hay and, by arrangement with neighbouring small farmers, it was his week to take the milk of the others to the creamery.  He pointed out that he could not turn up until he had the hay saved; there was nobody else to do it.  He was then refused assistance on the ground that he failed to turn up for work when notified.</P>
    <P>He appealed and appeared before an appeals officer of the Department. He pointed out that he had been constantly seeking work, outlined his circumstances and said he felt he was being treated most unfairly, as were others in this matter.  He thought he would be restored the benefit but instead he received notice from the Department through the local office that the appeals officer, whose decision in his case was final, had decided that the applicant was not genuinely seeking and unable to obtain suitable employment under section 15 (b).  The notice gave two specific dates, one being the day on which he was summoned to work with less than 24 hours notice, on which he had failed to turn up for work.</P>
    <P>He pointed out to the officer concerned the grave hardship involved for him.  He said that in his efforts to secure employment, his name had been on the books of Limerick County Council for 16 years for the job of lorry driver but he had never been called. Twelve months previously he applied to Shannon Meats, Rathkeale, but was never called.  He applied to the Forestry Division for work and offered portion of his land to them in the hope that he might get employment.  He was asked how he had lived prior to the social welfare scheme coming into operation and he replied truthfully that he had acted as part-time salesman for milking machines which had earned him £130 in 1964.  He set out to sell milking machines in 1965 but because of the circumstances in which credit was not available to farmers and in which hire purchase arrangements had tightened <Col N="1629" /> up, he was unable to sell the product and consequently, though on paper he had sold quite a number of machines, for six months he had been working for nothing.  He tried to get work from building contractors, pointing out that his sole income was the money from the milk of six cows, that he had to pay for grazing and that he had contracted with the Agricultural Credit Corporation for accommodation in respect of which repayments at this stage amounted to £40 16s 8d annually.  He had to support himself, his wife and five children on the milk of six cows for five months.</P>
    <P>I feel sure the Minister did not mean that the regulations should operate to deprive such people of benefit and I appeal to the Minister to clarify the situation.  When this scheme was introduced, most people realised that qualification certificates were necessary to get benefits.  I know of two other cases, single men, in the same area who were awarded 3/- a week and had to travel seven miles to the garda station to sign for that sum.  I do not think that is the type of benefit the Minister had in mind or this House had in mind in regard to schemes of social assistance like this, and there is an obligation on the Minister to ensure that regulations governing such schemes should be spelled out clearly and unequivocally so that all might know what they are entitled to.</P>
    <P>There is the means test according to valuation of holdings.  There are localities and circumstances in which the land is poor and in which a different type of means test would be fairer.  For instance, the amount a person is able to earn from a small holding could be taken as a gross figure and allowance made for vouched expenses.  I urge the Minister to bear some such test in mind. If he does so, he will ensure that John T. Aherne and others like him will not be excluded.  The only alternative for such people is to give up their holdings and emigrate.  The Minister should ensure that the benefits he had in mind for them will reach them.  At the moment the Act operates against them as if they were indolent and did not wish to work. <Col N="1630" /> Surely we should be able to devise a system to ensure that where people are naturally hardworking and trying to rear families on small holdings, people who do not refuse regular employment when it is offered to them will not suffer by the operation of these rules?  There are circumstances in which people on small holdings must co-operate with one another in the transport of milk to the creamery.  Their wives must help them with the hay, their children being too young in most cases.  In such circumstances, it is not reasonable to penalise a man for not turning up for work.  We must be understanding in these matters.  The official who has the job of implementing the scheme should not be tied too tightly: he should be allowed to use his discretion in cases where he knows the circumstances warrant it.</P>
    <P>The only other matter I wish to deal with is that involving applicants for illness benefit.  I suggest there should not be such an unreasonable time lag between the application for benefit being made and its receipt.  I know the Minister is more than sympathetic to such applicants: I have had experience of it in a case I brought to his notice.  When a person is sick and has sent in a certificate of his illness from the local medical officer, he should not encounter such delays in payments.  It is unfair that it becomes necessary to make an approach to the authorities on behalf of such people.  Sometimes the local authority have to be approached for assistance to keep such people going until the sickness benefit turns up. This, incidentally, imposes a burden on the local authority who have to pay the amount out of their own funds and who, in turn, must investigate the person's entitlement.  Even for this benefit, the applicant has to wait for some time, thus extending his agony.  I urge the Minister to do everything possible to speed up these payments, to lessen the time-lag between the receipt of sickness certificates and the despatch of payments.</P>
    <P>They are the only comments I wish to make on the Estimate.  Specifically wanted to mention this new type <Col N="1631" /> social assistance for small farmers in my area and to ask the Minister if this is an arbitrary imposition confined to scheduled areas or does the Minister intend to vary these scheduled areas and give benefits to people in areas not now scheduled?  If we segregate people any further, it will be naturally thought that we are imposing inferior status on people in certain circumstances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="StephenCoughlan" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is with reluctance that I address myself to this question of social welfare payments, because it is outrageous that we as public representatives have to make application time out of mind for the just demands of our people.  The Minister can blow about all the money he is pouring into social welfare; it may be all right in figures but in application and from the point of view of practical experience, an appalling state of affairs prevails.  I as a public representative have publicly denounced on many occasions, and have got the unanimous support of Limerick Health Authority, the delays in regard to social welfare payments. No voice has been raised against the statements I have made in Limerick Health Authority in connection with the working of the Department of Social Welfare.  Numerous times I have denounced the incompetence, the indolence and the inhumanity of the officials of the Minister's Department in the operation of this Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When a person makes a claim, a justified claim, for any of the social welfare benefits, there is no compliment or charity about it.  I have sent to the Minister three or four complaints every week in regard to the indolence of his Department.  The procedure, as far as I know, is this.  A person makes a claim in the city of Limerick for a widow's pension, an old age pension or any other social benefit to which he or she is entitled.  What happens? The claim is sent to Dublin to be numbered in the Department.  The claim is numbered in the Department and it is sent back to Limerick for investigation.  It arrives in Limerick and the unfortunate man there is inundated because of this centralisation of claims in Dublin.  He will go off on <Col N="1632" /> a circuitous route that will suit himself in regard to the investigation of claims.</P>
    <P>I read a letter at the last meeting of Limerick Health Authority from an unfortunate widow in my constituency. The letter is dated 30th August, 1966, and I quote:</P>
    <P>I applied for a widow's pension last May and you directed me to get a form and fill it in and bring it back to you, which I did.  Since then I have sent the Department of Social Welfare all certificates necessary, birth, marriage and my husband's death certificate, etc.  The pension officer called on me about two weeks ago.  I would be very grateful if you would put in a good word for me that I might get a widow's pension as I am £300 in debt.</P>
    <P>She got her pension only last week. She had to wait from May until 16th August for the pension officer to call, and she got her pension last week because of the representations I made to the Department.  Yet the Minister tells us he is doing this, that and the other in regard to social welfare.  That is only one of the many cases I could quote here.</P>
    <P>I applied in April, 1965, on behalf of a widow and I got no acknowledgment of it until 18th August of the same year.  I can give the name and address.  I applied on 24th August on behalf of a person who had already sent in six certificates, and got no acknowledgement or reply.  I applied again in mid-July on behalf of another person, and although six certificates had been sent in, no payment was received. I applied again on 31st August and the person did not receive benefit until November.  I made another application on 5th November on behalf of a person who had sent in six certificates and received no acknowledgment.  I made an application on behalf of a man in John's Square, Limerick, who had forwarded three certificates and received no payment.  I applied again on behalf of a man from Galbally, in whose case nine weeks elapsed and no payment was received.</P>
    <P>I have many letters here which I could quote for the Minister if he <Col N="1633" /> wants to take heed of these unfortunate people who are depending wholly and entirely on the accurate and up-to-date working of his Department.  This is not a personal view; it is the unanimous view of Limerick Health Authority that you and your Department have been indolent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister and his Department have been indolent and negligent in the handling of claims. What is the situation that has resulted from the Department's indolence and negligence?  Applicants come to their public representatives and we go to the home assistance officer to make representations on their behalf.  I have letters here from widows.  We plead with the home assistance officer for £1, £2 or £3 and a couple of turf vouchers during the winter period for these people. Where does the money come from? It comes out of the pockets of the taxpayers of Limerick city and county because of the ineptitude and indolence of the Department.  Every excuse is made.  Certificates are sent up week after week and nothing is done.  We, as public representatives, have to get in touch with the home assistance officer, the local labour exchange manager, and then we have to get in touch with the Department of Social Welfare to inquire if a cheque is being sent out to the applicant or if it is on its way or what are the Department doing about it.  We get the same old answer, that the matter is being investigated.  I want to alert the Minister to this fact, that Limerick Health Authority unanimously discredited his Department on account of these delays.  I am not speaking personally in this matter.  I speak now as a representative of Limerick Health Authority.  That authority is composed of fairminded people, who know what the Department are doing and who know of the incompetence, indolence and inhumanity associated with the Department in the investigation of claims.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It then comes to the point where we make representations on behalf of old age pensioners.  We send up whatever <Col N="1634" /> claims have to be submitted.  Claim forms are completed.  We get a stereotyped reply.  Can anyone imagine the effect on one of getting these acknowledgments in respect of unfortunate persons who may have been born in the early 80s or 90s of the last century? I have returned these documents on numerous occasions to the Department. This piffle is sent to us and we are asked to transmit it to the applicants or to advise the unfortunate persons who may be only holding their bones together.  The educational facilities available in the 80s and 90s of the last century were not as good as those available today.  I do not know what we are supposed to do with these acknowledgments or how we are supposed to explain to an applicant that her claim for old age pension is being investigated and the investigation may take five or six months.</P>
    <P>Then they call this the Department of Social Welfare.  I have another name for it.  The people of Ireland have another name for it because of the indolence, incompetence and inhumanity in the working of this Department. It is about time the Minister applied himself in an energetic and intelligent manner to the work of his Department. I cannot understand why in the case of a person who lives in Limerick county her application for a widow's or old age pension must be sent to Dublin to be stamped and then returned to Limerick perhaps two weeks, four weeks or three months later for investigation.  Will the Minister deny that that takes place?  He cannot.  If you think that that is social welfare in operation, your opinion and mine are at variance.  Nobody will make a claim for a widow's pension or any other form of social benefit unless she is forced to do so.  I treat all these claims that I meet as of immediate urgency and on many occasions I had to phone your Department.</P>

      <P>The Minister's Department. I have done so on behalf of persons who had been waiting two or three months.  It is my duty to do <Col N="1635" /> so.  The people who come into the office at 10 a.m. and stamp a claim from Limerick and send it back for investigation about two months later have no humanity.  There is no humanity there and there is certainly no social welfare there.  If that is your parsing and analysis of social welfare, it is not ours.  The quicker you realise that fact, the better.</P>
      <P>We come to another section of this alleged social welfare and the great benefits that are being poured out.  You are pouring out money like a man with no hands, according to yourself, but I want to bring to your notice&mdash; to the Minister's notice&mdash;claimants for unemployment benefit who are not regarded as claimants until they have signed at the labour exchange on three days.  Take the case of dockers who line up along the quay wall in all kinds of weather at 7.30 every morning. There are 360 in Limerick.  A number of them are called for work and the rest proceed to the labour exchange. The same thing happens on the second day.  On the third day, men who were not employed on the first two days may be called on to work.  Their claim is broken.  Where is the social welfare in that case?  These people get one day's work in three.  There is a five-day week in operation.  Therefore, they get one day's work a week.  Are you aware of that?  Is your Department aware of it?  These men get £3 5s. a day when they are working.  They lose five days benefit at the labour exchange.  What are they to do?  What would anybody do with a big family living on casual work?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What about the people whose employer refuses to stamp their cards? What does this Department, this great beneficiary that doles out all things to all people, do about it?  I have here details of cases where an employer has for years refused to stamp cards.  The employee taking the employer at his face value thinks everything is grand. Then work stops; he goes to the labour exchange and makes his claim.  He is told he has no cards there for two or three years.  On 14th April and 15th May, I sent the Minister ten cases of <Col N="1636" /> one employer who refused to stamp cards for years.  The Department wrote back and said it was up to the employee to proceed to do this, that and the other.  These unfortunate men were working on the road laying a sewer.  I am not the only one in this House who now knows about this case.  What has the Minister done about seeing to it that that employer stamps their cards?</P>
    <P>Now we come to the case of the unfortunate citizen of this country who happens to be out of the country for some time.  He goes to the employment exchange to make a claim and is told it will not be considered on three grounds.  This is an Irishman married to an Irishwoman.  The three grounds given were: (1) he had at any time before making such application been ordinarily resident in any urban area for a period of five years or for a number of periods which amount in the aggregate to five years: (2) he has been residing in any urban area for one year immediately preceding the date of application; (3) he has had at least three months employment within the year immediately preceding the application.  That letter is dated 30th September, only one moon ago.</P>
    <P>There is a married man who because of his skill was taken by his company to Germany, where he spent four or five years training in a factory. Because of his wife's ill health, he comes back, makes his claim in the employment exchange in Limerick on 30th September and is refused on these three grounds.  Where is the humanity there?  We all have another name for that Department, whether or not the Minister is aware of it.  On more than one occasion, you and your Department have been unanimously condemned by Limerick Health Authority because of these delays.</P>

      <P>It is hard to be patient when you are dealing with incompetency and inefficiency.  What can you do but be ruthless?  Why blame me?  Now we come to that section of our community who have spent years working for our greatest enemy, the man we never wanted to feed or serve.  These are people who through their own ability and ambition were granted benefits in England.  They come home to spend the autumn and winter of their lives in Ireland.  They bring with them from this archenemy of ours, according to some of the people over there, the benefits they have well earned.  Then they apply to the Department of Social Welfare for their old age pension. They are told: &ldquo;You do not qualify. Somebody else is feeding you; why should we?&rdquo; Because they get £2 or £3 a week pension from Britain, they are automatically disqualified for an old age pension here.</P>
      <P>What right have we to deprive these people of what they have well earned from somebody else?  Why should we interfere?  Is it not another trick of the loop effort by the Minister and his Department to hoodwink these people by telling them they are entitled to benefits when he knows in his heart and soul they will never qualify for them?  Let us be honest and tell the people the truth at all times.  But you come in here and tell us the amount given this year as against last year.  It is not so long since we could buy ten Players cigarettes for 6d.  I do not know what they are now&mdash;I do not smoke&mdash; but I am sure they are more than 6d. We could say we gave you twice as much for cigarettes or whatever it is. That has no bearing.  It was the same thing with the Minister for Local Government when he told us last night about what he was giving for housing. There is no comparison between figures last year and this year.  Anyone can juggle with figures and the Department of Social Welfare is the master juggler.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister tried to centralise the working of his Department but he has <Col N="1638" /> confused it, befogged it and muddled it tragically at the expense of the unfortunate social welfare claimant. Just remember the letter I quoted&mdash; and that is only one.  I can produce them and I have produced them at meeting after meeting of Limerick Health Authority and I have got the full support of that authority on all my claims and in my charges of indolence and ineptitude on the part of the Department.</P>
    <P>That is all very well.  Some of us can wait a week or a day but how long can these unfortunate creatures wait? Every second day of the week, I have to put them into my car and bring them down to the local assistance officer or to the local dispensary.  A turf voucher will come some time: a couple of quid will come some time.  This is what has been created by this alleged uplift and reorganisation of the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>Do the Department of Social Welfare know anything at all about their business?  They are not burdened with intelligence and they are not vitally aware of the needs of the people as we are, as public representatives. I feel very strongly about this.  I want to impress on the Department and whoever is in charge of the Department's staff&mdash;I do not know who is in charge of it&mdash;that we have sent up not one resolution or two or three resolutions from Limerick Health Authority with regard to the incompetence, indolence and inhumanity of their approach.  We shall pursue the matter until we get satisfaction for the claims of the unfortunate people who are waiting six months, five months, eight-weeks' certificates going up, six months' certificates going up, and nothing coming and they are falling on the shoulders of the local ratepayer to keep them going in the meantime. You have shifted their cost from your general bill on to somebody else.  You are now trying to shift it over to the taxpayers of Limerick City and County.</P>
    <P>While I am in public life, I shall expose the shifting of the responsibility of this Department on to the local taxpayers.  If you think or if the Department think that home assistance <Col N="1639" /> will carry the people, because of your indolence, ineptitude and inhumanity in your approach to the Department, you are backing a loser as far as we are concerned.</P>
    <P>I know this and have gone through it.  There is no week that representations are not made by me to this Department twice, four times or six times, because of indolence, ineptitude and inhumanity.  Do the overpaid and underworked people who work from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. ever think of anybody else?  Do they ever think of the unfortunate people who are starving and waiting for the money to buy a loaf of bread, a pint of milk and the half-stone of coal to try to keep body and soul together? If these claims were treated locally in the first instance instead of all this nonsense of sending a claim to Dublin to have it numbered and stamped and in two months' time sent back to Limerick for investigation, and another two months elapsing before it is investigated, we should all be better off and we should have a happier community.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether my advice falls on stony or on fertile ground tonight but, be it stony or be it fertile, that is a matter for the Department. If it does not fall on fertile ground, we shall continue to pursue the matter. As far as Limerick Health Authority is concerned and as far as Limerick Corporation is concerned, we shall continue to embarrass this Department until such time as the light is switched on and these people see what unfortunate people throughout the country are suffering because of&mdash;let me repeat it&mdash;the ineptitude, inhumanity and indolence of the Department of Social Welfare.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not claim to speak on behalf of any corporation, health authority or council, but, having listened at length to some of the speeches, I would say I have not heard any widespread condemnation of the administration except by one Deputy. One can claim to speak only on a subject one knows.  As far as representations to the Department are concerned <Col N="1640" /> I can say, offhand, that I have as great a volume of representations to make to that Department as any Deputy, some of which relate to very difficult claims.  I have not met with any inhumanity or indolence from any official engaged in the administration of social welfare.</P>
      <P>It is easy to stand up in this House and to condemn officials who, perforce, must administer the Social Welfare Acts in relation to the various subjects presented to them.  I want to say, offhand, coming after the last speaker, that I dissociate myself from his ugly epithets and some of the charges he made here.  Those of us engaged in this public work know that, in this year, the Department of Social Welfare is responsible for the disbursement of £42¼ million.  That is a huge sum in relation to the size of our Budget.  We also know the Minister's statement that this sum represents an increase of roughly £10½ million over and above what was originally estimated and this increase in expenditure stems from the increases given under the Social Welfare Act of 1965.</P>
      <P>When we come to speak about spending money, we all must, if we are realistic, have some regard to whether or not we will be able to raise the revenue necessary in order to redistribute it in the best possible way, in the fairest, most equitable and just way; it therefore behoves us to have regard to the amount which can be levied by way of taxation in any given year in order to raise the necessary revenue.  A sum of £9½ million was necessary to provide for the increases in social welfare and social assistance generally. There is an upward trend in expenditure in every direction and I think the sum of £1 million extra was mentioned as representing the upward trend in expenditure here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we speak of social welfare, we have to consider it in the context of the general aim of Government policy. The general aim of Government policy in its economic programmes is, with the help of various specialised agencies, to generate more employment or to create more work.  In that connection we have such agencies as An Foras <Col N="1641" /> Tionscal, Córas Tráchtála, Bord Fáilte, and so on.  All these agencies or organisations were established with the general aim of providing work.  Over and above these agencies, there are other incentives in the way of financial supports of one kind or another for both the agricultural and the industrial arms of the economy and there, again, the aim is to create more employment, leading in time, it is hoped, to a position in which there will be no longer any need for unemployment assistance or, as we call it the dole.  We all look forward to the time when unemployment assistance will no longer be necessary and the greater the success of the programmes and of the various agencies I have mentioned, the less need there will be for State assistance socially.</P>
    <P>There are one or two specific points with which I should like to deal.  In the interim, the twin social problems of unemployment and emigration will continue, especially in the congested areas.  These areas are peopled in the main by smallholders.  I might mention here that the unemployment assistance scheme, as we know it, was never designed for smallholders.  I do not, therefore, envy the Department of Social Welfare its task of trying to apply this scheme to smallholders.</P>
    <P>That brings me now to a part of the scheme which can be described as both unfair and unjust so far as the smallholder is concerned.  I refer to the Employment Period Orders.  These orders are difficult to apply and, if one goes through the mass of correspondence in relation to these Orders, one sees at once the difficulty there is in relating them to smallholders, especially smallholders in the congested districts.  There are two such Orders&mdash;the First and the Second.  The theory behind the administration of the First Employment Period Order is that for part of the year a farmer of over £4 valuation is not deemed genuinely unemployed and seeking work because it is accepted that he is fully occupied on his holding.  I want to relate that condition to the Second Employment Period Order.  The theory here would seem to be that during this period of the year, agricultural work is available <Col N="1642" /> for all hands.  It is my submission that both of these Orders are unsound so far as the congested areas are concerned. Lest the Minister might think that I have an axe to grind in this matter, I shall give him an example which will support the case I am making, namely, that the Minister should seek to abolish those orders.</P>
    <P>Take, for example, the Second Employment Period Order and examine the position in relation to it.  We shall see that work on the land may be available for smallholders who are deemed to be not fully employed on there own holdings if&mdash;and where there is an &ldquo;if&rdquo;, there is a want&mdash;if they live in areas in which there are larger farmers who might require seasonal labour.  The point I want to make here is that in congested areas where the holdings are of a similar pattern, it is simply not true to claim that farm work is freely available.  This brings me back again to the First Employment Period Order which contends that because a worker lives on a £3.19 rateable valuation, he is available for work throughout the year, while his neighbour down the road, on a £4.1 rateable valuation, and who may perhaps be living in worse conditions, is not deemed so available.</P>
    <P>Here we come to a gap and this is, shall we say, a serious omission in the social welfare scheme which annoys me.  The worker who lives on a £4.1 rateable valuation is deemed available for work for only 18 weeks of the year. Here it will be seen what a difference 2/- in the valuation may make.  The 2/-on its face value is neither here nor there in this day and age but if we take it in the context of the administration of the scheme, it makes a vast difference to the farmer who lives on the slightly higher valuation.  The point is that even if it is admitted that the rateable valuation is a reliable guide for the amount of time taken up in farm work&mdash;and, mark you, I should not like to have to argue that case&mdash; one could say outright that the dividing line is surely not as sharp as defined in the Employment Period Orders.</P>
    <P>If there have to be Employment Period Orders, the duration of the <Col N="1643" /> Orders should quite obviously be related to the valuation of the farm in a more gradual, reasonable and logical way.  In support of that, one could say that those claimants who are disqualified from unemployment assistance by the Employment Period Orders referred to are not disqualified on the grounds of need.  For example, there is no suggestion that at any period of the year their means are such as to render them ineligible for unemployment assistance which, incidentally, as we all know, is at the lowest rate of all forms of assistance.</P>
    <P>Now, I come to another aspect of this matter which is also bound up with the enforcement of those Employment Period Orders and which is equally difficult to understand.  In fact, one would be at pains, going through the exercise, to get a reliable grasp of the method which the Minister has to use in order to arrive at a decision for the purpose of the enforcement of these Orders.  It is apparent that the total income extracted from the farm is assessed, divided by 52 and the weekly vote of unemployment assistance is reduced by this amount during the 18 weeks for which it is payable.  In my submission, this is grossly unfair.  The workers in this group are paid unemployment assistance for 18 weeks only because they are deemed unemployed for this period and they are denied it for the remainder of the year because they are deemed employed.</P>
    <P>There is another point to note in this regard.  If a man works for part of the year and is unemployed for the remander of it, what he earns while he is employed is not assessed as means when he is unemployed and therefore, in equity and to be fair to the smallholder, the money he earns, which must surely be earned while he is employed, that is, during the operation of the Employment Period Order, should not be used to reduce the unemployment assistance during the period of the year he is unemployed. This is a complicated explanation and it is hard enough to grasp the principle of it.  A further point to <Col N="1644" /> note here is that if the total income earned from the land is to be spread over the whole year and used to reduce the weekly amount of unemployment assistance, then surely this reduced amount should be paid for the whole year.  Again, I would submit that if unemployment assistance is to be withheld for portion of the year, it should be paid at the full rate for the remainder of the year.</P>
    <P>The position at present is that a smallholder under £4 rateable valuation is assured of an annual income, even though it may be at a low enough level, from unemployment assistance plus whatever he has from his farm, which is supposed to equal the amount of unemployment assistance which would be payable in his case had he no means.  If his rateable valuation is over £4 he will have this income for 18 weeks only since it is for only 18 weeks his income is supplemented by unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>Finally, for the remainder of the year, his income will be below unemployment assistance level, which, as I indicated here, represents the lowest standard of living in the scale of social assistance.  As I have said, God knows the Minister tonight has listened to enough criticism&mdash;maybe some of it fair and some of it unfair&mdash;but I should like to wind up by making the case that, as I mentioned earlier, the unemployment assistance scheme was never drawn up to be applied to smallholders. Yet, with all, we must take it on present terms.  I would say, in fairness to those people I mentioned, that the Minister should move to abolish the injustice contained in the Employment Period Orders.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not my intention to detain the House to any great extent but rather to draw the attention of the Minister to what I consider to be a few matters of outstanding importance in relation to the poor sections of the community.  At the outset, let me say, with reference to speeches that have already been made on this Estimate&mdash;and I have been a Member of this House now for very close on a quarter of a century&mdash;that <Col N="1645" /> I have received no discourtesy whatever from the Department of Social Welfare.  Neither have I at any time made representations to the Minister for Social Welfare.  The occasion arises very frequently when like most Deputies, a letter has to be written to the Department.  When I had occasion to write, I was always extended the courtesy of a most satisfactory, comprehensive and very favourable reply.</P>
      <P>I should be lacking in my duty if I did not express my appreciation to the staff of the Minister's Department.  The Department of Social Welfare must have an extraordinary volume of correspondence to deal with.  Compared with the Land Commission, the Department of Education or any other Department, the Department of Social Welfare have to deal with an enormous amount of correspondence.  I have always had what I consider to be a favourable reply.  I never received the slip in Irish which was displayed by Deputy Coughlan.  I cannot say that the Department favoured me any more than any other Deputy.  I should like to support the plea put forward by Deputy Coughlan in relation to the small slips with the reference number on the left-hand corner, the name of the constituent for whom the Deputy is making representations written in ink across the top and the remainder in Irish.  That is a shabby reply to send to any Deputy.</P>
      <P>The services of the staff of the Department may be taxed probably to the fullest capacity.  Even so, I feel that Members of the Oireachtas who make representation on behalf of constituents should receive a reply which they can present to their constituents. I respectfully suggest that the slip which I saw in Deputy Coughlan's hands, and which I never received from the Department of Social Welfare, should not be sent out to any Deputy who makes representation on behalf of his constituents.  I make representations at a very steady rate to the Department but I never received such a slip from them.  An effort should be made to send a Member of the Oireachtas a reply which he can convey to his constituents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1646" /> I sympathise with Deputy Coughlan if he has to present those slips to his constituents in Limerick.  I also sympathise with any other Deputy who has to present them to his constituents. Such a reply should not be sent to any Deputy because a reply of that nature is of little use to the person to whom it is passed on.  I should also like to express my appreciation of the manner in which I have been treated by the staff of the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to couple the Minister with that but I do not think I ever had occasion to ask the Minister for anything.  I never write to the Minister because I always think it is better to send a note to the Secretary of the Department.  Ministers may come and Ministers may go but the permanent head of the Department is always there.  It is a good thing for Deputies that such an impartial officer as the Civil Service head of a Department is there.  It is a very great safeguard for Members of this House from all Parties and for that reason I am only too glad and happy to associate the Minister with any bouquets I have to give to his Department.  In doing so, I may say I never found him display discourtesy because I never asked him for anything.  If I did, I am sure the Minister would display the courtesy expected of any Minister to any Deputy no matter to what Party he belongs.  I can assure Deputy Cunningham it is not my intention to press that.</P>
      <P>I always address my correspondence to the Civil Service head of the Department. I cannot describe myself as a personal friend of the Minister, but there are many members of the Government whom I have known intimately for many years and I never hesitate to send a note on any problem that comes my way.  However, so far as the Minister for Social Welfare is concerned, if I ever have to get in touch with him, I will have no hesitation, but I would expect the same courtesy as I have received from his Government colleagues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1647" /> This question of social welfare is a very big problem.  It is very easy to offer criticism and very easy to offer solutions, but in this country I feel that more attention should be given to the Department of Social Welfare. I really feel this is an Estimate on which every single Member of this House can address himself at great length.  It is the one State Department which deals primarily with the poorer sections of our community, those who cannot provide for themselves, those who because of old age, of unemployment or of ill-health or disablement cannot cater for themselves. They are helpless to defend themselves and they are unable for one reason or another to take their place as citizens and provide fully for themselves.  For that reason, the Department deals with a very specialised section of our people.  I have always expressed the opinion that it should be a Department which would lend itself to helping those people rather than to making it difficult for them and adding difficulties to their already great burden.</P>
    <P>There are many people throughout the length and breadth of this country who have been deprived of the means of providing for themselves. The only assistance they get to keep body and soul together is the assistance from the Department of Social Welfare.  It would be quite wrong to say that charitable organisations will be able to cope fully with relieving all the distress that arises.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not possible.  For that reason, it is only right to pay tribute to the charitable organisations &mdash; the Roomkeepers' Society, for example, the various conferences of the St. Vincent de Paul Society and the many other charitable organisations&mdash;who seek to make the lot of the poorer sections of our community easier.  They have performed an outstandingly great service.  Again, we must admit that it is not possible for the State to cater for every single case of distress that is likely to arise.  I do not know of <Col N="1648" /> any country in the world that has such a comprehensive social welfare programme in operation that it caters for every single case of hardship.</P>
      <P>No matter what way the Department of Social Welfare endeavour to cater for the poorer sections of the community, there will always be a need for charitable organisations and I hope that the general public, you and I, a Cheann Comhairle, and all of us here who have the faculties available to us to provide for ourselves will realise that.  There is a bounden duty on all our people to endeavour, so far as possible, to act in a Christian way in assisting the poor and the needy.  I want to say that in this country whatever charitable offerings were made, the recipients were always grateful.  It is worthy of note that it is the poorer section who give the most generously to help the poor.  That is a nice and fine spirit.  Our people are noted for their kindness and their very great charity.</P>
      <P>The Minister must be well aware of the great Christian, charitable and national work being performed by those charitable organisations.  No matter what allowances the State may give, there are many poor people and those are the people with whom I am greatly concerned.  You have not alone hundreds but thousands of people who have left in them a degree of self-pride, who are too proud to make it known that they are in poor circumstances, in distress and poverty.  It is a grand thing that there are people still who possess this great gift of self-pride.  I really feel that, in the city of Dublin where we have the lights of O'Connell Street and the grandeur of the cars parked thereon, the crowds that may be coming from cinemas, hotels and ballrooms, at the back of all that, there must be a vast amount of hidden poverty and distress.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should hope it would relate.  In those types of cases charitable organisations help to relieve the Department of Social Welfare and the recipients.  The Department of Social Welfare have a responsibility towards those people.  Through their generosity charitable organisations help people who are too proud to beg, too proud to seek home assistance, too proud to seek unemployment assistance and too proud, in other words, to solicit public assistance.  I would like to see a complete recasting of our social welfare code, so that the vast number of people at present in dire want and need will be catered for.</P>
      <P>The Department of Social Welfare at the present time have rather comprehensive schemes of one type or another.  To deal determinedly, courageously and energetically with the many social problems we have, our first objective should be to rid our country of distress and want and poverty.  That is the responsibility which the Minister has, the responsibility which any Minister for Social Welfare has, to rid the country of distress and poverty and want and see to it that the old, the blind, the sick and the widows at least have at their disposal sufficient funds to enable them to live and to live independently. The feelings of people who cannot live independently&mdash;by that, I mean people who are not able to earn and provide for themselves&mdash;must be terrible.  It is bad enough to be in receipt of the allowances paid by the Department of Social Welfare, which are entirely insufficient, but the fact that those people have practically to live on charity and on the assistance provided by the Department must be an extraordinary load of worry for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should have social services which will ensure that all our old age pensioners will be able to live in Christian deceny.  I respectfully suggest that at the present rate of non-contributory or even contributory, pension. with the cost of transport, the cost of electricity, the ever-increasing rates and the cost of living soaring higher and higher every day, old age pensioners who have nothing but the allowances provided by this State must find it <Col N="1650" /> extremely difficult to keep body and soul together.  That is why, and I have seen it on many occasions, the recipients of old age pensions have to apply to the local authority for home assistance to supplement the rate of old age pension paid to them.</P>
    <P>I often thought that it would be much better to have the old age pension steadily increased and to pay the old age pensioner a pension on which he would be able to live independently than to compel him to seek supplementary allowances from the local authority.  In many cases the local authorities are doing their best to provide home assistance for the old, the blind and the widows.  I feel that this is an effort on the part of the Government to evade their responsibilities in so far as the Exchequer is concerned and to make greater demands on the local authority for the provision of these supplementary allowances of home assistance.</P>
    <P>When the world is gearing itself to everything that is modern and up-to-date, when a man is preparing to reach the moon, when Governments are spending millions on rockets and men are circling the earth in space, we must ask ourselves how can the millions be provided for these things when it is so extremely difficult to find money for widows and orphans, the blind, the lame, the sick and the poorer sections of the community who find it so difficult to keep body and soul together?  I am not suggesting that Ireland is about to take part in the race for the moon but we could provide no better service than looking after the old, the blind and the widows.  That is the section of the community who deserve our sympathy and it is the section who have not alone been given a deaf ear but also the blind eye by practically all Governments since the State was founded.  Let us express the hope that, with the great social advances being made throughout the world, an effort will be made to provide fully and well for those poorer sections of the community.</P>
    <P>I might suggest to the Minister that between now and this time 12 months <Col N="1651" /> when he will present his Estimate again he might seriously look into the recasting of our social welfare services. In addition, he might find it possible to see that the local authorities will be relieved of their responsibilities in that regard and provision made from State funds because it is all the same.  It is robbing Peter to pay Paul.  The State might as well provide fully and relieve the local authority or let the local authority take over full responsibility, which would be absolutely impossible. I do not think it right that we should have the State and the local authority at the same time doing work which should be undertaken by the State.  The State is responsible.  I think it was the late President Kennedy who said in very striking terms that a country that cannot provide well for its poor cannot long afford to protect its rich.  We all have a duty to provide for the poor and our present social welfare services are falling far short of what would be expected.</P>
    <P>It is true to say that there has been a good deal of criticism of those services and the manner in which they are being administered.  My memory takes me back to the days of free milk, free boots, free beef, free doles, free turf.  I will not elaborate on the free beef tonight.  There is nothing provided in this Estimate for free beef.  We have had in this country seeds sown by Fianna Fáil and those seeds were sown by the allocation of free beef and free milk, free boots and free doles.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister will agree that our people are equally as proud as people abroad who are to a great degree far more independent than we are.  If I am a judge of the Irish people, they want nothing for nothing.  They want to be independent.  It is very degrading for any man or woman to have to queue up for free turf and it was very degrading for the unfortunate people years ago to have to queue up with vouchers for free beef.  It is degrading for people to have to accept free milk.  When we have to provide free beef, turf and milk, it shows that there must be a high degree of poverty. I am not suggesting that any steps <Col N="1652" /> should be taken to deprive people of those facilities because you must have them until you have something better with which to replace them.  It is better to have our people independent.</P>
    <P>I have often said, and I make no apology for saying it, that the free dole was the curse of this country.  I often said that it was a good effort to pauperise our people.  It did not give them the encouragement to work, if work was available.</P>

Would it not be better for the Minister, instead of paying this free dole for, let us say, three, four, five, or six days per week, to subsidise an employer so that instead of free dole being paid out to an unemployed person the employer would receive an allowance to enable that person to be put into productive employment?</P>

      <P>May I raise one point to which I have been giving serious thought for some time past?  It is children's allowances, for which the Minister is responsible. Everyone can draw children's allowances. Whether a person has an income of £100 a year or £100,000 a year, he can draw the children's allowances.  I do not see anything wrong with that but I find it very hard to reconcile the fact that a person with an income of £5,000 per year can draw children's allowances, and at the same time under the same Department, an old age pensioner can have great difficulty in trying to get his full rate of pension of 47/6d per week.</P>

      <P>The manner in which old age pensions are investigated is, in my opinion, most unreasonable. I should have hoped that the Minister for Social Welfare would have directed, by way of circular to all investigation officers, to all pension officers, some instruction to exercise a greater degree of charity when it comes to assessing means.  I was alarmed at the manner in which some pension officers calculated means for old age pension purposes. I was alarmed at the manner in which investigations were carried out in connection with claims of widows for widows' pensions.  I was astonished at the long delay in disposing of claims for blind pensions.  Certificates of blindness have to be obtained but I can never understand how it takes several long months to dispose of claims for blind pensions.  If a person is blind, he is blind and there is no more to it, and the first certificate of blindness ought to be sufficient to qualify the applicant for a blind pension.  Everybody knows, that if a person is blind, he cannot work and he is suffering from a physical disability which renders it impossible to provide for himself and his family.  Would the Minister undertake to expedite all claims for blind pensions and make a ruling in his Department that, from the date the application is received, the case should be finally disposed of within four weeks?  Indeed, there are old age pension appeals in the Minister's Department&mdash;some of them close on 12 months.  Again, I cannot understand the long delay in the Minister's Department or whether it is that the appeals officers in his Department are already overwhelmed with work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know what has happened since the inter-Party Government were in office but I can readily recall, when they were, that day after day these files of appeals would be disappearing <Col N="1655" /> and there appeared to be, at that time, more speed and efficiency in disposing of appeals for old age pensions, widows' pensions and blind pensions. But in recent years, particularly in the past three or four years, there seems to be some unreasonable hold-up.  I agree with Deputy Coughlan when he says there appears now to be a long delay in disposing of certain claims for social welfare benefits.</P>
    <P>I know cases in which six, eight and ten medical certificates were submitted and no payments were made, because of investigations being carried on in the Department.  I have a feeling that one of the reasons was that, in many rural districts, we had what was known as the National Health Insurance agent at one time; he then became the social welfare agent for the paying out of social welfare benefits; he then disappeared when it came to the time for retirement, was not replaced, the certificates were sent to the head office in Dublin and the payments were sent out direct from there.  In areas where the National Health Insurance agents&mdash;as we knew them of old &mdash;existed, there now seems to be a long delay and the whole affair seems to be more unsatisfactory than it was at the time when it was being disposed of by them or by the social welfare agents.</P>
    <P>We have cases in which certificates have gone astray, in which certificates have not been received in time, in which certificates were not posted, and there are cases where the Department of Posts and Telegraphs did not exercise speed in the despatch of these certificates to ensure the delivery of the cheque at the end of the week.  I am sure the Minister for Social Welfare knows that a sick person unable to work, will have his wife and five or six small children depending each week entirely upon the cheque which must come from his Department by way of sickness benefit.  It is a shocking disaster in any home if that cheque does not arrive at the end of the week. When the cheque does not arrive it is too late to get home assistance; the home assistance officer cannot be immediately contacted.  Even if he is, it <Col N="1656" /> may be late on the Saturday afternoon by the time the vouchers are made available and the whole thing is most unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>An effort should be made to expedite matters&mdash;even at the expense, if it is necessary, of increasing the staff dealing with social welfare benefits&mdash;where a worker is ill and has his wife and family entirely dependent for their very existence on the payment of social welfare benefit.  The responsibility should be placed on the heads of the Department concerned to see that every sick person within the State receives the benefit due to him on the day on which he is entitled to receive it.  It is only country members of county councils and country members of the Dáil who realise the hardships these people have to endure when there is not one penny piece in the house to provide for the necessaries of life for a whole week-end.</P>
    <P>The day has gone in this country when shopkeepers would trust people in poor circumstances.  We have now reached the stage when all the small shopkeepers themselves have gone out of business.  We have now reached the stage at which the supermarkets are doing the business in our big provincial towns.  That means that a person must have cash in hand.  The poorer section of our people depend on the payment of social welfare benefits each week.  They must have money for the shopkeeper.  Otherwise, they must remain hungry.  I am sorry to say that in many part of the midlands, I have known cases where the St. Vincent de Paul Society, the local clergy, and the local TD, have had to come to their aid to prevent a family from suffering absolute starvation from Saturday to Tuesday morning.  This is a situation which should not prevail in a Christian country as this.</P>
    <P>This Minister should call together the officers responsible for dealing with sickness benefit and should give them definite instructions that if they are short of staff they should say so. It is his duty and the duty of the House, to provide the money so that there will be ample staff to pay sickness benefits to the poor people who <Col N="1657" /> need money each week when the certificate comes.  Doctors do not give certificates for fun.  They have certain professional standards and they give certificates only to people who cannot provide for themselves, who cannot work, and who are entitled to certificates. When they reach the Minister's Department, the cheque should go down post-haste to the applicant for sickness benefit.</P>
    <P>Most of the problems I have with the Department relate to sickness benefit.  I am satisfied that nine out of every ten cases are genuine.  I can never understand why delays are caused by crossing files from one place to another to be initialed and marked `checked'.  Surely we must realise that in the meantime local authorities are cut down on funds?  Practically every county manager is doing his best to reduce the amount paid out in home assistance.  Superintendent home assistance officers have been instructed not to encourage people to seek home assistance.  May I ask the Minister while the Department are not speeding up the payment of sickness benefit, what are the poor people to live on?</P>
    <P>The Minister can perform a duty of great national importance to the poor section of the community.  We must bear in mind that when a person is well off, the least of his thoughts are for the poor person who has not a penny piece to provide his next meal. Poor people are often lonely, worried and sad.  How many of our well to do people whom God has blessed with all the riches of this world and with contentment shun the poor?  That is why there is a great responsibility on the shoulders of the Minister.  He is the link between the Government of the day and the poor who cannot speak for themselves, and who can only be spoken for by Deputies who can express their grievances in this House.</P>
    <P>Whatever the wealth and riches of this country may be&mdash;and there is no clear evidence of that today&mdash;there are very poor people in the country.  There are many who are on the verge of hunger.  That is why the Minister would be well advised to have conferences in the Department to ensure <Col N="1658" /> that there will be no delays in dealing with old age pensions, widows' pensions and other payments.  I presume the Minister would require more money to increase these benefits and that would require legislation.  May I throw out a hint to the Minister?  We will expect him to exercise the great influence he has with the Government to see that his Department will receive a greater allocation of money for poor people, because the responsibility of providing for the poor rests on his shoulders.</P>
    <P>I want to direct the attention of the Minister to the state of many labour exchanges.  I do not know whether the Minister has passed them over to the Department of Labour.</P>

However, this is now a matter for the Department of Labour and let us hope we will be able to say a word about it tomorrow, and we will solicit the sympathy of the Minister for Labour in the provision of employment offices and accommodation for people who are unfortunate enough to have to resort to those offices, so that they may at least have a roof over their heads while transacting their business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Coughlan raised the next point with which I want to deal.  I can never understand why British pensions are taken into account in the assessment <Col N="1659" /> of means for old age pensions in this country.  That is wrong and I hope it will be remedied in the not too distant future.  There are many ex-service men who were courageous enough to give their services during the 1914-18 war, and who were granted pensions by the Crown in return for their services, their bravery and their skill in the field.  It is regrettable that when an increase is granted in those pensions by the British Government, steps are taken by the Department to take back from the pensioners the money given to them by the British Government.  If the British pensions are increased, the Department decreases the pension here.  It is the British Government giving with one hand and the Irish Government with two hands taking back what the British Government had given.</P>
    <P>If a person is fortunate enough, gallant enough and brave enough to have won for himself a pension for services outside this country, it is only right that that should be completely disregarded.  I could never understand why payments from outside the State were not disregarded.  Maybe in his reply the Minister will tell us if he will do anything about this during the next 12 months.  Quite recently a large number of British pensions were increased. I know one case in my constituency in the town of Mountrath where an old age pensioner had a British pension and the moment that pension was increased, the Department of Social Welfare asked for the pension book which was later returned with a reduced rate of pension.  What was granted by the British Government was taken by the Irish Government.  That is wrong; it is something of which the House should take a serious view. When pensions are provided by the British Government, we do not expect them to subsidise the Department of Social Welfare.  When the British increased their pensions, what really happens is that the Irish Department of Social Welfare reduce the Irish pensions.  That is wrong and the means test should be altered so as not to take into consideration income which may be in the form of a pension from outside the State.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1660" /> In the case of very small farmers who apply for unemployment assistance, there is a serious situation. There are many small farmers whose incomes are less than £4 a week.  At this very moment we have a number of them lying outside on the steps of Government Buildings.  I believe it is teeming rain on them and the least the Minister could do is to give a hint to the Minister for Agriculture to open the door and let them in.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>If they are small farmers with an income under £4 a week, they are worthy of mention. Those small farmers whose incomes are so very limited and who can be catered for by the Department of Social Welfare should be treated more generously when they sign on for unemployment assistance.  I have known quite a number of them in my own constituency and it is true that very many of them have very small holdings, and in some cases, by the time rent and rates are paid, the income would not be anything like £4 a week.  The Minister should be generous in dealing with people in such circumstances.  Judging by the way things are going, it will not be too long until most farmers have their incomes reduced to the region of £4 a week.</P>

I do not intend to deal with the problems of the farmers but it is no harm to draw the Minister's attention to the fact that a social problem exists in connection with small farmers.  The Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries may be dealing with the greater problem of farmers, but the Minister for Social Welfare has this problem of the very smallholders and I am asking him to be more generous in the future than he has been in the past with those people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Those of us who are <Col N="1661" /> concerned about the least fortunate in our society would fail in our duty as public representatives if we did not avail of the opportunity of pointing once again to the defects, inadequacies and anomalies which exist in our archaic and outmoded social code.  A great man once said&mdash;his monument is behind me in this House; I refer to James Connolly&mdash;that the freedom of a nation is measured by the freedom of its lowest class and that every upward step of that class to the attainment of higher things raised the standard of the nation in the scale of civilisation and that every time that class was beaten back into the mire, the whole moral tone of the nation suffered.</P>
      <P>We judge true freedom on these Benches by the standard of life of the most distressed of our citizens.  We have always asserted that it is the fundamental duty of any Christian Government not merely to safeguard people in their everyday lives by providing employment, job security, decent conditions and good wages and all the things that go with the good life but that, in particular, there is the responsibility to safeguard us in sickness, in infirmity, in widowhood and in old age.  It has been said by some Government spokesmen, in an attempt to present a facade to the House and the people of the country, that all is well with social welfare.  We have got these annual increases in benefits of 2/6 or 5/- and sometimes 10/- depending, perhaps, on the situation whether a by-election, a general election, a local election or a Presidential election is in the offing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been said that some £40 million will be spent in this Department: the Minister contends there has been an increase of £9 million or £10 million in his Vote this year.  That may be so but I do not know how this extra £10 million is being spent.  Certainly, it is not spent on those most in need of it, the least well off of our community.  It may have gone in administration costs, in status increases or some other way but certainly the section which should have benefited most, the non-contributory element, the assistance element, the widowed, the <Col N="1662" /> old aged and the unemployed did not benefit at all, I submit, from the extra millions which the Minister so vaingloriously spoke about in the House.</P>
    <P>Let us not forget that this social welfare code is still constrained by the most niggardly means tests the art of man could devise.  Unfortunately, the game of politics was played with the increases given.  We have had dual Budgets this year.  Last year, in the one Budget, an increase of 10/- a week was provided.  It got lavish headlines in the daily newspapers, big coverage on television and sound radio, the Government organs, especially, making capital out of that allegedly great increase, due to the benevolent Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    <P>It was only a few days later, when we had had time to look closely at the social welfare code, that we began to realise only those whose incomes did not exceed £26 a year would benefit by this increase.  Anyone whose means were assessed at more than ten miserly shillings per week did not receive that increase of 10/-.  The House will realise in respect of the 5/- a week increase provided in the two Budgets this year that it was a disgraceful, even a despicable thing for a Government and a Minister for Social Welfare to boast about it and about the 10/- increase last year and later to say: &ldquo;But no one gets this&rdquo;&mdash;the &ldquo;but&rdquo; was in small type&mdash;&ldquo;if his income exceeds 10/- a week.&rdquo;  Obviously, thousands of those in need did not get that 10/-increase. Therefore, the Minister perpetrated a fraud on the poverty-stricken people and his Government stood behind that fraud.  As I have said, 5/- a week extra was granted to social welfare beneficiaries this year and it contained a stipulation, again in small type&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I wish to point out that in respect of the increases in assistance benefits, to non-contributory widows and orphans and old age pensioners in particular, only those people who had in the words of the Minister no means whatsoever derived benefit from the 5/-increase. It was bad enough to apply a means test of £26 a year last year but to come along this year and say on the one hand that they were giving an increase in social welfare benefits&mdash;&mdash;</P>

We asked him to rid his mind and the minds of his advisers of the idea of imposing these terrible means tests which insist that one will get an increase in social-welfare benefit only when it has been proved one has no means whatsoever.  Let them not talk about being a great benevolent Party or a great Christian Government who have the welfare of the aged and the infirm at heart when by legislation they make it virtually impossible for anyone to benefit&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join with Deputy Flanagan in bringing attention to the Department's treatment of beneficiaries in this country of British pensions of various kinds. The Labour Party played a prominent part in recent years, particularly in recent months, in the endeavour to get the Department to realise the urgent necessity of bringing about a reciprocal agreement between this Government and the British Labour <Col N="1664" /> Government in regard to social welfare beneficiaries under the British code living in this country.</P>
      <P>In years gone by, many thousands of Irishmen were obliged to leave this country not because they liked the bright lights of Piccadilly Circus but because they were denied the opportunity of earning a livelihood in their own country.  Having spent many years in England, many of them received benefits of various kinds. Some of them joined the army and participated in World War I and World War II and, in recognition of their valour in the field, earned British war pensions.  If they died in action, their widows and their children benefited. Many others spent a number of years working in England and qualified for high rates of old age pensions, retirement pensions and unemployment and sickness benefits, as the case may be.  When it came to retirement, those men and women decided to come home.  It transpired that any increase in their pensions from the British Government were not applied to them while domiciled in the Republic.</P>
      <P>We in the Labour Party sought to redress this injustice and were successful in getting the Minister and his counterpart in the British Labour Government to evolve a reciprocal arrangement whereby any future increases in British pensions would be applied to beneficiaries in this country. That agreement is now in operation. However, a dismaying feature has appeared: this odious means test is being applied to the munificent pensions awarded by Harold Wilson's Labour Government because our Minister for Social Welfare has decided to re-investigate the means of thousands of beneficiaries who are entitled to pensions here.  Many of them have suffered a reduction and considerable numbers have had their pensions taken away altogether.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 23rd June this year saw an army of social welfare officials rampaging throughout the country on this mission.  Because of the co-operation between this country and Britain, the Department immediately became aware of every person who had <Col N="1665" /> secured an increase in his British pension. All pension books were immediately called in by the Department and drastic reductions, and in some cases withdrawal of pensions altogether, took place on a very large scale.  This is deplorable. It was most dishonourable that having sought a reciprocal agreement by which our people were to benefit, our own Irish Government should dissipate this increase by the withdrawal of Irish pensions. I asked the Minister at column 1264, Volume 223, of the Official Report of 23rd June, 1966, if he would state:</P>
    <P>the number of persons in receipt of non-contributory social welfare benefits who had these benefits reduced consequent upon the increase of British pensions paid under the reciprocal arrangement with Britain; and what was the average reduction in these benefits.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Social Welfare replied:</P>
    <P>So far, 1,504 non-contributory pensions have been withdrawn or reduced, the average reduction, including pensions withdrawn, amounting to about 30/-.</P>
    <P>This was the shabbiest, meanest and most despicable act of which any Government could be guilty.  This was money from a foreign source, which might be regarded as an emigrant's remittance, would certainly be regarded as an important factor in bridging the gap in our balance of payments, would be regarded as part of our invisible assets.  This revenue was brought about by the benevolence of a British Labour Government, and it was intrinsically wrong for the Minister and his Department to apply this niggardly means test and undo all that we sought to achieve in this reciprocal agreement.</P>
    <P>I want to put on record the feelings of outrage and dismay of all the recipients of British war pensions, British retirement pensions and other British pensions involved.  I would ask the Minister to relax the legislation in respect of the categories of persons to whom I have referred.  If he thought it worth his while to bring about a <Col N="1666" /> reciprocal agreement with Britain whereby all future increases would benefit Irish recipients in this country, the least he should do is to see that increase was not dissipated by any action of his Department.</P>
    <P>I want to protest also about the shabby manner in which it was done. The many thousands of people involved were given no intimation by the Minister's Department as to why this was happening.  They were merely instructed to send back their Irish pension books, whether it was an old age pension or a widow's pension.  The books were sent back; weeks and months elapsed and, despite the representations of Members of this House, including myself, we could get no indication from the Minister's Department as to what was going on.  In due course, after some months, there were meetings of old age pensions committees in our areas, of which some of us were members, certainly in my area, at which scores of these cases came before us, and it was revealed that many old age pensions were reduced drastically or withdrawn by reason of the increase in the British pension.</P>
    <P>As one who played some small part in trying to bring about this reciprocal agreement, I deplore the action of the Minister and his Department in this instance.  Yet the Minister and his Government would continue to pretend that they and they alone are the conscience of the poor of this country and that they and they alone have done anything worthwhile to help them.</P>
    <P>I have always believed that the social welfare legislation, as I know it, is so framed as to deprive the applicant or the beneficiary of benefit rather than to assist him to secure it at any given time.  It is hardly known to most people that if their income exceeds £3 per week, they have no hope of getting an old age pension.  It is hardly known to most people that there are so many tricks in the social welfare code that it is very difficult to get benefit, and that if they are fortunate enough to get benefit, the legislation is such that they will not long continue to enjoy it.  Some means will be found to disqualify you quickly.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1667" /> A claimant for unemployment benefit must be capable of and available for work.  Benefit may be disallowed on various grounds some of which a claimant would be amazed to know about.  If a claimant has lost his employment by reason of a stoppage of work due to a trade dispute at his place of employment or elsewhere, if he is locked out as an indirect result of a stoppage of work of any kind, he does not receive benefit.  If he has lost his employment as a result of alleged misconduct on his part, he does not get the benefit.  If he refuses what is regarded by the Minister's officials as suitable employment, he is disqualified. If it is felt that he is not availing of every reasonable opportunity to obtain employment, he is disqualified.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am merely pointing out how difficult it is to get benefit and how easy it is to be disqualified and generally pointing out the defects in our social welfare code.</P>
      <P>Arising out of my duties as a member of an old age pension committee I have discovered an anomaly.  It is extremely difficult for the ordinary person to secure a non-contributory old age pension when the rigid means test to which I have adverted is applied. If the income exceeds £3, the person gets no pension whatsoever.  Yet, other categories, such as farmers who hand over their farms to their next-of-kin, particularly a son, are conceded the old age pension without question irrespective of the valuation of the land involved or the amount of money which they may have in the bank, or the standard of life which that family may enjoy.  Without hesitation, the maximum old age pension is conceded while for the ordinary town-dweller a niggardly means test is applied.  This is something which we cannot understand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate the necessity to have legislation which assists people to hand <Col N="1668" /> over their property, especially farms, to the younger generation.  Anything which tends towards that is essentially good.  At the same time, it is difficult to understand the anomaly.  There is a means test whereby maximum pension is granted in a case where a man hands over his property to his next-of-kin but continues to enjoy the full fruits of that property, the opulence, riches, wealth and luxury which go with it and which denies a pension to a poor unfortunate person on the side of a street whose income is as low as £2 or £3 a week.  That is something which members of old age pension committees can never understand &mdash;the flagrant maladministration in respect of two sections of our people, the bending over backwards to give pensions to one section and the full use, or abuse, of the regulations which the Minister could design to see to it that other sections do not get it.</P>
    <P>We would also like to see a levelling up in the amounts of pensions paid as between contributory beneficiaries and non-contributory beneficiaries.  In every instance the rates of pension payable to the non-contributory section are much less than those payable to the contributory sections.  I appreciate that in respect of contributory pensions the beneficiaries have been insured contributors over a long number of years and have paid their share for the insurance stamp every week. I appreciate that the cost of that stamp is considerable at the moment.  The Minister is being credited with an expenditure of an extra £10 million this year and an overall expenditure of some £40 million.  Let it not be forgotten that these social welfare contributors, the working classes, contribute at least one-third of that amount&mdash;7/4d per week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is 7/4 per week deducted from the wages of every <Col N="1669" /> insured male person and 7/- is deducted in the case of every insured female worker.  That is their contribution.  We feel that all working class people, both men and women, would be prepared to contribute more to social welfare if they could be satisfied that the money would go to those most in need.  We would like to see a balancing of the differential which exists as between the non-contributing sections and the contributing sections.</P>
      <P>The contributory old age pension is 60/- per week.  The non-contributory old age pension is 47/6 a week.  In the case of a man and wife and two children the contributory old age pension is £5 7s 6d.  In the case of a man and wife and child the non-contributory pension is 57/6 a week.  These are odious comparisons.</P>
      <P>We do not like the two classes of society which the Minister seems to perpetuate in this code.  Let there be a levelling up and let us eliminate from the Statue Book for all time the odious, niggardly, inhuman means test which is applicable in the case of non-contributory pensions.</P>

Many of the things I am advocating here would not require new legislation but <Col N="1670" /> could be done by a stroke of the pen, by an order of the Minister, in the morning, if he felt in the mood.  This Minister, without introducing legislation or involving me in a breach of order or decorum could, by order, do many of the things which we require to be done.  Certainly, he could, by order, in the morning, decide that the old age pension should be paid at the age of 65 rather than 70 in the case of men and at 60 in the case of women.</P>

      <P>This Party have never hesitated to make available to you all the money required for social welfare purposes but we reserve the right to be satisfied that the money goes to those we feel are most entitled to it.  We have the right to question the manner in which the Minister raises the money and in which he administers it.  We have never hesitated to extend our support and votes when the Fianna Fáil Government required them to provide the necessary means for the assistance of the sick, infirm, aged, widows and orphans, and we never shall.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I searched the Minister's speech carefully for some reference to the workmen's compensation legislation which this House enacted some time ago but found no mention of it.  In 1954, the leader of my Party, Deputy Corish, first set about the amendment of the workmen's compensation code by setting up a Commission.  This Commission sat for a long number of years and brought forward recommendations which were accepted by the Minister and approved and ratified by this House.  It is disturbing in the extreme, despite the long delay in improving workmen's compensation, to find in the Department of Social Welfare booklet for 1966 that workmen's compensation payments stand at the same figure as in the 1950s, that is. <Col N="1671" /> £4 10s per week.  This is despite the fact that legislation was passed by this House to improve these payments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>This booklet is for 1966 but there were supplements issued with it in respect of disability benefit.  There is no reason why the Minister could not issue a supplement in respect of workmen's compensation.  It is to be greatly deplored that the Minister has been mulling over this matter since the leader of the Labour Party set up the Commission in 1954 and that as yet no increase has been made in workmen's compensation payments, despite the political capital made out of it at the time.</P>
      <P>It would obviously take a long time for me to comment on all the aspects of social welfare on which I should like to comment.  I want to appeal to the Minister again to be more understanding of the needs of our people in respect of the administration of the free footwear scheme now under the control of his Department.  Heretofore this scheme was administered by the local authorities.  While it may not have been quite as satisfactory as those of us on public bodies desired, nevertheless it was relatively fair and impartial. Since the scheme was taken over by the Department of Social Welfare, however, it is my experience that this so-called &ldquo;free&rdquo; scheme is costing the poor of this country contributions ranging from 5/- to £1 or 25/- per pair of footwear on the means test basis applied by the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This never happened when the scheme was administered by the local authorities because their officers, knowing the people intimately, their <Col N="1673" /> standards and backgrounds, administered the scheme fairly and impartially. The yardstick now applied by the Minister is such that only those in receipt of unemployment assistance or home assistance receive footwear free.  The other categories, entitled to any benefit whatever, are charged on each pair of footwear.  It would be much better if the Minister particularised the type of person entitled to this footwear rather than have the scheme administered in this ridiculous fashion.</P>
    <P>I am concerned also with the delays involved in the payment of social welfare benefits of various kinds, particularly disability benefit or sickness benefit, as it is more commonly known. Deputy Coughlan is right in adopting an outspoken and indignant attitude <Col N="1674" /> to this question of delay in the payment of disability benefit.  I do not know if the Minister realises the hardship caused by these delays on the family concerned.  If a family is waiting for benefit for a number of weeks, it means they are obliged to seek home assistance.  Mark you, in almost all the cases where home assistance is granted to a family to keep body and soul together pending payment of social welfare benefit, it is repayable to the local authority and is usually recouped by the local authority.</P>
    <P>Progress reported: Committee to sit again.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 20th October, 1966.</P>
