    <Title>Coinage Amendment Bill, 1965: Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Lynch) Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to amend the Coinage Act, 1950, so as to authorise the issue by the Central Bank of a special silver coin on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the Rising of Easter Week, 1916.</P>
      <P>The obverse of the coin will bear a portrait of Pádraig Pearse, the reverse a representation of the Cuchulainn statue in the General Post Office.  Both designs will be on a concave surface. The coin being thicker at the rim than in the centre will have a dish effect.  The edge of the coin will bear the inscription &ldquo;Éirí amach na Cásca, 1916&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Schedule to the Bill sets out the denomination, weight and composition of the new coin.  I am advised by the Central Bank, however, that tests of samples have shown that it will be necessary to amend the figures for standard weight.  I will be introducing an amendment at a later stage when the figures for weight are finally settled. The design and diameter, 1.2 inches, will be prescribed by regulations to be made by me under the 1950 Act.  The <Col N="346" /> denomination of the new coin will be 10/- and it will be legal tender for payment of amounts not exceeding £5. This compares with the legal tender limit of £2 for cupro-nickel coins.</P>
    <P>The Central Bank will arrange for the coins to be available in all bank offices in the State on Tuesday, 12th April, 1966.  It is proposed to make sufficient coins available to meet the demand.  Supplies of a polished proof coin in a leather case will be available some time later for collectors both here and abroad.</P>
    <P>Special coins are frequently issued to commemorate great historical events. It is appropriate that the first issue of a special coin by the Irish Government should be the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the 1916 Rising.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>We welcome this Bill as one of the measures to commemorate the Rising of 1916 and those who made the sacrifices of that time.  I cannot understand the Minister saying that he will introduce an amendment at a later stage.  Surely he could have left the whole thing until this matter about weights had been cleared up?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I could explain that and then the Deputy could continue.  The anticipated weight of the coin was as set out in the Bill as before the House, but in fact it turns out that there is a slight variation in the weight, and, since the weight must be specifically stated in legislation, an amendment is required. It would be my intention if I got the Bill through all Stages today to have an amendment introduced in the Seanad and then have it brought back here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand.  I did think it was more or less a waste of time introducing the Bill and then having to amend it.  The Minister states that:</P>
      <P>The Central Bank will arrange for the coins to be available in all bank offices in the State on Tuesday, 12th April, 1966.  It is proposed to make sufficient coins available to meet the demand.</P>
      <P>I wonder what he means by that.  Will we have a situation whereby the number of coins which will be minted will be such that they will be taken up immediately by collectors to the extent that the ordinary people other than collectors will not have an opportunity of getting these commemorative coins?</P>
      <P>I wonder if the Government are wise in deciding to mint a 10/-piece? It is pretty expensive for ordinary people who want to get this commemorative coin to have to pay out 10/-.  Could they not have made it 5/- or, if they wanted a special denomination, 4/-?  However, these are not important matters.  The important matter is that the House should unanimously agree that 1916 be commemorated in one instance in this particular way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">

      <P>The Minister means the two coins can be used for the next wage increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Deputy O'Higgins, the coin was designed by Mr. T.H. Paget, an acknowledged expert in coin design.  He was appointed as a result of consultations between the Central Bank and the Royal Mint, the Royal Mint being the mint that executes all coinage anyway.  I believe we have got in Mr. Paget the very best man available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think there will be any difficulty about the amendment I shall propose.  It will not make for duplication of discussion.  It will not be a new introduction but an amendment of a detail of the specification of the coin, which the Seanad will have no difficulty in accepting, providing the Dáil allows me to bring <Col N="348" /> the Bill before the Seanad for the purpose of having the amendment effected there.</P>
    <P>With regard to the 10/- unit, I think it is a good thing we have a special unit of our own.  On Deputy Corish's point as to making it a 4/- unit, we have sufficient variation in the coinage in circulation in these islands without other denominations.  I think 10/- is a good denomination.  In addition, the value of the coin makes for a coin of nice size.  Many Deputies will be familiar with the Kennedy memorial coin.  Our coin will be about the same size.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will recall that there had to be a limit put on the number of Kennedy coins bought?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I was going to say that our coins will be minted in anticipation of the demand.  If the demand exceeds that anticipated, it will be possible to have more produced.  Therefore, there will be no question of collectors hoarding them, even though they may ultimately become more valuable than their intrinsic value.</P>

      <P>In reference to the Minister's statement to Deputy Corish that it would not be feasible to have the names of all the signatories on the coin, recently we attempted to have a plaque put up at Kilmainham to commemorate James Connolly.  We were refused permission because the people who are doing such a good job of restoration there said it would be unfair to single out any one of the 1916 leaders without commemorating the others.</P>

    <Title>Houses of the Oireachtas (Laying of Documents) Bill, 1965: Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>
    </P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Lynch) Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>The principal object of this Bill is to strengthen Parliamentary control over statutory instruments by prescribing that documents laid in accordance with provisions in which the period for Parliamentary intervention is not clearly expressed shall lie before the Oireachtas for a minimum period of four weeks in each of which the House in question sits.</P>
      <P>In the case of most statutory instruments, the statute under which the instrument is made prescribes a specific period during which the document must lie before one or both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The enabling statute usually provides that, during this period, the instrument may be annulled or prevented from coming into force.</P>
      <P>In some statues, however, the period is loosely expressed in terms such as &ldquo;days&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;days on which the House sits&rdquo;.  In such cases it could happen that the period for Parliamentary intervention could run its course when neither House was sitting.  To avoid this, the present practice is to treat the period as commencing on the day on which the House concerned next sits.  Despite this, however, Parliamentary control could still be largely ineffective because a sitting day could be followed by a lengthy period of non-sitting days.  Section 3 of the present Bill will strengthen the powers of the Oireachtas in such cases by prescribing a definite period of four sitting weeks during which the instrument will be before the House concerned. I should like to emphasise that this will apply only in cases where the existing statutory period is uncertain and therefore unsatisfactory.  It will not affect the great majority of instruments for which the period is precisely expressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="351" /> A further object of the Bill is to define what is meant by the laying of a document before a House of the Oireachtas.  Section 2 of the Bill states that this means either the action specified in the Standing Orders of the House concerned as constituting the laying of a document, or, if no such action is specified, the procedure followed and accepted by virtue of the practice of that House.</P>
    <P>Advantage is being taken of this Bill to clarify the period during which orders prescribing the fees to be taken in the Registry of Deeds must lie before they can come into force.  The fees in question are prescribed by orders made by the Minister for Justice under section 35 of the Registry of Deeds (Ireland) Act, 1832 and section 9 of the Land Transfer (Ireland) Act, 1848, as adapted.  The presentation provision is contained in section 1 of the Registry of Deeds (Ireland) Act, 1875.  On one view of the existing provision, such orders could not have effect until they had lain before both Houses of the Oireachtas during 40 sitting days, a period which might well run for more than a year in the case of the Seanad.  There will, I feel sure, be general agreement that such an extended and uncertain waiting period would be quite unbusinesslike in the case of a fees order.</P>
    <P>The provision in section 4 of the Bill will enable the Minister for Justice to specify in the orders themselves, as in the case of court and Land Registry fees orders, the date for the coming into force of Registry of Deeds fees orders.  So that adequate notice will be given to all concerned, it is being provided that an order shall not come into force earlier than three months after it is made.  The present provisions of the law requiring presentations to both Houses are not affected by this provision nor does it curtail in any way the existing right of either House to pass a resolution annulling a particular order.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill, of <Col N="352" /> course, is acceptable to us and we appreciate its object, namely, as the Minister says, to strengthen Parliamentary control over statutory instruments. It is true that in recent years it has from time to time become problematic as to what is meant by a stated number of days in relation to the laying of documents before the Houses of the Oireachtas and in so far as this Bill removes the difficulties in that regard and defines sitting weeks and sitting days, it certainly is a step in the right direction.</P>
      <P>May I raise one matter with the Minister, that is, the growing tendency which is carried forward in this Bill to invite this House to legislate with a blindfold over our eyes?  I do not understand why it is necessary, in drafting legislation, to compile together a section such as section 2 in this Bill.  I have looked at section 2.  I have turned it upside down, backwards and forwards and I can only accept that it is intended to mean what the Minister in his speech has said it does mean.  It seems to me extraordinary that we should have to use phraseology of the kind used in that section and it seems remarkable that more and more drafting of this kind is creeping into our legislation here.</P>
      <P>I have mentioned this before.  I think it particularly unfortunate that it should occur again in a Bill put forward by the Minister for Finance. There is a great danger, if those responsible for drafting do not try to seek clarity in the words they use, that we, in this House, will become inoperative as examiners of legislative proposals.  The language, in my view, is unduly obscure.  It is couched unduly in phraseology which is not familiar and it represents a tendency which I think should be curtailed. That is only by the way.  The main purpose and policy of the Bill, in so far as one gathers from the Minister's speech, appear to be acceptable and will certainly have our support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>We also support the Bill.  Indeed, we think the present form of the words used &ldquo;before the <Col N="353" /> House&rdquo; is preferable to the one which, up to recently, was in operation, &ldquo;on the Table of the House&rdquo;.  I was amazed to find, when the Trade Agreement was put through, that somebody did revert to the original: it may have been a case of days gone by or maybe it brought them back some years.  I agree with Deputy O'Higgins about the terminology in this and in many other Bills.  We have the example of people framing Bills which nobody except themselves and the Minister, who is using a brief, appears to understand. I do not know why that should be so. Dean Swift is reputed to have made a comment on this type of thing in his time.  If he were here today he would be horrified.  It is bad enough for the ordinary members of the House who are supposed to know what they are dealing with but people outside this House are horrified when they find documents passing through Parliament which cannot be understood by most people in the country.  The fact that the Minister himself can produce a brief which explains in a reasonable way what is meant is proof that there is no reason why archaic phraseology should be used in this Bill, as well as in other Bills.  That is my only objection to the measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dunne remarked recently that we would require a sizeable lorry to carry away the documentation issued from this House if we were to take away with us all the documents that are presented, and for that reason I would not suggest that all the matters laid before the House should be sent to Deputies.  I wonder how many Deputies have been years in the House before discovering that on the Order Paper there is a list showing the documents currently before the House.  If we checked on the Members of the present Dáil, I am sure it would be found that quite a few of them are not aware that that information is listed in that way.  Whether we should have a different system of notice to Deputies is another matter and where exactly the document can be studied and whether or not there are enough copies for a number of Deputies&mdash;on occasion, it has been found not to be so&mdash;are <Col N="354" /> matters.  I should like the Minister to consider while he is attending to this particular Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Anything that tends to give greater control over this type of legislation to the House is relevant.  I join with Deputy O'Higgins and Deputy Tully in regretting the obscure manner in which this Bill expresses itself.  This is a Bill which is of peculiar interest to each Deputy because it refers to a right which a Deputy has to assert Parliamentary control over control which might be looked upon as bureaucratic in the form of a statutory order laid on the Table of the House.</P>
      <P>If the Minister would have regard to section 2, I think he would agree that it is rather obscure in its terms. I am very surprised that an explanatory memorandum was not issued with the Bill.  It would have been in the interests of each Member of this House that he or she should have been made aware of the contents and the intent of the Bill.  I discussed this section last night for some time with Deputy O'Higgins and neither of us, lawyers as we are, could quite understand what the Minister was after: I do not know if the Minister himself knows.  In his speech, where he purports to explain section 2, all he does is to repeat it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 2 (a) really explains itself.  It means that delivery of a copy of the document to the Clerk shall be the laying of the document before the House.  I should be glad if the Minister would explain to the House what other manner there is of laying a document before the House because, from subsection 2 (b), it would appear to me that Standing Orders do not always specify what laying a document before the House means.  There is evidently some other practice.  From a perusal of Standing Orders, one would take it that there was only one way of laying a document before the House, that is, by delivery of a copy of the document to the Clerk.  If that is not so, I should be glad to know what other alternative methods there are.  According to Standing Orders, there is one way of doing this and, if Standing Orders are so precise, why is it that other practices, either alternative, or contrary to Standing <Col N="355" /> Orders, have been drawn up in the meantime and have been accepted by the House?  Have they ever been explained to the House or have Standing Orders been amended by agreement amongst the Parties?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The point raised by Deputy T.F. O'Higgins and Deputy Barrett is a reasonably good one in that it is not absolutely certain&mdash;in fact, I think it is most unlikely&mdash;that Standing Orders take account of the laying on the Table procedure at all.  However, if Standing Orders do, then subsection 2 (a) will take care of the procedure. If Standing Orders do not, subsection 2 (b) will refer to the practice in each House.  I think the best way of getting over that would be for the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to examine Standing Orders in this respect and, if they can define a precise method by which this ought to be done, then subsection 2 (a) will apply.  In the meantime, if there is not any precise procedure laid down in Standing Orders, then subsection 2 (b) will continue to apply until then.  I think no great difficulty will arise and that the Committee on Procedure and Privileges will ensure that there is a precise method laid down in Standing Orders. If they do, subsection 2 (a) will apply and, if not, subsection 2 (b).  I should imagine it is a matter mainly for the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</P>
      <P>With regard to the point raised by Deputy Tully, I suppose it is possibly true that very few Deputies go to the trouble of consulting documents which have been laid on the Table of the House.  I should imagine it is the first duty of any Deputy to read his Order Paper.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>He should not confine himself to letting his eye slip down to see the questions to which his name is appended.  I think there is a greater duty on each Deputy because there is a lot of information on the Order Paper, not only questions, but legislation pending, activities of Committees and a full list of instruments which have been <Col N="356" /> laid on the Table of either House, as well as Messages from the Seanad.  The Order Paper is not a very long document; you certainly do not need a lorry to bring it away and it is supplied to the hotel or home of each Deputy every day.  There is a duty on each Deputy to know what is happening in each section of the House.  I do not know if any other procedure could be defined, unless we employ a town crier in the corridors of Leinster House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think what the Minister has said is quite satisfactory. I think the House would like to know is there any such practice as is referred to in subsection 2 (b) of this section.  Does this refer to a past practice or to some possible future practice and, if a practice has grown up, what is it because subsection (1) of Standing Order No. 139 says:</P>
      <P>Where a document is required to be laid before the Dáil the delivery of a copy of the document to the Clerk for that purpose shall be deemed to be the laying of it before the Dáil.</P>
      <P>That to me would appear to be sufficiently specific to cover all cases and I do not know how any other practice could have grown up alongside Standing Order 139.  If a practice has grown up, I think the Minister should tell us what it is and how it has grown up.  I do not think we should leave subsection 2 (b) without ascertaining this.  I should be glad if the Minister would be more precise before we finish dealing with that particular section.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> Last evening I was attempting to review our economic progress over the past few years and to show that the present economic difficulties were not something of recent occurence.  I dealt at length with our balance of payments figures, our capital inflow, our unit production costs, our external assets and import ratio, and our bank liquidity.  In dealing with these as signposts of our economic progress.  I showed, I believe, that the Government should have seen the writing on the wall long before the announcement was made on July 13th.  I believe they should have so informed the people and should have taken earlier action. One may ask why they did not do so.  The answer is equally simple; it was not politically expedient to do it and only when the election was safely over and they were again in the saddle was it deemed politically safe to come before the House and wash their dirty linen in public.</P>
      <P>Dealing with the question of bank liquidity, may I direct the attention of the House to page 54 of the booklet sent to us by the NIEC?  At the bottom of that page you will find this very pertinent part of paragraph 78 which says:</P>
      <P>The Central Bank will, no doubt, consider it appropriate to take action to prevent an exceptionally high but temporary increase in the net capital inflow from leading to an excessive expansion of credit and will continue to use the mechanism of changes in recommended ratios to keep the rate of credit expansion in line with the requirements of economic growth.</P>
      <P>These steps were not taken and the progressive change in ratios which was there for any Minister for Finance or Government to see was produced and I am sure drawn to their attention quite regularly and was clear evidence of the undesirable inflationary trend in our economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="359" /> I had just begun to deal with the question of Government borrowing and borrowing generally.  Everybody had been admonished, as we are all being admonished now, to cut down expenditure.  The Central Bank had given instructions to the commercial banks covering the last nine months of 1965, and now extended to cover a full year, to curtail bank lending except for productive purposes.  In general, the policy of restraint has been adopted and those in the community who have had occasion to go to the bank trying to borrow money are painfully aware that there is a very rigid credit squeeze in operation.</P>
    <P>But when one looks at the Government position one finds in spite of all admonitions they have continued to borrow.  It may be difficult for them suddenly to change the pattern; they may not have too much room for manoeuvre but I think it proper to draw attention to the latest figures which may be obtained from <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i> These show that from 1st April, 1954, State borrowing from all sources was £211 million and there was £184 million in Exchequer Bills during that period.  Despite all the admonitions we have had, between 1st April, 1965, and 1st December, 1965, State borrowing jumped to £368 million with an Exchequer component in that of £253 million.  Surely this is increased money in circulation. Is this not inflation?  Is this not revenue overdraft mounting rapidly?</P>
    <P>Similarly, we find that on 20th October, 1964, commercial bank advances to the Government were £25 million and on 19th October, 1965, those advances were £39 million.  This shows the highest percentage increase in any section of the community and this is the Government who are asking us to exercise restraint.</P>
    <P>Apropos of that, may I direct attention to this paragraph in the introduction to this booklet?  I shall quote paragraph 24:</P>
    <P>Finally, action is necessary in the field of credit policy.  The role of credit policy in the first instance is to ensure that the volume and composition of credit will be in line <Col N="360" /> with the planned growth of consumption and investment expenditures. The lesson to be drawn from 1964 is that there is a danger that an abnormally high inflow of capital may be used to allow a rate of credit expansion which cannot be maintained when the inflow returns to a normal level.  This also applies to increases in bank liquidity resulting from abnormally large issues of Exchequer Bills which can have the same effect as a large capital inflow in increasing the liquidity of the banks and thereby permitting an expansion of domestic credit.  The Central Bank will, no doubt, consider it appropriate to take action, should the above circumstances recur, to keep the rate of credit expansion in line with the requirements of economic growth.</P>
    <P>This is the booklet which the Government are asking the House to endorse and the concluding paragraph of that booklet is, so far as a production of any State Department can be so, condemnatory of the Government.</P>
    <P>Deputy T.F. O'Higgins and, I think, Deputy Michael O'Higgins, adverted to the former attitude of the Taoiseach in regard to bank credit control.  Deputy Michael O'Higgins stated that at Castlebar on 29th March last the Taoiseach said that if Fine Gael proceeded to exercise credit control over the banks as enunciated in their Party policy statement, there would be a flight of capital out of the country.  Yet we have it stated in this book, and, indeed, we all know it, that the Central Bank would, in effect, exercise restraint and issue restraint instructions to the commercial banks beginning on the 1st April and going on to the end of last year and subsequently extended to cover the entire financial year.  Here was the Taoiseach giving one view on the 29th March and the Central Bank with which one would expect him to be in consultation, apparently acting in the opposite direction at the same time.  Has there been proper consultation or any consultation between our Taoiseach and our Central Bank on such an important issue?</P>
    <P>One fundamental defect in this document <Col N="361" /> as I see it is the inadequate reference to the agricultural section of the economy.  Not alone are farming interests not represented on the NIEC but this publication is in line with that approach in so far as very little reference is made to the agricultural section of the economy.</P>
    <P>I put down a Parliamentary question to the Taoiseach on Tuesday of this week asking, in general, for particulars as to the Government aid given to the agricultural section of the economy and to the industrial section of the economy.  The figures I got were that the estimated aid to agriculture for 1965-66 would be £51.9 million and to industry £57.5 million.  Much of the aid given to industry, of course, applies to building.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> I asked, because it is an important part of our judgement of the economy, the import content of our exports.  The figures given to me for agricultural exports for 1965-66 was £96.4 million and for industrial exports £82.7 million but I was informed that no information was available regarding the import content of these exports.  I, therefore, turn to Table 33 of the last Central Bank Report and to comparable figures given on Table 11 (a) of the National Industrial Economic Council Report.  For 1964, according to these figures, our agricultural exports amounted to £123.8 million; other products, £93.6 million.  For 1964, imports of materials for agriculture amounted to £16.5 million; materials for industry, £195.4 million; consumption goods, £71 million; producers' capital goods ready for use, £52 million; unclassified, £11 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point I am trying to bring out&mdash; and I have no further information than the statistical tables provided here &mdash;is that there is a very small import content required to produce a substantial <Col N="362" /> agricultural export.  If these figures are correct and if I am interpreting them correctly, for an agricultural export of £123 million the corresponding figure for materials imported is £16.5 million; whereas, for £93 million exports on the industrial side there is an import content of £195 million.</P>
    <P>Over the years our agricultural exports have been consistently greater than our industrial exports and the imported materials necessary to service these exports have been running at about one-tenth or one-eleventh of the imported materials necessary to provide our industrial exports.  In this booklet, in Table 11, similar figures are quoted.</P>
    <P>It is claimed by the NFA that the agricultural community, about one-third of the population, produce two-thirds of our exports and enjoy little more than one-fifth of the national income.  I think it is generally accepted that the income of farmers, agricultural labourers and forestry workers has not kept pace for many years with the income of the other members of the community, despite falling numbers engaged in farming occupations and despite the fact that production has in general tended to increase.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I find it hard to accept that we can approach this question of incomes policy, which is the theme running through this booklet, without taking into consideration in a more realistic fashion than we have done the question of agricultural income and farmers' income in general.</P>
    <P>I suppose you could say that the agricultural community, which represents only one-third of the nation and feeds the entire nation&mdash;because the amount of food imported is not really very great&mdash;and provides, maybe, two-thirds of our exports, with very little import content, receives it would seem something a little more than one-fifth of the national income while the remaining two-thirds of the nation provides a proportion of the goods and services and to do that imports materials for industry to the tune of £195 million per year; capital goods to the tune of £52 million, making a <Col N="363" /> total of £249 million, and £71 million worth of consumption goods.  These figures should bring home to everyone the fundamental importance of our agricultural industry in the field of exports and I am at a loss to understand why more consideration was not given to that aspect in this Report. Our agricultural labourers, deemed to be unskilled workers by some, are amongst the lowest paid in our society. Forestry workers are paid £7 15s. per week; bonus incentive can, I believe, bring that figure to about £9 per week. They complain about their conditions. They have no huts.  They have to work under canvas in bad weather.  With regard to the average agricultural income of the farming community, different figures have been given at different times by various economists and in Government reports.</P>
    <P>Speaking yesterday, the Taoiseach was not very encouraging, to say the least of it; as far as I understood him, the economic curbs will continue until 1967.  I would have hoped there would be reasonable improvement in our economic position towards the end of this year.  Improved cattle exports, which we surely must have by the end of this year, remembering that we had a record cattle population last July, should help to put right again the imbalance in our economic position at the moment.  The highest exports of store cattle were in the record year 1957.  The record exports for that year were very welcome to the incoming Fianna Fáil Government.  Cattle exports came to their rescue.  Probably history will repeat itself now, but it is ironical that in two periods the cattle trade, in relation to which a gentleman on the opposite side once said: &ldquo;We will destroy in one year what it took 100 years to build up&rdquo;, should now be the means of saving the Fianna Fáil Government.  If it is. then this traditional industry will have saved Fianna Fáil on two occasions.</P>
    <P>It is rather extraordinary that our economy always seems to boom before an election and to slump after it.  That, of course, is not fortuitous. That is something carefully organised with a complete disregard for the <Col N="364" /> national welfare.  Many simple people may think this &ldquo;Stop-Go&rdquo; in our economy is a cyclical thing, largely occasioned by influences outside our control.  I admit there are influences outside our control which have intermittent effects upon our economy, but the position quite clearly is that our economy is being subjected, whenever that seems necessary, to the pressures of political expediency.  The Government were very unpopular when they introduced the turnover tax and to redeem their unpopularity they introduced an unprecedented wage increase in the form of the 12 per cent ninth round.</P>

        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> The Taoiseach intervened and got the Federated Union of Employers to sit down a third time with the Congress of Irish Trade Unions.  The negotiations broke down twice.  I do not see the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance, or his colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, intervening now to get the Federated Union to sit down once more with the Congress of Irish Trade Unions. Indeed, the attitude of the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Industry and Commerce is: &ldquo;The negotiating machinery is there, if they want to use it; we, like Pontius Pilate, wash our hands of it.&rdquo; There is no necessity now for the Taoiseach or any of his Ministers to rush around desperately in an effort to negotiate an agreement.</P>

The Government are now in the position of having a fairly assured majority.  There is no necessity for this recurring panic which bedevilled their activities in the previous Government.  There is an opportunity now for calm planning. There is an opportunity for them to take decisions without looking over their shoulder and thinking of when the next election will be coming off.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate, I believe, has been conducted in a responsible way in an effort to analyse the problems, economic and social, which affect us.  The debate was brought about by the decision of the Fine Gael Party to table a motion last November endorsing and supporting the NIEC Report and recommendations.  The gravity of the deteriorating situation moved the Government, with unexpected and unusual alacrity, to table a similar motion last week.  The fact that it has been possible to get a discussion on the recommendations included in the Report and the general agreement that has been shown during the debate on the causes of the present situation indicate and underline the importance of securing, wherever possible, the right measures to deal with the situation.</P>
      <P>The NIEC Report, in its analysis of the problems which affect the country attributed them to four main causes: the excessive expansion of monetary demand, of which a major cause was the rapid rise in investment over the period, which, in the Council's words, was largely determined by Government policies; secondly, a deterioration in the relative competitiveness of Irish production; thirdly, excessive credit creation, much of it for unproductive purposes, which in the Council's Report was regarded as facilitating the excessive increase in demand; and, fourthly, the creation by these developments of an environment in which price increases could be easily passed on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A close examination of this Report and the recommendations made in it reflects at many points strong criticism of the failure of the Government to take the necessary action and the fact that the Government did not adhere to the various figures laid down in the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion.</i> There has been a remarkable growth in the Government's capital programme, and the fact that the available resources are no longer adequate to finance that Programme <Col N="367" /> is to a very considerable extent due to the failure of the Government to examine periodically and in a critical manner the terms of that Programme and the availability of adequate capital to meet it.</P>
    <P>During the course of the last election when Fianna Fáil were criticising various aspects of the Fine Gael policy and in particular, criticising the proposals made in respect of banking credit, an attempt was made to generate fears among the community and to cause concern by attacking the proposals made on the ground that this was an attempt to interfere with or in some way control by Government appointees credit policy and that the normal reaction of individuals, farmers and business people, is to resent any Government control or interference.</P>
    <P>That was done because at that particular time the Government had created the illusion that it was possible to spend freely, that adequate resources were available and that there was no reason for limiting the capital available either for productive development purposes or for building and construction. Although the evidence was there in the report submitted to the banks that the situation was deteriorating and that 1964 had shown quite a significant change&mdash;in fact there is, I believe, evidence to show that at least one bank sought guidance in December, 1964, on what action might be taken&mdash;the Central Bank failed to move in that direction.  It is not quite certain when the Central Bank first took action on the matter but there is some evidence that at the end of April or early in May, action was taken for the first time.</P>
    <P>It is of importance to advert to the comments that have been made by those who have a purely economic interest as distinct from those who might have a political interest as well. The quarterly <i>Irish Banking Review</i> had this to say in December last:</P>
    <P>The deterioration of the balance of payments has led to many warnings. The question may fairly be asked if some of these warning should have been pronounced some time ago and some of the remedies applied earlier. <Col N="368" /> Delay in facing up to difficulties may make their correction more severe and prolonged.</P>
    <P>The proposals which we made were, I believe, reasonable.  We suggested that the Central Bank should take action, as has been recommended in the NIEC Report, in respect of credit creation.</P>
    <P>We think it is significant that the action, taken in a quiet way, unannounced until later, came within weeks of the published recommendations we put forward.  One important aspect of this question is that the 33 per cent formula which was pointed out to be a reasonable ratio in respect of bank lending was departed from, though the margin referred to in the Second Programme allowed a ratio of anything from 27 per cent or 28 per cent to 33 per cent and nothing was put in its place.  There is now some evidence to suggest that it has dropped to as low as 22 per cent.</P>
    <P>The NIEC Report refers to the difficulties of foresight in the field of credit policy and in the whole field of economic management:</P>
    <P>We believe that primary emphasis must be laid on policies of the type we recommend for ensuring that the growth of money incomes is kept in line with the growth of real output and that expenditures are planned so as not to exceed the real resources available.</P>
    <P>A big, if not the biggest, single user of capital is the building industry and the position in so far as building is concerned has now deteriorated to quite a marked degree.  Deputy T. F. O'Higgins adverted to the December figures and to the fact that there was a notable decline in employment and that these figures pointed a very serious warning.  I should like to advert to this in the context of a reference to it in the document <i>Public Capital Expenditure,</i> laid before the Oireachtas last October.  It is stated at paragraph 23:</P>
    <P>It is hoped that it will be possible to maintain the public building programme next year close to this year's level of £31.6 million, which is the highest ever achieved.  As regards the possibility of raising it <Col N="369" /> above this level, in line with the projections in the Second Programme, it is necessary to point out that the Second Programme projections were made in the light of forecasts of financial resources which having regard to present conditions, must be regarded as optimistic.</P>
    <P>What were the National Building Advisory Council doing?  We have been told now it is proposed to reconstitute that body.  I want to suggest, without intending any disrespect to the members, that the members of that council are hand-picked and it does not require a great deal of imagination to find the reason.  They were not appointed to represent this industry. They could not communicate with all the interests concerned on matters before the Council and do not represent the building industry&mdash;there are no specifically appointed persons on the Council who represent any section of the building industry and they are entirely out of touch with the building industry.</P>
    <P>In the light of that situation, with the acute shortage that has developed in respect of capital, this serious situation has resulted.  Government Departments have delayed the placing of contracts for public construction, there is a big hold up, there is confusion and a drop in the volume of work and employment.  Those of us who are familiar with Government Departments realise they never move quickly even with the green light, but with the red showing they have not only stopped but have gone into reverse.  The position is that because there was not available an accurate estimate of the total construction projects in each Department, there is no properly indexed schedule of the building projects and it is not possible to decide quickly which projects should go ahead and which projects should be stopped.  The result is that there is now a hold-up in virtually every Government Department and, because there was no order of priorities in the past, there is not any possibility now of getting a quick decision as to what projects should be proceeded with.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="370" /> In the private building sector there will also be a drop this year.  It may be true to say that the same amount of money will be made available but that is not sufficient.  With the SDA loan procedure, even allowing for increased grants, it is obvious that because of the rise in building costs&mdash;it is true to say they have risen not less than 10 per cent and some people say by more&mdash; and the facilities from building societies drying up, it is obvious there will be a serious drop.  I can speak with most experience of County Dublin in this respect&mdash;the area served by Dublin County Council and Dún Laoghaire Borough Corporation&mdash;and I can say the number of houses will drop considerably. The situation in County Dublin is quite remarkable and has alarmed those who have examined it. It is obvious, therefore, that the Building Advisory Council should be reconstituted rapidly on a realistic basis so that those appointed on it will have not merely authority to represent the interests concerned but the right to have discusions with those interests.</P>
    <P>In the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion,</i> reference was made in Table IV at page 270 to the public capital building programme during the years 1964-65 to 1969-70. For the year 1966-67 the total estimated expenditure is £34.37 million and it is made clear on the previous page that it is expected total public capital expenditure during the six years inclusive in terms of present prices would amount to £569 million, or an average of £94.9 million a year. With the deterioration in money values and the rise in building costs, it will be necessary this year to spend £38 million in order to provide for the same amount of building work as was originally planned in that Programme and which the Government have departed from without giving reasons or explaining the circumstances of why the targets enshrined in the Second Programme, which have been discussed at length in the House, will not be realised.</P>
    <P>They hope, this year, to get £31.6 million which, on the figure I have <Col N="371" /> given, is a drop of one-fifth.  This, as I said, is due to a variety of factors.  Due to the delay in placing contracts and due to the fact that available supplies of capital are not adequate, they are unlikely to attain their own targets.  Even more serious than this is the fact that the figure which was laid down in the Second Programme of a growth rate of 4¼ per cent was not attained last year and on the estimates made for the coming year it will not be attained this year either.  It is, therefore, obvious that if that situation continues&mdash;and there is no evidence to suggest that there will be any likely remarkable expansion in the years ahead&mdash;then the targets will not be realised or there will have to be a very substantial increase in growth in the latter years of the target.</P>
    <P>I believe that the Government have a responsibility and a duty to review and re-examine the Second Programme. If it is not realisable or attainable in certain respects they should say so and get public support even for a less ambitious programme.  There is no advantage in publishing a whole set of figures that are incapable of realisation in practice.  One of the facts that has been adverted to in the NIEC Report is the difficulty of securing adequate capital.  In this connection, I want to try to get some information from the Government other than that supplied in the course of a reply by the Minister for Finance in relation to the proposed US loan.  I notice a new expression has now crept in to describe the situation.  It is said that because of congestion in the finance market, the loan has to be postponed.  In effect, what that means is that the total number of applicants exceeds the supply available.  It is important that we should be informed adequately in advance.  That is the problem that is affecting, and that will affect, the building industry today.  They are not able to get sufficient information in advance. There has to be planning, arrangements have to be made, tenders have to be secured and the programme of work has to be ordered in a way that will enable the resources of the industry to be utilised to the best advantage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="372" /> One of the very strong comments made in the course of the NIEC Report was that there was no order of priorities.  I adverted to this on previous occasions in the course of debates here and it is adverted to at page 50, paragraph 71, of the Report, which says:</P>
    <P>In particular, in the case of capital expenditure, a ranking of projects in order of national importance is necessary to ensure that the resources available for public and private investment, which are now scarce in relation to the demands being made upon them, are used to maximum advantage.  Up to recently, such careful scrutiny of the relative return from different investment projects may not have seemed so vital because the problem was a shortage of productive projects and not a shortage of investment funds. However, the reverse is now the case: it is now resources and not projects which are relatively scarce.  If the new opportunities for growth are to be exploited to the full while at the same time maintaining stability, a stricter examination of the relative benefits from the various possible projects is required.  The investment projects must be ranked in order of priority based on a considered judgment of their benefits to the national economy, and an assessment must be made of the share of the total resources available for investment to be devoted to each project in order to maximise the total benefits.</P>
    <P>That is a criticism of what has been happening up to the present.  It is also a recommendation with regard to the necessary action in respect of the capital construction programme.</P>
    <P>I want to advert to a point I made earlier and examine the Government policies in relation to the need to attract and the measures taken to attract capital to this country.  It is quite noticeable that last year, completely independent of any action that we proposed, and at a time when the Government were operating their own policy, two measures, one in 1963 by the Minister's predecessor and another in the last Finance Act operated to deter capital from coming to this <Col N="373" /> country.  This may very well, according to estimates that are given by those who are conversant with the banking system, mean that there will be a definite outflow of capital.  There is no doubt that the proviso in the 1963 Finance Act, which obliged banks and banking institutions to disclose deposits in individual cases, has meant an outflow of capital.  The theory behind that decision may have been reasonable enough but there does not seem to have been anything more than a theory behind it.  The idea was that people had for a long time collected and placed on deposit sums of money which, if disclosed, would make available money hitherto not available for taxation purposes.  That seems all right in theory, but, in fact, you have now to take account of the nature of those deposits.  Many of them had lain there for a considerable period and, even if they were there, once a person took out a deposit and put it to any use which made it liable to tax, eventually the Revenue Commissioners would be entitled to find out where this money came from and secure tax from it.</P>
    <P>I believe that what was equally serious was the proposal passed in face of our criticism in the last Finance Act, which aggregated insurance policies with other assets for death duties. That is bound to have a deterrent effect on capital inflow, not merely from a securement point of view but from the business point of view, from the farming point of view and, as I said earlier, from the point of view of attracting outside investment. Those are factors which have been adverted to by accountants and economists. The experience of anybody running a farm or a business at the present time is one of increasing need, because of rising costs, for more capital to ensure that a business may be continued without the necessity to mortgage portion of it, to sell portion of it or to enter into unduly onerous financial arrangements to maintain the existing rate of expansion.  The proposal enshrined in the last Finance Act will mean for the first time that farmers and business people who took out, or who take out, insurance policies to provide against a heavy incidence <Col N="374" /> of death duties will find that it applies in many respects inequitably and unfairly.  Although there is quick succession relief, nevertheless in most cases where death duties apply, it is not an easy problem to alleviate the consequences for the business or the firm.  In those circumstances, it is important that any action that has been taken should be reversed and repealed in the coming Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>I believe that those two proposals, the one introduced last year which has not yet had time to have an effect, and the other, are indicative of a wrong attitude and a wrong approach to the attraction of capital to this country.  In recent years the Government have secured a much larger share of the increased capital which was available.  In 1964, bank lendings to the public sector, which showed little change over previous years, increased by 27 per cent, compared with an increase of 12 per cent to the private sector.  This is quite significant.  In the December bulletin of the <i>Irish Banking Review</i> this was adverted to.  It stated:</P>
    <P>The capital programme of the Government is the section of total domestic demand which has shown by far the most rapid rate of acceleration.</P>
    <P>It went on:</P>
    <P>On the investment side, a ranking of projects in order of national importance is required because, at the present time, financial resources are the scarce factor rather than the number of sound investment opportunities available.</P>
    <P>There was also this significant comment:</P>
    <P>In the course of 1964, bank credit by way of bills, loans and advances increased at a significantly faster pace than the total of deposit and current accounts, the respective rates of growth being 13.9 per cent as against 8.8 per cent.</P>
    <P>That re-emphasises the situation which is adverted to, and pinpoints the criticism which was expressed in this NIEC Report, that the action which is now being taken should have been taken earlier.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="375" /> The recent statement by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions was, I believe, made in a constructive attempt to adopt a reasonable approach to the problem of wages and salaries.  I say this without offering any view on the figure suggested.  Some figure had to be mentioned, of course, and certain types of employment, and certain categories of workers, might be entitled to more than others, depending on the type of work and the trading position of the business or industry concerned, and so on.  It is vital in any arrangement or agreement that the special position of the lower-paid workers should be taken into consideration. There appears to be a generally accepted view that the country at present, in the light of a rise in unit costs, and a deterioration in our competitive position, with a shortage of capital and a general weakening of the economy, cannot afford more than about three per cent in total increase.</P>
    <P>I believe that the recommendation which was endorsed by the unions represented by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions is, at any rate, an indication of an awareness of the problem and a constructive approach to the difficulties involved in it.  It is unnecessary to emphasise the desirability of agreement being reached and the dangers consequent on a free-for-all. Negotiations between the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Federated Union of Employers, conducted by both sides in the realisation that failure to reach agreement must react to the detriment of the nation will surely provide the necessary incentives for the reasonable, practicable and constructive approach which is necessary in conducting these negotiations.</P>
    <P>In the face of mounting problems such as a rise in the numbers unemployed, a slowing down in industrial output, a drop in building and construction, a weakening of our export competitiveness, brinkmanship in industrial relations is good neither for the individual nor for the community. What is needed now is an indication of what Government policy on wages is, and if wages are increased, whether employers and businesses be allowed <Col N="376" /> to increase prices to pay for those increased wages.  I say this because I think some indication must be given in advance of what the consequence of wage and salary adjustments will be, and whether any such changes in cases where they are warranted&mdash;and not in cases where they are not warranted&mdash; will be entitled to be included in price changes.</P>
    <P>The Minister also indicated that certain measures would be taken to meet the breach of the three per cent. I believe it is important that any such measures should be announced in advance if they are to be effective.  Some positive indication should be given other than the phrases used in the Minister's speech.  In that connection I want to say a word on profits.  This, of course, was adverted to in the NIEC Report and reference was made to the fact that an incomes policy should be so designed as to avoid any disincentive effects and so inhibit the desirable growth of profits.  It went on to refer to certain forms of taxation in the event of excessive profits or unreasonable profits being made.</P>
    <P>I believe it is important to differentiate between reasonable profits and excessive or unreasonable profits.  In any economy&mdash;and this is not confined to free democracies such as ours&mdash;there is a realisation nowadays that the profit motive is the only incentive which will secure adequate returns.  I believe the Government have an inescapable responsibility to ensure that excessive profits are not earned, and that if unreasonable profits are earned, a strict examination is made to ensure that they are ploughed back or put to productive or other advantageous uses in the industry or project concerned.  If the profits made are unreasonable, that naturally causes disquiet, and causes comparisons to be made between either wages and salaries on the one hand, or profits earned in industry, on the other.</P>
    <P>These are two aspects of the matter which were adverted to in the NIEC Report and to which reference was made in a recommendation similar to the recommendation Fine Gael made in their policy document, that it was not the purpose of an incomes policy to <Col N="377" /> prevent profits from growing or to prevent wages or salaries from rising but to ensure that the control of profits is not desirable where they are earned competitively, and it refers to tax and other measures to ensure the rate of increase in aggregate post-tax purchasing power derived from investment is not higher than the rate of increase in aggregate post-tax wages, salaries and other incomes.  This clearly contemplated a similar tax mechanism and tax arrangements to those laid down in our policy document and which have been restated in somewhat similar phraseology in the NIEC Report.</P>
    <P>One very definite criticism that is being made in connection with the NIEC Report, and which I want to reemphasise, is the fact that this Council does not include representatives of agriculture.  The excuse given in the past was that because they could not get agreement from the various agricultural organisations, it was decided not to put them on.  In any event, there was some reference made by the Taoiseach that it was dealing only with industrial matters.  That excuse can no longer hold.  In fact on page 7 of the Report, this significant phrase is used:</P>
    <P>An incomes policy that does not embrace all categories of money incomes, namely, wages and salaries, farmers' incomes, professional earnings, rents, profits and realised capital gains, is repudiated as inadequate and inequitable.</P>
    <P>That is the recommendation of the NIEC on which there are Government representatives, representatives of the trade unions and of the employers and other business interests.  The time has arrived when a fresh approach should be made to the agricultural organisations and in default of agreement, the Government should select representative nominees from these organisations and put them on the NIEC.</P>
    <P>In that connection I want to advert to one other reference and to relate it to the argument which was made yesterday. It says on page 9, in paragraph 19 that:</P>
    <P>Decisions about the current level <Col N="378" /> of support for agricultural incomes should be taken at the same time as&mdash;and recognised as an integral part of&mdash;decisions concerning non-agricultural incomes.</P>
    <P>This week a series of questions was put down to the Minister for Agriculture about the revised prices which would operate for agricultural products in the coming year and the Minister declined to give an answer. Last night at some unspecified Fianna Fáil agricultural committee an announcement was made.  I believe that shows scant regard for the Dáil and for the responsibilities of public representatives.  I can accept and understand if the Dáil is not meeting where if a Minister is going to some established public function, that anything is better than a repetition of platitudes and if he is able to make an announcement then, there is something to be said for it, but where specific questions are put down by elected representatives and a Minister declines to answer, and then goes later that night to some Fianna Fáil gathering and announces decisions that affect the nation, it shows scant regard for and an undesirable attitude to the responsibilities of elected representatives and to the functions and duties which Deputies have.</P>
    <P>This debate has been conducted in a most responsible and constructive fashion but the attitude adopted by the Minister for Agriculture in announcing that decision shows no regard for the function of the Dáil and no respect for the duties and responsibilities which Deputies are elected to discharge.</P>

      <P>I believe that one of the factors in the present situation is that there has not been, up to the present, a sufficient sense of urgency in the remedies applied and the speed essential to deal with the various problems that affect the country. Nowhere is that more evident than in the Government.  Ministers give the impression of having a lack of confidence and they appear to be overawed <Col N="379" /> by their incapacity to solve the problems of our time.  The Government have not provided leadership and have not provided the direction.  I am satisfied that the economy is essentially sound, that it has within it the resiliency necessary to surmount the present difficulties but there must be a clear indication of the targets that are realisable, definite decisions and decisions taken in time and then pursued with the resolution and vigour essential in order to see that they are implemented.</P>
      <P>The present situation has largely arisen because of undue optimism and the creation of an attitude and the development of a mentality by Government speeches and general propaganda that we were on the high road to prosperity and there was no need to plan adequately, plan carefully, plan in the light of realisable attainments and defined targets, and on the basis of the availability of adequate financial resources for the work to be done and the various projects to be carried into effect.  If this country gets effective, efficient government and fair leadership, we can surmount the difficulties but the responsibility cannot be transferred either to the Congress of Trade Unions or the Federated Union of Employers.  The prime responsibility for leadership, for decisions, for action, lies on the Government.</P>

      <P>They have been very vocal about 1922, 1932 and 1942 and they blame the Government largely for their failure to appreciate that a crisis exists.  I should like Deputies to take a hard look at this objective Report, at paragraph 10 on page 15 and also at paragraphs 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18.  Paragraph 10 says:</P>
      <P>In the first quarter of 1965, there were indications that the volume of fixed capital formation may have been about 10 per cent greater than in the first quarter, 1964&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>Ten per cent greater&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>and that the volume of building and construction work done may have been more than 10 per cent higher.</P>
      <P>The same held for the second quarter of 1965.  Does that show a lack of growth in the economy?  I need not quote the other paragraphs to which I have referred.  They demonstrate the external factors which affected our economy and the crisis came about for the reasons given in that Report.  They set out three principles for dealing with this situation, set out on page 15.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, there is an incomes policy. What does an incomes policy mean? It is very easy to speak about it but a lot of hard work has to be done before we can properly arrive at it. We must first have a speedier and better collection of statistics and a better appreciation of their significance. We must have an adult and sophisticated approach to the whole problem.  We must sit around the table like rational men with one thing in mind: that the objective of any incomes policy is to maintain a healthy national economy.  The increased national cake can then be divided when a clear-eyed assessment has been made of the growth in the cake.  Better still, if prices hold, if the national cake increases and the cost of living is held, you can have a real share-out of the <Col N="381" /> cake, which will mean an increase in real incomes.  That is the heart of the matter.</P>
    <P>As this Report points out, other problems remain.  There is this question of the differentials between professional and vocational classes and labour.  The working out of an incomes policy should not be confined purely to thinking of wages and workers.  The Labour Party dwelt completely on that.  It is likely, even if you have a growth in the national economy, that some industries will earn more than the national average and will pay more wages.  On the other hand, less efficient industries will probably be able to pay only less. That is a natural thing.  It will result in an effective and efficient economy here.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully put up some cockshots of his own making.  No one wants to prevent collective bargaining or strikes, but we should seek to avoid them by creating devices and procedures to prevent their happening. Above all, a prerequisite of an incomes policy is good industrial relations. This does not meant you abolish the right of free collective bargaining, but it does mean you must take, in addition, a patriotic approach, knowing we are all in the same boat in this country.  A lot has been done in this way by many industries.  You have consultations on the shop floor between foreman and shop steward and consultation in the works council between management and workers.  That consultation is not all one way.  Ideas come down from management to workers and go from workers to management.  All this is only creating the climate in which an incomes policy can succeed.</P>
    <P>There is no use telling us Fine Gael thought of an incomes policy or the Labour Party thought of it.  It is inherent in the 1916 Proclamation and in the social policy of the Republic of 1919.  It is inherent in ourselves.  It is part of our Christian and democratic tradition.  This is not to minimise the difficulties.  The principles are set out here for effective action to prevent aggregate demand from rising excessively. This is the exercise the Government <Col N="382" /> are at present engaged in.  It is a very necessary exercise and they are doing it.</P>
    <P>The third principle, concerning banking policy, is set out in paragraph 7 on page 14:</P>
    <P>If the Central Bank's advice to the commercial banks regarding the growth of total bank lending had been strictly complied with and had taken immediate effect, loans and advances to the private sector and/or lending to the Government would have been reduced.</P>
    <P>You have the heart of the matter there. It says &ldquo;if the Central Bank's advice had been taken,&rdquo; but I would prefer to substitute the word &ldquo;direction&rdquo; for &ldquo;advice&rdquo;.  If you have good planning priority, you then have direction and not advice which can be ignored.  That is the hub of the increase in the demand.</P>

      <P>During the debate on the Free Trade Area Agreement, the Deputy, in his inimitable way, envisaged Castlereagh coming through this House.  The other day I decried Napper Tandy coming through this House.  He shook hand with Deputy L'Estrange, said it was a most distressful country and took his seat in the Fine Gael back benches.  I wholly commend what Deputy Cosgrave has said. We are working together.  Let us hear less criticism of what happened in 1922 and 1932 and more about what is going to happen in 1966.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Cosgrave indicated in his remarks, the Minister <Col N="383" /> can be assured he will receive in this House the greatest assistance from the Opposition Parties in the present dilemma in which he and the country find themselves.  That does not absolve members of the Opposition from the duty of examining the root causes of the difficulties we are now in, with a view to ensuring they will not occur again.  Any examination of these root causes leads to the inevitable indictment of the Government for their failure to face the facts of a situation which developed long before the general election in April last.</P>
      <P>During the last general election, the people were actively encouraged by the Minister, by his colleagues in the Cabinet and by the Leader of the Government, to believe they were living affluently and that they were beholden to the Government for that affluent life.  We know now, as we knew then&mdash;and as the Minister knew then&mdash; that the people were not living affluently but were living dangerously beyond their means.  Far from being cautioned, as they are now being cautioned by the Minister and those who sit with him, that this was a dangerous thing to do, they were encouraged to do so.  They were encouraged to believe that this state of affairs would continue if the country opted for Fianna Fáil as the Government in the general election.</P>
      <P>Now we find the Minister coming in here and saying something we on this side of the House have been saying for a long time.  I have been in this House 12 years and certainly at least twice a year, I have said in relation to expenditure on main roads and such things that we should realise we cannot get what is desirable but what is possible. The Minister used that phrase on Tuesday.  In my memory it is the first time I have heard that expression used in regard to the national economy by a member of the Government Front Bench.  It gives me hope that what we are going through at the moment will teach the Government the lessons necessary for the institution of government by the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister tells us the Government will cover consumption expenditure by encouraging savings.  I <Col N="384" /> rejoice to hear that.  Up to the last general election the only encouragement savings got were an advertisement on the back of the Telephone Directory, a few advertisements in the newspapers and maybe a flash on the television screen.  There was never a word of caution to the voters, to the mothers and fathers of families, to anybody who had hold of domestic or industrial purse strings.  I am glad to hear that the Minister now suggests that savings will actively be encouraged by the Government.</P>
    <P>The Minister also tells us that they will influence consumption expenditure by favouring a credit policy which will give priority to productive proposals.  We welcome that, I should like to know what the Minister means by &ldquo;productive proposals&rdquo;.  One of the big tragedies of the present troubles is that the Government refuse consistently to regard housing as a productive proposal.  I know of no more productive proposal.  All the materials which go into a house are produced in Ireland; all the labour which goes into the building of a house is produced in Ireland.  I know of no greater wealth that the country could possess than happy, clean, hygienic homes where children can be brought up in a proper Christian attitude.</P>
    <P>As the Minister is talking about credit policies, I may say I regret very much the situation in which our credit policies vacillate from year to year. You can go, in April, and get credit for a second car or for a month in Majorca, if you are in that particular social bracket, or you can get credit for a fortnight in the Isle of Man or for going to the club three times a week or to the pub for a hooley three times a week, depending on your social outlook.  But, in March, May and June, after an election, you cannot get credit for important things like building a house or any of these matters, no matter what the security.  I suggest to the Minister quite sincerely that when all this is over, when this crisis has passed, as I hope it will pass, we should not go back to the old system of that sort of unrestricted credit, whether by way of bank advance or hire purchase.  If a man goes <Col N="385" /> to buy a second car by hire purchase, there should be something to make him prove it is a necessity and not a luxury because if people want to invest in luxuries, they should invest in them from savings and not from credit.</P>
    <P>The Minister also indicates that he intends to control public expenditure. We are back again then to what the Minister said in his speech, that we must decide what is possible rather than what is desirable.  When I was coming up through my constituency, and the counties between Cork and Dublin, on almost every few miles of the road I saw what I looked upon as unnecessary expenditure on main roads.  I do not know what has been spent over the years on these roads: they are unnecessary; they are desirable but they are not by any means necessary.  Therefore, they are in the bracket of being desirable and in these circumstances I think this expenditure should, in so far as is possible, be arrested even at this stage.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Cosgrave indicated in his speech, we are most anxious to accord every assistance to the Government. We do not want to rock the boat at a time when it has a perilous list such as it now has.  Irrespective of Party or class, when we realise we must assist the Government of the day, provided the Government show the proper dispositions, I believe we can overcome this crisis.  Somebody referred to this particular position in which we find ourselves at the moment as an &ldquo;emergency&rdquo; and somebody else referred to it as a &ldquo;near crisis&rdquo;. The country generally refers to it and thinks of it in terms of a crisis.  I think it is important that the Government should realise that to investigate the present situation as a purely Government problem is to localise a dilemma which is national.  It may be solved only by each individual playing his or her part in the national life over the coming months.  The Government should not blame the trade unions, the employers, the Opposition or anybody else.  In the first place, they should squarely admit that the Government themselves allowed this situation to develop, at least to some degree, by their failure, by their fear in fact, to <Col N="386" /> arrest the trends they actively encouraged up to 7th April of last year.</P>
    <P>This prompts a suggestion at which I think Deputy Cosgrave hinted.  I think he said that the composition of the Government was such that they were unable to deal with the problems which now beset them.  The thought is not that of Deputy Cosgrave alone. There is a feeling throughout the country that the constitution of the present Government is such that it is not able to serve the people as it should.  The Taoiseach told us during the last general election campaign that he was not as young as he used to be and that probably he would never lead another Government; in other words, that he was getting old. The feeling down the country is that a man in such a position needs the very best advice and assistance he can get and that the people who would give that advice should have the best qualities available.</P>
    <P>I say this in an absolutely impersonal way, irrespective of how dedicated or how hardworking the Ministers whom the Taoiseach has gathered around him may be.  I should like to pay tribute to the heartbreaking work which many of them have tried to accomplish over the past few months.  The Taoiseach should stand back and take a square look at his Cabinet and decide whether it is one by which he can best be served or whether he should look elsewhere for assistance when he goes into a Cabinet meeting.  Having done that, he should put his mind and conscience to what is required in the present difficult situation.</P>
    <P>It is said, time and time again, that no man is an island, that no man can isolate himself and feel he is quite independent of his fellow men.  I have advocated, time and again, on the Estimate for the Department of Education, that young people in our schools should be taught exactly that. I think the dilemma in which we find ourselves at the moment springs, certainly in some degree, from a lack of education in matters such as the inevitable nature of the laws of economics and our appreciation of Christian social principles.  Every child <Col N="387" /> should be taught that if he or she, whether worker or employer, tries to take all the cake for himself or herself, the country cannot exist.  I think that, had previous generations been so educated, much of the difficulty the Government must now be experiencing would have been avoided.</P>
    <P>I do not know if there is anything that can be done to make up for the lack of that education in respect of present generations.  It might be possible, by way of advertisement, television, radio or something of that nature, for the Government to get across to the country the need for an unselfish approach to this problem.  I am not suggesting that it should go out by way of Government propaganda but possibly some statement, agreed by the Leaders of the three Parties, could be turned into advertisement form and used to bring home to the people the necessity for an unselfish approach to the present problem.</P>
    <P>It is all very well for us to talk here in this House.  If, in the unique event of our talking commonsense every time we stood up here in the Dáil, even then, by the time the words had been taken down, sub-edited and put into a newspaper they would naturally be truncated and, truncated as they are, the fact is that the majority of the people do not read the reports of proceedings in Dáil Éireann.  If some approach could be made to the people to induce them on an occasion like this to deal with their fellowmen in the most unselfish way possible, if it were pointed out to the worker that maybe he cannot have his extra slice of cake, and to the employer that maybe he cannot have his extra portion of roast duckling at the moment, possibly something might come of it.</P>
    <P>I share the views expressed by Deputy Cosgrave that, essentially, we have a sound economy.  Maybe it would be better to say we have the remains of a sound economy but Marshall Foch one time said that battles are won by remainders.  If we could hold on to the remains we have, if each man and woman in this country did his or her part, we could <Col N="388" /> overcome our difficulties.  On the other hand, if sectional interests only are looked after by each section, the remains we have will be interred indecently and greedily, first because of the inefficiency of the Government in their approach to the situation before the last general election but, above all, because each man and each woman in this country&mdash;by his or her sectional approach to this problem&mdash; failed to assist the country in coming to a realisation that we could rescue the remains of our economy.</P>

      <P>It is not my intention to look back and criticise what has or has not been done.  I think the House will generally agree that the progress envisaged in the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion,</i> at this time, has been considerably curtailed by what may be described as an international credit crisis, together with the introduction of the British levy.  This levy, in my view, was a tremendous blow to our continued economic development and this fact, I think, is accepted by all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come to what I consider to be the kernel of my brief contribution, and developing what I have already said as self-evident truth.  In this NIEC Report there is a great emphasis placed on the Buy Irish campaign.  I would suggest, as an addendum to the Buy Irish campaign, we should introduce the slogan&mdash;Sell Irish.  We have a duty to sell abroad as well as on the home market, and I refer particularly to Table 1 of the Report in this context. I would suggest that, to rectify in some small way our present economic difficulties, a complete examination of the work of Córas Tráchtála Teo. would be a worth-while exercise.  Are they really fulfilling the required functions in relation to selling Irish abroad?  If we examine the figures published in Table 1 from 1960 to 1965 and compare imports with our exports, it has been stated that we are maintaining our export capacity.  I do not altogether agree with this proposition.  I compare the value of money in 1960 with that in 1965 and relate the import figure. which is practically double, to that of the export figure, which is still three-quarters <Col N="389" /> short of doubling itself.  I wonder how Table 1 would look if it were assessed on a tonnage basis rather than on sterling?</P>
    <P>Córas Tráchtála being a semi-State project and, keeping in mind that the Report states:</P>
    <P>We should programme our capital projects in a better planned manner to obtain the most up-to-date and most essential use of our various projects.</P>
    <P>I pose the following questions:</P>
    <P>(1) Is Córas Tráchtála and its functions as a selling organisation really working at full capacity?</P>
    <P>(2) Does it not, in fact, gain its main contacts from our Embassies abroad?</P>
    <P>(3) Has not Aer Lingus shown itself worthy in the extension of its services to be helping to promote tourism?</P>
    <P>(4) Could we in some way correlate the progressive sales abroad of Aer Lingus with those of Córas Tráchtála in an effort to promote greater trade contacts?</P>
    <P>To develop question (4) a little further&mdash;businessmen, as we know, use Aer Lingus extensively, both national and international businessmen&mdash;could we not during these flights, amongst other things, give them some sort of indoctrination as to the merits of investing in Ireland and, indeed, the methods of buying Irish.  These are personal views, as set out in these questions.  At some later date, I hope to make some small contribution on how our Embassies, Bord Fáilte, Córas Tráchtála and Aer Lingus could, in some way, co-ordinate for the greater development of our export sales drive. Is it, for example, a fact that we can afford separate offices for Córas Tráchtála, Aer Lingus, Bord Fáilte and our Embassies in the United States and other countries?  However, these are random thoughts which I hope to develop at a later date.</P>
    <P>It was astonishing to note the figures published dealing with savings. It is evident that withdrawls had to be made to meet the increasing prices.  I know the corrective measures of the Minister for Industry and Commerce for a standstill in prices will have the <Col N="390" /> desired effect.  I believe if the younger people in employment took the time to look at Table 14 and see the cost per unit of output, it would urge them to take a keener interest in their various jobs and make more effort to increase output, and, consequently, productivity.</P>
    <P>I think management could be more flexible in its approach to employees. The young people today are more independent and, in a lot of ways, clearer in their minds on the various issues which come before them from time to time.  I believe if employers came to their employees and said&mdash;&ldquo;Well, here is the audited statement of our accounts; we are doing all we can to promote exports; this is our deficiency for this year; we must come together and rectify this position in the coming year&rdquo;&mdash;a proper answer would not be long forthcoming.  I believe if we had more trust in one another, both management and employees, it would accomplish a lot.  This is a time, as has already been expressed by other people in this House, for co-operation.  One side blaming the other and one side criticising the other achieves nothing. As someone stated recently in relation to the co-operative movement, co-operation is not merely business, it is a social policy.  I believe this concept should be extended to deal with the present situation on the industrial relations front.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach put it very well yesterday&mdash;if I may presume to give an opinion on it&mdash;when he said that it was not impossible to visualise the Government, trade unions and employers sitting around a table to work out what it is feasible to attempt in the matter of wage increases this year.  He went on to say that this matter should be capable of being decided in a reasonable&mdash;I emphasise &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo;; this is a great time for reason&mdash; and objective way by reasonable men by reference to known factors and sensible expectations.  This excellent suggestion should be seriously considered by all the political Parties and accepted and, of course, implemented. I had intended calling for an all-Party committee on the problem but <Col N="391" /> the Taoiseach's idea&mdash;again, if I may be presumptuous&mdash;is a first-class one and I defer to it.</P>
    <P>In reference to an incomes policy, the Report states that the start should be directed to the self-employed or professional people.  Records of all transactions should be inspected.  Let me say on this aspect of the Report that the seventh report of the Commission on Income Tax should be adopted as a matter of urgency.  Also, if I may modestly say so, I am a professional man and I am prepared, and always have been, to subordinate my own welfare to that of my country and I attach great importance to the concept of a more efficient and greater Ireland.  The present situation requires prompt action.  I believe this action can only be achieved by co-operation. Co-operation is the key.  There are injustices on all sides.  Could we not come to recognise these wrongs in a rational way and solve them together in the spirit of patriotism rather than in a spirit of regionalism or in a spirit of sectionalism?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have been properly reminded in the course of this debate of the number of criticisms uttered by the Taoiseach and his minions during the general election campaign last year in which they condemned Fine Gael for proposing a prices and incomes policy and asked the people to support Fianna Fáil because they would not introduce such a policy, nor would they engage in any credit policies such as Fine Gael were suggesting.  In the course of that campaign we were also told something else which it is correct to recall on this occasion.  We were promised by the Taoiseach that he would retire before the next general election and it seems to me that if he has any regard for truth or for the views which he expressed in February and March of last year, now is the time for him to retire.  The policies on which he sought support and got it have now been found by him and his colleagues and the nation to be unsuited to our needs.  The policies which he condemned, the policies at which he jeered and which he said he did not <Col N="392" /> understand, are now the policies which the NIEC and the Government Party are accepting.  These are the policies which we in Fine Gael brought to the electorate at the last general election. Therefore I would expect that at a time such as this when there is a complete reversal of economic and financial policies on the part of the Government as presented for the most socially and economically-minded election we ever had, the Taoiseach would take this opportunity of retiring and indicating that the policies in which he believed had failed and leave it to somebody else to replace them.</P>
      <P>The words he used&mdash;I am speaking of the present Taoiseach&mdash;in relation to an incomes and prices policy were that it was &ldquo;a vague idea&rdquo;, &ldquo;a slick phrase&rdquo; and &ldquo;an impractical idea&rdquo;. This is what Deputy Seán Lemass, who spoke here yesterday as our Taoiseach, said to the people earlier this year.  I cannot understand how he can feel comfortable in remaining in office except of course that he is following the best traditions of the leadership of Fianna Fáil, that is, to satisfy his own personal vanity first and the nation's needs afterwards.  At the time of that election campaign, we had the most vulgar example of personal vanity ever uttered by a public man when the Taoiseach said that his own personal wish above all others would be to be Taoiseach of a Fianna Fáil Government on the occasion of the celebration of the Golden Jubilee of 1916.  It strikes me that that is the only reason he is remaining in office because at heart he must be an extremely sick man and his mind must be very much disturbed, seeing that all he propounded for the past seven or eight years and all that he went to the country on early last year has been rejected and has been found by everybody to have failed.  I therefore call upon the Taoiseach, if he is a man at all and if he wishes to be remembered with real respect by the Irish people, to quit office now and make way for a leader whom the Irish people can trust.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are certain qualities essential to leadership of this country if the <Col N="393" /> difficulties we are now going through are to be overcome.  The first of these qualities is truthfulness and coupled with truthfulness, a capacity to understand the needs of our time, not when compelled to do so when an emergency makes one sit up but long in advance of the emergency, so as to prevent it.  It is quite clear that the present Leader of the Government cannot have both these qualities.  He either failed to understand the difficulties of the country over the past few years or, understanding them, was not truthful with the nation about them.  It is quite clear from the NIEC Report and from what we in Fine Gael have been saying, year in year out, to the point of boredom for ourselves and the nation, that these difficulties have grown like a malignant growth. They could have been cut down, and prevented from spreading but instead the Government were not truthful with the people and were not determined to prevent the growth of this cancer. The result is that if we are not bankrupt, our creditors are considerably worried about our capacity to pay and that is the step before bankruptcy.  It is not foolish talk to say that; it is stating the facts of economic life.</P>
    <P>It also strikes me that we need in the leadership of this country an indifference to personal popularity. Quite clearly a man whose principal preoccupation is an ambition to satisfy his personal desire to be in office during the Golden Jubilee of 1916, to stand on platforms and be the guest of honour on all occasions in the celebration of that Golden Jubilee, is a person not indifferent to personal popularity.  Clearly then, the present Taoiseach is unfitted to lead this country at present.  As I said earlier, a capacity to understand the problems that face us, to anticipate difficulties and avoid them by that anticipation is essential to leadership in the crises which we are going through now and which will become worse during this year.  Clearly, all the indications are that the Taoiseach and the Government he leads have not got that capacity.  It is clear also that we need a man of courage.  How can we say that the Taoiseach or his minions have <Col N="394" /> courage when they have avoided for many years the necessarily unpopular steps which had to be taken to keep the economy right or to get it on to the right tracks again?</P>
    <P>In the course of my few brief remarks, I will indicate where the Taoiseach and his Government were lacking in courage and, above all, in leadership.  At a time like this we need a man who can be trusted.  How, in heaven's name, can this nation or anybody with whom we do business trust a man who for years has argued that you cannot have price control, who for years has said that it is impossible to visualise a prices and incomes policy, who for years has asserted that it is impossible to have proper credit policies, and who in time of grave crisis says that all these things are acceptable and are the solutions to our difficulties?</P>
    <P>I think that one needs a man with qualities of truthfulness and determination, indifference to personal popularity, capacity to appreciate difficulties and thus avoid them.  We need a man with courage, a person who can be trusted.  The Taoiseach has promised us that he will retire before the next election.  It seems to me, as I said earlier, that now is the time for him to do it, but even if he does not do it now, he is going to do it before the next election.  Quite clearly, there is nobody in his Party who can in one person combine all these qualities but on this side of the House we have a man by the name of Cosgrave whose name is synonymous with all these qualities, who in times more difficult than these, financially, politically, socially&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>A leader who has always believed in and who has asserted these policies long before the wiseacres thought is wise to propound them and who has the qualities of which I speak is a man like Cosgrave and the sooner the Taoiseach makes way for him the better.</P>
      <P>A considerable part of the debate today and throughout the past year has been devoted to the question of credit policies and, in the best MacEntee style, in the course of the last general election campaign, the Taoiseach in particular, and to a lesser extent Deputy MacEntee and other members of the Fiannn Fáil Party, attacked the Fine Gael policy for a just society by saying that the ideas which Fine Gael had would restrict credit and would create hardship.  The facts are, as indicated in the NIEC Report and as asserted by Fine Gael, that wise credit policies prevent a situation developing such as we now have, in which essential national priorities have to be postponed because of our inability to meet ordinary current commitments. We in Fine Gael asserted, before the publication of the NIEC Report, that there should be a determination of the priorities to be given to various forms of investment and various social policies.</P>
      <P>The NIEC Report, on page 9, says that there should be a ranking of projects in order of national importance. We endorse that.  We are sorry that the Government opposed us when we put this to the nation earlier this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="396" /> One would hope that in future we will have a proper assessment of national priorities and that we will ensure that our credit policies are such that these national priorities get first attention.</P>
    <P>I would direct your attention, Sir, and that of the House to page 75 of the NIEC Report where, on Table 16 (b), we have figures for the gross domestic physical capital formation at 1958 prices between 1958 and 1964.  I am sorry that the figures do not go back just to 1956 but we will get those figures in the near future based on the 1958 prices.  This Table is most interesting in this regard, that while prices of dwellings have more than doubled between 1958 and 1963, the gross domestic capital formation has not doubled or anything like it.  There is a rise of from £10.4 million to £17 million.  That is not sufficient even to maintain the deplorably low quantity of private dwellings which were being built in 1958, which was a particularly bad year for the building of private dwellings, so that, in real prices, over the period we invested less in the provision of necessary housing for our people.</P>
    <P>At the same time as we did that we increased the spending of money on other building and construction, that is, on the construction of edifices other than private dwellings, from £28.3 million to £48 million.  We are able to spend an additional £20 million on the building of offices and factories, some of which have not yet paid or are incapable of paying the capital cost and we have spent it on the building of hotels and various forms of luxury erections.  It seems to me that this indicates a failure to assess national priorities and, having assessed them, to see to it that the credit policies of the country were so used as to ensure that money would be available for what should be our national priority, that is, the provision of dwellings.</P>
    <P>I was sorry to see that one of our national journals in a directive which it gave early this week to Members of this House as to the topics upon which they should discourse during this debate, said that we should not discuss the question of house building.  I find <Col N="397" /> that unacceptable and I will continue to find it unacceptable as long as there are, as there are in this case, 100,000 families in unfit dwellings.</P>
    <P>If there were financial difficulties in 1956, one of the principal reasons for them was the fact that the then Government were investing one-third of the gross national annual investment in the provision of housing for our people but we accepted that burden, whatever the consequences might be. We accepted that as a national priority deserving attention before all other forms of building.  Now we are in serious financial difficulties for a multitude of reasons, one of which is not the provision of housing for our people.  If we are to have a proper assessment in the future of our credit policies, we must first of all have priority given to the provision of houses for our people.  We in Fine Gael will say this even if it bores people and even if certain people in the national press tell us that we ought to shut up about it.</P>
    <P>Figures published annually in relation to house building and so forth are grossly inadequate to enable any reasonable assessment to be made of the capital required for house building. They are also inadequate in that no indication is given as to how the capital is provided for houses in the private sector which, taking one period with another, probably represent half or more, of the houses being built.</P>
    <P>In the replies to a series of questions which I addressed to the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Local Government earlier this week, we found that there are no figures available to indicate the amount of money made available by our commercial banks for the building of houses.  We also found that there are no figures available to indicate the capital made available by building societies for the provision of dwellings, as distinct from other mortgages and loans.  We also found there are no figures available to indicate the amount of money supplied by insurance companies for the building of private houses.  There is a clear need here to have a detailed investigation so that <Col N="398" /> we shall not continue to have this abominable sequence of slumps and booms in building.  This ought to be given some serious attention by the Government and by the various money agencies so that, once and for all, we will have a proper assessment made of the various agencies which can supply money for building; knowing what these agencies are and knowing what they have done in the past, steps can then be taken to ensure a steady flow in accordance with our national needs instead of having the present unknown, unascertained and unsatisfactory situation.</P>
    <P>A great deal of our trouble has been caused by the reckless optimism of the Government and of the various people, including the banks, who were misled by the Government.  In recent years, from a purely book-keeping point of view, our accounts were kept somewhat in balance by some unusual and non-recurring forms of foreign capital investment.  As a result of these unusual and non-repeating capital flows, our banking system, encouraged by the Government, made many widely scattered, foolish and irresponsible loans. For a long time it was not a question of whether or not you wanted a loan; it was simply a question of being given encouragement by the bank manager to take on loan commitments, loan commitments which the individual might never have had in mind at all. Many bank customers, not seeking loans, were invited to take loans and were encouraged in every conceivable way to expand their liabilities.  This was done, not on the basis of a better economy but on the basis of a few unusual and, as I say, non-repeating forms of substantial capital investment.</P>
    <P>Now that these foreign flows are no longer repeating, we have the crudest and most irresponsible credit sqeeze ever inflicted upon our people and particularly upon our business community. There has been an utterly stupid and irresponsible clamp-down on credit.  This has had very serious consequences for business.  I believe we are only beginning to feel the pain. I believe that the pain will intensify and grow very much worse.  The evidence of this will be found at page 57 <Col N="399" /> of the NIEC Report which shows that, as between the end of 1964 and 1965, bank deposits increased substantially. In 1964 there was £6,147,000 on deposit and private account with the commercial banks.  At the end of 1965 that sum had increased to £7,851,000. There was an increase of £1,700,000 in the banks.  Yet people were in dire need of credit in order to meet current commitments and in order to pay for stock ordered by them in the days of unlimited loans.</P>
    <P>Having been encouraged to expand business, increase stock and make purchases, they were unable to get the money from the banks to pay for these and the consequences so far have been that many stores and shops, wholesalers and retailers, have been obliged to sell stock purchased by them in the days of unlimited credit at substantially below cost and they are now unable to maintain the staffs they took on in order to sell the increased goods they were encouraged to handle.  The consequences of this are to be found in our unemployment figures, which show an increase of 8,000 in a few months, and the indications are that the figures will worsen.  If it were otherwise, I am sure we would have received a specific assurance from the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance in the course of the debate that the credit squeeze was going to be relaxed.</P>
    <P>It is clear there are a number of forms of borrowing which should not be encouraged.  On the other hand, there are forms of investment for productive purposes and desirable national purposes which should be encouraged.  For the purpose of providing incentives or disincentives for the varying kinds of credit, serious consideration ought to be given to the provision of money at varied interest rates.  Again, money ought to be made available at varying interest rates in accordance with the location of investment. One appreciates this would require a very sophisticated and, perhaps, difficult to administer system, but, if good will come of it, as we believe it will, it is something certainly worth striving for.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="400" /> Previous experience has shown that, where you have a credit squeeze, you may get your books right, but the squeeze will inevitably lead to a decline in production because production will respond to the lesser demand.  This has been a consequence of the present Government credit squeeze.  There has been a fall in productivity and this is likely to worsen unless the credit squeeze is relaxed.  In the first quarter of 1965, there was a reduction in the volume of food produced by the industrial sector.  In the second half of the year, there was a reduction in textiles, clothing and footwear.  These figures bring us to the June quarter only of last year, but, from the figures available to us in other journals, it appears that this trend has been worsening <i>pro rata</i> with the worsening of the credit squeeze.  Even the Taoiseach was obliged to accept that the position was worsening when he spoke of the significant rise in unemployment. I believe that he spoke of this more to frighten the workers than as an admission of his own failure. But there is a significant rise and that is likely to continue so long as the unselective credit squeeze continues to apply.</P>
    <P>The building industry is tottering on the brink of disaster.  Yet we are assured here and, through us, the people as a whole, by the Minister for Local Government that he is not aware of this parlous situation.  He has not been aware for the last year that there were any difficulties in the provision of credit for private houses and, now when the building industry has in public sounded its concern, and the building industry has directly to the Minister and his Department expressed its concern, the Minister says he is not aware there is any difficulty at all and figures can be produced to show how right he is and how wrong the builders are, how wrong the unemployed builders' labourers are, to show that if they think they are not working, he knows to the contrary, that they really are, that if they think they have no money in their pockets at the end of the week, no weekly wage packet, they are wrong because he can produce figures to show otherwise and that if <Col N="401" /> builders have debtors summonses served upon them and if building firms have gone or are about to go into liquidation, as one would believe the position to be from looking at <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and other such documents, all the people are wrong and the Minister for Local Government knows otherwise.</P>
    <P>It is quite possible that the Government are convinced otherwise.  It is quite possible that they have the same source of information as they have had for the past six or seven years, but the position is that the people in business, the people in building, know to the contrary, and these are the people who have as much right to complain as anybody else.  The person who eats the meal or goes without it knows as much about the consequences of what goes on in the kitchen as does the chef or the scullery maid.</P>
    <P>We find on page 60 of the NIEC Report, Table VI, another most disheartening development, a development again which the Government have been denying in this House, that in a short period of two years, between 1963 and 1965, emigration has doubled, and from the trends of the past two or three months, all the indications are that it has quadrupled the figure for 1963.  We shall probably have to wait for the various figures produced before the Budget to realise the serious nature of the growth in unemployment and in emigration.</P>
    <P>The failure of the Government to control prices over the past eight or nine years is reflected in the high costs of production.  The fact is that workers here&mdash;by &ldquo;workers&rdquo;, I mean every person who earns a living&mdash;and their families have a lower standard of living than is available on the other side of the Irish Sea.  Notwithstanding the fact that our wage rates here, according to the NIEC Report, are higher, nominally speaking, than in Britain&mdash;I think it is necessary to emphasise that these figures for wage rates speak only of the nominal wages given at the end of any week&mdash;the real value of wages here is considerably less, because they will not purchase the same quantity of goods.  Bread <Col N="402" /> and butter, the staple diet of our people&mdash;or what is alleged to be the staple diet of our people, because for many of our people it is bread and margarine&mdash;are dearer here than they are in Britain, and we subsidise butter in order to make it cheaper for the British people.  The principal diet of working families&mdash;these commodities represent some 80 or 90 per cent of their diet&mdash;are dearer here.  There are many other commodities which are cheaper on the other side of the Irish Sea but, in addition, there are other factors which we must take into account.</P>
    <P>Parents here must pay for secondary education.  On the other side of the Irish Sea it is free.  The majority of our people, certainly in Dublin city and county, whatever about some better-provided-for areas in the West, must pay for medical services.  In England milk is provided free for children.  Here it has to be paid for. The principal commodities in the diet of families here, bread, butter and milk, are dearer, and these and other commodities must be taken into account before any attack is made on people who are seeking an increase in wages.  The fact is that wages here, while nominally higher, are purchasing very much less than wages across the water.</P>
    <P>On page 71 of this Report, we are given indices of output and earnings per hour, and of unit wage costs in manufacturing industry, and one finds that the cost per unit of output since 1963, and perhaps earlier for all we know&mdash;the figures are not given&mdash;are higher here than they are in Britain, but this is not and should not be taken to be a reflection on workers. It should not be and must not be taken to be a criticism of people here for seeking to be paid too much.  What it must be taken as representing is clear proof of the Government's abysmal failure to control prices and profits.</P>
    <P>The sole attacks to date, and one suspects in the future, by the Fianna Fáil Party are apparently against wage earners and salary earners.  The element of profit in prices, the element of income in profits, has been ignored <Col N="403" /> to date except by Fine Gael, by the NIEC Report and by the Labour Party, who have been emphasising these fundamental facts of economic and financial life.  Rather than this abuse of working people for seeking an improvement in wages, we should have an appreciation by the Government of their responsibility to provide a decent standard of living.  If the Government fail to control prices and enable a decent standard of living to be achieved with a lower wage rate, then workers are justified in seeking higher wages and salaries.  One appreciates that the consequences of that to the economy are not damaging but the primary responsibility goes back to the Government. Their duty must be to control prices and such things first.</P>
    <P>There has been, as the NIEC Report points out, a substantial falling off in the net capital inflow to this country. Apart from the fact, which I emphasised earlier, that a substantial part of foreign capital investment in this country was of a non-recurring nature, we must also attribute the falling off in the net capital inflow to the disastrous folly of the Fianna Fáil Finance Act which sent millions of pounds which lay on deposit here out of the country.</P>
    <P>In taxation, two factors must be balanced against each other.  One is the desirability of having the tax borne according to the capacity of people to pay.  The second factor we must bear in mind is the consequences if, in enforcing the first one, we damage the economy by sending money out of the country or by discouraging people from investing in the country.  That happened as a result of the 1963 Act, and the 1965 Act adjusted the figures in accordance with changes in money values.</P>
    <P>This is the type of stupidity we have had in the Control of Manufactures Acts which prevented this country from having the benefits of an inflow of money from abroad for almost 30 years.  It is no use our being cloistered here, working out beautiful theories, if we fail to put these theories into practice and to apply them.  That is what has got us into the difficult position we now face.  When one makes a <Col N="404" /> detailed examination of our imports, one finds several commodities the import of which has increased out of all proportion to the benefits flowing therefrom to the community.  It strikes me as undesirable that a Government should hesitate to control imports of a luxury nature; yet that is what has been happening.  Rather than wait for crises to develop, the Government, in anticipation of the consequences of a particular trend, should step in well in advance of crises.</P>
    <P>Recently I argued the position in relation to glass imports.  We have quadrupled our imports of glassware over a short period and from investigations which I pressed for in the House by way of question, we found that the Department of Industry and Commerce were relying entirely on a monoply in this country in the manufacture of glassware for information they sought as to what their policy should be in this matter.  When they were told by the hardware trade and when they were again informed in the House that the failure of the Irish monopoly to produce glass obliged people to import it, the Minister for Industry and Commerce would not accept what the hardware trade had to say.  I find it extremely difficult to understand the Minister's attitude and that of his colleagues who apparently will take information only from a particular source, especially when it happens to be a monopoly.</P>
    <P>What has happened in relation to glass has happened in relation to several other commodities.  If we are to have a thorough examination of imports and of the need for them, it is necessary that the Minister for Industry and Commerce and other members of the Government throw their nets of inquiry further afield in order to get unbiased and objective information. It is quite clear that, where a particular industry, working under protection, claims to be supplying home needs, if the Minister accepts their information, you will have an increase in imports if people unable to get the products they require from the monopoly are obliged to import.  It may be that the Government did not care on this occasion if imports increased so long as they could <Col N="405" /> get the customs duties flowing from the goods and one can find grounds for such a suspicion in various publications. The Government have the idea that as long as they can get a buoyant revenue, all will be well even if the revenue comes from imports.</P>
    <P>We in Fine Gael can find so much to agree with in the NIEC Report that we simply encourage people to read it, but we feel that in reading it, they will also be reading the Fine Gael policy on a just society.  Indeed we know for a fact that the secretariat of the NIEC had before them that Fine Gael programme when they were compiling the Report on the economic situation in 1965 and when drafting the various recommendations issued to the country. We know also from the Report what the NIEC consider to be the principal reasons for the unfortunate developments which now have us in this mess. They are not, may I point out, the reasons advanced here today by Deputy Andrews who said the cause of our difficulties is to be found in the international shortage of credit.</P>
    <P>That is not the reason, but we are likely to have more difficulties in the near future because of the inability of the Government to obtain in the international money market a paltry loan of £7 million.  We already know the consequences to the various targets in the Second Programme of the appalling credit squeeze which the Government are directing at the moment but we have not been told during the debate the consequences of the Government's failure to get £7 million in any part of the world.  We will be told that only when the misery is upon us. What a low position our credit must be in when this country is unable to get £7 million from one end of the world to the other.  If the Taoiseach does not like the word &ldquo;bankruptcy&rdquo; to describe that situation I can only say it is the step immediately before bankruptcy when nobody will lend us a bob.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>We agree with the <Col N="406" /> NIEC Report.  We realise that this country is going through a period of economic difficulty, with contraction of employment, a credit squeeze and balance of payments difficulties.  We think the Government are in no small measure to blame because, with their long years of experience, they should not have permitted us to reach this situation.</P>
      <P>There is divided opinion among trade unionists abroad as to what an incomes policy is and how it should work.  Germany is bitterly opposed to an incomes policy and Britain is obsessed with the idea.  Trade unionists in Britain are divided on the issue, though, I think, mainly on the application of an incomes policy more than anything else.  We in the Labour Party favour very much an incomes policy and we would support an incomes policy if it were introduced into this country, making clear, of course, our views on what an incomes policy is. Everything that has been said here would lead us to suspect that an incomes policy is a euphemism for a wages policy or a wage control policy. This is where we would be very cautious.</P>
      <P>The Irish Congress of Trade Unions at its annual conference in July last adopted a motion which was passed unanimously on this question of an incomes policy.  I think it should be quoted in full as it represents the official viewpoint of the trade union movement.  The motion was:</P>
      <P>Congress declares its opposition to any attempt by Governments to control free collective bargaining between trade unions and employers and re-affirms its rejection of any form of incomes policy that does not deal effectively with prices and profits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Congress considers that an acceptable incomes policy must not only adjust the total volume of increased demand to the total volume of increased national output but must have as its primary objective a just distribution of income.  To this end Congress calls for an examination of long-term policy concerning the distribution of incomes, which <Col N="407" /> materially affects the form and character of our society.  For the immediate future, Congress declares that a national policy on incomes should be directed towards the following objectives:</P>
    <P>(1)  A substantial increase in the income of lower-paid wage and salary earners, pensioners and persons dependent on welfare benefits, and</P>
    <P>(2)  Increases in the incomes of wage and salary earners generally which would be sufficient to offset price increases and which would enable them to enjoy a steadily rising standard of living.</P>
    <P>To achieve these ends, Congress considers that it is essential to resist any limitation on increases in wages or salaries which is not equally applicable to other incomes and which does not take into account the level of such incomes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very relevant, if I may say so.  The NIEC in its Report is equally emphatic in rejecting any incomes policy which does not concern itself with the behaviour of all money incomes so we can say that the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the NIEC are in accord about this, that it must be all-embracing.  The NIEC Report says that the wage and salary incomes of farmers and self-employed persons, professional earnings, land profits and realised capital gains should be taken into account.  To quote the NIEC:</P>
      <P>We repudiate as inadequate and inequitable any incomes policy which does not embrace all categories of money incomes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are faced now with the NIEC <Col N="408" /> wanting a proper incomes policy.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions have affirmed their views of what an incomes policy should be and nothing less will be accepted.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has implied and many Government speakers, I am sorry to say, have implied that an incomes policy should be a wages policy.  That, I think, is wrong.  It can be harmful and it will be repudiated by the workers of this country.  You cannot apply a policy to just the wage earners and leave the professional men and the business directors alone.  The NIEC and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions were in accord about the desirability of bringing standards to a level which is in keeping with the present day increases in prices.  This should be one of the aims of an incomes policy.</P>
    <P>An incomes policy has a social purpose, too.  It should be designed to ensure that the value of the real increased money income should not be upset or should not be eroded by price increases.  We know workers over the past 12 years have bitter experience of wage increases being practically wiped out by price increases which followed.  The onus is on the Government to spell out in no uncertain terms a proper incomes policy.  Vague terms and references are not sufficient. Britain, at the moment, are bogged down and cannot come out with any proper concept.  They cannot put into working shape their idea of what an incomes policy should be.  It has never been successfully done in any country in Western Europe.  I cannot see how we can have one in this country.  A proper incomes policy, as outlined in the NIEC Report, has failed so far in other countries.</P>
    <P>Much of the NIEC Report is revolutionary in its outlook and in its implications and I think the full significance of it has not been understood by many people who welcomed it.  It should be widely read and studied.  It should be subjected to critical analysis. We should not put it away.  It should be widely discussed in different circles in the country after it has been read so that a proper understanding of what is <Col N="409" /> implied in it is obtained.  We of the Labour Party are very much opposed to this matter of three per cent increase for the workers.  The Taoiseach said that no more than a three per cent increase could be considered without increasing prices.  There is no doubt that over the past two years the profits of companies have increased tremendously.  Having regard to the expenditure incurred by workers through increased social welfare contributions, a three per cent increase in wages would not compensate them for the increases which have taken place.  I think the workers of this country would reject any attempt to enforce an increase of just three per cent in their wages.</P>
    <P>The question of industrial relations is relevant to the situation.  Scarcely a day goes by without headlines in the papers about worsening industrial relations, and it has been implied that the workers themselves are at fault.  I certainly am new to this&mdash;I was not aware of this before April&mdash;but I have seen quite a considerable lot of indifference on the part of the employers to negotiations.  It was evident in the bus strike when the manager of CIE refused to discuss the position.  He was away.  He was out on the golf course. That is true.  He was not anxious even to consider proposals, and he preferred CIE to incur a tremendous debt over that long time rather than be available to discuss any proposals which might have helped to resolve the situation.</P>
    <P>How can the workers be blamed when the employers adopt this indifferent attitude?  The same goes for the printing strike.  Members of the Irish Printers' Federation did not want the strike to be settled.  They wanted to go on vacation and that was their attitude.  They did not want to resolve the strike.  They preferred it to drag out.  So long as the employers adopt this attitude we will have continuing bad industrial relations.  The time is now ripe for workers and management to come more closely together.  So long as this gap exists between them they will never understand each other. <Col N="410" /> The workers have tried on many occasions to make contact but without success.  Unless we can have a situation which is entirely different from the situation which exists today&mdash;where no effort is made to bring workers and management together, and where CIE management reject the idea that the workers should have any say or voice in management&mdash;we will have worsening industrial relations.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Transport and Power gave an order to the effect that whatever decisions were made by the negotiating bodies in CIE, the company were not to honour them.  That is a very serious state of affairs, and it should receive a lot more publicity than it has received.  With an attitude like that, we cannot hope for proper industrial relations.  Without proper industrial relations we cannot have an expanding economy, because the country will suffer so long as the situation continues as it is at the present time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I see in the discussion of this Report of the NIEC a great opportunity to mark the opening of a new era in the prosperity of the country, if we take cognisance of the facts put before us regarding the economy in general, and the crying need for an improvement in industrial relations.  The greatest need facing our society today is for some kind of sanity between capital and labour so that we can go on, irrespective of what Government are in power, to build up the economy and offer full employment to all our people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no need to stress how serious the industrial scene is at the moment.  I deplore the attempt made in this House to distort some of the facts and to suggest that the Government in their attitude to an incomes policy are interested merely in having a wages policy.  I have heard speakers opposite say that they had an incomes policy at the time of the last general election campaign.  This is something new.  I came across an article I wrote two years ago for a workers' paper in which I quoted a world authority on the need for an incomes policy.  The last speaker said it had not worked <Col N="411" /> anywhere in Western Europe.  I agree with him that it is a very difficult thing to organise or introduce an incomes policy which will be fair to all sections and achieve the purpose it is intended to achieve.</P>
    <P>In Sweden they have such a policy. I am not an expert on this policy in Sweden, but I can point to Sweden as being probably the most prosperous country in Western Europe.  It took courage on the part of members of the board to produce this Report.  It says things which we have all been saying for a long time, but if one suggested an incomes policy three years ago one might be called a traitor to whichever side one was on.</P>
    <P>I think a plea should go out from this House to employers and workers to try to stop this thing of having two camps in such a small society.  In England the Government are striving to introduce an incomes policy and to wipe out for ever the &ldquo;them versus us&rdquo; battle.  They have a richer economy than we have.  In all seriousness I say that unless we can introduce a policy which will give us some peace and continuity in industry we will face grave dangers&mdash;much graver dangers than I could emphasise this evening.</P>
    <P>The Report states that the first principle on which an incomes policy must be based is that increases in total money incomes must be related to increases in national production.  Up to a short time ago we had speakers here who disagreed with that and said they would not have income measured by production.  You need not be an economist to realise that this is essential if we are to make any progress and have any peace.  It is stated in the Report that:</P>
    <P>If the continuity of economic development is to be assured, three things are necessary: first, a policy for the planned development of incomes; second, effective action to prevent aggregate demand from rising at an excessive rate; third, a policy pertaining to credit.</P>
    <P>There are very few people in this House who would stand over any attempt to introduce an incomes policy <Col N="412" /> which dealt merely with wages.  As a matter of fact, it would be so unwise that the thing would kill itself.  Any incomes policy must take into account the top salaried man, plus his dividends, right down to the wage earner who has only his wages to depend on.</P>
    <P>I mentioned some of the distortion of matters contained in the Report by some speakers and on page 75, in Table 16 (b) there is reference to the gross domestic physical capital formation at 1958 prices, for 1958 to 1964. One speaker referred to what was spent on housing and said that the amount mentioned had not all been spent on housing, but on hotels and factories. He actually condemned the building of factories.  I note in regard to &ldquo;Other building and construction, including land rehabilitation etc&rdquo;, that in 1958 the figure was £28.3 million and in 1963 it was £48 million.  That figure, of course, included hospitals, clinics and public libraries.  It is not a great point which he made but I am mentioning it in order to point out to members that if we are going to benefit the country by any discussion we have to accept this Report, which is not a Governmental report but one prepared by representatives of the Government, the trade unions, the FUE and several other people.  Indeed these people are to be complimented on the courage they showed in putting forward this Report.  I am sure there were matters in the Report about which the trade unions had some misgivings but the fact that they showed the need for this Report demonstrated their earnestness in trying to give us a means which we could adopt to benefit the country generally.</P>
    <P>At the moment we have a shortage of credit but we had that before.  I believe this shortage would have occurred no matter what Government were in power.  We know that the USA, probably the greatest country in the world, also has its problems, as have France and Britain and they have had to restrict credit.  While credit restriction is not to be welcomed, if we arrange our priorities in the right order the least harm will be done to the weakest sections of the people.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="413" /> The lowest-paid workers were also mentioned in the Report.  They have been mentioned by most Parties in various economic debates.  Everyone is interested in the lowest-paid worker. If you take the semi-skilled labourer in the city who earns about £11 a week, probably has five or six children and is living in the suburbs&mdash;which means increased bus fares&mdash; you often wonder how that man can keep going with the expenses he has, as against the tradesman who is drawing £4 or £5 at least more than he is.  When we come to the question of helping the lower-paid workers, we can see that it is a very difficult problem.  Human nature being what it is, if the Government were to give the semi-skilled worker an extra £1 a week, we know that the craftsmen would seek to maintain the differential and they would have to get the £1 extra also.  That spiral keeps going on and you find that the lowest-paid workers are still the lowest-paid workers.</P>
    <P>Even in regard to the social welfare contribution, the lowest-paid worker will pay the same amount as the higher paid one.  You may say that he obtains the same benefits but I think that perhaps there is a case here and the Department might consider whether we are being fair to the lowest-paid worker.  He is paying 7/- a week and one wonders if we could not give him some reduction.  It would show our earnestness in trying to help this man who is such an essential part of the community.  In the city we are naturally worried because of the great housing problem.  Housing is affected by the present credit restrictions but so far there has been no hold-up and it is our earnest desire that whatever priorities will be affected housing will not be one of them.</P>
    <P>One final point which I should like to make is in regard to the Dublin dock strike.  Might I say to both sides, despite their differences and the deadlock that exists, that this strike must be settled sooner or later?  Can we not appeal to both sides, in the interests of the community, to come together once more and settle today what must be settled tomorrow or next week? <Col N="414" /> If that is done today, it will save the workers of the city and the country a lot of unnecessary suffering.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;Do not rock the boat&rdquo; appears to be a popular slogan in this House and around the country, particularly from Government supporters. What does &ldquo;Do not rock the boat&rdquo; mean today?  Does it mean that the boat is not seaworthy, that it has not been kept in a proper condition or does it mean that the captain and crew are unable to get the boat safely to whatever harbour they were destined to go?  In any democracy it is necessary that an Opposition should criticise the Government.  If we are to arrive at the stage where we start patting everybody on the back we will arrive some day at what is called national government, or dictatorship.  The democratic system which we have is the best possible system today but it is necessary that criticism should be directed against the Government whose members are the captain and crew of the boat at this particular time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The NIEC Report has been read, criticised, interpreted and misinterpreted here for the past couple of days but it has been accepted as some kind of new bible, the foundation on which this country will go forward in the future.  The fact that this is accepted is an admission by the Government that the bible they had been using up to this was not the proper one and that the methods they had been using were not properly directed or at any rate were not achieving what the Government intended to do.  It is a good thing that the policies of expediency which were pursued by the Government in the past for their own political interests should now be dropped.  Everybody should realise, particularly the Government, that it needs the co-operation and good will of every section of the community if the nation is to survive at all. It was pointed out that emigration has increased and that unemployment is rising.  There is no doubt about this. but can we place any of the blame on the shoulders of the Government for this?  It was made abundantly clear that it was the hasty action of the Government, for purely political <Col N="415" /> motives, in granting the 12 per cent increases which started off this spiral which has led the Government to where they are today.  I do not know if the acceptance of the fact that the economy can face a three per cent rise will be of any benefit to the thousands of small farmers whose incomes are under £4 a week.  I do not know what three per cent will mean to them.</P>
    <P>This debate, based on a document surveying the whole economy, has today deteriorated to the point that nothing is being discussed but employer-labour relations.  I know those relations are important and that they are at flashpoint today.  Somebody is at fault.  However, the wider aspect of where this country is going needs to be discussed.  With the background of restricted credit, both at home and abroad&mdash;seeing that we were unable to get accommodation in the wonderful country of the United States for a measly pittance that would probably keep Mayo County Council in operation for a couple of years&mdash; I do not know if anybody can be very complacent about where we will land in the foreseeable future, even with the co-operation of every section of the community.</P>
    <P>A lot has been said about a prices and incomes policy.  No doubt it is necessary.  Its structure is the important factor.  How you are going to achieve it without complete co-operation from business, professional, industrial and worker interests, I do not know.  It is necessary that the workers realise as well as everybody else that wildcat strikes which hold the public up to ransom will have to cease or eventually the workers and the trade unions will force themselves into the position that public opinion will force the Government to take legislative action to control them.  That would be the worst thing that could happen.  But it has to come and will come unless there is a more realistic attitude on the part of workers and employers.</P>
    <P>Everybody says the worker is entitled to a certain wage.  But do workers <Col N="416" /> not realise that in a situation in which industrialists and employers have to risk their own capital, seek their own markets, have to stand all the losses caused by transport troubles and other strikes and who may be forced into a position where they have to curtail their work and exports, workers cannot expect to get more of the cake than is available?  To have a structure in which there will be acceptance of that fact by both employers and workers is what faces trade unions, employers and the Government today. It will have to come or else we will be on the rocks in spite of everything.</P>
    <P>The aggressiveness of trade unions was necessary in the past.  Without aggression, they would never have made the trade union movement what it is today.  Without aggression, we would never have achieved our freedom. But surely the day has come when commonsense must take the place of aggression on the part of everybody?  The structure I envisage will take a long time to build up.  If we have the goodwill of everybody, it can be done.</P>
    <P>It has been said that some of our problems have been caused by world restriction of credit.  That may be so. But it was stated from the Fianna Fáil benches that the British 15 per cent levy caused almost the total collapse of our economy.  If that is so, our economy must be on a damn shaky foundation.  However, I do not think it is so.  I think the Government must have failed in their long-term view of what was to come.  They must be taken to task for that.  On the other hand, having regard to the point of view which tells us not to rock the boat, basically the economy is sound.  If you have the people of the country willing to work and co-operate, the economy is always basically sound.  Even though we have to blame Fianna Fáil for the situation in which we find ourselves, it would not be the proper thing to deny the Government the support they will need in order to get the country out of the mess.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the NIEC Report will mean for the small farmers of Ireland.  At a function last night the <Col N="417" /> Minister for Agriculture decided to make a statement about increased prices for wheat.  As was pointed out here today, that showed great disrespect for the Dáil.  The Minister was asked a question on this subject this week in the House.  He decided not to answer it here, where I think all matters of policy should be told to the people, particularly Government policy, rather than at dinners down the country.  The Minister is giving an increased price for wheat.  That will mean nothing to the small farmers in the West, where I come from.  It will mean they will have to pay more for the unmillable wheat they feed their stock, which will make production costs higher.  Instead of an increase of three per cent, they will get possibly a decrease of five per cent.  Nobody in this House or anywhere else appears to have any solution to the problem. Regardless of whether trade unions and employers iron out their difficulties, if the bleeding of the West goes on any longer, this country will go down.  You cannot have Dublin city with the hinterland behind it a desert with unproductive people.</P>
    <P>The debate serves a useful purpose in showing the people we have, if not a crisis, at least near enough to it to cause concern to everybody.  I hope the debate will bring a sense of reality to our people so that with more co-operation, even though the Government are not the best we could have, the country will go on to greater prosperity.</P>

      <P>The motion before the House is:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann agrees generally with the views and recommendations contained in the Report of the National Industrial Economic Council on the Economic Situation, 1965, which was laid before Dáil Éireann on the 24th November, 1965.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That motion was moved by the Minister for Finance on behalf of the Government.  We take it that generally the Minister agrees with a number of the principles laid down in the NIEC <Col N="418" /> Report.  He possibly has noted other matters dealt with, apart from principles. For instance, in paragraph 43 on page 36, the following appears:</P>
    <P>An example of the dissatisfaction with existing differences is the attitude of manual workers towards the relationship between their earnings and the earnings of various clerical or other office workers.  There also appears to be dissatisfaction among wage earners generally with the differences in conditions attaching to their employment as compared with salaried employment: in very many cases there are, for example, differences in security, pension rights, holidays, sick pay and hours of work.</P>
    <P>I am interested in the Government's position in regard to their responsibility to their own lower-paid staff&mdash; and not only in respect of wages, which compare unfavourably with the wage rates paid to employees in private employment.  What has been the Government's attitude through the body they set up, the Agricultural Wages Board, to wage rates and conditions of employment of the bulk of the ordinary wage earners in this country?  Certainly, when we get this Report before us for discussion at this particular stage, it is appropriate to examine the record of the Government. It is appropriate to ask what the Government have been doing during the years to improve the wage rates of lower paid working staff.  It is appropriate to ask what they have been doing in relation to sick pay provisions for unestablished staff, temporary staff, which would compare at least reasonably with those provided for a large number of workers in quite good private employment and even, as my colleague Deputy James Tully says to me, for permanent staff.  It could be recorded that the Government have been masterly in their inactivity.  For instance, many attempts have been made to endeavour to bring the working hours of certain employees of Government Departments into line with accepted working hours.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>

      <P>With your permission, Sir, I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together and to circulate in the Official Report a tabular statement giving the information requested in so far as it is available for industries producing transportable goods.  Current data concerning the volume of industrial production in 1965 relates to the period January-September; the compilation of the results of the quarterly industrial inquiry covering the fourth quarter of 1965 will not be completed before the end of next month.  Data on the value of industrial production are available only from the annual censuses of industry; the latest completed census relates to the year 1963.</P>

        <i>(South Tipperary)</i> asked the Taoiseach if he will state this country's annual exports by weight over the past decade of carcase beef and carcase lamb to (a) the United Kingdom and (b) elsewhere; and the value of these exports in each category.</P>

      <P>With your permission, <Col N="428" /> Sir, I propose to circulate in the Official Report a statement showing the information required in so far as it is available.  The Official Export list does not contain a separate heading for carcase lamb and combined figures for mutton and lamb are, therefore, shown in the statement.</P>
      <P>Following is the statement:</P>
      <P>DOMESTIC EXPORTS of beef and mutton and lamb in each year 1955&mdash;1964.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy is referring to the comments about the Agreement which were made at the annual general meeting of the Irish Livestock Exporters' and Traders' Association on 18th January, I would point out that, in addition to the advantages provided by the Agreement for the carcase beef trade, significant improvements have also been secured for the live cattle trade and, indeed, this was duly recognised at the Association's meeting.</P>
      <P>I do not consider that the advantages for the carcase beef trade are to the detriment of the cattle trade.  The link to the British Fatstock Guarantee Scheme which is being introduced for Irish carcase beef provides a valuable degree of security for producers of fat cattle here and should contribute generally towards increasing the overall supplies of fat cattle for export, either alive or in carcase form.</P>

So far, however, only a few have decided to reduce their farms substantially.

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann agrees generally <Col N="443" /> with the views and recommendations contained in the Report of the National Industrial Economic Council on the Economic Situation, 1965, which was laid before Dáil Éireann on the 24th November, 1965.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Minister for Finance.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>Taking one small aspect of the Government's record in relation to lower-paid workers employed by them and their failure over the years to make any real attempt to improve what they may now declare to be fringe benefits for the purposes of this debate, we find that fairly substantial fringe benefits have been enjoyed by the higher-paid members of Government staffs.  This approach of the Government has been taken as a headline.</P>
      <P>You will recollect that just before the recess there was the most embarrassing situation that employees of the Office of Public Works, whose ultimate boss is the Minister for Finance, had to resort to industrial action and Deputies attending Dáil Éireann had to do so on a number of occasions in certain conditions.  I am not concerned with the problems of Deputies but with the approach of the Government, through the Minister for Finance, through the Parliamentary Secretary, an approach that has not been adopted by progressive employers up to this point in time.</P>
      <P>It was hoped when the new Government came into office that there would be a change in the approach of the Office of Public Works to staff matters but the old position has prevailed that these matters go on the long finger. That is one small aspect which indicates how the Government approach the matters raised in this Report.</P>
      <P>In the case of every report and recommendation made by the National Industrial Economic Council and the principles set down therein, eventually it will be a Government that must implement them.  The record of the Government in these matters and their relationship with their own staffs and their views and their history in relation to workers generally must be taken into account when examining the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="444" /> Deputy Lyons has repeated an incorrect statement which has been made on many occasions.  I had hoped that by now his colleagues in the Fine Gael Party would have advised him as to the truth of the situation.  The Deputy referred to 12 per cent given by the Government.  What is the position? Towards the end of 1963, there was a clash between the Federated Union of Employers and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions as to the form in which agreement for a wage increase might be arrived at, having regard to the circumstances existing at that time, the increased cost of living, increased productivity, and the desirability of stability in regard to wages.  A breakdown occurred.  The Federated Union of Employers having resisted for a long time reached a point where they were prepared to think in terms of an adjustment of 10 per cent and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions considered that an adjustment in the neighbourhood of 14 per cent was necessary, taking into account the extent to which the cost of living had increased, the estimated increase which would occur in the cost of living following the decision of the Government to impose the 2½ per cent turnover tax and the assumption that in the nature of things there would be some further adjustment over a period.  Both parties were asked to come together again to try to arrive at a settlement.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach must be given credit and is given credit for inviting both parties to get together again and see could they resolve the difficulty.  The difficulty was resolved.  Yet, ever since that time, for some reason or other&mdash;of course there is certain advantage taken of it in a political way at certain times&mdash;people talk in terms of the Government giving the workers 12 per cent.  Deputy Lyons again today, in an area where people should know better, used the same terms.</P>
    <P>We must examine the report on the economic situation and the motion before the House in relation to paragraph 50 of the Report, on page 38, which sets down what the Council considers an incomes policy to be.  I quote:</P>
    <P>By an incomes policy we mean a <Col N="445" /> policy which is concerned with the behaviour of all money incomes, i.e. wages and salaries, incomes of farmers and self-employed persons, professional earnings, rents, profits and realised capital gains&mdash;rather than a policy which focuses attention on particular components of the total such as wages or profits.  Too often an incomes policy tends to be regarded as a wages policy.  We repudiate, as inadequate and inequitable, any incomes policy which does not embrace all categories of money income.</P>
    <P>We take it that the Minister for Finance, in moving the motion before the House, subscribes to the view expressed in that paragraph.  One would not think so, however, if one were to judge by the contributions to this debate of the Minister and his Leader and other members of the Fianna Fáil Party.  The tone of their speeches and of their argument is that wage and salary earners should be restricted with regard to claims for wage or salary increases and, further, that they should not negotiate fringe benefits, reduction in working hours, service pay, extension of sick pay or superannuation schemes.  That would appear to be the reported views of both the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>Is that surprising?  It need not be surprising to anyone in this House or to anyone outside who has observed over the years the attitude of Fianna Fáil in government.  I emphasise &ldquo;in government&rdquo;, when they felt they were in a rather difficult financial position. They lost an election in 1947, on the very same grounds.  At that stage they indicated clearly and definitely that they proposed interfering with the trade union movement and they intended, if they returned to power, to take over the job of looking after the workers' interests and the organisation of the workers, laying down rules and regulations which would be harmful to the trade union movement.  They lost the election that time.</P>
    <P>It is an extraordinary thing that every time a Fianna Fáil Government feel themselves faced with some, to them insoluble problem, the first thing they do is to strike at the very people <Col N="446" /> who have unfortunately supported them all down the years.  Fianna Fáil is synonymous with wages standstill. There is nothing in this document about a wages standstill but the only interpretation to be taken from the Taoiseach's statements is that there will be a wages standstill.  In November, 1965, the cost of living had increased by 10.5 as compared with November, 1963.  What is the Government's approach to that?  Three per cent is mentioned as a possible figure in relation to money incomes.  I should like to know from the Minister, and so, I am sure, would everybody else, how he proposes to restrict the bankers, for instance, to three per cent.  How does he propose to restrict the self-employed, the professional classes and the large farmers to three per cent?  What steps has he in mind?</P>
    <P>There is one thing the Government must do, that is, get their priorities right.  At the moment many in the lower income bracket, agricultural workers and thousands of industrial workers, are earning around £10, or less, per week.  The activities of the Government should be directed towards ensuring that something is given to these people.  The Government have failed to do what is recommended in this document with regard to precautionary measures to be taken when there appears to be an unfavourable trend.  This is something that has not arisen now for the first time.  For many years, we, on these benches, have been insisting on the necessity to plan ahead, nationally and economically. For many years, our advocacy of such planning was laughed to scorn by the Taoiseach.  I am afraid Deputy Dillon has now donned the mantle worn by the Taoiseach.  The Taoiseach was always wedded to the profit motive; once that was secure, everything would be lovely in the garden; the carrot of profit was sufficient inducement; the land would flow with milk and honey.  However, over the years the Taoiseach learned that a modern economy just does not operate in that way.  He has learned that there is need to think in terms of the future.  Deputy Dillon is, of course, the great individualist. I am afraid there are many <Col N="447" /> like him and many of them are in a position to exploit their fellow humans. I do not say that Deputy Dillon would knowingly exploit anybody, but his approach is that of an individualist&mdash; no necessity for economic or any other form of planning, no necessity for fiscal guidance.  There are a great many who think like him.  However, I think the day of <i>laissez faire</i> has gone.</P>
    <P>It is pertinent to ask if the Government propose to think in terms of the future and of the view expressed here. We have a number of State-sponsored bodies, among them the Agricultural Institute.  The responsible Minister is, of course, the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.  The Labour Court, a body set up by the Government to deal with industrial disputes, recommended that an agreement which had been made between the technician staff association and the Institute, an agreement which was about to be dishonoured, should be honoured and the operative date should be 1st October, 1965.  The association sought 1st January, 1964, and the Institute sought 1st January, 1965.  The interesting thing is that the day after the Institute formally acknowledged it was accepting the recommendation of the Labour Court in respect of the technician staff, it applied salary adjustments for its professional and administrative staff as from 1st April, 1964.</P>
    <P>I am not one to criticise people in clerical or administrative grades for obtaining adequate salaries, but I understand that in relation to senior grades of staff in the Institute, not only did the Institute offer an earlier retrospective date but they offered a percentage increase on top of the 12 per cent, varying from 12 per cent to 22 per cent in the case of the professional staff and from nine per cent to 25 per cent in the case of the administrative staff.  This decision must have been made by the council or perhaps by the Director-General of that organisation at the time when this Report was going to be discussed in Dáil Éireann.  Whoever was concerned, possibly the Minister for Agriculture himself, was aware that this Report had been published in November, and <Col N="448" /> these proposals were made only within the past three weeks.  Then the Taoiseach speaks here about a three per cent adjustment in wages.</P>
    <P>It has become quite clear that the ordinary people of this country&mdash;by &ldquo;ordinary people&rdquo;, I mean those who have to work to earn their livelihood&mdash; are facing a conspiracy between this Government and the Federated Union of Employers.  The Government say they do not intend to give their staffs any increase; they talk about a three per cent adjustment in the face of a 10.5 per cent increase in the cost of living.  Let us remember that usually the spring is a period in which the cost of living increases more rapidly than at other times of the year.  When the cost of living figure comes out for the period to mid-February, we may find that lower-paid workers are again subject to increasing hardship.</P>
    <P>One knows that to apply compensation to wage and salary earners whose wages are around £10 a week&mdash;and there are many salary earners at that level&mdash;would require about ten per cent, but to apply an adjustment all round would require no more across the board, as far as wage and salary earners are concerned, than around seven per cent.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach is giving sustenance to the people who are responsible for the deepsea port of Dublin being closed today.  Anyone who knows about the situation is aware that the dispute should be settled between the representatives of the workers and the representatives of the employers.  They will not be let settle it, and I wonder, and lots of people are wondering if this direction is reinforced by the case made in the discussion on this incomes policy report by the Government spokesmen.</P>

      <P>I am expressing a thought aloud.  I have expressed statements of fact in relation to what the Government's attitude has been over the years in relation to wage adjustments at particular times.  Some of the Fianna Fáil spokesmen were not over there but were on these benches when their stooges in every area were going around insisting that claims be put in for very substantial increases.  I can state that from personal knowledge.  I was present at many meetings around 1951 when claims without any relation to the facts were being pressed very strongly in every trade union and in every area by people who were known supporters of Fianna Fáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>They were not taking responsibility for government at that time.  They were here.  Maybe they will be here again, which might be good for lots of people.  The Taoiseach goes further and talks about fringe benefits and reduction of working hours.  He suggested we might interfere with the principle of collective bargaining.  He is aware, and the Minister for Finance is aware, that there has been a particular attitude adopted by the Federated Union of Employers in the past few months.  What control will the Government announce to this House that they have taken in regard to the fringe benefits of those who are not wage and salary earners?  One of the problems in examining the question of an incomes policy is that of convincing workers on the shop floor, in the factory or in the office that an attempt is being made to control the managerial side of business, to control the incomes of directors and of other people who are more properly described than civil servants as faceless men.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everybody would like to know whether the Government have any specific plans in regard to the control of such incomes.  Anyone knows that above a certain level in industry, it is not announced what the salaries are, and nobody gives information as to how many directorships are held by individuals, what income they are getting and what free shares they are getting.  Of course it is announced in <Col N="450" /> the newspapers when companies decide to issue bonus shares, a device they use for their own purposes.  The people are insisting that the Government should start at the top in controlling incomes and that they should afford those in the lower grades the opportunity of getting an increase which will, to some extent, compensate for the rise in the cost of living.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Government's lack of activity in this respect, we must examine their record over the years, during which the trade union movement and even some of the employers indicated it would be good for the economy to try to bring about stability of prices to stop the spiral of wages chasing prices.  What was the attitude of Fianna Fáil spokesmen? It was that it could not be done, that it should not even be attempted.  It has taken a long time to educate them in this respect.  The principles enshrined in this Report may be agreed to by the trade union movement and generally, but the important thing is not to have just a set of principles but to take them and apply them.  I doubt if any set of the principles set out here would be applied fairly and equitably, having regard to the record of the Government over the years in relation to wage adjustments.</P>
    <P>Discussing labour costs here and in Britain in a previous debate, the Taoiseach used the term &ldquo;lazy industrialists&rdquo; or &ldquo;lazy employers&rdquo;.  I wonder to what extent the labour figures as shown have been inflated by a number of such industrial undertakings.  I believe a number of industrialists in this country have been sitting back and letting others do their work for them.  We all know a certain section of industrialists have been inflating their administrative staffs with a consequential overburdening of overhead charges.  There have been industrialists who have attempted to modernise, to re-equip themselves for the problems that lie ahead.</P>
    <P>In such circumstances, one gets an unbalanced view when talking purely in terms of unit costs here as compared with those in Britain.  Several matters have to be taken into consideration. In many cases unit costs are higher <Col N="451" /> here because of the fact that the industry concerned is smaller and less diversified than its counterpart in Britain or in Europe.  All this brings us to the question of fringe benefits.  Let us compare such benefits here with those in Britain and in Northern Ireland&mdash;longer holidays, shorter working hours.  In Northern Ireland yesterday, bakery workers went on a five-day week, from Monday to Friday.  In this part of the country, there was a dispute in that trade before Christmas and a five-day week was conceded but not from Monday to Friday to all engaged in the industry.  When thinking of comparisons, does the Minister for Finance not realise that in any examination of unit costs here, the workers' side will always think in terms of such things as working hours of similar employees in Britain, Germany, France and other European countries, and of the holidays enjoyed by fellow-workers in those countries?</P>
    <P>In this context there is also a comparison to be made in relation to the situation here <i>vis-à-vis</i> other countries where a worker happens to be unemployed. The Irish worker's lot is not at all a happy one by comparison with that of a worker in Northern Ireland, Britain, France, Germany, Holland and so on.  We in the Labour Party submit there must be co-operative effort to deal with all these problems. This effort is called for because of the uneven approach of the Government to these problems over the years.</P>
    <P>During the past two years, Deputies, particularly those who are members of local authorities, are aware that Ministers have been chasing county and city managers about building programmes which had been neglected during the years.  Suddenly, in the past two years, Ministers decided to hurry things up, to expedite plans.  Local authorities were suddenly asked to prepare plans for essential housing programmes.  The local authorities did their utmost to churn out the plans and just when they had become geared to the task, there was a sudden falling off.  How is it that the experts of the Department concerned or the Government were not able to <Col N="452" /> forecast the situation?  In May, 1964, the Government could not get plans quickly enough for schools, for housing and other development.  One local authority alone had plans for urgent development to the tune of over £1 million.  Then, the Minister said: &ldquo;No, we cannot do anything about it.  We must look at the capital programme again.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>One local authority had entered into commitments to the extent of £10 million in one phase of activity but there was no money left, and we now have the situation when building contractors who over the years established plant and organisation are dismantling them because they do not see any possibility of getting any contracts. If this Government had not been in power for so long, if they had come to office as recently as, say, 1962 and had not the knowledge or experience, there would be some excuse for them.  This Government have been in power for a very long time.  Before the general election in 1965, we had Ministers who had been there for a very long time.  They were getting a bit old, grey and tired.  After the election, we had the Taoiseach who is an expert in matters of industry and commerce and we had some Ministers who were new and keen.  We thought we would have no problem there.</P>
      <P>The Report of the NIEC has been used mainly, as far as I can see, as a deliberate device by the Government to introduce a wages policy.  They have not said clearly, and I repeat this, what they propose to do with the people who do not come into a wage and salary bracket.  They must propose to do something.  Today we read that the price of wheat has been increased by 10/- a barrel.  Does that mean that this is a restriction of three per cent on the growers of wheat?  It does not appear to me that there is a restriction on the growers of wheat to three per cent.  They have been given an increase of 10/- a barrel.  I do not know what the value of it was.  I understand the National Farmers Association made a representation for that amount.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government have said to the civil servants that they do not propose giving them any increase because they do not think the time is opportune.  Maybe the people in the middle income bracket, whether they are civil servants, clerical workers, farmers or somebody else can do with the three per cent at this particular time.  The people who are relatively well off are naturally in a stronger position in any particular time of difficulty. Those who rely on their week's wages on their week's or fortnight's salary to provide them with the basic necessaries of life are the worst hit in time of difficulty.</P>
      <P>We were told that the average earnings of an industrial worker are around £14 a week.  This figure was referred to in the case of the earnings of industrial workers going in excess of the 12 per cent.  I think this reference was made by the Taoiseach yesterday.  That attitude, in my opinion, is not the correct one because the earnings for this purpose include the result of contributions to those workers to increase productivity.  In recent years there has been an extension of incentive schemes to workers to increase productivity. Their earnings take in overtime earnings, earnings on Saturdays or Sundays. Surely, in this year of 1966, it should be realised that workers must be paid adequately for work on Saturday and Sunday and that this type of information should not be used.  We know that it is making a statistical exercise of the same situation.  This may have been all right in 1963, 1962 or 1961.  We are concerned at the moment with the indication which the Government have given that they are opposed to any increase in excess of three per cent.  It is not clear, at this stage, how they hope to maintain that situation, and whether they hope for collusion with the Federated Union of Employers and others to enable them to adopt that attitude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a real threat in the Taoiseach's statement that the Government may be thinking of some form of wage restraint.  It is imperative, in my <Col N="454" /> opinion, before the Government give any thought to such a line of approach, which would be resisted, that they should take steps to ensure that other sections of the community, whose incomes are not readily ascertainable at the moment and who do not conform to the income tax regulations with regard to their income, will also come under this restraint.  I do not know how the Government can control increases in those sectors to three per cent.</P>
    <P>I want to conclude on this note. I do not think anybody has seriously challenged the general views and the general principles set down in the NIEC Report.  The statistics are there.  There is a certain interpretation being given to some of them.  The issue is not just this motion before us, in the name of the Minister for Finance, but how any proposed incomes policy, as adumbrated in this Report, will be applied, or can be applied, in the circumstances of our economy.  There is one thing the members of this Party are completely opposed to, that is, any suggestion of the application of a wages policy in isolation, even supposing the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Taoiseach were all prepared to work out a scheme to bring the people who are not normally covered, that is, the self-employed and others, under their control.</P>
    <P>There are problems even in the field of normal wages and salaries.  At a particular point in time it may well be that the workers voluntarily will not press for an increase in excess of what they think would be a reasonable amount, but there are so many changes taking place in industry, in clerical and in technical employment, that there must be this freedom to negotiate, to have collective bargaining, collective negotiation, collective discussions, and to reach a collective agreement arising from these changes.  If the industry of this country is to develop, these changes will continue, and possibly grow faster.  If, in those circumstances, the workers have to be trained to undertake tasks with which they are not familiar, and trained to engage in operations which require greater skill, <Col N="455" /> their representatives must be free to negotiate adequate compensation for the added responsibility they will take on.</P>
    <P>There can be problems even within a single industry where there may be a number of units.  One unit may be efficient, and it may be successful in a selling campaign or in production.  As a result it may become more profitable. Workers in that unit will naturally seek to share in the productivity to which they have contributed.  Even in the one industry there may be different levels of take-home pay.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach referred to the fixing of conditions of work.  There are a number of sections&mdash;the joint industrial councils, the joint labour committees&mdash;operating at present under the aegis of the Minister for Industry and Commerce to fix minimum conditions. For too many these seem to be also maximum conditions.  The Taoiseach is not reported as fixing minimum conditions of work.  He is not reported as saying he is thinking in terms of fixing minimum wages.  The Taoiseach is reported as urging &ldquo;fixing conditions of work&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>There are 17 joint labour committees and they have already provided for minimum rates of wages, minimum hours of work, overtime payments, etc., and so forth.

      <P>Consequently, they delay in adjusting to the changes taking place in our economy.  They are almost as bad as the Board of Works.  There are joint industrial councils which operate under the aegis of the Minister for Industry and Commerce and they prescribe by agreement rates of wages, hours of work, holidays, etc.</P>
      <P>I have said that it may well be that in one industry, although there are minimum requirements in some units, because of their operations, because of their advantages in having more efficient machinery, because of their organisation being better or their sales force being more expert, other units are able to achieve something beyond the minimum.  In circumstances where the workers have contributed substantially to productivity, is the Taoiseach suggesting that they will not get their share?  Why should they not?  There is a difficulty in relation to this type of proposal when it is read against the background of the statements made by the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach, that in present circumstances three per cent is the maximum. I presume the Minister means three per cent for everyone, including the self-employed, the company directors, and the shareholders.  Deputy Dillon and Deputy Cluskey dealt adequately with the bankers yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach referred to the question of fringe benefits.  It appears to me that the only thing that can be read into this statement&mdash;and I am sure this particular paper would not print it unless it was satisfied it was adequately reporting the Taoiseach's views&mdash;is that we will have a levelling <Col N="457" /> and that the levelling shall be down.  I concentrated my remarks not so much on the information contained in this very valuable Report, not so much on some of the general principles to which we can all subscribe, but on the difficulty of applying those recommendations. It would be difficult enough in circumstances in which the Government's approach to wages and salaries was clear-cut but it is more difficult in our existing situation.</P>
    <P>The suggestion is that workers will not be entitled to seek or secure compensation for increase in the cost of living, not a little of which has resulted from the decisions of the Government, their actions and their failure to apply a brake at the correct time.  In 1965, they brought in a Prices Bill but why did they not do something in February, 1964?  It was anticipated then that portion of the 12 per cent increase would be to cover expected increases in the cost of living, possibly at about two per cent, and this was intended to give the workers a breathing space. However, the Government were satisfied purely to take the political credit for the negotiations between the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the FUE and other employers' organisations.</P>
    <P>In the early part of 1964 they did not say: &ldquo;We have reached the point at which there is some stability and we should do something about maintaining it.&rdquo; In these circumstances, discussion on this Report is to some extent unreal because while we are discussing it in here, there are thousands and thousands of workers outside who require a cost of living adjustment without delay in their wages and salaries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>We welcome the belated efforts of the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance to inform the Dáil of the present state of our economy.  The Taoiseach admitted that it was in a serious state.  For the past few months, we have been asking that the Dáil be informed of the position but instead the Taoiseach and various Ministers attended dinners, lectured the people, and evaded their responsibility.  It is only in the past few days that they have come here <Col N="458" /> and told the people what they claim to be the truth.  I hope the people have been told the truth and that nothing has been kept from them. Personally, I have my doubts because I think this Government for many years have been trying to by-pass this House.  No later than yesterday I asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries a question about tillage and he told me that he hoped to make an announcement on the matter almost immediately.  I want to protest in the strongest possible manner against the attitude of the Minister in bypassing Parliament and refusing to give vital information to Deputies. In today's paper we read that yesterday the Minister spoke at an agricultural committee of Fianna Fáil.  They do not say at what time, nor is it stated where the meeting was held, but the information I have is that the statement was made before he answered my question here in the House.  I should like the Minister for Finance, or the Minister for Agriculture, to deny that statement but that is the information I have.</P>
      <P>As far as this Government are concerned, politics is no longer the art of governing the people but an exercise in the avoidance of responsibility. For them, Parliament has become a place not where problems are faced or where questions are answered, but where they are circumvented. The present is no time for evasion because we are going through &mdash;the Taoiseach has at last informed us&mdash;a crisis and it is time for co-operation. The Government should stretch out their hands and ask for the help of all.  There is a constructive Opposition whose Leader has pledged his support.  It is a time when every body should be taken into the confidence of the Government and people should be told the truth.  If we are to have happenings such as yesterday's happening in the case of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries it will be very difficult to get the full co-operation of the people on this side of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>England had her difficulties and Churchill brought the country through, with the promise of blood, sweat and tears.  Yesterday the Taoiseach said that there might be 100,000 unemployed <Col N="459" /> here, despite the fact that in November he promised that there would not be 90,000 or 100,000 unemployed as there were at one time. There may be unemployment facing the people and there may be blood, sweat and tears, but it would be much better for the Government if the people were told the truth.  There is no point in telling the county councils that money and grants are available when we all know that money and grants cannot be obtained for those unfortunate people who are planning to get married and build houses.  There is no use in the Minister for Education telling us, as he did yesterday, that there is money to build schools, when I know, as a member of a committee in Mullingar, that we had prepared the contract for a school, the Minister had given sanction and it had been advertised and then the axe fell.  There is no point in the Government promising pie in the sky; they must come down to hard reality. They should remember that there are reasonable people in the country, in the trade unions, in the FUE and in this House, and if they all come together, the difficulties facing us can be surmounted by joint effort.  If the Government continue as at present, then the ship of State will go down with that famous slogan &ldquo;Lemass Leads On&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate to ask what has produced this situation.  There is only one answer: the deliberate inflationary policy which the Government have pursued for the past five or six years.  It seems that the Government were determined to pursue an openly inflationary policy.  The evils that would ensue from such a policy were pointed out from this side of the House by people such as Deputy Cosgrave, Deputy Dillon, Deputy T. F. O'Higgins and many others.  The Government were warned on numerous occasions but they did not heed the warning. They continued on their merry way with their heads in the air and their feet off the ground.  We see where that has brought us today.  It might be no harm to quote the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 31st October, 1964, when Deputy Dillon <Col N="460" /> was Leader of the Fine Gael Party.  He pointed out:</P>
    <P>The present economic situation of this country is highly critical.  As I pointed out to the Government in the Adjournment Debate in Dáil Éireann on July 1st, the inflationary trends in Great Britain could not long continue after their general election, and that the post-election period in Great Britain would create new and formidable problems for this country.</P>
    <P>He continued:</P>
    <P>Our Government have apparently been taken by surprise by these developments and they are entitled to a reasonable time to demonstrate what steps they propose to take to meet the new situation, but if, as I suspect, they have no plans to deal with what can only be described as the crisis which now confronts the country, it is high time for them to get out.</P>
    <P>They were warned at that time but they heeded not the warning.  It is the Government's duty to govern, control the economy and balance all factors, one against the other.  They are the people who should know the facts.  It is their duty to avoid a succession of booms and slumps.  They have failed to do their duty.  They took a gambler's chance on our gaining admission to the Common Market to cover up their faults and failures.  They failed in that. They have made an Agreement which I believe is bad for the country.  However, I will not discuss it now because we discussed it for a long period.  They think if they have enough propaganda about that in the <i>Irish Press</i> and on Radio and Telefís Éireann, if they promise the people pie in the sky in future, they will keep their minds and thoughts off the pressing problems confronting them at present.</P>
    <P>We know things are bad today.  We are all agreed we must try to find a solution to the industrial disputes which, if allowed to continue, will strangle the economic life of the country.  I believe a period of stability and harmony is needed if we are to survive this crisis and achieve our <Col N="461" /> targets, social and economic.  We must all, if possible, try to work harder.  The lead must come from the top, even from the people here in Leinster House, from Ministers and Deputies, from management and everybody else.  It is true to say that in this country a large number of our managers in industry and those in other important positions do not pull their weight.  Many of them are too fond of the coffee bars and the golf courses.  I know from experience that people in high responsible positions are not to be found in their offices when they should be there; they are to be found in other places.  If you go to Europe and inquire, you will be told the managers of factories are in at 7 o'clock in the morning.  They open their correspondence and are ready to meet their workers and show an example.  That is not happening in this country.  Those people should pull up their socks and give an example.  It is necessary for everybody to work harder to safeguard their own jobs and to produce a bigger national cake.</P>
    <P>The bald truth today is that we are pricing ourselves out of the market.  If this continues, our industrialists will not be able to hold their own even on the home market when tariffs are reduced. If it continues, it is definitely the road to economic disaster.  It is time the people were told the truth. Let us all try to get together and save the nation.  The Government should give the lead, but unfortunately, they are not doing so.  The more we look at the sad history of this country for the past few years, the more we realise that the Government are responding rather to every wind that blows.  They gave labour its head when labour was restive in the past.  We remember&mdash;I do not want to go into it&mdash;the position with the ESB in 1961 before the general election.  They took the employers' side when the employers were worried.  They came to the succour of every sectional interest, including the £4 million status increase to the civil servants, and let the rest of the country go hang.  The result we see all around us today.</P>
    <P>There is an obligation on every political Party who seeks office to tell <Col N="462" /> the people the truth, not to mislead them and fool them.  There is an obligation to tell the people how the Government are using the powers entrusted to them.  The financial crisis with all its evil effects which is now upon us but which the Taoiseach, the former Minister for Finance, Dr. Ryan, and other members of the Government so falsely denied before the general election, is now revealed and accepted by all.  We know the Government knew about it over a year ago.  They were warned by Deputy Dillon over 15 months ago, but they took no action. We know that Britain has had her difficulties for the past year or so.  But they were perhaps due to her huge commitments abroad.  The majority of our difficulties here are of the Government's own making.  These difficulties are taking place not at a time as in 1956 when cattle prices were £4 per cwt, but at a time when in 1964 cattle exports reached an all-time high record and in 1965 when cattle were selling at from £7 to £8 per cwt&mdash;double the price in 1956.</P>
    <P>We must try to trace the reasons for the present mess.  The roots of the economic distress and industrial unrest go back to February, 1963.  In February, 1963 the Government issued the White Paper <i>Closing the Gap.</i> Its purpose was to underline the danger of living beyond our means.  Our people were told they were spending too much. It was clear we could not maintain that level unless we earned more abroad.  Accordingly, the White Paper urged.  Departments, State-sponsored organisations, trade unions and others, to make no demands for higher wages until we increased production.  The White Paper evoked a reasonable response from employers, workers, trade unions and all concerned.</P>
    <P>Until the autumn of 1963, we had stability here.  Wage demands were few and strikes were fewer still.  Then the Government introduced their iniquitous turnover tax, a new tax imposed for the first time in the history of the country on bread, butter, tea, sugar, meat, fuel, clothes and all the necessaries of life.  Fine Gael, including Deputy Dillon, Deputy Cosgrave, Deputy T. F. O'Higgins and others, <Col N="463" /> pointed out at that time the bad effect of this ill-conceived policy, how a tax on the necessaries of life was bound to increase the cost of living.  They pointed out that this would again fan the flames of inflation with all its harmful effects and that it could do irreparable harm to the national economy.  Unfortunately, all our forecasts have been proved right.  There was a sudden jump in prices.  The Government did nothing about it&mdash;they allowed prices to rise and rise without murmur or protest.  The cost of living began to increase.  While the Government were calling for restraint, the worker's pay packet was not going as far as before.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil speakers argued at that time that the turnover tax would have only a minimal effect on prices, that it would mean only two and a half per cent or less.  They even went so far as to say that, with increased competition, the majority of merchants would absorb it and that very few of them would pass it on.  Were Fianna Fáil so innocent as to believe that a policy of restraint could be maintained in the new conditions of higher prices which Fianna Fáil themselves had created?  It was a major tactical error from the start right up to the present chaos and the present economic crisis which confronts each and every one of us in this country.</P>
    <P>Remember, the next move was a clever political move by the Government and by the Leader of the Government. This move was called &ldquo;Closing the Gap&rdquo;.  The death of two Teachtaí Dála very suddenly closed the gap.  The Taoiseach changed horses in midstream. He took out his pen and wrote a letter.  The gap between spending and income had somehow suddenly and mysteriously been closed.  He quoted figures to show how the gap had been closed so quickly.  No Minister has quoted any figures since.  Not even the Minister for Transport and Power, who is so fond of quoting figures throughout the length and breadth of this country, has told us.  Neither has any member of the Fianna Fáil Party told us how that gap was closed.  The Taoiseach simply wiped out the picture <Col N="464" /> he painted throughout the years and drew a a grand new one in Fianna Fáil optimistic colours.  So we had the famous 12 per cent as a bribe to the electorate of Cork and Kildare in order to win two by-elections.  A sum of £40 million was injected into the economy to win those two by-elections.  The Government may now say that they were not responsible but I was in Kildare at that time, and I know that their canvassers went from place to place throughout the country saying, in effect: &ldquo;The Government got this increase for you.  If you vote against them, you may not get it.  Keep them in office and you will get your increase of 12 per cent&rdquo;&mdash;and they claimed credit, and unfortunately got credit, for it at the time.</P>
    <P>Having won the two by-elections, the Taoiseach switched horses again and proceeded to sound dire warnings throughout the spring and summer of 1964.  He said that the 12 per cent was more than they should have given.  He was now back again, backing the employers' point of view.  Even some Government Ministers said that eight or nine per cent was all the economy could bear.  The Taoiseach said we had taken out a mortgage on the future, that productivity and exports would have to go up to cover it and that there must be no more wage demands.  The argument may have been valid from statistics but it was not in accordance with what the Taoiseach and his Government had been saying before the Cork and Kildare by-elections.  Once more the Taoiseach was contradicting himself, but what about it or what about the country: he had won the two by-elections and Fianna Fáil and their followers were still in the saddle.  The circus continued.  The people saw through the Government and their broken promises and Fianna Fáil lost Roscommon to Deputy Mrs. Burke and East Galway to Deputy Donnellan and mid-Cork to Deputy Mrs. Desmond.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall deal with that in my own good way and in my own good time.  Not only did Fianna Fáil keep the truth from the people at <Col N="465" /> that time but they knew a crisis was coming: they failed to tell the people the truth at that time.  The economic crisis then began to get worse.  The Fianna Fáil Party knew the full facts about the state of the economy and knew that an economic recession was about to come upon us.  They knew that things would get worse.  Fianna Fáil were the only people who had the facts.  They knew the situation.  Therefore, the Taoiseach, ably supported I presume, by each and every one of you, called a general election.  Fianna Fáil did that because they knew that if they remained in office much longer, they would not be able to keep the truth from the people.  Their idea was to have a general election, to be returned to office, and to try to straighten out things in the ensuing four or five years. The Fianna Fáil attitude was that if Fine Gael were returned to office, they would blame Fine Gael for the economic crisis which was about to break upon us and in that way they would try to ensure that the Party on this side of the House would never achieve office again.  We should thank God we did not get into office last April.  It is much better to leave Fianna Fáil to stew in their own juice and to wallow in their own mess, and to get out of it as quickly as they possibly can.</P>
      <P>When the general election was called, of course the Fianna Fáil Party again changed horses.  They again wiped out the picture they had been painting up to then and painted a completely different picture which shows that Fianna Fáil are prepared to stoop to anything to cling to power in this country.  Let us bring our minds back to last January and February.  Overnight, the country became more prosperous. Banks started to give out the money.  The Agricultural Credit Corporation gave out money freely even to buy a Mercedes car.  It was preached at the crossroads, on the radio and on television and in innumerable speeches by the Taoiseach and by the Government.  It might be no harm for the House to hear what our Taoiseach said in a special message on the eve of the general election last April:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="466" /> Before you vote, look around you &mdash;look at what has happened or is happening in your city, town or county, and then decide.  It is your own future, as well as the future of the country, which depends on your decisions.</P>
    <P>The main task of the next five years is to maintain the momentum of the country's economic progress which has now been built up.</P>
    <P>If it has been built up, then it must have been on shaky foundations.  The message continues.</P>
    <P>It is only by this means that the nation can get the additional resources it needs to fulfil its social purposes&mdash;in Social Welfare, Housing, Health, Education, and so on.</P>
    <P>We know that the axe has fallen on Health and Education and Housing since those promises were made to the people.  Let me continue to quote from the Taoiseach's message on that occasion:</P>
    <P>Everything depends on the country's agricultural and industrial production continuously increasing as it now is.  I urge you not to allow your attention to be diverted from this central and fundamental fact.</P>
    <P>Our national production is going up now, as never before in our history.</P>
    <P>He then referred to the situation that might arise on a change of Government. He suggested we might go back to a period in our economy such as that which prevailed in 1956.  He said that that must not happen again and that he doubted if this country could pull itself out of such a situation a second time.  We know we are now in a worse situation than the one in which we were in 1956.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach ended his message with these words:</P>
    <P>Our country can now face a future that is steadily becoming brighter. All our national aims are now within our reach.  This is not a time to stop or to falter, much less to turn back.</P>
    <P>Who is stopping now?  Who is faltering? Is it not the man who wrote that message to the Irish people?  Under <Col N="467" /> Fianna Fáil, the country is stopping, faltering, turning back and, according to the Taoiseach's words, unless there is a change, we shall shortly have 100,000 people unemployed.  He did not tell us that at the time but Fianna Fáil knew it and so did Ministers at that time&mdash;I am not saying the present Minister knew it because he might not have had the facts.  They knew this crisis was upon us.  They wanted a snap election and another four years during which time they hoped to be able to right things or to let the Opposition take over the reins of government and then accuse the Opposition of being responsible for the sorry situation.</P>
    <P>He told us everything depended on the country's agricultural production continuously increasing.  Since he made those statements, there has been even a further decline in tillage acreage. This from Fianna Fáil, and we were supposed to be the ranchers.  This is what they brought.  We know now that there has been a decline in the tillage acreage and it shows a wasting economy stricken with pernicious anaemia.  But even the Golden Boy cannot make things hum in his own Department.  There used to be a legendary king called Midas and everything he touched was supposed to turn to gold.  Unfortunately, for the people of this country, it does not seem to be the case today, when everything the Golden Boy touches seems to turn sour.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance said: &ldquo;We won the election.&rdquo; They won it because they knew there was a crisis on top of us and, by radio, television and newspapers, succeeded in getting their own propaganda across to the people throughout the length and breadth of this country.  It might be no harm to quote from a full page advertisement on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party in the <i>Sunday Press</i> of 4th April, 1965. One read in huge type:</P>
    <P>This is No Time for a Change!</P>
    <P>But, what a change since Fianna Fáil returned to office! Reading on, one found this:</P>
    <P>Does it make sense to exchange the <Col N="468" /> Fianna Fáil programme&mdash;which is working successfully now&mdash;for a leap into the past with Fine Gael, Labour or a Coalition?</P>
    <P>Then came this:</P>
    <P>Our recent prosperity is not yet strong enough to withstand the shock of a change of government.</P>
    <P>Now, they and their people tell us it was not even strong enough to withstand another three or four months of Fianna Fáil Government because, in July, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance were warning us that we were heading towards an economic crisis.  Then, in the same advertisement, we had those beautiful appropriate lines:</P>
    <P>In this crucial general election you must ensure that Fianna Fáil is enabled to carry on with a working majority, so that the economy is given a chance to continue expanding without confusion, delay and indecision.</P>
    <P>What has happened since?  As I said, the Taoiseach knew the crisis was upon us then.  They told us they wanted to continue on in Government so that the economy would be given a chance to continue expanding without confusion, delay and indecision.  But what have we today in this country?  We have confusion, we have delay and we have indecision.  And how neat and nice to continue expanding that confusion, delay and indecision today with the extra 10,000 unemployed in the last month and the people in Mullingar, Athlone, Dublin, Cork, Waterford and throughout the length and breadth of this country who cannot get grants for houses to carry on with the work they should be doing.</P>
    <P>But the last sentence of that Fianna Fáil pre-election full page advertisement in the <i>Sunday Press</i> of the 4th April, 1965 read:</P>
    <P>The best is yet to come.</P>
    <P>In fact, of course, it should have read:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The worst has yet to come&rdquo; because the Taoiseach, or the Minister, when they were putting in that advertisment at that time knew themselves that the worst had yet to come.  But such is the regard for the sacredness of the <Col N="469" /> truth, such is the degree of the development of the art of calculated deception in the public life of this country today. It is all right for the Minister to say they won the election.  That is why they won the election because at that time, with his 12 per cent in his pocket and when prices had still to catch up with him, the Fianna Fáil message, perhaps, did sound reasonable enough to the man in the street.  With their vast propaganda machinery, with the hundreds of thousands they were able to get from people throughout the length and breadth of the country and the money poured into the election, Fianna Fáil were returned to power. They are now the big man's Party, industrialists subscribe generously to them, and all that helped to get them back into power.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, then safely back in the saddle, changes horses again and wipes out the picture he had been drawing for the general election.  He draws a brand new picture in pessimistic colours but, once more, the Taoiseach is contradicting himself. But what of it?  He is back in power again and Fianna Fáil and their friends are still enjoying the fruits of office. In July he warns us that things are bad.  The election is over now, and we have stringent price control, we have new restrictions on credit, with more to come this year, due to the bad government and economic policy pursued by Fianna Fáil over the last three or four years.  We have a record adverse trade balance of £146 million in 1965.  Record taxes of over £225 million to £230 million have been collected from the people of this country this year and, if what we hear and read in the newspapers is correct, that may be increased to £250 million in the year ahead.  Millions extra are being taken from the people this year in rates.  I think over £30 million has been taken in rates, and our national debt stands at an all-time high record of, I think, approximately £240 million at the present time.  The cost of living, due to the economic policy of the Government, stands at an all-time high record of 181 points and emigration has been increasing since 1956.</P>
    <P>According to the figures in this <Col N="470" /> Report, as have been quoted by Deputy Ryan, the emigration figures for 1964 are double those for 1961 or 1962. Remember&mdash;and I quote from the <i>Irish Press</i> of the 28th October, 1965&mdash; there are 158,100 fewer people in employment in 1964 than there were in 1951.  That is what Fianna Fáil economic policy has got for us so far.  I know there are, perhaps, a great many difficulties to be faced before we can arrive at a workable incomes policy.  There is the attitude of both the unions and the employers but, in this country at the present time, the Government are very lucky in that regard because the representatives of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, those nominated by the Federated Union of Employers, those nominated by the other employer organisations, those nominated by the State bodies and those nominated by the Federation of Irish Industries Ltd., who have endorsed this NIEC Report seem to be in favour of an incomes policy.  I suppose there are more who will still object and claim that it is restricting their usual freedom of action, but, at the same time, I want to say that the system which has served us so well in the past may not still be the best system.</P>
    <P>All these things are debatable.  The system that has served us well in the past may not be the best system in present circumstances.  It is true that perhaps without this system in the past workers would not have achieved a just wage or what they have at the present.  That does not mean we should allow the system to remain without modification.  In present circumstances its operation may be against the common good.  Neither does it mean that modification of the system can be left to the parties concerned. If the general economic good is involved the Government have a right to interfere to bring all concerned together.  They are all rational people, and nearly all Irish men and women. They have the future of the country at heart and if they get together there is no reason why they could not hammer out an incomes policy which would be fair and just to all.  That is what we all want.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="471" /> I said earlier that there is a responsible Opposition in the country.  The Government have not held out the hand of friendship nor have they asked for support and co-operation as they should have done.  We remember the political capital Fianna Fáil made of the 1956 crisis which, unlike the present one, was not of our making but was due, first of all, to financial and economic upsets in Britain which had adverse repercussions on our economy. Secondly, it was due to the rise in the bank rate in England and the consequent difficulty experienced by the Government at that time in procuring capital.  Thirdly, it was due to the dispute in the summer of that year concerning the taking over by Egypt of the Suez Canal.  Fourthly, it was due to the dumping of Argentine cattle on the British market depressing the prices of Irish cattle which were reduced to £4 or £5 per cwt.  Fifthly, it was due to dislocation of business and industry caused by the blockade in 1956 of the Suez Canal and military operations in Egypt which resulted in increased petrol prices and some garages had to lay off workers, thus increasing unemployment. There was also the threat of world war.</P>
    <P>The actions which the Government of the day took were supported in the Dáil by Fianna Fáil&mdash;I want to say that&mdash;and the only criticism then was that the measures taken were inadequate and ineffective.  The Taoiseach said that they were too little and too late.  This criticism has now proved to be groundless.  But while giving lip service in the Dáil to these measures which the national situation required, Fianna Fáil began to reap the political benefits from their operation.  The Party were divided into two groups and their line was to agree in the Dáil that imports must be reduced and that expenditure must be decreased and severe measures put into operation. That group boasted that they had supported the Government in this national crisis but the other group was down the country keeping up a constant barrage of criticism of the Government for the inevitable consequences of the actions which the Fianna Fáil Party agreed <Col N="472" /> were necessary and had supported in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>Later, at the hustings in 1957 the Taoiseach, who had himself been one of those who agreed in the unanimous approval of these measures in the Dáil, committed himself to this proposition: &ldquo;I tell you, with all the responsibility of one who has been a Minister for 19 years, that there is no need for these restrictions.&rdquo;</P>

I wonder would the Taoiseach now, after 28 years as a Minister, and an older and a wiser man, tell us there was no need for these restrictions then and that there is no need for them now.  I doubt if he would.  During the past three years the economic and financial fabric of the State has been subject to forces, stresses and strains which threaten, unless drastic, immediate steps are taken, to cause irreparable damage to the economy of the country.  That has been pointed out by the members of this Party.  The Government did not heed the warnings and that is why we are in the plight in which we are today.</P>

In this city alone today there is industrial strife which will require the best guidance from trade unions and management to resolve.  That is a matter on which we should occupy our time rather than in reviewing past history since 1922.  We can all admire the past achievements of our predecessors. We never fail to appreciate their efforts.  Today there is a problem facing us which is far more real for us than the history of the past 40 years. The question of labour-management relationship must play an important part in the formation of our economy. Deputies should interest themselves in that matter rather than in reminiscing, as Deputy L'Estrange did.  He tried to quote facts that he was not sure about.</P>

        <i>(Dublin):</i> We should sincerely interest ourselves in the matter as to how best our economic problems can be solved and good labour-management relations established.  It is on the basis of good labour-management relations that the economy must be founded.  There has been a good deal of criticism expressed in the House of the Free Trade Agreement that was negotiated before Christmas.  There need be no fear if good labour-management relations can be established.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this city at the moment there is a strike which is causing untold hardship to many unfortunate people. It is not necessary for me to be specific. <Col N="475" /> We have had reports that various carassembly firms have dismissed 400 and 200 workers.  We should explore every possibility of securing a settlement in this matter.  In my constituency, Dublin South Central, there is untold hardship being created by this trade dispute.  I hope the Congress of Trade Unions and the employers particularly concerned in this matter can find some basis for a peaceful settlement.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the industrial unrest is not confined to this instance.  It seems to be general.  I do not know the reason for it.  It is a highly complicated matter.  For the sake of the country, so that the various economic and housing programmes which this Government have in mind can be implemented, every effort should be made to arrive at a peaceful solution to this matter.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to understand the basis for the criticism expressed by various members of the Opposition of this programme.  Having regard to the expansion of the economy in the past two or three years, it is a programme of which we can be justly proud.  The Government have a record in regard to their policies for every sector of the community, the farming community and the industrial community, of which they can be justly proud.  I am sure Deputy Dunne will agree that in Dublin there is evidence of economic expansion.</P>
