      <P>The question of approving the Ballyconnell-Derrylin road was considered as part of the review of cross-border traffic facilities undertaken, in consultation with the British customs authorities, last year.  As a result of this review four new routes were approved, one of which was the Belturbet-Derrylin road which is within a few miles of the road the Deputy has in mind.  I am satisfied that the volume of traffic would not justify the expense of maintaining a second frontier post in this area.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> Would the Minister agree that this is the only Border town of any size in either Cavan or Monaghan which has not got an approved road and that as a result the business people of Ballyconnell are at a very severe loss and disadvantage because this road is not open?</P>

      <P>I am afraid I am not sufficiently familiar with the geography along the Border to agree that this is the only town of a substantial size which has not got an approved road, but as I said in the reply, the other road is within such a short distance that to accede to this request would invite similar requests in respect of many other roads along the Border.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government (Mr. P. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I received a request from Clonmel Corporation to discuss their proposal to appropriate the Clonmel Theatre under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, <Col N="659" /> 1963, with a view to disposing of it for industrial purposes.  In view of the value of a municipal theatre to a town as large as Clonmel and its potential growth, I had already suggested that more thought should be given to the long term civic and social aspects of the proposal.  The structure is basically in sound condition and its outward appearance could be easily improved. The provision of a theatre on another site, if that should prove necessary in the future, would be difficult and costly.  While there is already some industry located nearby, the area is one of mixed use, with which theatrical activities are not incompatible. The corporation have earmarked an extensive area elsewhere for industrial development in their provisional plan for the town.  I understand that the industrialist in question has no intention of using the theatre for the expansion of his industry for some years to come even if it were transferred to him now.</P>
      <P>I am fully alive to the importance of planning authorities encouraging and facilitating industrial expansion in their area, but the more they succeed the greater will be the need for a high standard of social and recreational facilities.</P>
      <P>I am, accordingly, of the view that what is primarily needed now is not a discussion with a deputation but a more mature consideration of the proposal locally in the light of the various considerations that have been placed before the corporation.</P>

    <P>I understand from Dublin Corporation <Col N="661" /> that the total revenue paid to the corporation from 1st April, 1949, to 31st December, 1965, by exporters in respect of all cattle, sheep and lambs killed and dressed at the Corporation Abattoir for the export trade was £178,635.  Particulars of the revenue for the period from 1st April, 1943, to 1st April, 1949, are not available in the form required.</P>
    <P>The total revenue received by the corporation for the killing and dressing of cattle, sheep and lambs at the Abattoir for both the local and export trade from 1st April, 1943, to 31st December, 1965, was £592, 554,&mdash;of which £469,118 related to the period 1st April, 1949, to 31st December, 1965.</P>
    <P>The total expenditure from 1st April, 1943, to 31st December, 1965, on reconstruction and improvements to the abattoir amounted to £65,290. Of this sum, £35,678 related to reconstruction and improvement of buildings, £26,905 to new and replacement plant and £2,707 to new equipment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Haughey) Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 22 to 26 together.</P>
      <P>To put the whole matter into proper perspective, I must first point out that the primary purpose of the Dublin Corporation Abattoir is for the supply of meat for the local trade.  The abattoir was, however, registered for use for export purposes by a number of exporters who had not their own slaughtering premises, its use in this connection being limited to the extent that the abattoir was not required for the local trade.</P>
      <P>I should also point out that the proportion of our total exports of meat to the Continent which is accounted for by the abattoir is small&mdash;less than 2 per cent in the case of beef and about 10 per cent in the case of lamb.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present difficulty in regard to the shipment of carcase meat and lamb from the Dublin Corporation Abattoir arises from new standards prescribed in EEC Regulations which came into effect on 1st July 1965.  It is one of my <Col N="669" /> functions to supply to the EEC countries a list of premises in this country which comply with their prescribed standards.  The responsibility for complying with the requirements to bring premises up to the standards required by the importing countries rests with the owners of the premises &mdash;in this case the Dublin Corporation. I can only point out the standards required and, in the last resort, withhold export facilities if these standards are not met.</P>
    <P>In December, 1964, copies of the new EEC Regulations were furnished by my Department to the Irish Fresh Meat Exporters' Society, which comprises all persons and firms exporting meat from this country, including those exporters who operate from the abattoir.</P>
    <P>On 15th June 1965, following an inspection of the abattoir premises, there was a discussion between representatives of my Department and the corporation, during which it was made quite clear that it would not be possible to certify the abattoir as meeting the requirements of the EEC regulations. On 6th July the attention of the city manager was drawn to the unsatisfactory conditions at the abattoir, particularly in relation to the slaughter of sheep and lambs for the continental trade.</P>
    <P>There were further meetings with officials of the corporation in August and early in September, during which every opportunity was taken to impress on them the necessity for effecting substantial improvements if the abattoir were to be allowed to continue to export to the Continent. On 10th September, the corporation and the exporters operating from the abattoir were notified that the abattoir premises could not be included in a list of premises meeting the prescribed standards which had been requested by one of the EEC countries.  In the course of meetings in my Department at the end of September and the beginning of October with representatives of the corporation, the exporters and the workers at the abattoir, it was indicated by them that considerable improvements would be effected at the <Col N="670" /> abattoir within a month and my Department accordingly agreed on 8th October to restore the abattoir provisionally during that period to the approved list for the country concerned. Full details of the improvements required to bring the abattoir up to EEC standards were confirmed by letter to the corporation on 14th October.</P>
    <P>As the principal improvements required were not in fact carried out, I had no option but to withhold certification from the abattoir in respect of exports to EEC countries.  Otherwise, I would be furnishing an incorrect certificate to the Government of another country.  Having regard to the interests of the country's entire meat export trade, I cannot agree to any further temporary certification arrangement in respect of a premises which clearly does not meet the special requirements of the EEC countries.</P>
    <P>The bulk of the meat export trade from the Dublin abattoir to the Continent is in the form of lamb and my Department's records show that for many years the question of providing up-to-date sheep slaughtering facilities had been the subject of discussion with the abattoir authorities and that the construction of a new sheep slaughtering section at the abattoir has been under consideration for a lengthy period by the corporation. Plans submitted by the corporation were approved by my Department in 1961.  Revised plans were approved by my Department in 1963, and the latest information available to me is that a further set of plans is being prepared by the corporation.</P>
    <P>The fact is that my Department have been concerned for many years to secure that improvements would be made in the facilities available for export at the Dublin Corporation Abattoir.  Incidentally, the abattoir is not the only meat export premises which could not be approved for exports to EEC countries.  Out of 30 premises which had been engaged in recent years in exporting to those countries, four privately-owned premises have not been so approved.  Fortunately, however, our meat export <Col N="671" /> industry as a whole is up to date, progressive and efficient, and no less than 41 premises are approved for exports to the EEC countries.  These premises are quite capable of coping with any volume of trade likely to arise in the foreseeable future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's long and inaccurate reply, I should like to ask him if it is not a fact that the first communication received by the corporation from his Department was dated 10th September, 1965 and that in the course of that letter it is clearly stated that this directive was issued by the EEC countries on 26th June, 1964?  Could the Minister tell this House, as the Minister responsible for the dead meat export trade, why there was a lapse of 15 months before he took any action to ensure that the standards required were met?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Did I understand the Minister correctly to say that the first time he communicated with the exporters concerned was in December, 1964, and, if so, would he explain why he sat down between June, 1964 and December, 1964 and did not raise the matter at all?  Would he further please explain why he raised the matter with the exporters' association in December, 1964 but did not then raise it with the corporation, on his own reply, until June, 1965?</P>

      <P>There are two separate aspects of this.  First, there is a question of sheep slaughtering facilities, which is the main aspect of the matter.  The situation is that since the middle 1950s my Department have been in constant communication with Dublin Corporation month by month in an effort to get them to provide reasonable and adequate facilities.</P>

      <P>The position is as I have said.  Indeed, as some of my predecessors will be able to confirm, my Department have been in constant touch with the officials responsible in Dublin Corporation in an endeavour to have them provide proper and adequate sheep slaughtering facilities at the abattoir, both from the point of view of the home trade and of the export trade, but particularly the export trade which is our major responsibility.  In fact, in pursuance of these discussions the corporation submitted to my Department on two separate occasions, in 1961 and in 1963, plans which they sought our approval for.  We examined these plans and on both occasions approved of them and urged the corporation to proceed with them.  Unfortunately, they have not as yet proceeded with them.</P>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Sweetman, while the regulations were promulgated by the EEC Commission in Brussels in July, 1964 they were not expressed to come into operation until July, 1965. We had a considerable amount of inquiry in order to satisfy ourselves as to their exact content and the exact stipulations laid down.  It was not until December, 1964, we were able to have the whole thing completely cleared and inform the exporters, the people directly concerned, of the position and of the requirements they would have to meet.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say whether the exporters who use the abattoir up to the present are assured of accommodation in the premises that come within the regulations of the EEC?  Furthermore, could the Minister tell the House how extensive and how expensive are the alterations and why it is that the corporation have not carried them out?  Have they given a reason?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The reply to the first question is that in the case of private meat exporters, who, up to now, have been using Dublin Corporation abattoir, the abattoir is the only public abattoir in the country licensed for this purpose.  Indeed, it is something of an anachronism that it should ever have been licensed for meat export because basically its purpose is to serve the home trade.  However, it was for a variety of reasons.  In fact, when the Dublin Corporation built it first in 1930, it was regarded as the best and most efficient abattoir we had in the country.  Down the years it was permitted to participate in this export trade, although, in fact, developments in this business have long since rendered its present facilities obsolete, but the reply to Deputy Clinton's question is that as far as I know&mdash;indeed, not as far as I know, but definitely&mdash;there is no other public abattoir to which these <i>entrepreneurs</i> can go to get slaughtering facilities.</P>

It is clear that a new sheep slaughtering premises will have to be erected.  This has been recognised by the Dublin Corporation themselves for many years.  As I said, they submitted plans in 1961 for new premises, which we approved of.  They submitted new plans in 1963 for new sheep-slaughtering premises, which we approved of.

      <P>The Second Interim Report of the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure which <Col N="681" /> was published on 19th November, 1965, recommends that persons sworn as jurors should receive remuneration at the rate of £2 a day, the cost to be borne by the State.  The Report also recommends that, where the trial judge is satisfied that a juror is obliged to seek accommodation overnight, the cost of such accommodation should be borne by the State.</P>
      <P>I have also received from the Committee two further Interim Reports dealing with other aspects of the jury system, namely, Jury Trial in Civil Actions and Jury Challenges.  These two further Reports are at present being printed and will be published shortly.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;The question of loan schemes has not been adverted to in this discussion.  While such schemes operate in some countries, preliminary investigation showed that problems attached to them.  Any suggestion for a scheme, if it were to be appropriate to Irish conditions, would require careful examination.&rdquo;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Investigations are being carried out in a number of cases into the question of amalgamating one and two teacher schools with neighbouring national schools.  This is being done in County Kerry in common with other counties.</P>
      <P>The closing of any national school resulting from these investigations will not cause any hardship to the children concerned since transport will be made available to bring them to and from the amalgamated school.  In fact the vast majority of the children concerned will attend school under more favourable conditions than they do at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>How long is this process of considering amalgamations to go on?  Is it to operate to the exclusion of school building in perpetuity?  That is the first supplementary question I want to ask.  Secondly, when the Minister speaks of transport facilities being provided, does he intend to provide <Col N="684" /> these transport facilities free or are we going to make primary education in this country, for the first time, available only to those who can afford to pay for transportation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the Deputy's supplementary question is that there is no holdup in school building.  In fact, in the current year we will, I think&mdash;I cannot be sure until the year is over&mdash; have built more schools than ever before in any year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>As to how long this is to go on, naturally that depends on when we reach the end of the road as regards two-teacher schools.  There are some two-teacher schools which will continue into the foreseeable future. We are building new two-teacher schools in certain areas, depending on local circumstances.  I cannot say when the end of the road will be reached on this except that we will continue until we reach the end of the road.  As regards the question of transportation, it will be provided free.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That section 5 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I was inquiring last night from the Minister what the special significance of paragraph (n) was.  He was explaining that it introduced nothing new so I took the trouble to get the Principal Act of 1960.  If Deputies look at subsection (2), paragraphs (a) to (k), they will see that there are provided in these several paragraphs, which are all subject to a general provision in subsection (1), powers to enable the Authority to do all that is necessary to be done.  What I do not understand is why the Minister desires further to supplement the general character of subsection (1) of section 16 which reads:</P>
      <P>The Authority shall establish and maintain a national television and sound broadcasting service and shall have all such powers as are necessary for or incidental to that purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any reasonable reading of that general subsection will, I think, lead the House to believe that in case of any national emergency, or in a situation requiring communication urgently to <Col N="692" /> be made to the public at large on behalf of the Government in the public interest, the general subsection (1) gives the Authority all the powers it needs.  Subsection (2) goes on then to say:</P>
    <P>In particular and without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1) of this section, the Authority shall have the following powers . . .</P>
    <P>It can do a number of additional things, things associated with correspondence, for instance, with foreign broadcasting companies or foreign broadcasting authorities and it is quite understandable that the general power to maintain a national service requires to be supplemented by this specific provision.  But, over and above that, they were entitled to enter into correspondence with foreign broadcasting bodies.  Now we find that, in addition to the special powers included in subsection (2) for corresponding with foreign broadcasting authorities, we begin with a new paragraph (1), which is quite understandable, that further expands Telefís Éireann's right to correspond with a foreign broadcasting enterprise.  Then we come to paragraph (m) in this Bill.  That speaks of, subject to the consent of the Minister, compiling, publishing and distributing, with or without charge, recorded aural and visual material.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. J. Brennan) Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>And enables the Minister to lend it to Television Europe, or the Columbia Broadcasting Company, or somebody else.  But we come now to the interesting one, paragraph (n) which says:</P>
      <P>subject to the consent of the Minister, to provide services for and on behalf of Ministers of State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not on behalf of the Government. Why?  My submission is that subsection (1) of section 16 of the original Act gives the Authority all the powers it could conceivably require to deal with any situation of national emergency in which the Government ask it to intervene, to distribute news, or issue a <Col N="693" /> warning, or an exhortation, about foot and mouth disease, or an outbreak of smallpox, or the need for vaccination, or anything of that kind.  What is the meaning of giving it special power in an entirely different context&mdash;&ldquo;subject to the consent of the Minister, to provide services for and on behalf of Ministers of State&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Those of us who are familiar with the handling of legislation in this House are always put on guard when we find something injected into a context in which it does not belong.  I could understand it if this had been a proposal to provide a new paragraph to subsection (1)&mdash;that is to say, &ldquo;shall have all such powers as are necessary for and incidental to the purpose of maintaining a national television or sound broadcasting service&rdquo; and &ldquo;subject to the consent of the Minister, to provide services for and on behalf of Ministers of State&rdquo;.  But that is not what we are doing.  We are giving a general power in respect of the domestic scene and then setting out a whole series of things the Authority can do <i>vis-á-vis</i> foreign authorities and then we are being asked to put in three paragraphs, two of them dealing in the context of communication with foreign authorities and, slipped in at the end, &ldquo;subject to the consent of the Minister&rdquo;&mdash;in this case, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs&mdash;to provide services for and on behalf of Ministers of State. I do not think I am unreasonable if I ask the Minister now what has he in contemplation in asking for that power and, if he does not know&mdash;I mean to say, if it has not originated with the Minister himself&mdash;what is the justification for this requisition being made upon him by the Television Authority? If the Minister's position is the latter, then I think he should tell us on what grounds the Television Authority made this request.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this paragraph is to clarify the authority which, in fact, the Television Authority is already operating.  Section 16 is the section which broadly gives the Authority these powers to which Deputy Dillon referred.  In the paragraph <Col N="694" /> under subsection (2) these are more clearly defined and spelled out in simple terms, and more specifically, in relation to different things.  At the moment, Telefís Éireann are acting as agents for the Department of Education in a schools programme for which the Department refund them the cost.  This is done outside of ordinary broadcasting time.  There is some doubt as to whether the broad terms of section 16 cover it specifically or not.  This is simply a matter of making it specific in relation to other things, having regard to the possibility that some situation could arise in relation to other Departments.  They are already operating the schools programme service as agents for the Department of Education. The power to do so is derived from section 16.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the powers under section 16, the Act then proceeds to spell them out more specifically under these paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), (g), (h), (i), (j), and (k), with reference to material, and so on.  Under the amendment of this section we have to broaden the scope of some of them in order to leave no doubt as to what the Authority can do in regard to change of material, the question of recorded material, and so forth.  This further paragraph in relation to services for Ministers of State is for the same purpose.  There is nothing specifically spelled out with regard to the Authority acting as agents for a Department.  They have taken that authority from the broad terms of section 16.  They are already doing this work and this provision is to make is specific.</P>

      <P>The Minister and I are probably in substantial agreement here, but I merely want to approach it in the appropriate way.  I agree that the Authority ought to have, under subsection (1), the power to co-operate with the Department of Education, the Department of Health, the Department of Agriculture or with any other Department which may feel it can help. I would prefer if that was done not at <Col N="695" /> the instance of the Minister himself but at the instance of the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In practice, yes, but I will not worry about that.  What I am concerned to preserve is that if any abuse of this should arise and that it appeared to a reasonable citizen that a use was being made of television which was clearly not envisaged by subsection (1), he could proceed through the courts to restrain the Television Authority from proceeding with it.  Paragraph (n) takes that from him. Once paragraph (n) is put in, no matter what they broadcast, if you or I try to restrain them through the courts on the ground that they are exceeding the power Oireachtas Éireann laid down for them under section 16, they are entitled to say: &ldquo;We are, with the consent of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, providing a service for a Minister of State.&rdquo; The moment they establish that, there is no remedy; there is no restriction on what they may or may not broadcast provided they can satisfy the court&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not certain of that.  All I want to put to the Minister is this: We have the power under subsection (1) to do anything appropriate to a national broadcasting service. Rightly, I think, under subsection (2) of section 16 of the original Act we give the Authority wide powers to deal with foreign broadcasting authorities. Here in section 5, paragraphs (1) and (m), not unreasonably, we spell out further matters&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in relation to which they can deal with foreign authorities.  I am prepared to agree with all of that, but then I ask: Why do we want paragraph (n)?  I want to engage the attention of the few Deputies who bothered to attend the proceedings of the House: <Col N="696" /> I believe that in the day and generation in which we are living one of the powers that is most under-estimated is that of television.  I believe it is one of the most terrible powers that was ever put in the hand of man.  People often smile at me when I say that as between the atomic bomb and television I regard the atomic bomb as something of relative insignificance. The most the atomic bomb can do is to destroy your carcase; television can destroy your soul and corrupt your mind.  This power and this influence going into the living-room and kitchen of every human being in this country and being displayed in every public house and every place of popular congregation is utterly terrifying.  Therefore, we here in Dáil Éireann ought to be constantly vigilant to see that it is properly controlled, that nothing irresponsible is done, and that if anything irresponsible is done, the humblest citizen in the country can go to the courts and invoke the protection of the courts against malpractice.  I do not believe Deputies want individual Ministers of State to have the right to bespeak from the Television Authority such services as they may command with the consent of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  When we were passing the principal Act we were very careful to lay down&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, you did not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>What we laid down, as far as I can read the measure&mdash;and I would go into court to defend it&mdash;is that the independent Authority have certain duties and one of those duties is to provide a national service.  I would be prepared to contend that if an individual Minister bespeaks a special service, even with the consent of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, that does not come within the competence of the Authority if it does not partake of the character of a national service.  The Minister can be put on his proof that he was providing a national service. For instance, suppose a Minister for Agriculture gets some daft idea in his head and invokes the Authority to conduct propaganda for it, and prevails on the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs <Col N="697" /> that this is a very specialised thing and that he wants to carry it on, I can go into court in the morning and say: &ldquo;This is not a national service.  This is a daft idea this man has got into his head in which he alone believes but in which the vast majority of the people do not believe.  It is ludicrous.  It is not a national service.&rdquo;  If paragraph (n) is inserted, the Authority are entitled to go into court and say: &ldquo;Do not draw us into this quarrel.  We quote paragraph (n) as our justification,&rdquo; and that is that.  One can imagine such a situation arising if the Minister for Health, any Minister for Health or any other Minister of State got a bee in his bonnet&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If paragraph (n) is included, the Television Authority need only come into court and say: &ldquo;We provided that service in pursuance of paragraph (n) of the Broadcasting Authority (Amendment) Bill, 1965, and that is our responsibility.  No injunction can lie against us.  We have specific authority to broadcast this because we are doing it for a Minister of State with the consent of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs&rdquo;.  I think you are imprudently widening a section which is already wide enough. I do not quarrel with you about paragraphs (l) and (m) but I urge on the Minister strongly to delete paragraph (n).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a matter of elucidating and specifying rather than widening.  As I have already pointed out, we are not in conflict here at all.  Section 16 (1) does already give certain broad powers to the Authority to enable them to carry out specific duties for the Department of Education. They are not quite happy since other specific duties are spelled out more clearly in the paragraph to the subsection and they think that a further specific paragraph relating to these specific duties would clarify the position under that broad section 16.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy sat in on this Act when it was going through this House and I remember the discussion.  Many Deputies on that side accused the <Col N="698" /> Government of handing over powers, and CIE and other State bodies were quoted as examples where a Minister would have to stand up and say: &ldquo;I have no responsibility&rdquo;.  It was said that we were delegating too much power.  An effort was made to strike a balance between delegating power completely and the retention by the Minister of certain rights.  This balance was achieved in the Act.  Nobody can say that any Minister has abused these powers.</P>
    <P>I will read the section specifically relating to the powers of the Minister, section 31 (1):</P>
    <P>The Minister may direct the Authority in writing to refrain from broadcasting any particular matter or matter of any particular class, and the Authority shall comply with the direction.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) states:</P>
    <P>The Minister may direct the Authority in writing to allocate broadcasting time for any announcements by or on behalf of any Minister of State in connection with the functions of that Minister of State, and the Authority shall comply with the direction.</P>
    <P>These powers are necessary.  It does not mean that some Minister will go mad and ask the Authority to do something outlandish.  I cannot understand the fears which Deputy Dillon expresses about agency work which it is already doing outside of normal broadcasting time.  The Authority feel, and I think rightly, that while the provisions of section 16 are very wide, they lack specific provisions with regard to that particular work.  This is purely and simply the purpose of the section.  I can assure the Deputy of that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has clinched and reinforced the argument I have been pressing upon him.  In the original Act, the Minister &ldquo;may direct the Authority in writing to allocate broadcasting time for any announcements by or on behalf of any Minister of State&rdquo; and now read the qualifying words &ldquo;in connection with the functions <Col N="699" /> of that Minister of State.&rdquo;  Show me those words in paragraph (n).</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

When we come to the television service itself, Deputy Dillon has stressed that in this country, as in other countries, there is a great need for vigilance to ensure that the national television service will be used as a means of education and entertainment. At times we are not satisfied with some of the things we see on Telefís Éireann. Most Deputies do not get much time to watch it.  Generally speaking, they are doing an excellent job and their technical performance is improving, but there is a small section there who seem to set out to make prudes like myself sit up.

      <P>This is not a matter of controversy but what does the Minister think is expected from the change from private auditors to the Comptroller and Auditor General?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it may make for a little bit of extra control. Although in the previous Act it was a duly qualified auditor, in actual fact it was the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Seeing the amount of State investment there is in the Authority, it was decided that it should be stated specifically that the auditor should be the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not argue about it but I have had a great deal to do with these matters on the Committee of Public Accounts and the present Minister was a colleague of mine on that Committee.  He will remember that we differentiated very specifically between the suitability of the Comptroller and Auditor General for Government accounting, for which he is peculiarly equipped, and commercial accounting for which he is not peculiarly equipped.  His staff is largely trained in the tradition and form of Government accounting.  My recollection is that when we were passing the original Television Act, there was present to our minds the fact that <Col N="703" /> these people would be dealing with commercial firms in regard to advertising revenue and rentals of television material and would be conducting a large commercial business similar to the business carried on by the large commercial broadcasting companies of Britain and the United States as against the most rigid procedures of the BBC which is an exclusively Government service and has no dealing with advertising agents and other such interests.</P>
      <P>For that reason we thought it would be desirable to make it possible for a commercial firm of auditors to audit the accounts of the Television Authority. The Minister says that in practice the matter is in the care of the Comptroller and Auditor General but the Minister must remember the problems we faced in the Committee of Public Accounts where we sometimes felt that the procedures of the Comptroller and Auditor General were too rigidly adapted to Government accounting. Does the Minister remember the occasion when we were dealing with the accounts of Gaeltarra Éireann? Stocks had been accumulated for such a long time that a firm of commercial auditors would have been frightened to death but the Comptroller and Auditor General was satisfied that as long as the stocks that should be there were there, everything was all right. Suddenly he discovered that we had a vast accumulation of unsaleable stock which had to be got rid of by drastic measures.  That was due to the fact that the officers of the Comptroller and Auditor General were uniquely equipped to deal with Government accounts but were less familiar with the practices of commercial undertakings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mention this to the Minister so that he may consider whether he thinks it expedient that he should tie himself to the Comptroller and Auditor General.  I think he should leave it so that it can either be the Comptroller and Auditor General or so that, if he thinks it desirable, he can put in a firm of commercial auditors.  Why does he want to tie <Col N="704" /> himself down to the Comptroller and Auditor General?  I would prefer the decision to be left open and allow the Minister to come here to the Dáil and say that he is calling in a firm of commercial auditors because he is satisfied that the commercial accounts of the Television Authority would be best examined by commercial auditors.</P>

      <P>The Minister, in his opening statement, stressed that in view of the heavy existing and potential State investment in the Authority, he thought it better that the Comptroller and Auditor General should report on the accounts of the Authority rather than a commercial firm.  Personally, I would agree with that point of view.  There is so much State money invested in the Authority that it would be better to have the Comptroller and Auditor General doing the work.</P>

      <P>The Comptroller and Auditor General has comparatively little experience of commercial accounting.  The whole approach of his office is the approach of auditors trained to deal with Government finance.  If there could be two things covered by the one name and still completely different, they are commercial accounting and Government accounting.  They are as different as chalk from cheese.  Surely we can rely on a responsible body of commercial auditors to do this work?  Surely we are not to take it that the only person on whose report we can rely is the Comptroller and Auditor General? We all employ firms of auditors in our offices and without them we would be bankrupt.  The Minister would be better advised to leave a measure of flexibility in the matter.  I do not know why he wants to tie himself down to the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>

I remember being asked by the present President, when Taoiseach, for my advice as to whether he should put a man in as Comptroller and Auditor General who was trained in a commercial auditor's office or trained in the Comptroller and Auditor General's office or in the Department of Finance.  My advice to him most emphatically, as the then Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, was: &ldquo;You must put in a man trained either in the Comptroller and Auditor General's office or the Department of Finance.  A commercial auditor could not audit Government accounts.  He is not trained for it.&rdquo; That view has prevailed from that day to this, perfectly right, in my opinion. But the very fact that the head of the Department is himself pre-eminently, not exclusively, an auditor of Government accounts, I think renders him less effective as an auditor of commercial enterprises than the head of a commercial firm would be.</P>

      <P>This is really a correction.  The Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1956, amended section 5 of the Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1926, by inserting a subsection (1A) after subsection (1) of section 5.  This subsection provided that a vehicle which contained wireless telegraphy equipment required to be licensed separately even though the owner had a receiving licence for other premises, e.g. his home.  A further subsection incorrectly numbered (1A) was inserted after subsection <Col N="706" /> (1) of section 5 of the 1926 Act by section 34 of the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960.  This subsection provided that the Minister may by order authorise the Authority to collect licence fees and grant licences, etc. Section 7 (l) proposes to correct this position and put it in its proper place.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.  It gives me a chance to renew an appeal made yesterday by Deputy Dockrell or somebody else to the Minister to reconsider one aspect of this matter of granting licences.  These corrections relate to a section of the old 1926 Act in regard to the issuing of licences for wireless sets.  In those days every wireless set you had had to have a licence.  That principle was carried over to the days when transistors came in and it was decided if you had one licence for a set attached to the mains, it would cover any transistors the children had or the woman of the house carried about with her going about her daily job.  But it was determined that if you had a wireless in the car, you had to get an additional licence.  The next stage was that television came in.  We provided you had to take out a £5 licence and that covered television and all the wireless sets in your house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now we are in this extraordinary position.  If I have a transistor wireless set and I carry it down in my fist to Sandymount strand, I am covered, but if I get the transistor wireless set and put two screws, one on each side of it, and screw it into the dashboard of my car, I am not covered.  I have to have a second licence.  Surely the administrative annoyance involved in making those kinds of distinctions more than outweighs any additional revenue the Minister gets from the licensing of radios in cars?  I put it to him he ought to consider suggesting to the Minister for Finance that it would simplify administration, would avoid a good deal of personal irritation, if a <Col N="707" /> person who held a £5 comprehensive licence was deemed to be a person who had a television set in his house and who could go out festooned with wireless sets if he wanted to, provided he had the pink £5 licence.  That is the kind of commonsensical thing that will be done sooner or later.  The sooner it is done, the less trouble there will be about it.  I urge on the Minister to consider that matter of having one comprehensive licence to cover the whole thing and drop this business about separate licences for radios in cars.</P>

      <P>Sound radio licences are diminishing as television takes over.  We are in the course of providing a better sound radio service, costing £160,000, and one would expect increased revenue from licences rather than reducing them.  If we were to say that radios in cars were covered by the licence attaching to the house, it could possibly lead to a good deal of <Col N="708" /> difficulty.  We were discussing the other day the changing of cars from one person to another.  It is much easier to keep &ldquo;tabs&rdquo; on the sets fixed to the cars and require a separate licence for them rather than allow a whole conglomeration of licences to be attached to the licence for the set in the house. If at some stage I was thinking of increasing the licence by another £1, I might allow car licences in.</P>

It is perfectly true that, when we were depending on valve sets attached to the mains, sound radio was practically a thing of the past; but sound radio has come back as a valuable asset in every household in this country.  A housewife who can now carry around her portable radio with her and have a bit of music and light entertainment while dusting and cleaning from room to room has an inestimable boon.  Lots of people forget that and imagine that television is the only thing that counts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin):</i> When the Dáil adjourned on Thursday evening last, I was speaking about the present condition of our labour relations. I mentioned that we must set about creating a peaceful environment between management and labour.  It is useless for us to formulate any policy or to sign any agreement unless first we establish proper labour relations. The unpleasant conditions that have prevailed in the past 12 months and which are continuing into 1966 are seriously damaging our economy.  We must be careful lest we should project a wrong image of ourselves abroad because if foreign importers of our goods take the view that we cannot be relied upon, it could place our future economy in a very dangerous position. How best to rectify this unhappy situation is quite a problem.</P>
      <P>I believe that the Labour Court could play a bigger part in labour-management relations&mdash;not but that, at present, it is doing an excellent job. Many disputes have been brought to a successful conclusion by the Labour Court but my conception of that Court would be that it should operate on a broader scale.  If we could enlarge its scope and make it more accessible, it would be a good thing for the nation. At the moment, the Labour Court is accessible only when all other means of negotiation have broken down.  If there were a larger personnel in the Labour Court so that small disputes could be rectified before they reach the last stage, it might solve a lot of problems because advice could be sought at an early stage from the Labour Court.  It is desirable that we should avoid friction between labour and employer and early contact with the Labour Court might bring about very satisfactory results.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="710" /> The NIEC recommend the introduc tion of an incomes policy.  This is very desirable.  I can see many difficulties from time to time in regard to the apportionment of wealth in various professions, in the services, and so on. There are basic principles and equities which have always existed and which must be maintained in the future.  We must always recognise a man of initiative, drive and integrity. We must never try to equate him with the unambitious and the lazy.  We must reward him for his efforts.  If we should in any way hinder the man who is ambitious, then private enterprise will stagnate.</P>
    <P>There has been much criticism of the Government in this and in other debates on the economic situation. Personally, I cannot see any justification for that criticism.  Undoubtedly we have difficulties but that is true in every walk of life and in every country. We have a balance of payments difficulty but we are not the only country to run up against that problem.  We should try to solve it in a businesslike manner.</P>
    <P>Our present and past economy reminds me of an autobahn.  We have been moving along quite smoothly for the past eight or nine years.  Every section of our economy has been expanding. Our industrialists have set new records.  Our agricultural sector also has expanded to a considerable extent.  We have now reached a danger point.  The danger signals have been set and we are told to take heed.  Who set the danger signals?  The Government have done so for guidance.  They have pointed out the steps we must take if we are to come through this passage smoothly.  They themselves have taken certain actions to ensure the safety of our economy.</P>
    <P>Last July, the Taoiseach took certain measures to help us along the way. At that time, there was restriction of capital expenditure.  There has also been restriction of credit by the banks to projects of a productive nature. Those of us who are engaged in business realise that credit is given today only where it will produce results valuable to the economy.  Then there was encouragement for saving. <Col N="711" /> Import levies were imposed to restrict the importation of certain goods.  Price control was introduced.  All these steps were taken because the Government considered them necessary for the wellbeing of our economy.</P>
    <P>With co-operation and team spirit, we will get through this difficult situation. There is no good in moaning and grumbling.  I heard during the course of this debate such words as &ldquo;broke&rdquo;, &ldquo;bust&rdquo; and so on from Deputies of various Parties.  That is a defeatist attitude.  A businessman who encounters difficulties must renew his determination.  Moaning as to the decline of his business will not improve his situation.  There is a much better chance of surviving difficulties if one develops determination and confidence. I deplore the pessimism that some Deputies have been spreading amongst the public.</P>
    <P>If the Government were to ignore the facts of the present situation, that would lead only to economic disaster and unemployment.  I hope that in the interests of the nation, and of employers and employees, we will all make the necessary temporary sacrifices and follow the example set by the Government in cutting down public expenditure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I was speaking to a man the other day about the matter now under discussion in the House. He said to me: &ldquo;How simple life would be if people consisted of a mass of computerised digits such as are envisaged by economists.  How simple it would be to arrange things to the liking of economists and at the same time how utterly and intolerably horrible it would be&rdquo;.  He was having these thoughts in relation to the dock strike, amongst other things.  He said: &ldquo;It seems to me that people are just as human as politicians are and just as liable to make mistakes and to do selfish things and to want to live as well as the next man&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have heard a great deal in the last week about wages and the duty of trade unions.  It would appear from the pictures painted by the Taoiseach and by some of his <i>aides</i> that the <Col N="712" /> organised trade union movement is engaged in a Marxist conspiracy to destroy society.  One would be led along that line of thought, if one were foolish enough to fall for the propaganda which has been poured out, from Government benches principally, since this debate on the NIEC Report was initiated.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach and those who surround him have tried to create the impression that the workers are the cause of our present economic disquiet. The Taoiseach did not advert to the circumstances of life, which are, that we live in a rapacious world, in a world in which the workers do not set the pace of grab-all which is the order of our society.</P>
    <P>It is very easy to give &ldquo;holier than thou&rdquo; lectures here about what workers outside this House should do. I can give Deputy Fitzpatrick one example of a man whom I met last Sunday, who is earning £11 a week, who is living in Deputy Fitzpatrick's constituency.  That man has five children, none of whom is working.  He is paying 27/6 a week rent to the corporation, which leaves him something over £9 with which to clothe, feed, and otherwise provide for, himself, his wife and his five children.</P>
    <P>It must be infuriating to such a man to be told that the most he can look for by way of an increase in wages in the time that lies ahead is three per cent, which would amount to 6/7, less, of course, the cost of the stamp.  What use would it be to him if I were to say to him next Sunday, after having interceded with the corporation in order to try to prevent his being thrown out on the street because of the fact that he is in arrears with his rent, that he should read the NIEC Report, wherein he will see why he should contain himself? What would he say to me?  I suspect that he might use language such as was described in the House a short time ago as language used by the British Army of Occupation here which, of course, was totally unknown to our own heroes.  He might very well use such language to me or to anybody else who would offer that kind of solution to him, and I would not blame him.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="713" /> When we talk about wages, production, and so on, let us talk about the facts of life.  Let us remember that people are human, that no matter how the computer may arrange them or how the economist may deploy columns of figures, people are flesh and blood. A man may have to strain himself in a job, perhaps work overtime, in order to get barely enough to keep him out of the courts.  Mark you, a hard job it is to keep out of the district court for debt, a very difficult operation for the man who is straining himself to achieve that, very often denying himself the ordinary, simple pleasures of life in order to keep his home intact and himself and his family off the side of the road, when he is adjured to restrain his normal inclination to look for more and when he looks around him and sees the inexorable rule of capitalist life&mdash; the less work you do the more money you get for it and the harder you work the less you get for it.  The people who engage in what appears to be the most frivolous, unnecessary, unproductive and parasitic activities in the country live in luxury, and you never find them a hundred miles from a lounge bar, and many of them carry on all their business activities in these places.  I know; I used to be in public bars and I saw them.  And yet these working people are lectured to by, amongst others, junior and senior chambers of commerce, consisting in the main of middle-class, lately sprung up young business men, with their institutes for this, that and the other, conferring degrees upon one another for being able to tie parcels.  You can get a degree now for tying parcels.  These have the impertinence, and it is nothing less, to lecture, with all the pomposity of which they are capable, the working people of this country as to production, as to what is demanded of them in the present situation.</P>

      <P>The fundamental labour position remains where it has been, where it has stood down through the years.  We want a fair distribution of the existing wealth of the country.  We are far from having achieved that in spite of the historic struggles of the trade union movement and the continued efforts of the Labour Party inside and outside Dáil Éireann.  Our activities have been a process of inching towards the economic exaltation of the community and the redistribution of wealth amongst those without whose efforts and whose toil not alone would there not be greater production but there would be no wealth to distribute at all.  This is the fundamental difference between the Labour Party and other Parties in this House.</P>

    <P>The discussion which has gone on here has been concentrated in the main in critical fashion upon the trade union movement, upon wages, upon the need to contain wages and upon what is to be done with whatever wealth is earned in the future.  The Labour Party say that, before we talk about that, we want a just distribution of the wealth that is there now, before there is any three per cent.  It was of course natural, I suppose, that the major Parties should more or less go along the same lines in this matter. As time goes on, it seems to be inevitable that they will draw closer together.  From the point of view of philosophy, little or nothing separates them in the political sense.  All that ever separated the major Parties in the past were the personal differences which arose from the unhappy conflict of 40 years ago.  As time goes on, and the sharpnesses of that period disappear, it must inevitably ensue that the Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael Parties, or elements thereof, will come together in a natural alignment of forces in which those who represent privilege and vested interests, as quite obviously Deputy Fitzpatrick <i>(Dublin)</i> is proud to do, and as quite obviously Deputy Fitzpatrick insists upon maintaining&mdash; he said that the things we have known <Col N="715" /> for so long cannot and should not be changed&mdash;will be grouped together in one Party and the other side of the House will be representative of those who work, whether by hand or by brain, and of those who are interested in creating a society which will come somewhat nearer to what was talked about by those who preached the elements of Christianity in deed.</P>
    <P>I do not like to appear presumptuous, and perhaps I should not refer to it, but I feel such a society will be nearer to the desire of the Creator Himself because there will be more justice.  There is none now.  Social justice is not to be found outside expressions of opinion.  Social justice in practice, especially for those in most need of it, is just not there.  That is the kind of society we have; you get out of it what you can take from it, because of the manner in which it is governed, and the extent of your welfare depends upon the extent of your organisation and what you can compel others to pay you for your goods or for your labour.  That is wrong.  It is materialistic.  It is unfortunate, but it is the truth.</P>
    <P>The Government put down a motion concerning this NIEC Report and the principal matter discussed in this Report is the question of an incomes policy.  I have listened to most of the debate and I have yet to hear the Taoiseach or any Minister of the Government referring to this question of what will be done about an incomes policy.  This debate has been used by the Taoiseach and Government spokesmen simply to attack the trade unions. There has been no reference at all to the considerations and arguments set out in this document by the Council as to the need for an incomes policy. Paragraph 13 in page 7, reads:</P>
    <P>An incomes policy that does not embrace all categories of money incomes, namely, wages and salaries, farmers' incomes, professional earnings, rents, profits and realised capital gains, is repudiated as inadequate and inequitable.</P>
    <P>That, which is the nub of this whole Report, was not referred to by any <Col N="716" /> Government speaker.  I do not know if it was referred to by Deputy Cosgrave&mdash;I did not have the opportunity of listening to him&mdash;but it is quite obvious to me that the Government have sidestepped the full import of what has been said in these pages.</P>
    <P>An incomes policy must apply to all sections of the community.  I have not heard anybody here suggest how farmers' incomes should be fixed or at what level they should be fixed; nor have I heard it suggested, so far as reimbursement of the farmers is concerned, what percentage should apply to them.  The Government are very tender on the matter of farmers.  Some time ago a commission was set up to examine the structure and incidence of income tax.  That commission recommended that farmers should pay income tax the same as the fellow about whom I was talking, whom I met last Sunday and will meet next Sunday, is required to pay income tax if he works sufficient hours' overtime to earn it, the same as a labourer or a clerk or a bus conductor or driver or anybody else living in a city or town whose earnings are traceable is required to pay income tax.</P>
    <P>It was suggested by this commission some years ago that farmers should be required to pay income tax.  The evening before the commission's report was released to the press, the then Minister for Finance, the predecessor of the present Minister, at a dinner&mdash;which is the usual place for Fianna Fáil to unveil their policy&mdash;hastened to assure the farmers that there would be no such thing&mdash;even before the report was out at all, so the public knew this was in the report of the Commission on Taxation.  The then Minister for Finance assured the farmers that such a thing would not happen to them: income tax was all right for workers and people like that but not for farmers, the reason being the political fact that if Fianna Fáil antagonised sufficient farmers, their position in Dáil Éireann was liable to change from there to here very quickly.  Of course, the question of justice does not come into it at all.  That is a superfluity where the Fianna Fáil Party are concerned.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="717" /> The policy of any Government interested in fair play for all should be to try to ensure that all section of the population are treated equally. Recently on television in connection with the celebration of 1916, when a number of people were asked what did they think of the progress which had been made towards the ideals of the men of 1916, somebody said very truly that the Proclamation called for the cherishing of all the children of the nation equally.  &ldquo;Children&rdquo; in that context does not merely mean juveniles; it means all the people of the nation.  It does not seem to me that the Government are cherishing all the people of the nation equally.  In fact there are favoured sections and amongst them I have no hesitation in including the farmers.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry cried salt tears for the farmers here the other night.  We are not unused to that.  If some method could be found of collecting all Deputy Corry's tears, there would be enough table salt for many years to come at any substantial dinner table.  He is very sorry for the farmers and the farm labourers, the men who get only £8 a week.  Deputy Corry puts the responsibility on the Government for the fact that farmers are not getting more for this, that and the other.  He never suggests that, as farmers are the employers of farm labourers, they might pay their farm labourers more. He tells us the farmer is poverty-stricken and in a desperate economic plight.  At the same time, he tells us the other evening of the great success attendant upon his efforts in his constituency for his neighbours or the people within his area whom he encouraged to grow peas which produced £60 an acre net profit after payment of wages.  Very often these farm labourers to whom I referred are the farmers' sons and very often they do not get even the minimum laid down by law.  However, that is a family matter and something for themselves to look after.</P>
    <P>In the course of this debate, the Government have taken up a very firm position, the position of the employers. They have adopted completely the role of defending the employers against <Col N="718" /> the unions.  There are members of this House who could reasonably be expected to voice the arguments in favour of the employers in the present economic situation.  One does not have to mention names but they are there. It was not given to them to speak on behalf of the people in whom they could be deemed to have a special interest.  The Government themselves have assumed the prerogative; they have spoken for the employers against the unions, and called for a display of responsibility.  This is one of those platitudes which the Taoiseach likes to trot out, and other people, too, including the pompous little junior chambers of commerce throughout the country, beardless youths pretending to know all there is to know, pontificating upon the obligations of workers, about the need to be responsible.</P>
    <P>The first responsibility of the worker is to provide for his wife and family and it is something which every effort of the Government is directed towards undermining, perhaps unconsciously. Surely after so many years of the exercise of our freedom in the Twenty-Six Counties, it has to be accepted that the trade union movement is a very important part of the social set-up and that the leaders of the trade union movement do not go lightly about their business.  They are not people who can be easily induced to take steps which may have a detrimental effect upon the economic fabric.  Any reasonable person would accept that that is so.</P>
    <P>While mentioning that, I want to make a passing reference to a misconception which exists in the minds of those who do not know what they are talking about, a misconception about trade union leadership.  You find this misconception and ignorance lurking very often under the anonymity of editorials and you find trade union leaders as a class being criticised.  In some cases they are belittled for their lack of ability to lead.  I can speak about this because I am not concerned with trade unions at present but I know a little about them and I know a good deal about the people who have the responsibility of leading trade unions. A trade union leader in any union has <Col N="719" /> one of the hardest jobs given to man and one of the most thankless jobs.  He will not be an effective trade union leader unless he is an idealist and believes he can improve the conditions of his members by doing his job well. He will not be anything like adequately paid because nothing would pay him for what he will have to endure.  We find that he is very often in the position of having to listen to free advice and sometimes to abuse from people who do not now the first thing about what is required in the matter of the organisation of workers or the leadership of unions.</P>
    <P>I have seen, in moments of grave industrial crisis, attacks being made from the anonymity and shelter of editorial columns upon men trying to do the best job they could.  I have seen trade union leaders being derided for what was claimed as the loss of control over their members.  What is the position of a trade union leader?  He is working for his members and they are his first responsibility.  They are the people who pay him and they expect him to discharge his duties as well as he can.  I have seen criticisms of trade union officials to the effect that they lead from behind.  Any person who makes that observation in regard to leadership in any sphere of human activity is a fool because all good leadership has quite a considerable amount of the ingredient of leadership from behind in it, whether it is political leadership or trade union leadership. The alternative to a certain amount of that kind of leadership is to get so far ahead of the crowd that you lose touch completely and they let you go on your own and you find that you are very lonesome.</P>
    <P>Something needs to be said in defence of trade union leaders because they have been accused of all kinds of things.  The most reprehensible is criticism from outside the House, sometimes it is inside, by people who know nothing at all about what the job consists of or what the problems are. The criticism is expressed by people who would not last five minutes in front of any reasonably-sized meeting <Col N="720" /> of workers in any industry because in the first instance they would not know the language.  This talk about the threat there will be to the economy if workers seek more than three per cent this year is guesswork because, mark you, a lot of the material in this very excellent Report is guesswork, perhaps inspired guesswork, and the three per cent is at best an inspired guess.  The discussion has centred around the awfulness of the possibilities that may follow from exceeding this three per cent.  This kind of build-up such as we have seen since this matter has been discussed runs along classic lines in a way.</P>
    <P>The other night I was reading about the techniques of politics and it is not dissimilar in most countries which have a system such as ours which could be said to be relatively democratic and where the Government are elected by the votes of the people. When a Government are in danger, it is essential to find a menace.  This Government have come through a period of increased prices when, I would say, it is fair to judge that their popularity is not at its apogee.  I would say that if there were to be a decision by the electorate at present&mdash;I am not seeking it and please do not let anybody think that I am just now&mdash;if there were to be such a contest, it would be a fairly good bet that this Government would not be returned with their present support in Dáil Éireann.  Whether that would mean that there would be an alternative or not I could not foretell, but it is a fairly good bet that the Government would lose sufficient to reduce their position in the House.</P>
    <P>Of course, the Taoiseach being, we all acknowledge, an excellent politician, a professional of many years standing, one of the originals, and the person whom it is impossible at times not to admire because of his ambience, summoned into existence a menace in the 1930s, the menace being that the importation of British goods would destroy our native manufacturing industry, then about to burgeon.  Then came the war and there was the menace to our neutrality, the menace of invasion.  After the war we had a <Col N="721" /> Deputy, still happily a Deputy, but one whose activity has become less obvious on those benches, who when he was a Minister was an expert at resuscitating another kind of menace known as the Red Menace.  Deputy MacEntee could always be relied upon, on the immediate sound of the approach of a general election, to exhume as many Reds as were necessary. He used to have his agents go through the files of yellowing newspapers to discover what might well have been the indiscretions of another century in so far as many of his political opponents were concerned.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that an interesting period for historians of the future would be the newspaper files leading up to the by-elections of 1947 which was the first time of the departure, temporarily unfortunately, of the Fianna Fáil Party from office.  The tracing by Deputy MacEntee of the lives and connections of members of the Clann na Poblachta Party and, indeed, of members of other Parties at that time is vitally interesting.  You would never think that these were the same people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be, but it bears on the point I am making that there is a great deal of talk of the imminence of economic disaster: we are not broke&mdash;that is stupid talk&mdash; but we are heading for economic disaster if the workers look for more. This is the menace I am talking about. The practice is that when in doubt, one should look for a menace and the menace today is the trade unions looking for more money.  There are 100,000 workers in this country getting less than £10 a week.  I do not know how many of them are getting married but a fair proportion would be so that you might say that from 200,000 to 300,000 people are living at that level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is it seriously suggested by the Minister that such people will be content or can be expected to be content with an increase of 6/5d or 6/7d a week when they know very well that prices <Col N="722" /> have been allowed to skyrocket, particularly in the period before the Government invoked the provisions of the Prices Act, not that the making of the regulations under that Act has caused any great stir in the country? There was one example which was brought before the Minister's Department as a case of profiteering.  It seemed to me to be a gross case of profiteering but the reduction effected was so minimal that it might as well have been left alone.</P>
    <P>However, the menace is the thing. We are asked to consider the menace of economic disaster.  As one political writer said in regard to a situation of this kind in another country and the plight of a Government faced with a difficult situation because of its own inadequacy:</P>
    <P>First there needs must be a menace.  Then there must be such a tremendous menace that the nation is convinced that it stands at the brink of disaster, shuddering and trembling.</P>
    <P>That statement might very well be applied to statements made by members of the Government as a yardstick of their truth.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting that we do not need greater production in this country but I am suggesting that there is enough wealth here at the moment if social justice is to prevail, enough wealth to improve very considerably the condition of the most needy sections of our people.  These are, in order of priority, the old people depending on old age pensions, the unemployed and the sick, and the workers, farm labourers, roadworkers or workers throughout our towns and cities earning less than £10 a week.  There is a need for something to be done for these people.  Do the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and the Government seriously consider that this country is so poor that we propose to permit the wages of such people to be increased by a miserable 6/- or 7/-a week with prices what they are today?</P>
    <P>We turn now to the subject to which this Report devotes considerable thought and space, the question of <Col N="723" /> an incomes policy, to which no Government speaker made any effort to advert.  The motion before the House asks us to confirm our acceptance of the NIEC Report and generally the principles contained therein.  We agree with that.  We agree with the idea that there should be an incomes policy but I want to ask the Minister how it is proposed to determine the incomes of farmers.  Is it thought that if you ask them they will tell you?  That is hardly likely.</P>
    <P>There was a rush on the banks to take out deposits when it was announced a year or two ago that certain investigations would be carried out in relation to deposits which might be drawing £15 a year or more in interest.  How are we to find out what are the farmers' incomes?  How are these incomes to be determined? Deputy Corry will tell you that the farmers are in a desperately bad way. I feel they are not in such a bad way at all.  By and large, the land-owning farmers in this country are far and away better off than the workers in manufacturing industry, the average workers, and not the exceptions who may earn reasonably big money.</P>
    <P>How are the incomes of the professional men such as lawyers to be determined?  In what parts of the world has an incomes policy succeeded? I do not know any.  Talking about an incomes policy is very much like talking about an immediately unattainable ideal.  Talking about it here in the House, as Government speakers have done, shows an apparent desire on the part of the Government to bring about social justice so that everybody will get a fair deal. But really, as it is based, it is an effort to pin the responsibility for the Government's own laxity and faults upon the trade union movement.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt we have had inflation here and it is continuing. Who is responsible for that in truth? Who is responsible for encouraging wage demands which meant nothing because they were nullified by prices? Can anybody deny that that was an obvious political ploy used on the eve <Col N="724" /> of two by-elections the year before last?  It worked.  It won two by-elections which might have been lost. But it did a tremendous lot of harm. The Taoiseach said at the time that the economy was all right and the workers should go ahead for more.  If the Taoiseach had taken steps then to control prices, things would not be as they are now and workers' wages would be buying effectively far more than they are able to buy now.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach sought by a little bit of economic jugglery to let things balance out.  What happened?  Whatever increase was secured by the workers then was completely negatived by the development of the prices spiral as time went on.  In the end, the workers are worse off than they were at the beginning.  The Government are responsible for that situation.  They are trying to shuffle it off by continuing to refer to the need to maintain wages within the three per cent indicated by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce spoke about the impossibility of regulating wages by legislation.  That is unquestionably a fact.  Neither in this nor in any other country can you, I think, impose wage rates by legislation or by compulsion upon the workers. We saw what happened here four or five years ago when the Taoiseach in a moment of aberration, sought to compel the ESB workers on strike to return to work by the introduction of a Bill which contained penal clauses making refusal to work in certain circumstances punishable by imprisonment. It had a very short life.  I do not know if it went through the Dáil. Certainly, it revolted the workers of Dublin and they responded in a characteristic way.  The ESB workers, who might not normally have got public sympathy, not alone got massive public sympathy, but huge financial support voluntarily given by the people of this city.  That is the kind of people we are.  We are not for compulsion.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce was right in what he said about this.  He was referring to his own difficulties. I know he is surrounded by them.  This very specialist field of industrial <Col N="725" /> relations requires a lot of experience and a cool head.  His job is not by any means an enviable one.  He stated the facts.  Certainly in this country you cannot force people to work if they do not want to work, and that is apart altogether from the fact that it is an abrogation of human liberty.  A man has a right to work if he wishes and not to work if he does not wish to.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach was not so timorous. In the course of his remarks, he conveyed to me at any rate that, if he was not satisfied with the progress of the present economic situation, he was toying in his mind&mdash;he did not state it explicitly but it emerged clearly from what he said&mdash;with the idea either of compulsion or of compulsion by taxation. If he could not secure the fastening down of wages by exhortation, he would turn either to the introduction of legislation to secure that end or, if the workers insisted upon increased wages and succeeded in getting them, he would secure the nullification of such increases to some extent by taxation. This is what I took from his speech.  We will see what falls out as time goes on.  I would hesitate to think he has not learned a lesson about compulsion. He surely must have done so. It was a wonder to me that a man with his background in this city, knowing the people of Dublin, ever tried that caper at all.  But we know the result there.</P>
    <P>It is not unlikely that taxation will be brought to bear very heavily on the working people in the near future.  We have already had intimations of taxation from the Minister for Finance.  He has made it clear we may expect additional taxation in the Budget of this year.  Taxation is inevitably inflationary in effect.  When people are taxed, they seek compensation in increased salaries and wages.  What greater act of an inflationary nature was there than the turnover tax when everything needed by every family in the country was taxed?  This was the greatest single incitement.  It was an absolute detonator of inflation and much of our economic problems at present stem from it.  How do we know but that this year the <Col N="726" /> turnover tax may be doubled?  If it is, we will be all in right trouble because it will worsen the present position very much.</P>
    <P>Recently, we were talking about a subject very much the same as this. The same matters arose in relation to the Anglo-Irish Trade Agreement. I made inquiry as to what had happened to the legendary First and Second Programmes for Economic Expansion. I wonder how many have read this Report from cover to cover.  It is a painful operation.  I am not given to reading such prose myself but I read this.  I think there are possibly two mentions of the so-called <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i> but there is definite mention of the fact that, between 1960 and 1965, employment in industry fell each year I think by seven per cent&mdash;and this was at the period of the introduction and operation of these wonderful revelations, the First and Second Programmes.  I suggested some time ago that not all the booklets in the world, containing all the figures in the world, would secure an increase of .001 per cent in the gross national product if the language used in them was of such a kind as to be completely and absolutely unintelligible not only to workers but even to the average man. Even with this Report, which is written by admirable people on both sides, there should be a glossary, at the very least, to tell the ordinary average person such as myself what some of the phrases mean.  I challenge any person in this House to tell me what &ldquo;gross domestic capital formation&rdquo;, for instance, means.  Very few persons would be able to do so: possibly if Deputy P. J. Burke were here, he might be able to do so, but I do not want to be unkind to him.</P>
    <P>The First and Second Programmes were a lot of wishful thinking, a pious expression of opinion.  They were really amalgams of cliché, platitude, tautology, guess-work, a few facts and an awful lot of bad English.  As seen now, they have no relevance at all to the economic facts of life as we know them and they have hardly been mentioned in these discussion.  Therefore, <Col N="727" /> let us have less talk about the so-called plans for economic expansion.</P>
    <P>I remember a time when, if one mentioned plans at all, if one mentioned a planned economy of any kind, Deputy MacEntee would be after one with a red hot poker.  You would be pinned down as an agent from Moscow and you would have very little chance of ever again achieving membership of this House by the time he would be finished with your character.  The world has gone plan-wise now, particularly Western Europe.  We have young men who want to be up there and with-it and we decided to produce these plans but they have no meaning whatever in so far as the economic facts of life in this country are concerned. I defy anybody to prove that the First or Second Programme for Economic Expansion has contributed in any real way to the improvement of the economic position of the country&mdash;in any real way.  Can anybody give me one example?</P>
    <P>There is an awful lot of pious talk about what should be done, about what might be done, about what the gross national product should be, about what everybody should strive for.  Can anybody give me one example, in that five-year period, of what those propaganda pamphlets have achieved for the country?  What they have done is to provide Fianna Fáil speakers on various occasions, particularly dinners, with something sounding important on which to hang their thoughts.</P>
    <P>On Sunday last, 30th January, 1966, I happened to read a piece in the <i>Sunday Times</i> concerning an economist. I think perhaps all of these materialistic young men in a hurry, and not-so-young men in a hurry, whom we have in the Fianna Fáil Party, on the Front Bench and elsewhere, might pay attention to it because it is an expression of opinion by a very eminent economist.  This is to be found on page 9 of the <i>Sunday Times</i> and was written by Professor Kenneth Galbraith who is regarded as one of the cleverest economists in the world. What puts him beyond criticism from our point of view is that he was United <Col N="728" /> States Ambassador to India and President Kennedy's economic adviser. He is now at Harvard as Professor of Economics.  He had this to say about economists:</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the politicians are still the victims of economists.  They must shake off their control&mdash;and I am talking as an economist.  I keep on having the same dream.  I imagine the day when the last automobile drives into London and comes to a halt in a solid mass of metal.  As the driver slowly suffocates to death of carbon monoxide poisoning, the last words he hears come over the radio from the BBC.  They announce the great news that last year the country's gross national product went up by five per cent.</P>
    <P>Although that is perhaps a lighthearted observation by this man, it does contain this much of a grain of relevance and truth for us, that is, that we are allowing ourselves, as politicians, or are in danger of allowing ourselves, as politicians, to become the creatures of men whose thoughts are most fitted to the drawing-board of politics rather than to the arena.  Economic theorists and such like people have their place in society but greater damage has been done, I think, by the attempted implementation of what were claimed to be perfect economic theories than by most other forms of human activity.</P>
    <P>What I am trying to say is that we should not give ourselves over entirely to the control of the professors.  We are members of the House and our duty is to reflect the feelings of the people we represent.  By and large, I think that if we let our normal instincts operate, we shall do that.  The members of the Fianna Fáil Party have been forced to sublimate their normal instincts in this connection.  I am sure that many of them would be in complete agreement with what I have to say, particularly in relation to the lowly-paid workers, but that they have had to sublimate their normal instincts. That is a very unhealthy process and will lead to all kinds of queer complexes later on.  Not that what I say will be acted upon but I suggest that they should make themselves felt in <Col N="729" /> their Party.  They should try to bring some commonsense to bear on the Taoiseach and those around him with regard to the plight of the workers, many of whom are facing grave difficulties. They cannot afford not to look for an increase and a more substantial one than three per cent.</P>
    <P>This Government have pretty successfully made a mess of conditions in this country.  As I have already observed, I can very well imagine what would be the case if this Government were on the other side of the House and there were another Government sitting where they are now.  They would make hay.  Certainly, the Taoiseach would make hay because the sun would be shining for him, and the national interest would not be cited.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>In view of the fact that a large number of military service pensioners, who played a large part in the foundation of the State, receive exceedingly small pensions which are quite inadequate to meet the present cost of living, and in view of the fact that with the passing of time these pensioners are both decreasing in numbers and advancing in age, Dáil Éireann is of opinion that the past services of these people should be more generously recognised and calls on the Government both to increase the pensions paid to them and, in particular, to ensure that when such pensioners receive any increase in social welfare payments their pensions are not reduced by a corresponding amount.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I rise to support this motion which calls for better treatment for military service pensioners.  There are a number of pensions covered by the motion.  In the first place, there are Army service pensions.  I understand that these pensions are very small.  The Minister said <Col N="730" /> that the vast majority of these pensions are less than £100 a year.  I think that is taking an over-favourable view from the point of view of the State.  The vast majority of these pensions are probably in the neighbourhood of £20 a year.</P>
      <P>The next category covered by the motion is disability pensions, that is, pensions payable in respect of a wound received or a disease contracted on active service.  These pensions are also fairly small.  As far as I know, they are not subject to a means test.</P>
      <P>The category of pension or allowance with which I want particularly to deal here this evening is the special allowance because the special allowance is an allowance made to a man who has a medal with bar, proving that he gave active service to his country when that service was badly needed.  It is an allowance to a man who is not able to support himself, who has not sufficient of this world's goods to keep body and soul together. This category of persons is being very badly treated.</P>
      <P>Irrespective of whether we have a shortage of money or a credit squeeze at the moment, I suggest to the Government and to the Minister that this is something that cannot be put off, because we are dealing with men who are growing old, who, according to the ordinary laws of nature, cannot hope to have very much further time to live.  If we are going to treat them properly, we will have to treat them properly now or not at all.</P>

    <P>I will give an example of the means test applied in the case of a special allowance to a man and his wife under 70 years of age.  If the income of that man and his wife amounts to £172 a year, he gets nothing.  He is deemed to be able, if not to live in comfort, to make ends meet on £172 a year because, if this special allowance means anything or is calculated to do anything it must be of such amount as to enable a man to make ends meet, to keep body and soul together, to provide him with food, housing, clothing and fuel.  We are saying here in so many words that £172 a year is sufficient to keep a man and his wife in frugal comfort.  I <Col N="731" /> cannot accept that and I do not think the Government accept it.</P>
    <P>We have at the present time in force here a workmen's compensation code, which we will be discussing later, under which a single man who is out of work is entitled to £4 10.0 per week but the Government accept now that that is not sufficient to keep that man and they propose, and rightly propose, in a Bill which is before the Oireachtas at the moment, to increase the allowance of that single man to £5 15.0 a week, and, indeed, under the present workmen's compensation code implemented by the Social Welfare Acts in force at the moment an injured workman who is married gets between £6 and £7 a week. Yet, in connection with the special allowance, we say that a married man and his wife are able to live on £172 a year.  We should be decent to these people now because, as I have said, it will be too late in the future.</P>
    <P>While one does not like to introduce unduly into this debate the fact that we are this year celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Rising of 1916, it would be a shame, I think, and quite out of order to forget about it.  In this golden anniversary year, we shall have many celebrations at county and provincial level.  We will have special medals struck.  I am in complete agreement with all that; it is fitting that we should mark the Golden Jubilee of 1916 in a fitting way and I cannot think of any better way, any more Christian and humane way, to mark that event than by doing the right and decent thing by those who fought in that period, who made this golden anniversary possible, and who are now in such a financial position that they cannot provide shelter for themselves, feed themselves and clothe themselves. By accepting this motion, we would mark this event in a fitting way.</P>
    <P>We should accept the motion and increase the figure for a married man to at least £6 per week.  Anyone who says that a married man can survive on less than £6 a week is not facing realities.  It may be said that these people have other incomes or benefits.  I give to this the interpretation <Col N="732" /> that will be given to it by the civil servants; it means the ceiling for a married couple.  If my reading of the regulations is correct, it seems rather strange that a single man is allowed £146 a year, whereas a married man is allowed only £172 per year.  It is difficult to understand that figure. It does not seem anything like adequate provision.  There is a difference of something in the region of £30 as between the two.  I do not propose to take up any more of the time allocated to this debate but I appeal to the Minister and to the Government, now that they have got timely notice before the Budget, to do the decent thing, the honourable and the noble thing, by these people, who served the country well in the past and who have now fallen on lean times.</P>

      <P>We put down this motion because our republican instinct told us in no uncertain manner how appalling has been the treatment meted out to those who made it possible for us to sit here this afternoon. Deputy Kyne and Deputy Tierney have already instanced many cases of hardship.  I should like to stress two points in particular: one is the screening the Minister is presently carrying out in connection with medals.  There is now a fresh investigation in certain cases to discover whether they were duly awarded or not.  That is causing great concern, particularly in the republican area from which I come. Secondly, it is a disgraceful state of affairs that a man in receipt of a meagre pittance in return for the services he gave to the country is not allowed any funeral grant or expenses. The least that could be done is to grant a certain sum towards funeral expenses.</P>

      <P>We will have another day.  I came prepared more or less to deal with conditions in the Army.  However, I appeal to the Minister to accept this motion.  This being the Golden Jubilee of the Rising, it is only right that some special grant or gratuity should be given in recognition of the services rendered by these men. Most of the recognitions in the past ten or 15 years were given on political grounds and as a result of political references.  Genuine cases were turned down.  There was a general handout of medals&mdash;in one case a person who was a child of six in 1916 was given a medal.  Now the Minister realises mistakes were made and some were unduly awarded.  People are being notified, particularly those who have applied for special allowances, that their cases are being investigated to discover whether or not the medals were duly awarded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a disgraceful way to treat people.  It is a miserable approach remembering <Col N="734" /> the services these men gave, the chances they took, and the dangers they faced.  All these things should be recognised in a fitting way.  Economies are being made, here, there and everywhere, we are told.  Even games in the Army are being discontinued on the ground of economy.  Be that as it may, the economic razor should not be used on these unfortunate men.  We on the Labour benches would appeal to the Minister to make a special review of the cases of those pensioners in order to bring their pensions into line with the cost of living.  The £1 they were receiving 20 or 30 years ago is hardly worth half-a-crown today.  We have tabled this motion in order to appeal on behalf of those who are not in a position to speak for themselves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EugeneGilbride" hpid="Mr. Gilbride Mr. Gilbride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilbride</NameTxt>
      <P>As one of the men involved, I would be very slow to believe that, in the year 1966, when we hear so much about celebrating the Golden Jubilee of Easter Week, anyone would attempt to play politics in connection with the Old IRA.  Let us examine this motion, which reads:</P>
      <P>In view of the fact that a large number of military service pensioners, who played a large part in the foundation of the State, receive exceedingly small pensions which are quite inadequate to meet the present cost of living, and in view of the fact that with the passing of time these pensioners are both decreasing in numbers and advancing in age, Dáil Éireann is of opinion that the past services of these people should be more generously recognised and calls on the Government both to increase the pensions paid to them and, in particular, to ensure that when such pensioners receive any increase in social welfare payments their pensions are not reduced by a corresponding amount.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everyone here knows that the date for applications for pensions had expired and expired a long time ago, until the present Government at some period reopened the matter and set a new date.  Deputy Coughlan said that politics entered into the obtaining of these medals.  Up until 1934 only one side of this House qualified for a pension. <Col N="735" /> Only those who belonged to the National Army got a pension.  It was only under the 1934 Bill that everyone who served in the Old IRA became entitled to a pension.  Anyone who wants to talk about playing politics would want to examine that side of the question.</P>
    <P>The granting of medals ceased at a certain date, and no special allowance was paid to the holder of a medal unless it was awarded previous to 1932. When I came into this House&mdash;I think it was in 1950&mdash;a few of my comrades and I brought in a motion asking that the holding of a medal, no matter when awarded, would make an applicant eligible for the special allowance.  In 1950, the former Deputy MacEoin, as Minister for Defence, accepted that motion, but he did nothing about it for the remaining years he was in power. It was only when the late Oscar Traynor became Minister for Defence in 1954 that that motion was implemented, and all medal holders became eligible for the allowance.</P>

During the first term of Cumann na nGaedheal Government and during the two terms of Coalition Government, how many increases were given?  I will let the Deputies opposite answer that themselves. Neither the pension nor the special allowance was given as a means of livelihood.  The pension was given for services rendered to the State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not delay the House but I wish to support this motion, which is only one of many to come before us here.  I recall General MacEoin two years ago making a final plea on behalf of his former comrades.  A note of political acrimony has been introduced into this debate, and I deplore it.  On this question of the special allowance and on the means test, in particular, I have had experience of helping to fight the case of a number of applicants, and let me say in fairness to the Minister, that I found him most cooperative at all times.  Of course he is hamstrung by rules and regulations, and this motion should help us to focus attention on the situation, particularly in regard to the means test.  This figure of £172 is completely ridiculous.  In view of the fact that the ranks of these veterans are being reduced every day, we should be a little more generous, particularly in this year when we celebrate the anniversary of 1916.</P>
      <P>There is a considerable amount of red tape involved and the means test is being applied far to rigidly.  In the case of a man with perhaps a cow or two, or a small shop, very often the assessing of his means is a matter of guesswork.  Very often applicants are shot down because they have a few pounds above the limit.  The whole thing needs to be looked at in an entirely new light.  Certainly there is a very strong case for raising the ceiling of £172.  I appeal to the Minister, knowing as I do his genuine interest in his former comrades, to have something tangible done at this late stage to show those men that we of a younger generation appreciate what they did and are prepared to do what we can to show practical recognition of their service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>In supporting this motion, I would first of all have regard to the remarks made by Deputy Gilbride when he unfairly suggested that there was a political aspect to the sponsoring of this motion by the Labour Party.  That was an unwarranted allegation and wholly unjustified when one considers that this Party, over a long number of years, have consistently brought to the notice of various Governments the unfairness and inadequacy of the pensions awarded to this important category of people and also when one has regard to the sponsors, and in particular to Deputy Tierney who has been an outstanding advocate of the Old IRA in this House and has to his credit very many motions couched in similar terms to improve the lot of the comrades with whom he served in other days. For any Deputy to imply that this was playing politics with the Old IRA is to imply something which, as far as Deputy Tierney, or any member of his Party, is concerned is patently unfair and should be withdrawn.  It is a reflection on the integrity, character and ability of a soldier of Ireland, in the person of Deputy Tierney.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not concerned with the politics involved, although I do know, and it is a very well-known fact, that this matter has been the plaything of politics for a long number of years. The allocation of pensions, medals and so on, has been riddled with politics. This has been borne home to us in recent months by the knowledge that many service medals awarded for alleged service during the War of Independence have been withdrawn on the ground that they had been wrongly awarded in the first instance.  That is a clear indication that there was something wrong in the Department of Defence when such a thing could happen.  My primary concern is with the odious means test which the Minister's Department applies when determining who is entitled to a pension and to what amount he or she may be entitled.  I do not think we have a more rigid or more rigorous means test than that applied to those who apply for Old IRA special allowances.  The means test applied under the social <Col N="739" /> welfare code is bad enough, but this is infinitely worse.</P>
    <P>I wonder is the Minister aware that many recipients of Old IRA special allowances have had their pensions reduced within the past few weeks in consequence of getting a 10/- increase in their social welfare benefits?  I have before me an award certificate in respect of a man in my constituency who enjoyed an Old IRA special allowance of £68 per year.  On 20th December, 1965, this man was informed&mdash;it was a nice Christmas box to get from the Minister's Department &mdash;that as and from the beginning of January, 1966, his Old IRA special allowance would be reduced from £68 per year to £55.  In the column headed &ldquo;Remarks&rdquo;, it is stated: &ldquo;The decrease in your special allowance from the 3/1/66 is due to the increase in your disability benefit as and from that date.&rdquo;  It would be enlightening to know how many unfortunate Old IRA men have been thus affected.</P>
    <P>Mark you, the people for whom I speak in this instance are not the people who enjoy pensions as such; they are that unfortunate, rather destitute element of the Old IRA whose standard of living must well be near subsistence level because to secure a pension of this kind, one must be extremely badly off.  The home assistance personnel would not apply a more rigid means test.  These people are extremely badly off but because the Social Welfare Department increased their disability allowance, these unfortunate men have suffered a reduction in their special allowance.  What a dishonour to confer on them at the commencement of the Golden Jubilee of 1916.</P>
    <P>When this House passed the increases to the social welfare beneficiaries, the Minister for Social Welfare was good enough to indicate to the many Deputies who queried him on the matter that it was not his wish that any recipient of these benefits would suffer a reduction in benefits from any other source.  We are concerned that home assistance officers might, as they did in the past, reduce home assistance recipients by an amount corresponding <Col N="740" /> to the increase given in Social Welfare benefits.  I think it is true to say that it is the confirmed opinion of this House, and of the Social Welfare Department, that it was never the intention in granting these increases in social welfare benefits that they should be curtailed by any other device whatever. It is all the more regrettable and all the more scandalous that the reduction should have taken place in the Department of Defence at a time when we are setting about celebrating 1916. This motion is timely and justified and I would appeal to the Minister to adopt a more humanitarian approach to the whole problem and to bring about a much needed modification in the means test and so ensure that these people receive something adequate.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned the standard of living of the categories of persons in receipt of Old IRA special allowances. Their circumstances must be extremely bad before they can qualify under this rigid and disgraceful means test.  I have had to bring to the notice of the Minister's predecessor the appalling conditions in which these people live. I have had to bring to his notice that a man who was believed to be a 1916 man was living in an outhouse in circumstances of utter destitution.  Despite all the evidence and persuasion I could bring to bear on the Minister's Department, nothing tangible accrued from my representations in this sorry case.</P>
    <P>Many of these Old IRA men are men to whom this country owes a deep debt of gratitude which we can never repay but which we should endeavour to repay while a few of them are still alive.  Many of them are living in our county homes.  Every country owes to its fighters for freedom the very best that it can confer upon them.  Many people who were entitled to Old IRA pensions did not apply for them at all.  These are the people who are most genuinely entitled to them but they did not apply for them because they went out to fight for the freedom of their country from patriotic motives and not in any hope of monetary gain.  Many of them applied for pensions because they needed the money and many more applied, chancing their arms, and got away with it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="741" /> When one compares the treatment given by other countries to their patriots with the treatment which our country metes out to our patriots, one must feel heartily ashamed.  I instance the care which the British Legion takes of the people who played their part in empire building and in the wars in which Britain was involved.  That puts our country to shame.  We can learn much from the manner in which the British Legion takes care of the British soldiers and their wives who may have fallen into economic distress of any kind.</P>
    <P>It is in that frame of mind that I rise to support this motion in the Labour Party interests and in the interests of all these people to whom we owe such a great deal.  The Minister has a unique opportunity to do honour to these people in this year of 1966, the 50th anniversary of the Rising.  There are so few of them left that it would be to our eternal disgrace if we did not do something for them.</P>

      <P>I am concerned about this question of the withdrawal of medals.  However surreptitiously a man may have got a medal, the Minister should be very careful before a medal is withdrawn or dishonoured in any way.  There has come to my knowledge the case of a man who gave outstanding service in the War of Independence and whose family were known to have sacrificed their all.  He was in England for a number of years and fell into difficult circumstances. His brother applied for a pension on his behalf and a service medal had been previously awarded to him.  The reply from the Department was that he was not entitled to a pension or an Old IRA special allowance because the medal was now being withdrawn.</P>
      <P>That medal was properly issued and the bad news came to that household at the time when the applicant had passed away.  The family resented it deeply.  They resented the inference that this patriot was not worthy of the service medal.  It was a terrible insult added to great injury.  I would appeal to the Minister, however difficult the times may be, not to be influenced by the credit squeeze or by a shortage of money and not to allow his Department to make use of the gimmick of refusing or withdrawing service medals for the purpose of nullifying applications for these allowances.</P>

      <P>I must refer to a remark made by Deputy Coughlan.  It reveals a state of affairs that is alarming in the extreme, and if Deputy Coughlan is serious, he has a duty to this House and to every medal holder to give particulars of the case he mentioned.  He mentioned that a young boy who was only six years of age in 1916 is now the holder of a 1916 medal.  This is something that would be a shame if it were true, for it brings into disrepute every 1916 medal in that district.  In my own county not far from Cashel, there is a very limited number of people&mdash;<Col N="743" /> not more than six&mdash;who are the proud holders of the 1916 medal.  They, with rightful pride, are honoured to have that medal.  The people in the locality claim a reflected share of the glory that is theirs.  I would look askance at anyone who would tolerate the unjust holding of such a medal&mdash;a medal that should represent so much, especially in this year, that should be given with honour, received with honour, worn with honour and without any kind of surreptitious action on the part of the person who received it.  It is obvious that a person only six years of age at the time could not qualify for it.</P>
      <P>The granting of special allowances and pensions is a matter of deep concern to the Minister.  He is a man who may be numbered among the freedom fighters and builders of this nation.  To his credit, on every occasion when the opportunity presented itself, he gave support, both within and without this House, to the cause of his less fortunate comrades. It is disturbing to hear over 40 years after the main event that, instead of decreasing, the number is increasing. We are told there are 64,000 medal holders in the country.  That must represent a challenge to the credulity of anyone.  There must have been an invisible army somewhere.  These medals were not granted at the whim of any Department: somebody verified for them.  It is about these people I would complain the most.  Any person who verified for another not entitled to the medal did, not alone himself, but his comrades a disservice and reduced the worth of the medal to a triviality.  One might as well have a hurling medal.</P>

      <P>If the Labour Party are sincere in this&mdash;I know the movers of the motion are&mdash;and if the Minister accedes to their request and <Col N="744" /> gives an increase in the pensions and special allowances, I hope they will have the moral rectitude to vote for the necessary taxation that must come in its wake.  It is easy to cry &ldquo;wolf&rdquo; and run away but it takes courage to stand up afterwards and vote the wherewithal necessary to pay these increases.  I deplore the action of those who call for these increases and pay tribute to the men concerned if they are not prepared later to show their sincerity with £ s. d. and vote for the necessary taxation.</P>
      <P>I would appeal to the Minister, even though there must obviously be a number of people holding medals who are not entitled to them, for the sake of those who are, for the sake of those in the winter of their lives, who may find themselves in difficulties, financial or domestic, to be helpful as far as the limits of the Exchequer will allow.  I, for one, will be prepared to vote for any increased taxation to enable the Minister to give these increases.  It is wishful thinking to think we can demand things and not be willing to pay for them.</P>
      <P>Recipients of social welfare payments, who are entitled to them because of their labour and contributions over the years, should not have their special allowances or any Old IRA pension taken into account in any means test.  This has been the practice of the county manager of the local authority on which I serve.  So far as means tests for hospitals and so on are concerned, he never takes into consideration Old IRA special allowances.  That is to his credit.  It is something that could well be followed by every local authority and every Department.</P>

      <P>For more reasons than one, we have reason to be grateful to the <i>Tuairim</i> organisation, who last week-end published a most interesting paper about our activities as well as the personnel of this House.  One of the interesting things to which they drew public attention is that less than ten per cent of the Members of the present Dáil are people who were in a position to play any part in the fight for freedom.  Therefore, I suppose, <Col N="745" /> we in this Dáil can speak more objectively about Old IRA men than most Dála before us, which contained a larger percentage of people actively involved in the fight for freedom.  We can also speak about the need for increasing the pensions and allowances to these brave people who sacrificed so much, without at the same time voting anything for our own immediate friends or for ourselves.  Therefore, we should approach this problem in the detatched way the impartial voice of history will comment on it.</P>
      <P>To learn that in this day and age&mdash; not in the autumn of their lives but in the winter of their lives&mdash;8,500 people who risked so much that we might be free are so close to destitution that they must receive a special allowance is something which ought to disturb our consciences.  It must disturb us to realise that last year when the State, which has not a reputation for being generous decided that people on disability benefit and other social welfare allowances would be compensated to the extent of 10/- to meet the cost of living&mdash;that being the most the Government could give&mdash;and we voted for those increases, we at the same time ensured that no person in receipt of a special allowance would get any benefit whatever from that.  That is in fact what happened.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to be generous and to make the Minister a present of 5/-, if that be it.  Last year, when Dáil Éireann, in its wisdom, decided that people who were disabled should get an additional 10/- a week, I do not think Dáil Éireann had in mind that those people who were disabled and who had fought for their country, who had risked their lives and suffered for their country, would get only 5/-.  If you are disabled now and have a record of national service, you will be worse off than if you are disabled and have not a national service record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many disabled people can have income from sources other than their special allowances or State sources. Such people can get the full increase, whenever social welfare benefits are increased, but that, apparently, is not to apply to the courageous people who sacrificed so much in the past.  That seems an unforgivable attitude.  I would petition the Minister, his colleagues in the Government and those behind him on the Fianna Fáil benches, to put an end to this miserable attitude towards these people who, through the operation of the natural law, are decreasing annually in number.  If my recollections are correct, the effect of maintaining the special allowance for these people at the figure at which it was before their disability benefit increased would be only in the nature of £10,000 or £11,000 a year and every disabled soldier who sacrificed so much in the past that we might be free today should get 10/-, the same as every other disabled person. We have been told that figures many hundreds of times greater than that were &ldquo;nugatory&rdquo;.  Here, we have that very small figure which will diminish year in, year out.  The Minister should prevail upon his colleagues in the Government to ensure that we put an end once and for all to this system which deprives disabled soldiers <Col N="747" /> of the full benefit of national welfare increases.</P>
    <P>The motion speaks for itself and it is well worded.  It speaks of the exceptionally small pensions which are payable. It speaks also of the need not to deprive these people of the full increases in social welfare payments. These are simple statements.  The request is simple&mdash;to grant a continuation. The welfare of these people will cost so little that we ought to undertake it without any further delay.  In some respects, I feel that, even if the monetary allowances were doubled, it would not answer the needs of some of these old soldiers.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that we have not had a more generous approach to these people.  It is unfortunate that we have not set up an institution to which they could go in the winter of their days when they have become disabled, where they could have their comforts and be in the company of people beside whom they had soldiered many years ago.  They are the architects of all we now enjoy.  They have given us the privilege and the opportunity to speak here in a free Parliament in a free country.  It is imperative that we should acknowledge that debt to them now and not simply leave it to history to emblazon their names in letters of gold.  That is no consolation to them now.  Rather, we should make their life a little easier in the way they deserve to have it done by the State they have created.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I merely rise to support the motion because I believe it is most meritorious and, of its nature, should command the support of every member of this House.  On an issue of this kind, nobody should indulge in any bickering or try to make political capital.  I was rather amused by Deputy Davern's suggestion that if we were so determined in moving this motion, we should have been just as determined that the necessary money would be available to implement the motion, should it be passed.  Deputy Davern would be very foolish to think that the motion would be put forward if we had other ideas <Col N="748" /> about the financial commitments involved. It would be better if he had avoided that line of argument.  Whatever increase may be given should commend itself to all schools of thought up and down the land.</P>
      <P>Over the years, recommendations of this kind have been coming before the House but no year would be as appropriate as this year, which marks the golden jubilee of the 1916 Rising, in which to give vent to the feelings of the members of this House to improve the lot of the people concerned. I appeal to all sides of the House not to register any opposition whatever in this regard.</P>
      <P>In the manner in which it has been put to the House by Deputy Kyne and Deputy Tierney, the motion clearly justifies itself.  It is appalling that the pension of an Old IRA man in receipt of social welfare benefit should adversely be affected either by the one or the other.  I appeal to the House to have very little bickering in this regard. Let us make one determined united effort to give proper recognition to those people as I believe it has been too long delayed.</P>

      <P>I support the motion which is a very important one.  Everything that can be said about it has been said.  However, seeing that the Minister and the Government have decided not to accept it, I shall make one very important appeal to the Minister.  The amount of pension being paid up and down the country, especially to those in receipt of special allowances, is very low indeed.  I do not think there is any hope that, at the moment, the Minister or the Government will agree to increases of pensions. Some time ago, I suggested to the Department that they might at least consider paying these pensions once a fortnight.  That is very important in the case of a person solely dependent on the pension.  Many of these Old IRA men are solely dependent on their pensions, many of them are living alone, and so on.  Therefore, I would ask the Minister to consider paying these pensions once a fortnight as it is a very important matter for the people involved.  It would bring great relief to these pensioners.</P>

      <P>Let me begin by saying that this motion, which was so well put before the House yesterday evening by Deputy Kyne and Deputy Tierney, was not decided yesterday evening as was reported in one of this morning's papers.  The motion did not fail yet and I hope the Fianna Fáil Party will have the good sense to see to it that it does not fail tonight.</P>
      <P>I was very surprised to find somebody for whom I have very high regard, Deputy Gilbride, one of the very few Fianna Fáil Deputies who took part in the debate, making an attack on the motives for which the motion was put down.  The motion was put down about six months ago and it is pure accident that it should be discussed now, but it is being discussed now and if it does embarrass the Government and the Fianna Fáil Party, that is their hard luck.  It ill-behoves people like Deputy Gilbride, who has a good national record, to impugn the motives of the Labour Party.  I may say to Deputy Davern, who appeared to worry as to whether we would be prepared to vote the money, that Labour stand by their principles now as they did in 1916 and that is more than can be said for a lot of people we hear talking about 1916 and what should be done to celebrate the 1916 Rising.</P>

      <P>The whole attitude of the Government here, as far as I could see, was that this was something that they were not prepared to do.  The Minister said so last night.  Not being <Col N="750" /> prepared to do it, they tried to cast a slur on it.  Deputy Corry, fair enough, stood up for five minutes last night and, as he so often does, disagreed with the Government, and it is fair to say that if time had allowed, he would most certainly have been prepared to express the view that the motion was right.  Time and Standing Orders prevented him from getting that far and he was not here to resume the debate this evening.</P>
      <P>The motion has been dealt with by this Party and by the few Fine Gael Deputies who took part, on the basis that we are attempting to persuade the Government through this House that there are people who were responsible in a big way for the setting up of the State who will be hungry in the year 1966, when the celebrations are taking place in Dublin and elsewhere, when hundreds of thousands of pounds will be spent in celebrating what they did.</P>
      <P>Do not let anybody here tell me that that is not so because I can take the Minister&mdash;I know he is aware of it&mdash; or any other member of this House to people who, although they have a good national record and were active when they were needed, have not got what will keep body and soul together, and that through no fault of their own.</P>
      <P>I had a letter some time ago from a lady resident in Northern Ireland who pointed out to me that her husband who, she said, did not take part in any patriotic activity, and who was ill in the North, was receiving a very good allowance from the Northern Ireland Parliament through social welfare and also had a helper supplied to look after him, whereas her brother who took an active part in the 1916 Rising, who lived in County Cavan and was in very poor health, had a very small special allowance and had nobody to look after him, with the result that he had to go into the local county home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have recently been in the county home in Meath and was appalled at the number of people there who I knew had a national record.  I asked some of them why they had gone there and was told that they were unable to look after themselves at home that they were getting only a few shillings <Col N="751" /> special allowance and that it was not enough to live on.</P>
    <P>Somebody said here that the allowance is not supposed to be enough to live on.  That is assuming that the people concerned have been insured workers entitled to sickness benefit through social welfare.  Many of them were not insured workers.  Many of them were small farmers or businessmen who had no stamps and who now have nothing but the special allowance.</P>
    <P>The Minister's argument is that if an increase were to be granted to everybody who was a medal holder it would cost a colossal amount of money.  I do not think the medal holders who own big stores in this city will ever dream of looking for a special allowance from the Minister. Good luck to those who were able to do so well.  We treat very shabbily the unfortunates who were not able to do well and who are down on their luck.</P>
    <P>On the question of examination of means, I brought to the attention of the Minister's predecessor the case of an unfortunate person in the town of Kells who was living on a special allowance.  He never had enough stamps to qualify him for any benefit. He was by way of being a tailor in his day and was trying to live on what he was getting as special allowance.  Somebody with a long tongue and having nothing better to do brought to the notice of the Department in Coláiste Caoimhín that this poor man was getting an odd few shillings for stitching patches on people's clothes.  The case was duly investigated.  His special allowance was reduced.  I took up the matter with Coláiste Caoimhín and with the Minister's predecessor.  The allowance was restored.  The person who investigated was not satisfied. Obviously, because he had a vindictive nature, he went around the town from house to house until he got sufficient evidence to go back to Coláiste Caoimhín to have the special allowance completely rescinded.  Since that time, this man has been living on the charity of his neighbours.  He has a record second to none in this State.</P>
    <P>That is the sort of thing which Deputy Treacy was objecting to earlier <Col N="752" /> and to which I want to object now. The maximum special allowance is small enough, without there being any question of looking for an excuse to take a few shillings away.  Deputy Treacy quoted from a document to show that a special allowance had been reduced from £68 to £55.  An amount of 5/- per week was taken from the special allowance because the person concerned got an extra 10/- per week in social welfare benefit from 1st January.  So, while the Department of Social Welfare considered that an extra 10/- per week was necessary to keep body and soul together, the Minister's Department decided to take 5/- from the allowance.  Apparently, they consider that 5/- is enough for such a man, although 10/- is required for everybody else.</P>
    <P>I am sure that on reflection the Minister will agree that if agreement can be reached between the various organisations who want to be responsible for the 1916 Commemoration celebrations, a great deal of money will be spent this year.  I do not know any better way in which we could spend money than in giving some of it to the poor people who so badly need it and who were, whether we like it or not, responsible for the fact that we are able to sit here as the Parliament of the nation.</P>
    <P>The Minister made a comment which I do not think was fair.  The Minister said that those who are in receipt of the higher pension or higher allowance would object if increases were granted to those on the lower level.  That is an unfair statement.  The Minister has absolutely no evidence to support it.  We are all humane enough, I think, to realise that people in very straitened circumstances, people who need some help, people&mdash;let us face it &mdash;on the verge of starvation are entitled to a little more than they are getting.  To suggest, as an excuse for not giving a little more, that it might make someone who already has a little more jealous because they were catching up is just a lot of cod.</P>
    <P>The question of the number involved in the 1916-21 and 1922 period has been commented on.  Someone said <Col N="753" /> there are now more holding medals than there were ten years ago.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am only repeating what was said.  Whether or not that is supposed to be a slur on those holding medals I do not know. Someone said that there must have been an invisible army.  Of course there was an invisible army and, if there had not been, we would not be here now.  It is wrong that those who were issued with medals 20 years ago should now be reinvestigated.  Many of the certifying officers are now dead. The evidence is no longer available. Apparently, as an easy way out presumably, it has been found that the written evidence produced is not sufficient to certify those who are now being reinvestigated, although it did satisfy those who made the original investigation.  Maybe, as Deputy Ryan said, it is another generation.  Maybe they are people who were not involved. Maybe they are so young they feel that the people of 1916 onwards do not count.  What happened does not matter.  They have no feelings.</P>
      <P>It is quite true to say that if someone has a medal and that medal is taken away, a horrible slur is cast upon that man and on his family.  The Minister is aware of one case in my village. A man had a special allowance for a number of years.  Investigations were carried out&mdash;at whose instigation I do not know&mdash;but the result was that the Minister decided not alone to take away the special allowance but to bring the man to court to recover the money he had got.  I warned the Minister that that man was at death's door.  In fact he died a few weeks after the decision was given.  I hope those responsible for having the investigation carried out are satisfied with their good work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The extraordinary thing about all this is that, when it comes to celebrating, to marching behind a band, waving a flag and talking about 1916, we are all prepared to join in.  There is a certain amount of reflected glory. But when someone suggests that someone who was involved and is now down on his luck should get a few <Col N="754" /> extra shillings to keep body and soul together, that is a cause of embarrassment. The Government should not be discommoded, particularly when there is a credit squeeze; those people should be able to carry on without a few extra shillings.  Sweep them under the carpet&mdash;forget them; the sooner they die the better, because they are an embarrassment to the Government.  It is just too bad that in 1966, with all our talk about celebrating the Rising, we have still got that type of mentality which thinks that, because a person is poor, he does not count.  He counted when he was wanted and if the Government bring before this House proposals to increase substantially, as the motion suggests, the pension and special allowances paid to these people, it will get the unaminous support of all Deputies, despite what Deputy Davern said a moment ago.  The number of people at present in receipt of special allowances is approximately 8,500. Between 1960 and today&mdash;the Minister will verify this&mdash;2,000 have died.</P>

This motion has been on the Order Paper for six months and, when it was put down, there was no question of 1916 celebrations.</P>
      <P>Reference was made to medals, who got them and who did not.  I raised in this House a case in which a medal was lent to a man who had never got a medal, to enable him to get a postman's job.  Lord rest him, the man is now dead.  I raised that here.  He was sitting on those benches, holding a parliamentary office.  It is too bad that that sort of thing should be done but Deputy Gilbride can be assured that, if there is trickery, it happens on his side just as well as it might happen on this.</P>

      <P>Deputy Kyne asked for a free vote of the House. This is not a political matter.  It affects those about whom we have been talking for the past hour and a half. If the Fianna Fáil Party are determined to beat the motion out of the House, and vote it down, even if it is defeated, I appeal to the Minister to go into this question of the reinvestigation of means.  It saves the State £5 to £12 or £13 and it costs much more than that when the expenses of the investigating officer are calculated.  I appeal to the Minister to use his good offices to put an end to that sort of thing.  If he does so, he will be doing a darned good job and a great many people who are in receipt of special allowances will be prepared to thank him for it.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Economic Situation.</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann agrees generally with the views and recommendations contained in the Report of the National Industrial Economic Council on the Economic Situation, 1965, which was laid before Dáil Éireann on the 24th November, 1965.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I invite the attention of the House to the fact that economic theses are seldom written by bus workers, building trade operatives or farm labourers, which is not to say that the people by whom they are written are any the less worthy by reason of that fact.  It is also true that when these strictures issue at banquets from Government Ministers and people of that sector of society, adjuring the workers to put more into their efforts for the national good, what comes across to the ordinary worker who has to meet with the harsh realities of life and has to work with hand or brain for a certain number of hours per week, is the audible, small but still <Col N="759" /> very audible, voice which says: &ldquo;Do not do as I do but do as I tell you.&rdquo; This is inherent in a lot of these lectures which we have been getting in this House and which we get regularly from the banqueting tables, not to mention the institute to which I referred before the adjournment.  It would be correct to say that the body of society seems to be afflicted by these institutes as by a rash.  I fail to see what contribution the self-glorification of these pompous little bodies makes towards the enlargement of the gross national product.  They do make a very definite contribution towards the enlargement of their own gross craniums&mdash;or whatever the plural of that word may be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>We in the Labour Party stand on the fundamental principle that before we start to talk about how we are going to divide the anticipated three per cent which the economists guess&mdash;and I emphasise the word &ldquo;guess&rdquo;&mdash;will be the total of the increase in our production for the coming year&mdash;and it might very well be much more than three per cent in the event&mdash;we want to talk about the distribution of the national product which is there now and the manner in which it is distributed, particularly in regard to the most needy sections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mentioned what I thought were the priorities and it will be no harm to repeat them.  First of all, there are the aged and the lonely.  There are 32,000 old people living alone, in many cases perhaps living on the non-contributory old age pension.  What more pathetic picture can one visualise than that? Loneliness in itself is not an economic factor but it is a very human one.  The economists do not refer to that at all. The economists with their computer <Col N="760" /> minds have no concern about this kind of thing but it is something with which the Government should concern themselves. It is something with which we as human beings representing the people should concern ourselves.  It is part of the problem of government to see in what way these people should be treated and what steps should be taken to make their lives more tolerable when they are thrown, as it were, on the waves of the world with very little to live on.</P>
    <P>There is a suggestion in the Report which was brought to my attention by one of the small coterie in the Dáil who read this Report from cover to cover, that the Government might find it necessary to restrict expenditure in the area of social activity.  That would seem to imply that if economies are to be effected, they might possibly be made at the expense of people of the kind about whom I have been speaking, the aged and the most helpless.  If by any accident of circumstances, or if by any misguided wish to follow too closely on the heels of the economists, the Government should find themselves in the position of not being able to afford more money for the relief of such people, if money stands between the provision of a domiciliary service of the kind operated by one very laudable order of nuns in Ballyfermot&mdash;for nursing the sick and looking after the old, the lonely and the poor&mdash;then it would be socially disastrous and in my view, much worse than even the threat of economic disaster.  The threat of economic disaster has been magnified out of all proportion and it has been the habit of our politicians to raise up menaces when they find themselves at a loss. A menace is always within reach if the Fianna Fáil Party are in difficulties. Menaces are always a useful political ploy and there is no greater producer of menaces than the present Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>We have had the proposition put here by members of the Government and, to some extent, by the principal Opposition that the unions should concern themselves primarily with the distribution levels of future production. Unions are expected to exercise a <Col N="761" /> restraint upon the workers in the matter of wage increases.  What is forgotten in this matter and what must be emphasised and cannot be repeated too often in order to impress it on the people who do not like trade unions anyway, and we have them in this House&mdash;they do not like the idea of workers being organised; they would much prefer them to be unorganised &mdash;is that a union's function is not, as has been pictured here, to act as a brake on the activity of its members. That is not the function of any trade union executive or leader and we reject the idea that such is their function.  A union's function is not to persuade workers to be content with what they have and thank God for it.</P>
    <P>Do not let anybody run away with the idea that everybody in Dublin is earning £25 or £30 a week.  There are many workers whose take-home pay packet is little more than £10 or £11 per week and they are doing their best to rear families on that amount.  The lot of these people is debt and worry. As one who is in constant contact with them, as are most of the members of this Party, I know that debt and worry are the constant companions of the average Dublin worker today.  To ask the unions to say to those workers that they will have to put up with an increase of 6/- or 7/- a week because the gross national product is not sufficient to meet any further increase shows that those who think that are completely out of touch with reality. It does seem to me that there are members of the Government who suffer from delusions of grandeur which are the result of a misspent political life. These are symptoms of a time not too well spent.</P>
    <P>I have referred to Deputy Corry and his wit in support of the farmers and I might advert to the particular type of farmer he represents.  He epitomises them in every way, in their appearance, in their approach and in their general attitude to the farming community as a whole.  I do not think I can pay him any greater compliment than that.  He talked about prices being inadequate as far as the farmer is concerned and he spoke of the farm labourer but apparently there is doubt <Col N="762" /> in his mind as to who should pay the farm labourer.  The farmer, to Deputy Corry's mind, has no function in that regard.  Apparently it is some kind of mystical body, obviously not the Government whom Deputy Corry supports, and certainly not the farmer.  It seems that there is some kind of invisible force responsible for the present bad conditions of the agricultural labourer.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry went on to say that there should be justice for the farm workers but he failed to identify the people who are not giving that justice to the agricultural labourer.  I suggest that that responsibility rests primarily on the farmer.  Deputy Corry, in the same breath, told us about the farmers making money and growing peas on contract and getting £60 a owt for them.  I suppose that would be the net return.  Then he complains about a wage rate of £7 a week.  Yet he supports a Government who say that a three per cent increase is as much as the traffic will allow.  What is three per cent of £7 a week?  It is about 4/8d. That will not get the farm worker very far.</P>
    <P>I regret we did not have any contribution to this debate from a Minister whom I regard as having a particular responsibility in the matter of assessing the economy of the country, that is, the Minister for Transport and Power without responsibility.  We know he has been away but let us hope that he will intervene in the debate.  CIE recently caused grave worry to many people.  I read somewhere that the Minister made a speech at a function at which CIE officials were present in which he said that CIE was broke.  He then went on to say that the people to whom he was speaking had done a great job.  If CIE is to be kept going, if Kingsbridge is to be kept open at all, it will need the injection of a couple of million pounds.  We in the Labour Party never burked that issue. We always felt that the idea of making a national transport undertaking a profitable business, a business that would meet its own costs, was far-fetched and impossible. From what we read, there does not appear to be any railway concern in the world that can <Col N="763" /> make profits.  Very many of them have been losing for years.  We have had thrust down our throats time and time again by the Minister for Transport and Power without responsibility that this must be done and everything judged according to what he calls efficiency, but the profit motive comes into it.</P>
    <P>We always regarded CIE as a social service, something that should be treated as such and paid for from the Exchequer.  It was unreasonable to think it could be made to pay.  Now we are left in the situation where this Report calls for increased production and it would appear the public transport system is going to come to a full stop.  They say they require £2 million of an injection to keep them going. Where is the money to come from? The Government have not got £2 million.  Therefore, it looks as if CIE will stop altogether.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister for Finance to say something on that when he has an opportunity to reply to this debate.  It is probably too optimistic to expect the Minister for Transport and Power without responsibility to come in.  Perhaps I should repeat Lord Baldwin's great definition of power without responsibility.  Anybody who has put down a question to the Minister for Transport and Power in connection with CIE has invariably got the reply that the Minister has no responsibility.  Therefore, he is the Minister for Transport and Power without responsibility.  Lord Baldwin defined people of that kind.  He was referring, I think, to anonymous newspaper editors who were attacking the Government.  He said the exercise of power without responsibility was the prerogative of the harlot through the ages.  I do not want to draw the analogy too far.  I leave it to Deputies to judge whether it is justified or not. Certainly, the title is unjustified and should be changed.</P>
    <P>I do not want to anticipate the reply of the Minister for Finance, but I think in the course of his introductory speech on this motion, he might have said something on the subject of incentives <Col N="764" /> to workers to produce more. We had no mention of that during the whole debate.  If you are going to get Irish workers to produce more, incentives are essential.  The best incentive is the promise of greater reward, of better pay.  Since the appeal to produce more must necessarily apply to all kinds of people, I would suggest to the Minister for Finance that there rests upon him an obligation to provide an incentive to that vast and respectable body of people we call ratepayers and that the burden they carry should be relieved at least to the extent of their not having to pay income tax on moneys which they have to pay in rates.  That seems to me to be unjust.  It is really double taxation.</P>
    <P>It is symptomatic of the whole trend of Government today that in this year, the 50th anniversary of the 1916 Insurrection, we are going to have a revolt about the revolt all over the country. The latest occurrence does not help towards the creation of an atmosphere in which everybody unites in the effort to produce more.  The latest piece of ignorant impertinence I observed in the newspapers was the denial of the right of the citizens of Dublin to see O'Casey during Easter Week&mdash;as if there was something wrong with him.  These moryah respectable elements have taken over again.  Poor Pearse, Connolly and all the rest! If they had the opportunity today to contemplate our activities, the activities of those exploiting them in various ways, particularly the kind of people who want to decry the memory of one of our greatest theatrical geniuses, O'Casey, I wonder what thoughts would pass through their minds?  I wonder what Pearse thinks of the British Royal Mint minting his head?  That is something I cannot swallow.  We live in a time when we are going back into the Empire with our heads up.</P>
    <P>Finally, this Government remind me, because of their profligacy in one sense and their meanness in another, their lack of real capacity to plan properly, of a scene which comes to my mind when we mention O'Casey of two characters going into a tenement room maudlin.  There is not a stick of furniture <Col N="765" /> in it.  Everything is in the pawn. The woman of the house has left; she could not take it any more.  The daughter is in trouble.  These two characters come in.  One of them puts his hand in his pocket, takes out a coin and looks at it.  It seems to sum up for me the despair which this Government are trying to generate, and have succeeded in generating to a great extent, among certain sections of the population.  He looks at the coin and declares: &ldquo;Only a solitary tanner out of all the money I borrowed.  The blinds is down, Joxer; the blinds is down.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The manner in which this motion by the Minister for Finance came to be discussed in the House is one worthy of a little comment.  In the late fall of last year, when in the ordinary way this Party were putting down motions for consideration in Private Members' Time, we put down the motion now being discussed with the motion by the Minister for Finance.  It lay on the Order Paper over the month before Christmas and over the early part of last month.  Then, I think four or five days before the Dáil was going to sit last Tuesday for this session, we suddenly got a message from the Government Whips Office that the Government proposed to give time for our motion on last Tuesday and that it would not have to be taken in Private Members' time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we got that message, without having asked for it specifically at that time, I must confess I immediately began to look to see what cunning was at the back of it.  You do not have to be versed in Virgil to know that Fianna Fáil never give anything away for nothing.  It transpired afterwards, if you look down the Order Paper, that the real reason they did it was to hide their own nakedness, to hide the fact that they had been so inefficient in relation to legislation and business that the Government had virtually no business for last week and very little for this week.  So, in order to cover up that gap and to prevent themselves from being shown up for the incompetents they are, they thought they would give time for the <Col N="766" /> discussion of our motion.  They are men wobbling, not able to make up their minds from day to day, as we have seen them all through the last year.  The next day, we got a message that they would not give time for our motion as the Minister for Finance was putting down a motion of his own and that motion eventually came to the Order Paper, the motion that we approve of the Report of the NIEC, a Report of which everybody must approve, signed, as it is, by the representatives of every section in the community other than agriculture, to the omission of which I shall refer later.</P>
    <P>I was inclined to think that it must be something like the earlier legislation we had last year when I saw that the motion was down in the name of the Minister for Finance.  I was inclined to think that it must be rather like the Finance Bill which he brought into this House and which, quite clearly, at the time and during the course of its passage, he never really understood at all and that he must be doing the same thing with the motion of approval of this Report.</P>
    <P>The Report itself is the most ferocious indictment that has ever been written of the policies put into force by the Minister for Finance and it is the most damning condemnation of the views the Taoiseach uttered during the course of last spring.  I cannot understand Deputy J. Lynch, as Minister for Finance, putting down a motion of approval of a Report that condemns as utterly inadequate and as utterly inefficient his own handling of the situation, that condemns the views his own Leader adumbrated with such vigour, force and bravado in the spring of last year.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the Minister for Finance was codded by the Minister for Agriculture into doing it so that there would be, in the words of Deputy Dunne, another Minister to be discussed; so that the attention might be taken off the manner in which the Minister for Agriculture had lost, through his inefficiency, £1 million of our markets that we had already there and about which we got the details today at Question Time.  Or <Col N="767" /> was it, I wonder, the fact that the Minister for Finance really did not appreciate that this was such an indictment of the failure of his own policy?  I am talking about him politically now: he really did not appreciate a Finance Bill when he came into this House.</P>
    <P>The story that is going the rounds of the town about him in that respect and about the NIEC Report is an apt one, a little unkind perhaps but I am afraid an apt one, politically. A bride came home from her honeymoon and, on the first day after they got home, she was doing her best to make dinner for her husband.  She was not very good at the culinary art and therefore she was working hard with one hand near the range and the other hand flicking over the pages of the cookery book.  The instructions for the dish she had decided upon were at the bottom of the page.  She wanted to make sure she was following the instructions accurately.  She set the dish before her husband in due course and it was not very good.  He cavilled somewhat at it and she said: &ldquo;I am sorry but I took it exactly out of the book&rdquo;.  He got the book and they checked.  He found that she knew so little about cooking that she had turned over two pages together and put the bottom of one dish into the top of another.  I think, in relation to some of these things like the Finance Bill and like this Report, that the Minister for Finance appreciates so little what goes between the first page and the last page that he has been easy meat for some of his colleagues who wanted to get over something on him that would be fairly unpopular.</P>
    <P>I shall explain in detail later what I mean when I say that this NIEC Report is the most ferocious indictment of the failure of any Minister for Finance we have had in our 40 years of self-government.  Before I do that, may I make some reference to the manner in which an incomes policy came to be discussed in this House on this motion and in the make-up of the NIEC Report?  The Report itself makes it clear that the background for these discussions on an incomes policy started in 1964 and were being brought <Col N="768" /> to ultimate fruition so that, in the early summer, the Council submitted a report on an incomes policy and then, in the late autumn, submitted this Report. I am sure that in the spring of last year, the Taoiseach must have known that the Council were considering the desirability of issuing a Report on an incomes policy.  I am certain that the civil servants who sit on that Council keep him properly briefed and properly apprised.  I am certain that they send minutes and memoranda to him. Nobody except the Taoiseach himself could know whether in fact he actually read them.  Not only that, on many occasions down through the years, OECD made it clear that they felt that an incomes policy was an essential part of any orderly development of growth; an essential part to ensure that we could have growth and, at the same time, reasonably full employment.</P>
    <P>On many occasions, the Taoiseach has referred here to reports from OECD.  In those circumstances, I can only say that the speech made by the Taoiseach at Mullingar was either grossly dishonest, because of what he knew was being considered behind the scenes at that time and what should be considered, or else he had not bothered to read the briefs that had been sent up to him.  When he spoke at Mullingar, and I quote from the <i>Irish Press&mdash; Pravda,</i> the Truth in the News&mdash;of 6th April, 1965, he made it clear, in absolutely unambiguous terms, that he would be against an incomes policy:</P>
    <P>We of Fianna Fáil do not believe that any system of this kind is workable.  It has never been successfully operated in any country except a communist country.</P>
    <P>Of course, it would not be worthy of Deputy Lemass as Taoiseach unless he could throw in a slur of that kind.</P>
    <P>Let us consider that quotation I have given from his speech in the spring of the general election when he was merely trying to denigrate the policies that had been put forward by this Party and which not merely contained in relation to an incomes policy the basis upon which the NIEC now admit an incomes policy should be built up but contained also a provision in relation to credit which Deputy <Col N="769" /> MacEntee, particularly, then Tánaiste, tried to suggest was an escheatment and a method of stealing people's money.  Yet, the Council now suggest, and the Central Bank has already in the past six months, exactly the powers we suggested then were more appropriate to ensure that there would be orderly growth.</P>
    <P>Speaking at the annual dinner of the Dublin Chamber of Commerce on 26th October, 1965, the Taoiseach said&mdash;a conversion in the six months between April and October&mdash;</P>
    <P>An incomes policy is a fundamental requirement of continuing economic growth and it is also the foundation of a just social policy&mdash;</P>
    <P>He went pretty near &ldquo;a just society&rdquo; when he said &ldquo;a just social policy&rdquo; but, of course, he had to change the wording slightly&mdash;</P>
    <P>which must involve a degree of income redistribution.</P>
    <P>Then he came on with a sentence to show that he was aware how vulnerable he was because of his previous speech:</P>
    <P>In a totalitarian regime it is imposed by government order.  In a free democracy it has to be worked out by consultation and agreement.</P>
    <P>That is exactly what we said six months before but which the Taoiseach then said could be carried out only in a communist country.</P>
    <P>I should add that it was not only in a general election that we indicated from this side of the House that we believed an incomes policy was a proper way of providing for orderly growth.  The present Minister for Finance may not then have been interested in speeches made on financial matters but I can recollect in the last two years before that several occasions on which, speaking on behalf of this Party, I made it clear that we believed that an incomes policy was needed, and badly needed at that.</P>
    <P>But it is always in a time of expansion and in a time when things are going well that one would have the best chance of getting anyone fully to understand the benefits of such a policy <Col N="770" /> and that is why we were particularly keen that it would be done in the early part of last year and were working on it then, before any cloud appeared on the horizon.  Fianna Fáil, on the other hand, through the document, <i>Closing the Gap,</i> of 1963, and by their insistence now on it, seem to regard it more as restrictive rather than as the proper means of orderly growth.</P>
    <P>I said that this was the most damning indictment there could be of the policy of any Minister for Finance, because the Report itself makes it clear that there are certain things that must exaggerate demand, exaggerate inflation, and these are things for which the Minister for Finance is entirely responsible.</P>
    <P>On the figures the Minister for Finance has given us already&mdash;and he knows whether these figures are genuine or whether they are not&mdash;we are going to have this year the greatest deficit in our current Budget that we have ever had in the history of the State.  We have at the present time increased expenditure over the corresponding period of last year to the tune of £22 million.  We have increased revenue of £16 million.  We have, therefore, an increased deficit of £6 million on the Supply Services, current and capital.</P>
    <P>Last year we ended up with a deficit of £4 million on the current Budget and, as far as one can judge, the position in relation to capital supply services is more or less the same as last year.</P>
    <P>The below-the-line expenditure this year is £6 million more than last year. The deficit on repayments of capital is about £1½ million more than it was last year.  We have, therefore, even allowing for the increased taxation of £16 million, a situation which is worse by £13½ million in the same ten month period as compared to last year and, to that extent, increasing and making worse the demand and, therefore, the inflationary tendencies that are at work in the community.</P>
    <P>The deficit in the balance of payments in 1962 was £13½ million.  Capital inflow in that year was £23 million, <Col N="771" /> which more than took account of it. In 1963, the deficit was £22 million and capital inflow was £25 million.  The deficit in 1964 was £31½ million and capital inflow, which everybody acknowledges and which the Central Bank itself says in this Report contained obviously some short-term funds from England, was some £36 million. Yet, though we were, in fact, living on money brought in from abroad entirely in that way, the Minister for Finance did nothing whatever in his Budget to meet the situation or to face the difficulties that might arise from it if the inflow was exceptional, as he had been advised at the time it was.</P>
    <P>That is not the whole story.  He came into the House with the Budget.  A few days before he published the capital programme for the current year.  The programme that was envisaged for public capital expenditure in the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> was £95½ million.  The Budget estimate the Minister brought in was £8 million more than that&mdash; £103¾ million&mdash;again £8 million more than the Second Programme estimate. One of the things about this Report which we are now asked to adopt and which the Minister asks us to adopt is that it is stringent in its criticism on the necessity to avoid exceeding the capital estimate of an economic programme.</P>
    <P>We had then, in July, the Taoiseach coming in in relation to that public capital programme and saying then, a matter of three months after his Minister for Finance&mdash;his new Minister for Finance&mdash;had introduced his Budget and had introduced his capital programme&mdash;that it was wrong and that it would have to be cut back to the £95½ million.  The Dáil rose and when we came back after the Recess we got another White Paper published in October, 1965.  Even in that White Paper, what the Taoiseach had said in July was again contradicted.  Instead of going back to the £95½ million he spoke of in July, they went to a figure of £100 million.  Is it not clear and obvious why, in those circumstances, nobody can understand what the Government <Col N="772" /> are going to do next?  They are running around like a punch-drunk boxer, jabbing quickly in this direction and that, but quite unable to work out coolly, calmly and coherently any plan for the future.</P>
    <P>I said a moment ago that it must have been obvious to the Minister, or should have been obvious to him and to the members of the Government, if they knew their job, that capital inflow was likely to be less in 1965. To underline and prove what I am saying, and to show I am not merely being wise after the event, I want to take the quotations from the OECD issue published in March, 1965, six weeks before the Minister introduced his Budget.  On page 14:</P>
    <P>The net capital inflow in 1964 was exceptionally high and may have included some short-term funds from the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>On page 23:</P>
    <P>But the increase in the net capital inflow was exceptional last year and the inflow may not be as great in 1965.</P>
    <P>Page 24 relates to incomes policy as such and not to capital inflow, but I shall deal with it later when I come to deal with incomes policy as such. These two quotations on pages 14 and 23 make it clear that the OECD economists who examined the position, and examined it not in isolation but with the experts of the Department of Finance and the special sector in relation to economic forecasting, and so forth, made it clear that there was likely to be this drop in capital inflow. I suspect what happened was that the Government did not take any of the advice they were given.  They rode roughshod over the Minister for Finance and the Minister himself did not have the courage to stand up to his colleagues and ensure that the position of difficulty he ought to have known would arise would not be worsened and would not be heightened. He budgeted for a higher capital inflow to save the situation whereas, in fact, everybody knew it was likely to be lower.</P>
    <P>In consequence of that decision by <Col N="773" /> the Minister for Finance in his Budget, and of no other decision, we had in the first seven months of this year one of the biggest runs on our external assets reserve since the beginning of the State.  It is part of that, and it follows from that, that we find in the White Paper on the capital programme published last October that the Minister had to revise his estimate of savings for the current year, from small savings and prize bonds, from £10 million down to £6 million, a revision downwards of almost 50 per cent.  He went across to New York to a meeting of the world bank and he came back and told us he was going to get £6 million&mdash;that was the exact figure&mdash;in a loan floated publicly in the United States.</P>
    <P>Everyone, including the Minister, went his own sweet way.  There was no effort and no hurry.  Nobody was exerting himself.  Suddenly, in November, they found they had missed the boat; they were not going to be able to get any loan on the New York market and they took a decision&mdash;a right decision at that time&mdash;that they would not float a loan, which they knew would be a failure, because they did know that, and the underwriters told them that.  They knew the Minister was not going to get the money. That was the right decision to take then.  But it was known to everybody in financial circles in New York, Toronto and elsewhere in the United States that this situation was bound to arise at the end of the year and, even if the Minister was not prepared to take the advice he could get from the financial people at that time, he had it before him in the evidence that was given to him last Autumn by me in another capacity, when it was made clear that we knew it was absolutely vital, if there was to be a foreign loan obtained for development in Ireland, that that loan would have to be put through before the end of November; if it was not put through before the end of November there would be no chance of getting the necessary money.</P>
    <P>We got a move on.  Let me pay generous tribute to certain members of the Government who assisted us to get a move on.  But the Minister did <Col N="774" /> not get a move on and the result was that, when he came to the point of looking for this money at the end of November, he found it was not there and he had perforce to cancel the issue or else have a failure.  It was right for him to cancel it in those circumstances, but it was a shocking dereliction of duty that the proper steps were not taken earlier in the year to ensure he would get in before others in the queue, about whom everybody else seemed to have adequate knowledge except the Minister for Finance.  Possibly he felt that by not pushing that foreign loan he would be able to damp down the demand for public spending.  That could be a reason for it.  It would, I think, be a wrong reason, but it is well known that one of the methods in the past was for the Department of Finance to put things off in the hope that by putting them off the necessity to expend money would not arise.</P>
    <P>Now, because of that failure, instead of getting funds in the public market, as he could have done easily if he had disturbed himself and the Government at the time, he has to draw on our share of the World Bank.  We are told that he is going to draw to the extent of £8 million.  I do not know where that figure of £8 million comes from or why we have got to change from the £6 million he had previously in mind for a public issue. Perhaps, again in that respect, he would like to advise us of the reasons for that change when he comes to conclude this debate.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons may be that there is a lack of saving incentive and savings in other respects are falling back in exactly the same way as savings fell from the point of view of small savings and prize bonds in the period to which I have already referred. We know, of course, that the Minister for Finance had to make a special draw of £20 million on the Central Bank for the purpose of funding different standing Exchequer Bills because there was, amongst other things, a dis-saving in the public subscription for such Bills.  The public were not subscribing to Exchequer Bills in the same way in 1965 as they had been earlier.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="775" /> We have got to realise that, if we are going to have any proper development, we have got to increase the incentives for saving.  There ought to be some new thinking in that respect.  One of the ways in which it could be done, as I indicated on an earlier occasion, is by following the advice given in the Royal Commission Report to the Swedish Government, a Commission which examined exhaustively the possibility of having what they called index loans and which examined the position that arose for people who lend money today to the Swedish Government and found that £100 converted into their currency would buy a certain quantum of goods today, and yet when that £100 was to be repaid 20 years hence by the Swedish Government, because of the natural and growing inflation that exists, instead of buying the same quantum of goods, it would only buy, perhaps, two-thirds of what it could buy at the time the loan was made.</P>
    <P>It has been precisely that diminution in the value of money and the diminution, in consequence, in the worth of gilt-edged securities that has made people so very uneasy and unanxious to invest in gilt-edged securities; therefore the dis-saving incentive has been greater than the saving incentive, the saving incentive we must have if we are to implement a proper programme of modernisation on every front, agricultural as well as industrial.</P>
    <P>The Swedish system which was advocated at length in the Swedish Royal Commission Report was a system which would be linked to what we call our consumer index cost of living.  We have never had any evidence of any thought being given by anyone in the Government to that obvious incentive that there would be for saving. It is not necessary for the Minister for Finance or his Parliamentary Secretary to know Swedish to read that Report, because the Swedes have been obliging enough to give a translation in English to those who want it.</P>
    <P>Another incentive there might be is in relation to something about which people grumble, and grumble justly. In the Daltonian era just after the war when interest rates were forcibly kept <Col N="776" /> low by the late Dr. Dalton as Chancellor of the British Exchequer.  Government funds were issued at very low rates and here the Governments of the day, too, got the benefit of the low rates of interest beyond, and Exchequer Bonds were issued at three per cent or three and a half per cent. Not merely has the value of those Exchequer Bonds, to which money was subscribed, say, 15 years ago, been almost halved but, in addition to that, the effect of the increase in interest rates has meant that even the nominal value of the bonds has gone back from the £100 they subscribed to 82, 84, 85 or 86.  I accept that no Minister for Finance could bring that up by giving additional interest.  That would not be appropriate or proper, but there are ways in which that glaring advertisement for dis-saving which is there all the time could be counteracted to some degree.  One way is that all those stocks would be accepted at par value for death duty purposes; then at least there would always be a market in them that would tend to get them up from the low level at which they are today.  If that were done, it would also have the effect of ensuring that people who had been paid in land bonds of earlier vintage would not see the price they had got for their land whittled away through the land bonds decreasing in value day after day as they do at present.</P>
    <P>There is an obligation on the Government, in honesty to the people whose lands were acquired and who were paid for that land in land bonds, to do something to ensure that the price the people got for their land will not be depreciated in that way.  One way in which that could be done would be to increase their value somewhat by excepting them from death duties in the way I have mentioned.  Another way would be by ensuring that the interest would be paid without deduction of tax, that there would be no deduction of income tax at source. That does not mean that the person who has land bonds would not be liable to pay income tax if he was otherwise liable, but deducting tax at source is undoubtedly a method which knocks several pounds off the value of land bonds.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="777" /> The point of that in relation to this debate is that unless some saving incentives are developed and unless we ensure that the obvious incentives to dis-saving are not there before the community all the time, then we are not going to get the capital we need and which the NIEC accepts we need for the development of our economy.</P>
    <P>We depend substantially on a capital inflow, and yet we had two Fianna Fáil Ministers, the then Deputy Dr. Ryan and Deputy Lynch, by the atmosphere they created in the Finance Acts of 1963 and 1965, doing their damnedest to drive capital out of Ireland instead of trying to entice it in.  I have heard Ministers of the present Government saying in a grandiose way that they did not want capital.  Many of the people who are waiting to be paid grants and loans which are so much in arrear throughout the country would be very glad if the members of the Government took a different line and realised, as members of Governments in other sensible countries realise, that the economy cannot possibly develop, particularly in this modern technological age, unless there is ample capital to do the job that has to be done.</P>
    <P>There is another effect which the wanton disregard of the Minister for Finance in the Budget has had on the private sector of our economy.  There has been, and had to be, a limitation on the extension of bank credit provided by the Central Bank.  I want to make it perfectly clear that I do not challenge in any way the necessity for the Central Bank to issue that directive, but once they have issued that directive that there was only to be a certain amount of credit available for the community this year, then every pound the Minister for Finance avariciously took out of that pool for the public sector meant that the ordinary businessman, the ordinary farmer, had less to get from the banking pool.  That is accepted and acknowledged in the report we are now discussing.  It is not put, naturally enough, in the same brutal way about the Minister for Finance as I have put it, but here is what it says on page 14, and it means exactly the same thing:</P>
    <P>If the Central Bank's advice to <Col N="778" /> the commercial banks regarding the growth of total bank lending had been strictly complied with and had taken immediate effect, loans and advances to the private sector and/or lending to the Government would have been reduced.</P>
    <P>But Government lending expanded substantially and in consequence of that decision by the Government, private lending had to be contracted.  The cause for every decision in relation to the withholding of credit for the development of something worthwhile goes back to the decision taken by the Minister for Finance when introducing his Budget last year.  Of course that Budget had other effects referred to in the annual report of the Central Bank last spring and in which it is stated on page 12:</P>
    <P>The consequent rise in public expenditure, over and above increases planned in the economic programme, necessitates higher taxation and borrowing which tend to exert a further upward pressure on costs and prices.  Inflation thus tends to develop a momentum of its own as the effects on costs and prices of excessive increases in monetary incomes operate against the intended increase in real consumption while rising Government expenditure, designed to eliminate inequalities brought about by price inflation, contributes to the inflationary pressures.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Contributes to the inflationary pressures&rdquo; which this Report states exist and in respect of which this Report suggests certain measures to contain them and to contain what has been caused by the inefficiency and unwise decisions of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>It is of course fairly evident that in relation to an incomes policy, you are not going to get anywhere unless you are going to be able to get a climate of opinion in relation to such a policy which will have it accepted voluntarily. I did not agree with much of what Deputy Dunne said earlier but one thing is quite clear, that is, that you cannot get success in this way merely by legislation and forcing people to do something.  You have got to encourage <Col N="779" /> them; you have got to educate them and show them that it is better for them to do it.</P>
    <P>We come from that naturally enough to industrial relations.  The main secret of successful industrial relations is what could be called communications and by that I mean consultation in the fullest sense of the term: talking to the employees and to the workers as though they were partners in a business rather than talking down to them, bringing them into the picture, asking their advice and taking that advice seriously and doing so at every level.  That is the type of labour management I suggest which would help to avoid inflation and help to create a proper atmosphere for a real incomes policy, which would mean that everyone could grow in his income with national production and assist national productivity.</P>
    <P>We have obviously no cause for complacency about our industrial relations but at the same time it does not do any good to exaggerate what has been lost through a breakdown in industrial relations.  I do not think it is untrue to say that we have probably lost more man days in the past three months through the common cold than from a breakdown in industrial relations, as such.  We must, however, try to remember that the days in which wages settlements affecting any important industry could be dealt with in isolation, away and apart from the welfare of the nation as a whole, are gone altogether and that those settlements in relation to an important industry, if they are in conflict with the basic needs of the economy, will not remain long in the interests of those who are concerned in that industry because they will be swallowed in general economic troubles.</P>
    <P>The other day I came across a few quotations in relation to this question of industrial relations which I think are worth putting on the record.  Here is one:</P>
    <P>Therefore I should say that enlightened management is probably the greatest contributory factor to industrial peace that I know.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="780" />&ldquo;Enlightened management.&rdquo;  Another quotation, and I will give the sources when I am finished, is:</P>
    <P>If managements are to make it clear that they regard relations with their employees as being as important as their other duties, there is no place for what I would describe as the old, authoritarian approach. People on the shop floor are now much better informed.</P>
    <P>Another quotation says:</P>
    <P>. . . the most successful methods of formulating ideas of co-partnership are joint consultations sincerely, widely and wholeheartedly applied.</P>
    <P>And a final quotation says:</P>
    <P>The trade unions are passing through a difficult period.  We are as conservative as anybody else. They are perhaps as conservative as churches.</P>
    <P>The criticism of the trade unions comes from Mr. Ray Gunter, the present Minister of Labour in the English Labour Government in a little pamphlet published by him called &ldquo;The Human Approach to Change in Industry&rdquo;. The quotation dealing with enlightened management is from Lord Robins, the Chairman of the British Coal Board.  The criticism of the old authoritarian approach is made by a former Conservative Minister of Labour, Mr. O'Hare, and the advocacy of joint consultations, sincerely, widely and wholeheartedly applied, is made by the past Chairman of Imperial Chemical Industries, perhaps the biggest business in the world.</P>
    <P>It is at least apposite that in considering this problem, we should consider what leaders across the water are saying in relation to industrial relations there.  In relation to our manpower policy, in relation to what the National Industrial and Economic Council says, we have to get across to everyone, from the top to the bottom and from the bottom to the top, that what we desire is a rational system of growth in incomes for all sections of the community and that it should be a system that will be fair for each section of the community.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="781" /> I wonder whether we are going to get that by the method which exists at the present time and by virtue of which a small section can hold the community as a whole up to ransom. I am not going to go into the rights or wrongs of the dock strike going on at the moment.  I do not know the answer. I do not know who is right or who is wrong.  Mr. Brittain, of Brittains Motors, says that the employers are wrong; others say the union is wrong. I am not competent to make an assessment on that subject but I say it is entirely unfair to the rest of the community that there should be a dispute in one sector that will cause great hardship to a number of sectors not directly concerned.</P>
    <P>Personally I believe that we will have to have some method&mdash;call it a court or arbitration or what you will&mdash; some authoritative method, some authoritative arbitrator who will sit and hear the views of both sides and when he makes a decision, that the employers will be prevented by law from employing people on any basis except under the terms that such an arbitrator has laid down.  One cannot force an employer to keep his business open but if he does open it, he must abide by the arbitrator's decision.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, it is unthinkable, in my view, to suggest that the arbitrator could determine that people must or must not work.  That must be a free decision for the individual to take but it must follow as well that if an arbitrator makes a decision with regard to the terms on which people may be employed, while these people will have the right themselves to decide whether they will be employed on those terms, they should not have the right to prevent other people from carrying on with their work and earning their living.  They should not have the power to upset the economy of the country. What is sauce for the one must be sauce for the other.</P>
    <P>A proper policy in relation to redundancy is necessary.  We will not get the technological improvements in industry that are essential unless there is going to be confidence that if anybody <Col N="782" /> is disemployed as a result of technological advances, there will be redundancy payment for that person. It would be utterly impossible to get any acceptance by the employer side of the need for such a redundancy payment if, when such a redundancy fund is created, that fund is to be diverted from the use for which it is intended into a strike fund.</P>
    <P>It has been reported in the news-papers that this has happened in relation to the dock strike.  I have no knowledge as to whether that is true or not.  I hope it is not true and if it is not true, that it will be strongly contradicted because it is bound to prevent any proper development of a redundancy fund.  So long as the possibility exists that a redundancy fund could be used for another purpose, there is no chance of the vital necessity for such redundancy funds being accepted.</P>
    <P>People sometimes wonder why there is more talk about one type of national income than about another. The statistical reports included in the appendices to the NIEC Report and the National Income and Expenditure Green Paper of 1963 make the situation clear.  In passing, I might remind the Minister for Finance that it seems strange that the last of these was for 1963.  Here we are at the beginning of 1966 and we have got nothing more up to date than that.  I know that in relation to certain tables, particularly Table 4, the Report gives us more up to date information and the information it does give makes it clear why there is this discussion to some extent concentrated on the form of income. I accept that for an incomes policy to be successful it must cover all forms of income.</P>
    <P>Employees' earnings provide about 52 per cent of the national income and the earnings of agricultural workers about 2½ per cent.  Agriculture itself provides about 18 per cent.  The significant things in relation to the redistribution of incomes in recent years have been the fall in the proportion of the earnings of the agricultural community and the fall in those of the middle-class white collar workers.  The agricultural community have only 18 <Col N="783" /> per cent of the national income and I leave it to anybody to calculate where we would be in relation to our whole national income if it were not for those who are employed in agricultural production.</P>
    <P>Trading profits of corporate bodies amount to ten per cent of the national income.  It is impossible to make an accurate computation of the amount paid out in dividends but it is generally assessed at about one-quarter and the remaining threequarters is ploughed back for future capital uses.  At the present time when we have a shortage of capital resources, that plough-back should be increased and there should be further incentives in that regard by way of taxation reliefs.  Other profits are about 11 per cent of the national income and I agree with the suggestion in the Report that there should be more stringent rules in relation to the assessment of professional earnings.</P>
    <P>The body to which I have the honour to belong has made it clear that here must be an audit of a solicitor's books before he can practice as a solicitor.  That is for the purpose of seeing that the returns made are correct.  Page 77 of the Report quotes workers' earnings at 55 per cent, industrial profits at eight per cent, farmers' profits at 23 per cent and some others.  Whether these are justifiable or not depends on where the divergent line is to be found but it does not matter very much what the exact percentages are.  The general picture is one that all of us can see.  It is inevitable with the increase in industry and with the increase in the industrial production that we will all see in the future that we are going to have a need for other methods of making up our national income.</P>
    <P>The Minister would also be well advised to examine the pattern for which he is responsible and which is set out in the <i>Irish Times</i> of 20th January, 1966:</P>
    <P>Ireland was one of the four countries in which workers' purchasing power fell last year, the International Labour Organisation reported yesterday. In the Spring of 1965 real <Col N="784" /> wages were about .2 per cent below the purchasing power of the previous year.  The other three countries were Britain.</P>
    <P>&mdash;with whom we have now gone into complete linkage&mdash;</P>
    <P>Hungary and South Korea.</P>
    <P>It seems to me they are an interesting association.</P>
    <P>I do not think there has been any real realisation, either, in the programme of the Government that, while automation may free men from routine work, it is not going to cut out the human element but rather is going to require that the human element should operate at a more sophisticated and educated level.  Therefore, we should and we must provide more for the education of those who are going to operate automation if they are not going to fall behind in the race.</P>
    <P>I agree with the NIEC Report.  I think it unfortunate that when NIEC was being constituted, it was not constituted as representative of the entire community that it was constituted a National Industrial and Economic Council instead of a National Economic Council.  It was unfortunate it did not include the representatives of our greatest industry, agriculture. It was unfortunate it was not, accordingly, in a pattern in which it could speak for the community as a whole. I agree with this Report and I said before it ever came out that the measures taken by the Minister for Finance this year were wrong.  I wholeheartedly support the motion the Minister has put down in which, in a spirit of hara-kiri, he asks the House to endorse his failure.  The Minister in his person and in his professional life is an honourable man.  If he is an honourable politician, after this motion is passed, after the way this Report condemns him and his Leader, he will resign from that Ministry and let someone else take over after the mess this Report truthfully says he made of the economy in 1965.</P>
    <P>May I apologise to the Minister for having to leave for a press conference? He will read about it in the morning.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I might get the reasons for this debate into proper perspective for the benefit of Deputy Sweetman and other members of his Party who suggested there was something nefarious about the manner in which the motion was put down.  The NIEC Report was published in November, very shortly before the Christmas recess.  It was immediately referred to by the Government in general commendatory terms.  That was published, as was also an intimation that the Government proposed to have the Report examined closely in the various Departments and commented upon in due course.  I suggest the examination of that Report in the various Departments was impressively expeditious. The Report having been examined, the comments of the Departments were co-ordinated and the Government met shortly before the Dáil resumed and decided that their comments on the Report should be published. That, I think, was the usual practice.  It was easy for Fine Gael, not having any responsibility in the matter, as soon as the Report was published to put down a motion in the terms in which they did.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government, having decided to make their public comment on it, next thought in what fashion would it be best that that comment be got across to the public.  Having intimated to Fine Gael that the motion they had put down in connection with the Report could be debated in Government time, the Government themselves, as they were perfectly entitled <Col N="786" /> to do, decided to put down a substantive motion which could be discussed as the main motion and in connection with which the Fine Gael motion could be discussed.  I do not think there was anything wrong with that. There was certainly no intention whatever of keeping Fine Gael out of the debate.  On the contrary, there was no limit put to the extent of the debate, even though Fine Gael themselves were desirous of concluding it on last Thursday evening.</P>
    <P>I think the Government were right in making that decision and ensuring, first, that the Report would have the widest possible comment from Deputies representing all Parties who have an interest in it and, secondly, ensuring that not only would the public get a full resumé of the Report but a reasonable breakdown of its recommendations, as interpreted not only by the Government but by the Opposition Parties as well.  I suggest there is no cause for complaint whatever on the part of Fine Gael in respect of the Government motion put down in conjunction with their own.  They were given every opportunity to debate the Report and comment upon it.</P>
    <P>The debate has lasted quite a while. Therefore, it is not my intention to traverse again the ground that has been covered.  It is at this point I am sorry that Deputy Sweetman's press conference, at which he is going to announce this young Presidential candidate, has taken him away from the House, because I have a few things to say to him.  He comes in here with his usual brash arrogance and alleges incompetency all around, incompetency amongst every member of the Government, and preens himself like the peacock who knew everything.  I forget what bird has his plumes in his tail, but that is what Deputy Sweetman reminds me of.</P>
    <P>He said that I, as Minister for Finance, and the Government generally, had mishandled the situation and that this Report is a condemnation of the Government in their handling of the current economic situation.  Deputy Sweetman was Minister for Finance for roughly four times as long as I have been Minister for Finance.  He was <Col N="787" /> Minister for Finance during the years 1954 to 1957 when the national economy ground slowly to stagnation, when our capital commitments in respect of expenditure on hospitals and housing were incapable of being met out of Government resources or out of resources within the procurement of the Government.  He was Minister for Finance when our unemployment and emigration figures reached an all-time high.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I remember that, in the closing months of 1956 and early 1957 of the inter-Party Government régime, the weekly unemployment figures were quoted in the returns at 94,000, 95,000, 96,000.  Whether there was incompetency or mishandling of the situation at that time, I shall leave it to the country to judge.  Inept steps were taken by the inter-Party Government at the time, steps not only inept but taken too late to correct that situation.  Instead of staying in power and facing up to the situation, that Government disintegrated and they ran out of office.  Much the same thing has happened now.  Our capital commitments have outrun our capital resources and other ills have affected the economy but we, as a Government, are facing up to the situation.  We believe we have tackled the problem in time. We are staying in office to ensure that the situation will be corrected, and corrected by us, and, to the extent that we have responsibility for it, we are facing up to it&mdash;unlike Deputy Sweetman and his colleagues in the spring of 1957.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman feels that if he comes in here and shouts loudly enough about his own ability and capacity in financial matters, and about the ineptness of others, he will get people to believe him but the proof of any pudding is in the eating.  The proof of policies is in performance and the proof of the extent to which a situation has been mishandled is the extent to which those against whom allegations of mishandling have been made will stand up to the situation and correct it. That is what we are doing and that is <Col N="788" /> what Deputy Sweetman and his colleagues not only neglected to do but were fearful of doing and ran out of office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been listening to the brash arrogance of Deputy Sweetman for about one and a half <Col N="789" /> hours and Deputy Fitzpatrick was here for some of the time.  I sat down and took my medicine.  I hope Deputy Fitzpatrick is able to do so too but if he wants to interrupt me, then, so long as they are interruptions <i>ad rem,</i> I shall pick him up.  Fine Gael ignored the extent to which there was international comment on an incomes policy for the past four or five years.  They ignored, too, that in the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> there was specific reference to an incomes policy.  I will refer them to Part I of the <i>Second Programme</i> issued in August, 1963, which, I think, was even earlier than Deputy Sweetman claimed for himself his ideas about an incomes policy.  The following statement appears in Chapter I, Paragraph 12, of the <i>Second Programme.</i></P>
      <P>A sound relationship between rising production and incomes is of central importance in maintaining and improving competitiveness and in ensuring that economic growth proceeds steadily.</P>
      <P>In Chapter III, Paragraph 105, it goes on to state:</P>
      <P>It is essential that there should be widespread public acceptance of the need for a sound incomes policy, and full co-operation between the Government and sectional interests in carrying it out.  Such a policy requires that the increase in <i>all</i> types of income&mdash;wages, salaries, profits and rents&mdash;should not exceed the realised increase in national production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not obvious, therefore, that it is easy for this Government, who were responsible for the publication of the <i>Second Programme</i> and for everything that appeared in it, to accept what was advocated by the NIEC in their Report about an incomes policy? I am not suggesting that an incomes policy is something that is easy of evolution.  Everybody knows well the difficulties &mdash; indeed, Deputy Dunne referred to them here an hour or so ago&mdash;of evolving an incomes policy that will embrace all types of income including that of farmers and of professional people.  It will take time and everybody realises it must take time. <Col N="790" /> It will be difficult to set down hard and fast rules about an incomes policy in relation to profits as well as to these other things.</P>
    <P>Some of the Deputies, including Deputy Dillon, made reference to increases in profits in industrial firms and by the banks.  I hold no brief for the banks&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <P>And increased distribution of dividend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to debate this now because it would take a long time and there will be an early opportunity to debate this in more detail but I should like to remind the House that the NIEC, this tripartite body, had something to say about profits. It said, and I quote from Paragraph 58-59 of the Report:</P>
      <P>Profits earned depend on a wide range of factors such as the amount of capital employed, the volume of sales, the efficiency of management in anticipating changes in market trends, and so on.  Because profit is the residual that emerges when total costs are deducted from sales proceeds, the level of profits cannot be predetermined . . .</P>
      <P>This is the important point to remember about it.</P>
      <P>. . . Even if control of profits were desirable&mdash;and this is not the case where they are earned competitively, for example, from exporting&mdash;such control could not be operated in advance but only in arrears, after the profits had been earned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I made it quite clear in my opening remarks in this debate that the Government recognise the undesirability of increases in profits and other non-wage incomes which are not justified by increased output, by enterprise or investment and, therefore, not being so represented, do not show a real contribution to national production.  I went on to say how excessive profits could be prevented, mentioning, first, effective competition which would be intensified by the reduction of tariffs as envisaged in the Free Trade Area Agreement and also by the enlargement <Col N="791" /> of quotas.  I then went on to mention the powers of price surveillance and control exercised by the Free Trade Commission, and, finally, expressing acceptance of the NIEC recommendation that if excessive profits still appeared in spite of competition and controls the Government would consider other measures to offset them.  These other measures would, of course, include taxation.</P>
    <P>The suggestion has been made, and perhaps very rightly so, both inside and outside the House, that an incomes policy is not possible of being evolved without a manpower policy. An orderly approach to the development of wages and salaries should be seen in the context of the Government policy in relation to workers generally. I do not think that there will be any question about the Government's desire and efforts to improve the status of workers.  The record of successive Fianna Fáil Governments in this respect ever since the Conditions of Employment Act in the early thirties, the first of its kind in Europe, is standing proof of that desire.</P>
    <P>To come to more recent times, in 1965, last year, a major step towards this end of improving the lot of the workers was taken in the establishment of the National Manpower Agency and of the Manpower Advisory Committee to assist the Agency in its work.  The Industrial Training Bill, 1965, which proposes to establish this new authority, with wide powers in regard to industrial training and retraining, was introduced recently in Dáil Éireann and will be circulated early during this session. A draft scheme for redundancy payments and resettlement allowances has been prepared and discussions on this scheme commenced with the employers' and workers' organisations earlier this year.</P>
    <P>These are only some of the measures which have been and are being taken by the Government for the benefit of workers.  The planned development of incomes must be seen alongside them. It involves no attempt whatever to deprive workers of what is due to them. Rather, it is an essential factor in <Col N="792" /> securing their wellbeing and their prosperity.</P>
    <P>From some of the comments that have been made in the debate and, indeed, by some Opposition Deputies outside the House in recent days, one would think that the Government were joining in some kind of bargaining about the rate of wage and other income increases in 1966.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions, in their statement which was published last Saturday, stated that they rejected outright as completely unrealistic any suggestion that increases for their members during the present year should be limited to three per cent.  I want to make it quite clear that I made no offer in this respect that could be either accepted or rejected.  I stated the simple but highly relevant fact that wage, salary and other income increases in 1966 cannot go beyond the expected rate of increase in national output without very damaging consequences. This, I think, is realism and it would be most irresponsible for me or for anybody else to pretend or to act otherwise. I gave it as the Government's expectation in the light of provisional assessments that the rate of increase in national output in 1966 would be about three per cent.  If this is not accepted as a realistic assessment, then let us all wait for the next report of the NIEC, on which Council, I should like to remind the House again, employers and trade unions are represented as well as the Government.  The NIEC will examine the prospects fully and will in the next few weeks be pronouncing on these prospects.</P>
    <P>It is possible that the figure of three per cent growth in national production which I mentioned will be revised upwards or downwards.  We can be absolutely sure, however, that, whatever the final forecast is, it will not be significantly above three per cent.  It may even reach four per cent.  I think a forecast of five per cent would be completely out of the question.</P>
    <P>I do not want to engage in a dialogue with trade union leaders about what the rate of increase should be but the General President of the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union yesterday, as reported in today's newspapers, <Col N="793" /> made a statement that I find it very difficult to reconcile with what I said.  I quote from the <i>Irish Independent,</i> front page, for Wednesday, 2nd February.  The General President of the ITGWU is reported here as having said:</P>
    <P>The proposal of the Minister for Finance of wage adjustments based on an increase of six-tenths of a penny would not improve the position of low paid workers, was unjust and would not be accepted, he said.</P>
    <P>I do not know where this figure of six-tenths of a penny came from.  I am trying to work out in my own mind as to how it emerged.  Of course, six-tenths of a penny has no relevance to the three per cent possible growth that I referred to.  I can only conclude that this six-tenths of a penny was worked out on the basis that it was three per cent of the suggested £1 increase, which is the wrong premise.  But, three per cent of £1 is much more than six-tenths of a penny.  Three per cent of 20 pennies happens to be six-tenths of a penny.  So that, to make this six-tenths of a penny relevant one would have to contemplate a weekly wage packet of 20 pennies, or 1/8d.  I thought it only right to mention that &mdash;I may have misunderstood what was intended&mdash;in case it got abroad that I was suggesting an increase of six-tenths of a penny on the ordinary workers' incomes, which would be completely unfounded.</P>

      <P>I should not like it to get abroad that I in some way suggested an increase on the basis of six-tenths <Col N="794" /> of a penny, which is clearly stated in the report of what the General President said.</P>
      <P>Far from sanctioning a general increase of three per cent in incomes, I made the point, and I was well aware that it would be unpalatable and unpopular, that expansion of exports, expansion of employment, stability of prices and a safer balance of payments would be more certain to come if there were little or no general increase in incomes this year. Even if it is unpalatable, even if it is unpopular, it is nonetheless true.  I recognise, however, that the lower-paid employees deserve special consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me a perfectly reasonable proposition.  I think it is justifiable and I hope it will receive the earnest consideration of those involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mentioned in my opening speech that over the years 1964 and 1965 money incomes in general had gone up by 20 per cent whereas national production had gone up by only 6½ per cent and I suggested then, and I think it is not to be gainsaid, that this was one of the main causes of our economic difficulties.  Many employees had, of course, a greater increase than the 12 per cent ninth round.  I think it is only fair to say that I am referring not alone to public servants but to other employees as well.  In this connection, too, I should like to say that the increases given to public servants were granted as a result of <Col N="795" /> arbitration awards or were based on arbitration awards.  Other groups of employees, as I have said, did just as well.</P>
    <P>Many companies also seem to have enjoyed a rise in profits greater than is easily attributable to any of the legitimate factors I mentioned last week, such as greater investment, higher sales or increased managerial efficiency.  For a sizeable sector of the economy, therefore, it would seem to involve no great sacrifice if people were to rest content with the present rates of income during 1966.  I do not think it would be asking too much on the part of those who have enjoyed these considerable increases to accept this degree of restraint for the country's benefit particularly&mdash;I say particularly advisedly&mdash;because prices have been nearly static since last May.  Indeed there are cases in which the members of the community generally could be given, without serious impairment of profit-earning capacity, the relief of a reduction in prices, or some other form of better value for their money. This is why I refer particularly to the position of lower-paid workers.  In this context, when I referred to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions recommendation, I said, and this is true, that, if their suggested £1 per week ceiling were to become the general rate of increase for all employees, it would represent an aggregate increase in the wage and salary mill of about 7½ per cent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The Report states specifically that wage and salary increases should be within the expected rate of increase in national production. This Report was signed by eminent trade unionists.  I am repeating the advice they have given to the Government as the means whereby the state of the economy can be improved.  I said that, if £1 became the standard all round, that would mean in effect an increase of 7½ per cent which, as I said last week, would be about double what the economy could afford as far as present indications show.  There have been some criticisms of this 7½ per cent estimate, that this percentage overstates the increase in money incomes which would result in the adoption of the recommendation of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to give the House an indication as to how I arrive at the 7½ per cent.  The calculation is really very simple.  There are at present about 660,000 wage and salary earners and they are paid about £460,000,000 in all.  One pound per week for everyone would cost an extra £34 million or 7½ per cent of this £460 million gross wage bill.  I realise, of course, that the Irish Congress of Trade Unions recommendation does not call for £1 increase for everybody.  I made that very clear last week, but I am concerned to draw attention to the limitations which any such indefinite recommendation must run up against in its practical application.  There are already some suggestions that claims now being formulated will seek the full £1 a week increase.  The cost to the <Col N="797" /> economy of implementing the Congress's recommendation would, of course, be much less than 7½ per cent if the increase were limited to trade unionists represented in the various unions.  I think they, in fact, represent about half of all employees.  I am sure that Congress did not have in mind that the increase should be limited in this way.</P>
    <P>The actual increase which should be given in particular cases would, of course, depend on the extent to which the special position of lower paid workers was recognised by giving them a higher than average increase.  Since the total increase in money incomes would have to be kept within this limit of three per cent, and if price stability and competitiveness were to be ensured, this recognition of the special position of lower paid workers would have to be accompanied by a lower than average increase for other workers.  The question arises then as to who are the lower paid workers.  This and other questions would have to be clarified by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions before any assessment could be made of the possibilities which could be considered within the overall national growth rate this year.</P>
    <P>I hope that there can be negotiations on all these between unions and employers. The Government, as the Taoiseach said last week, are willing to participate, if this would help.  Already an invitation has been sent to the Federated Union of Employers who promptly answered the invitation to come and meet the Taoiseach on Friday.  I understand that a similar invitation is being sent to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to come, I think, on Monday next.  I hope it will be possible to get the employers and trade unionists together again to see if, first, they can work out a reasonable increase and, secondly, to see if some other arrangement can be come to that would have regard to the lower paid workers.</P>
    <P>However, the restraint on income increases this year, no matter how important, is not of itself enough.  The NIEC Report rightly referred to the over-rapid increase which had occurred in credit and in public <Col N="798" /> expenditure.  The restraint on credit expansion, which was introduced last year by the Central Bank, must of course be continued.  Indeed spending on credit in relation to the intended use of internal and external resources must henceforth be an integral part of our national policy.  Bringing public expenditure more closely into line with the trend in national production is my special responsibility as Minister for Finance and one I intend to face up to.</P>
    <P>Over the past few months, I have devoted much of my time to ensuring that public expenditure will be kept within the limits of what we can afford on both current and capital accounts. In the Budget which I hope to introduce within the next few weeks, probably early in March, there will be no need to go into any great detail about our financial and economic situation. The NIEC Report and other reports and the long discussions we have had in the Dáil have made the position reasonably clear.  It will be my responsibility to slow down current expenditure. The main idea is that current expenditure will be paid out of current revenue even if that means increasing taxation to cover the existing deficit and therefore it may mean a postponement of new commitments.</P>
    <P>I also have to hold down capital expenditure to a level that can continue to be met out of domestic savings supplemented by external capital. I must take some of the inflationary tendency out of public expenditure in order to reduce the balance of payments deficit to a tolerable size.  This will be neither easy nor popular but Government policy must be aimed at the long-term national interest.</P>

      <P>As far as I can judge, the resources available to us from national sources, from national loans, small savings and other means will amount to about £75 million.  That will mean seeking about £25 million from external resources, making it up to £100 million.  We cannot allow our capital commitments to go beyond this figure which is reasonably realisable <Col N="799" /> and at which it would be prudent to hold down capital expenditure.</P>
      <P>I might say in connection with Deputy Sweetman's suggestion about encouraging increased savings that in so far as he has put forward some new ideas and, perhaps, some old ideas, they are all welcome.  He mentioned the index tied loans which he said were a means whereby interest rates could fluctuate with the cost-of-living index. That has been tried in other countries. It originated, I think, in Sweden and was adopted in other countries like France, Switzerland and Israel but I do not know if they are now too happy with it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cosgrave mentioned a decline in building activities.  I would like to give the House some figures to indicate whether or not there has been such a decline.  Building and construction accounted for more than one-third of our total capital expenditure for this year, last year and for recent years. It has increased spectacularly in the past six or seven years, from the figure of £13.22 million in 1960-61 to £33.40 million in the current year.  That is a very close estimate of what our public capital programme on building and construction will cost in the current year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give the Deputy the breakdown of that.  Of course it takes account of hospitals and schools. In the forecast for next year, that figure will be still further increased by about £1 million.  So far as it has relation to housing and sanitary services, I cannot give the breakdown between these two heads but the expenditure on them rose from £10.87 million in 1960-61 to £23.70 million in 1965-66.  That figure will be further increased in the coming year by upwards of £1 million.  It will be clear to the House that building activities on the basis of last year and on the basis of expenditure will be maintained at least at that level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave and one other Fine Gael Deputy had some trenchant things to say about the Building Advisory Council.  He suggested that they were <Col N="800" /> not representative of the building industry and that they were hand-picked. I was to some extent responsible for the setting-up of this Council and I tried to ensure that it would be truly representative of the building industry.  It comprised a quantity surveyor, and others representing the building professions, a number of builders who were familiar with the whole building industry, four or five trade union officials who had particular knowledge of the building trade, most of them officials of trade unions attached to the building industry, and four or five civil servants whose duties made them peculiarly suitable for this particular task.</P>
    <P>There were representatives from the Department of Local Government, the Department of Industry and Commerce, the Department of Finance, and representatives of the vocational schools in Dublin who are well known for their knowledge of the building trade.</P>
    <P>So much for the suggestions that the Council was not representative of the building industry.  I suggest it was and that it was as widely representative as a working council could reasonably be. I want to emphasise also that this Council had very many meetings, that the directors of it&mdash;they were called directors&mdash;were all very busy men and gave of their time and experience without any remuneration whatever.  Since their terms of reference included the assessment of what building activity was going on, what skills and man-power were available, they sought to make a full appraisal of building starts and levels of activity.  They found that the Central Statistics Office did not have sufficient information available to enable them to do their job thoroughly and they immediately sought to establish their own intelligence unit for the purpose of getting information. Unfortunately they did not have sufficient staff, and have not yet succeeded in getting sufficient staff, to enable them to carry out a thorough appraisal.  I might say that there has been operating a number of organisations and bodies within the public service generally under the aegis <Col N="801" /> of a number of departments engaged on somewhat similar tasks.  In order to ensure the avoidance of overlapping and the maximum return for the efforts of these bodies it has now been decided to bring the Building Advisory Council within the purview of the Minister for Local Government so that the various other agencies he employs within his Department will co-ordinate their work with the Building Advisory Council and so ensure maximum return for their work and the minimum of overlapping.</P>
    <P>That was by way of diversion because of Deputy Cosgrave's reference to the Building Advisory Council and the suggestions that expenditure on building activities was falling off.  I think I have demonstrated that, on the contrary, it is being increased.  The present economic and financial situation, to return to it again, is one which shows signs of overstrain.  All efforts must be directed towards relieving this strain to whatever extent is possible. Temporarily at least until production catches up, any income or expenditure increase will have the effect of adding to this strain.  To put on undue pressure through excessive increases in personal incomes or in public expenditure would be very serious, if not disastrous, in present circumstances.</P>
    <P>Last week when I was discussing the effect of a too big increase in incomes this year I referred, as did the NIEC Report, to the need for the Government in such circumstances to do everything possible to control these ill-effects by fiscal and monetary measures.  I do not think, however, that we ought to mislead ourselves.  What fiscal and monetary measures mean is putting on taxes to try to absorb the extra purchasing power and to have tighter credit restrictions.  Again, this is not my own creation.  I should like to remind the House that this is what the NIEC Report recommended.  How far you can carry this out&mdash;proceed with higher fiscal and monetary controls and tighter credit restrictions&mdash; without causing incalculable harm to new investment, to production or to employment is something we can easily answer, and we want to avoid this if at all possible.  Nobody should <Col N="802" /> think of these as remedies.  At best they can only be drastic remedies and things that would have to be done and done most regrettably to prevent worse befalling us.  They are therefore things which should be avoided by avoiding the occasions for their introduction.  I think we can do that by taking sensible decisions now and sticking to them.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is necessary to spend any further time analysing the current economic situation.  It has been done very exhaustively and objectively in this debate although some members of the Opposition were having regard to their own briefs.  It was done most admirably by the NIEC.  We should now cease raking over the coals of past dissensions, giving expression to resentments, frustrations and jealousies and do the things necessary to get the economy moving forward again, moving forward at a brisk and steady rate. Only in this way can we be seen to manage our affairs well and, having been seen to manage our affairs well, to continue to enjoy the confidence of our people and of our investors whether they come from home or abroad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Chair for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  The subject matter of the question is not only of importance to Dublin but of national importance.  It could have serious effects for one of our main export industries.  In view of the events that led up to the situation which now obtains in regard to the export of meat to continental countries, it is very important that the full facts in relation to this matter be made known.</P>
      <P>Dublin Corporation Abattoir, as the Minister said today, is the municipal abattoir.  I suppose it could be argued technically that its primary responsibility is killing for the local trade, but the fact is that quite an extensive export trade has been carried on since at least 1943 by a number of individual private firms engaged in the export trade of dead meat and that the Minister's Department is the sole authority for the export of dead meat.  There has been an attempt by the Minister to lay the blame for the situation that has now developed on Dublin Corporation. It is not possible for the Minister to exonerate himself from responsibility for the creation of this very serious situation.</P>
      <P>There are in the abattoir, as there are in every abattoir or slaughterhouse that exports meat, permanently situated representatives of the Department of Agriculture, veterinary surgeons who are the sole authority on hygiene, equipment, containers, every conceivable aspect of the export trade, and these veterinary surgeons are employed directly by the Minister's Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 26th June, 1964, a directive was issued by the EEC countries that they intended to introduce very stringent measures of hygiene on countries from which they were importing dead meat, and one would imagine it would be safe to assume that the Minister and his Department who are responsible for the whole of the dead meat export trade would keep themselves fully informed as to all the developments and trends that could in any way affect this most important export trade.  The fact <Col N="804" /> remains&mdash;and the Minister, in his reply to my question today, has stated&mdash;that on 15th June, 1965, a relatively minor official of his Department was in the abattoir and inspected it.  He held a conversation&mdash;note, &ldquo;a conversation&rdquo;&mdash;with a relatively minor official of the corporation to the effect that these new EEC regulations might affect us.  That is what the Minister has stated in this House; that is the concern he showed for a major industry in this country, that an informal conversation took place, on the Minister's admission, 12 months after this directive was issued by the EEC countries.</P>
    <P>A proper question to ask at this point would be : Is this what one would expect from a man who holds a position of major importance in this country, from a man who is responsible for the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, that 12 months after a directive was issued by the EEC countries a conversation should take place between the corporation, at junior level, and an official of his Department? The Minister also stated that in 1964 he communicated with the City Manager.  I am stating here tonight, in public, that the only communication received as regards conditions in the corporation abattoir in 1964 was in connection with the French trade.  It specified four items that it was necessary to improve, and they were complied with immediately by Dublin Corporation.  Now it is beginning to emerge where the responsibility lies. After this conversation in June, 1965, the next time we hear from the Minister's Department is on 10th September, 1965.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>On 10th September, 1965, a communication was received <Col N="805" /> from the Minister's Department to the effect that as from 2nd October, 1965, no export of meat to the Netherlands could take place from the corporation abattoir: three weeks' notice.  The Minister issued his ultimatum that, unfortunately&mdash;due to his neglect or incompetence&mdash;here was a trade that was going to cease in three weeks' time.</P>
      <P>The next communication received was dated 14th October, 1965, and told exporters and the City Manager how serious the situation was.  Apparently it became serious in the Minister's mind only in a matter of days. He went on to list 23 points with which it was necessary for the corporation to comply.  Again the corporation and the exporters in the abattoir got only three weeks within which to comply with these requirements, although some of the items listed by the Department involved major structural alterations.  The Minister gave us an ultimatum to have it done in three weeks.</P>
      <P>In his reply to-day, the Minister indicated that this was not a serious matter at all.  He asked what was all the fuss about.  He went into percentages. He tried by his acrobatics to dismiss the whole thing as not really worth worrying about.  I was on a deputation to the Minister with exporters and other people concerned last Friday week.  If the Minister is honest enough, he will agree with me that he said at that deputation that, while the continental trade was gone, it was most likely the United Kingdom trade would be gone as far as that abattoir was concerned within three months.</P>

      <P>If you think you will obscure the truth by your interruptions, I am sorry because you will be disappointed.  On January 4th 1966, a further letter was received from his Department.  This stopped all exports from the abattoir, with the exception of those for the United Kingdom.  I wonder what motivated the Minister? He stated in the House today that only one of the EEC countries stipulated that they wanted a list of where the exports were coming from.  The Minister said his Department was responsible for issuing certificates saying that all these requirements were met.  The Minister's Department have been responsible for issuing these certificates since the export trade started from this country.  How did things become so suddenly drastic on 4th January and why did the Minister on his own initiative stop exports to all destinations other than the United Kingdom? He had not been asked to.  He had been asked by only one country for a list of the slaughter-houses for sheep.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister must surely be aware that the standards of hygiene in the EEC countries are no better than ours. In fact, in some of them they are not as high.  The Minister must be aware <Col N="808" /> that, while the EEC countries are insisting on these standards, as they are entitled to do, they do not necessarily maintain them at home.  It is not a question of do as I do, but a question of do as I say.  Although the directive was issued by the EEC countries in June 1964, no action of any kind, either verbal or written, was taken by the Minister and his Department to convey the seriousness of the situation to Dublin Corporation Abattoir.  The first action taken by the Minister on his own statement was a conversation 12 months after the directive was issued, and the first written communication concerning the EEC countries received from the Minister's Department came 15 months after the directive was first issued.</P>
    <P>As a result of the neglect of the Minister, the repercussions of that neglect on the livelihood of several hundred people and the serious effects it could possibly have on the whole dead meat export trade, there is only one honourable thing for the Minister to do, that is, to tender his resignation. It is quite obvious&mdash;and I am sure it will be quite obvious to the people of the country&mdash;that a man who would allow, through neglect or incompetence, a situation to develop such as the Minister allowed to develop in the abattoir and the effect it has had on the dead meat trade, is a man who is not by any stretch of the imagination a competent person to deal with so responsible a Vote.

He is, after all, an official, I think, of a trade union which caters for workers in the Dublin abattoir.  He is a member of Dublin Corporation which owns and is responsible for the Dublin Corporation Abattoir.  Surely, in this dual capacity, he might have been expected to take some action at some time about the <Col N="809" /> conditions in the Dublin Corporation Abattoir?  It could well be that now, having been found out as neglecting his duty in both these capacities, he is endeavouring, as unscrupulously as he can, and by a complete distortion of the facts, to foist the blame for this unfortunate situation on to me.</P>

      <P>I quoted today, and I mention again as conclusive proof of the fact that these discussions were taking place, that Dublin Corporation themselves on two occasions submitted to my Department plans for a new sheep slaughterhouse at the abattoir.</P>

      <P>Since the export trade in sheep and lamb began to grow to sizeable proportions in the middle of the 1950s, we have been pressing Dublin Corporation to do something about this.  I am not responsible for Dublin Corporation Abattoir.  The provision of facilities in Dublin Corporation Abattoir is solely a matter, entirely a matter, for Dublin Corporation.  My job was to try to persuade, in so far as I could, Dublin Corporation to provide the necessary and adequate facilities there. I could only try to do that by persuasion. I had no powers to compel Dublin Corporation to do it.  The only power I had was the ultimate power of withdrawing sanction for export if they did not comply&mdash;and eventually I was forced to do that.  A point was made today by Deputy Sweetman about the EEC regulations.  The position with regard to them was that they were published in Brussels on 26th June, 1964.  They were approved by the Council of Ministers on 28th June, 1964, and they were officially gazetted by the EEC in Brussels on 29th June, 1964.  We received them as soon as we could after that.  The original text was in French.  They are quite complicated and their translation from French took a considerable time because of the technical nature&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  We, subsequently, having translated them, had to submit them to very careful veterinary and technical examination here to see precisely what was involved from our point of view.  By the time all this was done, the earliest we were able to publish them to the exporters here was in December, 1964, six months approximately after their publication in Brussels but six months before they were expressed to come into operation in the EEC countries.  We published them to all exporters of meat in this country including those private persons who use the facilities of the Dublin Corporation Abattoir for the export of meat.</P>
      <P>Subsequent to the publication of regulations to the exporters&mdash;and, as far as we were concerned, we were entitled to regard their publication to the exporters as discharging our duty in the matter&mdash;but, subsequent to that and prior to their coming into operation in July, 1965, the veterinary officers of my Department visited the abattoir and reported on the position there.  They reported that, on the coming into operation of these new regulations, the facilities for the export of meat to the EEC countries would almost certainly have to be withdrawn. As a result of that inspection, we arranged for a meeting between the representatives of the Department and of the corporation on 15th June, 1965.</P>

      <P>All the time, there was the normal pressure by us on Dublin Corporation to improve their facilities.  On 6th July, the Parliamentary Secretary of my Department wrote to the City Manager expressing concern at the conditions in the abattoir and asking when it was intended to go ahead with the new sheep slaughterhouse. On 19th July, the Assistant Manager replied that it was intended to go ahead with the sheep slaughterhouse as early as possible.  In the light of these simple facts alone&mdash;and there are many other items of correspondence and notes of meetings&mdash;how, in regard to these simple facts that I have given there, can Deputy Cluskey say we were not pressing in every way we could for the provision of adequate facilities in the abattoir?</P>
