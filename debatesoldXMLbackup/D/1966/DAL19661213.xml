      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach (for the Minister for External Affairs)</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the Deputy's question is in the negative.</P>
      <P>In August last Zambian officials interviewed some retired and serving members of the Garda Síochána and officers of the Defence Forces who might be interested in taking up posts in the Zambian police force after relinquishing their Irish appointments. While the offer of appointments is a matter between the Zambian authorities and the individuals concerned, I understand that some of those interviewed have recently been offered posts in the Zambian police force.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>Pending receipt of the report of an expert working party set up by FAO on official control of pesticides used in agriculture, I feel that it would be better not to come to final conclusions at this stage.  It is hoped that the report will become available in the near future, and I will then pursue consultation with Comhairle na Nimheanna, as required under the Poisons Act, 1961, on the question of what action should be taken.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he is aware that on a recent occasion in Ballina, County Mayo, residents were not warned in time about the cutting off of water supplies in the town with the result that in one case a boiler blew up in a house; what regulations cover the issue of warnings by local authorities where water supplies are to be cut off; and what steps are taken to ensure the carrying out of such regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Boland) Kevin Boland">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by Ballina Urban District Council that when a major break in the mains occurred in the town recently, which necessitated <Col N="227" /> the carrying out of immediate repairs, householders in the area were warned by means of a loudspeaker from a vehicle that the water supply was being cut off temporarily.  No report was received by the local authority that a boiler had burst.  Sanitary authorities have no statutory obligation to notify householders in advance when they propose to cut off water supplies.  It is, however, their normal practice to give prior notice to persons affected. The procedure varies from area to area.  Consumers may be informed verbally, by notice in the public press, by letter, or by loudspeaker, as in the present instance, in emergency conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasOHara" hpid="Mr. O'Hara Mr. O'Hara">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the supply to Ballina town is wholly inadequate for present needs and will he take the necessary steps to ensure that an adequate supply is made available?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that there is a likelihood of damage being caused, does the Minister not think there ought to be an obligation upon the local authority to notify consumers of the cutting off of water supplies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there could be any definite obligation.  In the case of an emergency &mdash; where repairs have to be carried out very urgently &mdash; it would be unreasonable to expect the local authority to wait until it was possible to notify each individual consumer personally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>What redress has a consumer who suffers against the local authority?</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>In this case the local authority did what it was reasonable to do, since it was an emergency and the repairs had to be carried out immediately.  I do not know that they have any redress.</P>

      <P>Homeless persons are provided with housing accommodation by Dublin Corporation on varying conditions according to the categories into which they fall.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the responsibility of the health authority to provide shelter for persons who are unable to provide it for themselves, and premises are maintained by them for this purpose.  Applications to the corporation from such persons for <Col N="229" /> rehousing are dealt with on the basis of the housing conditions of these persons immediately before they entered the shelter provided by the health authority.  Families in such shelters who were in a category equivalent to five persons in one room are being offered rehousing by the corporation at present.</P>
    <P>Families evicted from existing accommodation in the city through no fault of their own are considered as a priority class on the basis of their family sizes.  In such cases, families equivalent to the four persons in one room category are being offered housing accommodation at present.</P>
    <P>Homeless families coming into the city who are seeking housing accommodation are rehoused subject to certain conditions regarding residence.</P>

      <P>There is no fixed weekly working roster for an Irish soldier serving with the United Nations Force in Cyprus. Local circumstances at any particular time dictate the duty conditions of personnel serving there.</P>
      <P>The annual leave regulations prescribed in Defence Force Regulations apply to military personnel whether serving at home or in Cyprus.

I do not know what the facts are, but surely the Minister would have an interest, and a legitimate interest, to see that the United Nations commander in Cyprus treated all the troops under his command on the basis of equality?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>All the troops in Cyprus, all the troops of all nations contributing there, are under the United Nations commander, and local circumstances &mdash; and by &ldquo;local circumstances&rdquo;, I mean the circumstances in the districts in which troops are stationed &mdash; determine the working conditions of the troops in that particular local area.

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if, further to a reply of 27th October on the subject of post office temporary clerks, in which the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs stated <Col N="235" /> that the question of holding a confined competition to afford temporary clerks an opportunity of securing established appointments is a matter for decision by the Minister for Finance, he will now arrange for the holding of such a confined competition for these clerks.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Haughey) Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of holding a confined competition in this particular instance is a matter appropriate for discussion under the agreed scheme of conciliation and arbitration for the Civil Service.</P>
      <P>The general principles governing the grant of established status to unestablished officers have been covered in an agreed recommendation made under the scheme by the General Council and accepted by one of my predecessors. One of these principles is that officers, to be given the opportunity of obtaining established status, should have served satisfactorily for a specified minimum period which should normally be not less than three years.  The temporary clerks referred to in the question were recruited in 1965 and 1966 on a purely temporary basis and they were so informed at the time of recruitment.  In these circumstances I do not consider that the holding of a confined competition would be warranted.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Under section 59 of the Civil Liability Act, 1961, the Minister for Finance has legal liability for the negligent use of mechanically propelled vehicles belonging to the State. He has agreements with virtually all the insurance companies doing motor insurance business in Ireland and with some large bodies who carry their own insurance, such as Córas Iompair Éireann.  Under these agreements, claims for damage to property resulting from accidents involving Stateowned <Col N="236" /> vehicles and an insured vehicle are settled, irrespective of the incidence of negligence without resort to court proceedings.  These agreements are of two kinds: &ldquo;Knock-for-Knock&rdquo;, under which each party bears its own loss and &ldquo;Halving&rdquo; under which each party bears half the loss of the other party.  The agreements correspond broadly to analogous agreements which such insurance companies have with each other and are designed to avoid the costs of litigating claims.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>As the employments excepted from insurance by the regulations mentioned are of such a nature that they are ordinarily adopted as subsidiary employments only and not as the principal means of livelihood, I am not satisfied that the regulations in their application give <Col N="237" /> rise to hardship or that amendment for the purpose indicated by the Deputies is necessary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The regulations as drafted provide that rent collectors are not excepted from insurance unless their employment involves less than 18 hours service in a contribution week.  The obvious reason for this is that a collector could pick up other employment.</P>

Where a secondary school qualifies for a building grant from the Department in respect of an extension to the school, it can in certain circumstances include prefabricated classrooms as part of that extension for grant purposes.

      <P>I am aware that exhibitions of work purporting to be the work of handicapped persons have been held in many parts of the country, mainly in hotels, and that considerable numbers of tickets for admission to these exhibitions were sold.  It is reasonable to assume that members of the public buying the tickets were under the impression that the proceeds would be devoted to the care of the mentally and physically handicapped, but in many cases I have been unable to trace that they were.  Indeed, in several instances, bodies dealing with the handicapped lent material for exhibition, under the same impression, and experienced the greatest difficulty in having the material returned or paid for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The National Association for the <Col N="240" /> Mentally Handicapped of Ireland found it necessary in July last to warn all affiliated associations of the need to assure themselves of the <i>bona fides</i> of the organisers before lending any support to fund-raising activities of the kind mentioned.  A similar warning was issued by my Department to mental hospital authorities in August last. In spite of this, I understand exhibitions are still being arranged.  In this country, in recent years, a number of dedicated voluntary bodies have been formed to help the handicapped and an immense amount of good will has been created.  It is most regrettable that unscrupulous persons should try to cash in on this goodwill.  Members of the general public before contributing to any fund-raising activities, ostensibly on behalf of handicapped persons, have not the means of assuring themselves that the proceeds will, in fact, be devoted to this purpose, but the activities of undesirable elements would be very much curtailed if hoteliers and others who may be approached with a view to providing venues for these exhibitions were to refuse facilities in all cases in which the application was not supported by reputable local people known to them.</P>

      <P>A health authority has power to enter into agreements under which private mental hospitals will give in-patient treatment on behalf <Col N="241" /> of the authority.  This power is not used in Dublin.</P>
      <P>A person eligible to receive institutional services under the Health Acts may, if he so desires, in lieu of acceping services made available by the health authority, make his own arrangements for services in certain approved mental hospitals.  In such cases the health authority's liability is limited to a contribution in respect of the services made available.  The amount of the contribution is set out in a tabular statement which, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to have circulated in the Official Report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said about three times already before Fine Gael started their interruptions, it is not unusual that a discrepancy should arise between the estimated cost of the restoration of a building, especially an old building, and the actual cost when the job is done.  This is a well-known fact.  Any estimate of the cost of restoration is always extremely tentative. It is always treated as such by people who understand the position. There was a classic case of such esimation in recent years in Britain in the restoration of 10 Downing Street.  The estimated cost for the job was £1 million.  In actual fact, it turned out that the job cost more than double.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave also spoke generally on the question of possible uses to which buildings of that kind could be put.  It is not easy to give a general answer to that question but I can again refer to the activities of the Kilkenny Archaeological Society.  This is a society of ordinary people from the Kilkenny area.  A problem existed there of arresting the decay and ruin of this Elizabethan merchant's house and thereafter its conversion to some <Col N="246" /> practical use.  Now, this task was accomplished by this small society at considerable cost to themselves and without any histrionics of the type we are witnessing at the present time in regard to other historical buildings, without any donation from wealthy foreigners or, indeed, without any subscription from them either.  Those people laboriously and diligently collected the money required for the restoration of the building and restored it.  They now use it for committee rooms and as a museum.  They sought and readily got the co-operation of the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>Many tributes have been paid to the National Monuments Branch and the architectural staff of the Office of Public Works for the very fine job of restoration they did on Rothe House. I think there is a moral in this particular case.  Those Kilkenny people were particularly concerned about this historic building.  Without being offensive, arrogant or petulant, they applied themselves effectively to the task and they accomplished it.  I would respectfully recommend to other people who profess a refinement of taste in such matters that they take a long hard look at societies such as the Kilkenny Archaeological Society and endeavour, if they are able, to emulate their conduct in their particular problems. These are two examples which I know intimately.  I am quite certain that there are other equally good societies in other parts of the country.</P>
    <P>There also exists in the town of Kilkenny the problem firstly, of the preservation, and secondly, of the restoration, of Ormonde Castle.  In this case, too, a local body grouped themselves into a society and they have almost completed arrangements for the purchase of the castle and they have proposals to initiate the work, firstly, of the preservation of the fabric of the castle.  It is an exceedingly formidable task and I have no sanguine hopes to justify the belief that it would be accomplished even in decades but the task has been undertaken by people who are native Irish, who have single-barrelled names, who are quite ordinary people from the locality. <Col N="247" /> These people never write letters to the press and neither do they make unjustified assaults on Government officers or Departments.  Rather do they refer to the Office of Public Works, my own Office, and to other Government Departments, for help when they require it, and if it can be given, it is given.</P>
    <P>Another building that has been beautifully restored in recent times by the Office of Public Works is Carrick Castle, Carrick-on-Suir.  Deputy Cosgrave's problem arises here.  As far as I know, at present no use has been found for it but at least as Deputy Dillon said&mdash;I think he referred specifically to it&mdash;its decay and ruin have been averted.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon again raised the question of the aerial survey which he has been recommending on this Vote for several years.  I was glad to tell him that an archaeological survey from the air is being carried out in Louth, in co-operation with the Army Air Corps.  I am glad also to say that there is great credit due to Deputy Dillon for pressing this idea so persistently and he is welcome to the credit if he wants it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave asked what was the present position with regard to the preparation of plans for the Kennedy Memorial Concert Hall.  In so far as it affects the Office of Public Works, the preparation of detailed plans for this Hall is proceeding.  As the House knows, this is a matter which is in the hands of an all-Party Committee of the House and it would be outside my terms of reference to comment on the activities of this Committee.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon also referred to the condition of the parkland in and about the vicinity of the Papal Nunciature and Arus an Uachtaráin.  I agree that the pastureland in that area of the Phoenix Park is weed-infested and not particularly well looked after.  It would be easy to see that this particular parkland was sprayed once or twice a year in the future, or that some other method of weed control is exercised to ensure that the thistles and other weeds are exterminated.</P>

      <P>Deputy Larkin complained about the siting of the Sheriff Street Sorting Office.  There is not a great deal that can be said about this.  There will be heavy traffic in the Sheriff Street area but this is true of any other area in the centre of the city.  The Sheriff Street site was the best site available and work began on the construction of this sorting office and I do not think anything can be done about it.</P>
      <P>He also referred to the new post office building in Coolock-Raheny. The best thing I can do in this case is to refer Deputy Larkin to the fourth issue of <i>Oibre</i> which is published by the Office of Public Works and quote a short paragraph in it as follows:</P>
      <P>In the heart of the Coolock-Raheny suburbs of Dublin a large open site has been reserved for development as a shopping and recreational centre.  A section of this site was made available by Dublin Corporation for the erection of a sorting office and telephone exchange to serve this fast expanding section of the city.</P>
      <P>A photograph shows the new sorting office.  The point is that this is an area about to be developed, and while at present the building may look a little bit stark and lonely on this site, I have no doubt that when the area has been fully developed, Deputy Larkin's initial objections will&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I think it is a good building.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cosgrave was a bit worried about schools and about the way in which they would be affected by the wholesale tax.  He may have forgotten that in the years about which I was speaking when speaking on the Estimate, the wholesale tax did not operate at all.  Most building materials are exempt from the wholesale tax in any case.  He was afraid that while the expenditure on schools has risen steadily, I am glad to say, in recent years, the provision of schools and of school places would possibly have dropped because of the increased building costs.  I want to reassure him about this.  I have the figures for five consecutive years beginning with 1961-62 for the provision of school places and they read from that year: 13,623, 10,514, 15,936, 16,533, and for last year, 20,616. This last figure crashes right through the record and is a very satisfactory situation and I am sure Deputy Cosgrave and the House will be very pleased to hear it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon had some queries about arterial drainage in his own constituency. He asked about the Dromore. That is part of the Erne scheme and this scheme should be ready for exhibition about 1968.  The House will appreciate that we are so often accused of making rash promises that I am saying: &ldquo;should be ready&rdquo;.  I go no further than that, although I am satisfied that there is no visible reason why it should not be ready in 1968.  The Kilcoo is being surveyed and will be ready for exhibition next spring and the actual work should start some time in 1967. The same applies to the Skeoge which is also a border river and the work will confer certain benefits on Derry city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Fane is a minor catchment, I forget its place on the priority list, but it will not be done for several years, I think.  Over the weekend I saw a reference in a letter from a correspondent in the <i>Irish Farmers Journal</i> which said pretty definitely that the drainage of the Boyne would not be done any more than certain other <Col N="250" /> rivers he mentioned.  Where he got his information I do not know: I am certain he did not get it from us, although we are the authority dealing with arterial drainage.  As I have already told the House, work will start on the Boyne and Maine, probably in 1968.  Somebody raised the perennial question of spoil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I suspect that Deputy Dillon had his tongue in his cheek in raising this question because I am certain that he is as familiar as anybody with the problem involved in disposing of spoil.  People in catchment areas, quite rightly, frequently demand that their river be drained by the Board of Works but when their wishes are granted and the machinery arrives and dumps spoil on their land, there is a protest of another kind.  The obvious question is: what can you do with the stuff?  If it is alluvial spoil, there is no problem; it can be spread out over the fields and will be just as good as the riverside soil over which it is laid.  The only thing that can be done with rock spoil is to try to get somebody to take it away.  In some cases, such as the Moy, I think, the GAA took away thousands of tons of stuff to use for embankments around a sports field.  Even with that sort of disposal, there are limits to what can be done, but in every case the Office of Public Works tries to meet the landowners as fairly as possible.  They try to reduce the area of land occupied by spoil to a minimum and I do not see &mdash; neither has any other Deputy said &mdash; what can be done, outside of that.</P>

      <P>That is a suggestion, at least.  I imagine that it would be governed completely by economic considerations, by accessibility and by the nature of the stone, but we shall see if any progress can be made in that direction.</P>
      <P>Deputy Larkin mentioned Howth in his remarks about major fishery harbours. He probably knows that out of the five major fishery harbours, development has started at Dunmore East, Killybegs and Castletownbere, and further development is a matter for the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.  When we are asked by them to commence activities in Howth, we shall do so but we have not yet been asked by them.</P>
      <P>Deputy Larkin returned, somewhat to my surprise, to the question of sick pay and superannuation.  All I can do is to refer Deputy Larkin to volume 225, columns 186-188 of the Official Report and remind him that quite recently he asked a Parliamentary Question about that subject which I answered as fully as I could.  He also had me here on the Adjournment about it and, again, I dealt with it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>On special employment schemes, Deputy Cosgrave spoke of flooding and I think he was referring to areas of his own constituency, <Col N="253" /> built-up areas.  All I can say on that score is that this appears to me to be a matter for local authorities.</P>
      <P>He also inquired about the position of rural improvement schemes applicants who have applied since August, 1965, and whether they ought to re-apply.  They need not re-apply.  All the applications that have been received since that date have been recorded and when acceptances are resumed, they will be treated as new applications.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kitt, rather surprisingly, in view of the great storm that was created in certain localities, was the only rural Deputy, apart from Deputy Dillon, who represents a rural constituency, to mention the Special Employments Schemes at all.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I am rather intrigued by the order of priorities of the western Deputies in Deputy Clinton's Party.  Deputy Kitt felt it was his duty to come to this House.  He was elected to this House to express the mind and opinion of the people in his constituency and, as Deputy Dillon says, of rural Ireland generally. This is the place to do it, but Deputy Clinton's Party almost to a man, were struggling around Kerry or Waterford, and unavailingly, as usual.  However, that is another story.</P>
      <P>I realise that the reduction in the Special Employments Schemes Vote resulted in a certain amount of disemployment but, to be objective about it, it can be shown with great ease that the total loss to the rural constituencies, especially in the West, was more than compensated for by greatly increased expenditure by the Government in the West in other ways.  Let us approach it this way.  There are two things you can do about a body of unemployed people in the West or anywhere else.  You can provide schemes such as this for them in order to give them, as was the rule, about three or four weeks' work in the year or you can try to build up small farm economies in order that there will be increased agricultural production and increased farmer independence in small farm areas of that kind.  This is by far the more difficult thing to do, in the short run at any rate.</P>

      <P>The efforts of Deputy Dillon and his colleagues to associate the Government with the present poor prices for cattle are ineffectual.  They have been shown to be ineffectual.  They flogged that horse to death in Kerry and in Waterford. I heard their candidate in Waterford flogging it to death, and it was unavailing, because as has been demonstrated, farmers who stand outside chapel gates and listen to politicians orating, while they may not indicate one way or the other how they feel, realise the situation. I know what they think because I am one of them myself.  They can read the signs very well.  They know pretty accurately the reasons why cattle prices are&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise; I have been sidetracked deliberately by Deputy Dillon.  I had been talking about the highly successful efforts by the Government, and particularly the Department of Agriculture, to build up the agricultural economy in the small farm areas and meet the problem of unemployment and low production in that way rather than by direct payment through employment schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Highly successful?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>They will be successful and they are showing success. I am quite sure of this, too, that whatever worthy scheme the Government may introduce, it will be sneered at, just as the heifer scheme was sneered at by Deputy Dillon, and pronounced to be unattainable by Fine Gael.  That seems to be their function, to act as a Cassandra wringing their hands and announcing in advance that the thing <Col N="256" /> cannot work.  The Fianna Fáil Government have made a great many things work in this country, and if Fine Gael could say something even vaguely similar we probably would have a better country today.  If Fine Gael could say that they did not attempt to destroy the efforts that have been made by our Government to build up the country when they got a chance, even that would be some boast they would have to make, but they cannot make it.</P>
      <P>The amalgamation of the minor employment bog development schemes with the rural improvement schemes has been criticised in this debate and before that, too.  Deputy Kitt, when he was speaking, referred to a large meeting that was organised by my colleague, Deputy Dr. Gibbons, of all Deputies and Senators from the west of Ireland, of all Parties, to examine this question.  I went into it in some considerable detail with them at that time.</P>
      <P>There was the process of selection in the matter of minor employment roads.  It was governed completely by the presence or absence or relative concentration of unemployment in an area.  It bore no relation whatever to the degree of necessity for road repairs in that area.  Very often it gave rise to an anomalous situation.  In one parish, where there was high unemployment, work might actually run out and there would be duplication. Schemes were done on little roads which did not badly require to be done because they had been repaired a few years previously.  On the other hand, in a neighbouring parish, which might not have as many unemployed, you would have very bad roads indeed with farmers and others trying to get into their houses by roads pretty well impassable.  But, because of the lower rate of unemployment in their locality, they did not qualify for minor employment scheme grants.  A fantastic road structure grew up in certain parts, especially in the West, on this account</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the contributory scheme, while it obviously imposes a certain burden of payment on the people who benefit by it, has the great merit of giving a system of selection which <Col N="257" /> actually works.  People do not readily contribute to a scheme unless they feel they are going to get some real benefit from the money they invest in it.  In this way rural improvement scheme jobs, especially on the roads, have been much more satisfactory and much more rationally distributed than work done under the other two schemes. However, there is no dodging the fact, and I do not seek to dodge it, that one of the most powerful reasons why the merger was made was that the available money was not as high as it had been the year before.  It had some very regrettable consequences but, in the financial circumstances prevailing, it was the best we could do.</P>
    <P>Lastly, as I said in my opening speech, we are introducing a Supplementary Estimate for urban employment schemes.  Deputy Larkin seemed to think that the reduction was being visited almost completely on the urban areas.  As a matter of fact, this is not the truth at all.  The position is that the provision for urban employment schemes last year was £190,000. In the Book of Estimates some months ago, this was reduced to £130,000.  On reflection, it was decided that this figure was not adequate and for that reason a Supplementary Estimate of £50,000 will be introduced now.</P>
    <P>I do not think any other points were raised to which I should refer.  I would like to thank Deputies for their contributions and to assure them that, if I can help them in any way at any time, I shall be glad to do so.</P>

      <P>That a sum not exceeding £793,400 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on 31st day of March, 1967, for Salaries and Expenses in connection with Sea and Inland Fisheries, including Sundry Grants-in-Aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As will be seen from the details given in the Estimates Volume the sum provided by way of grant-in-aid to Bord Iascaigh Mhara has increased by £151,500; an extra £8,800 is provided for inland fisheries development; the grant-in-aid to the Inland Fisheries Trust Incorporated is increased by £5,000; the grant-in-aid to the Salmon Research Trust of Ireland Incorporated shows an increase of £500; and other increases amounting to £8,000 relate to salaries, wages, allowances and expenses.  The total of all these increases is £173,800.  The reason why the Vote as a whole is slightly smaller than for 1965-66 is that it was necessary to include in that year's Vote a write-off provision in relation to <Col N="259" /> advances from the Central Fund to Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  So far as direct State assistance for the development of the fishing industry is concerned, the Vote shows a substantial increase.</P>
    <P>During 1965 the steady expansion which had been recorded in the previous two years in the development of our sea and inland fisheries was more than maintained.  The total value of landings of sea fish and shellfish in 1965 was the highest on record and the total value of all fish exports, including salmon, trout and eels, at £1,971,000 was over £20,000 higher than the 1964 figure which itself had constituted a record.  For the first nine months of 1966 the upward trend of exports continued, the value at £1,800,746 being almost 14 per cent greater than for the same period of 1965.  The estimated income from angling tourism rose by £500,000 during the year to the value of £3,600,000.  Thus exports, both visible and invisible, arising from our fisheries were valued at over £5,500,000 in 1965.  And finally home consumption of fish increased by an estimated 13 per cent during the year.</P>
    <P>Landings of sea fish, excluding shellfish, which are recorded partly by weight and partly by numbers, amounted in 1965 to 563,000 cwt. representing an increase of 75,000 cwt. on the figure for the previous year.  The total value of landings, including shellfish, rose by almost £200,000 or 13 per cent to the record figure of over £1,700,000.  The expansion was spread over the entire range of fishing endeavour, the value of the pelagic catch, mainly herrings and mackerel, rising by £100,000 on the 1964 figure, while the demersal landing such as whiting, plaice, haddock, etc. showed an increase of £83,000 and shellfish an increase of £11,000.  The varieties which contributed most to fishermen's earnings were herrings, whiting, plaice, lobsters, cod, crawfish and haddock in that order.</P>
    <P>Figures for the first nine months of 1966 show a still further improvement. While the landings of sea fish, other than shellfish at 390,542 cwt. remained steady, the total value of landings, <Col N="260" /> including shellfish, for the nine months was £1,424,539.  This was £191,425 or 16 per cent above the figure of £1,233,114 for the first nine months of 1965.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that, in regard to the variety which showed the greatest expansion in 1965, namely herrings, where the value of the catch increased by almost £100,000 deepest disappointment must be expressed.  It was hoped that last season would see an end to the discord which has existed at Dunmore East for the past few years but unfortunately these hopes were not realised.  The new season has started and I would appeal to all concerned to secure a return to harmony at the port which would enable the full potential of the fishery to be realised.</P>
    <P>The grant-in-aid to Bord Iascaigh Mhara has again been increased this year to £304,000 for administration and development work and to £137,500 for capital purposes.  The capital provision is, as usual, mainly for the payment of grants of 25 per cent towards the cost of new boats and new engines, including grants for two stern trawlers recently acquired by an Irish company. Advances from the Central Fund of up to £205,000 have also been authorised mainly for financing the purchase of boats and gear.  During 1965 31 new fishing boats were issued on hire-purchase by the board which also helped to finance the purchase abroad of four second-hand boats of approximately 70 feet in length.  A satisfactory feature of the board's operations in 1965 and to date in the current year was the increase in hire-purchase repayments, indicating the improving position of the fishing skipper.</P>
    <P>The fish processing factories at Galway and Killybegs must in the general interest of the industry continue to operate.  As indicated in the programme of sea development set out in the White Paper of April, 1962, the board were prepared to lease or sell them to private or co-operative interests.  The board have in recent months leased the two factories to a private concern.  Thus the board have completely withdrawn from fish processing and can devote their entire <Col N="261" /> energies to their functions as a development body.  I am confident, however, that with the continued build-up of catching power, fish processing factories operated by co-operatives and by private enterprise will as time goes on have a role of ever-increasing importance in the industry.</P>
    <P>The board continued during the past year to extend their development functions.  Fishing methods were improved with the assistance of an expert technical adviser.  The influence of contacts with fishing operations in other countries, facilitated by study tours arranged by the board, was evident in the progressive attitudes of our skippers towards modernisation of craft and fishing methods. Existing co-operative societies of fishermen made progress and the ground work was laid for establishment of new societies.</P>
    <P>One of the major aims of fishery policy in recent years has been the provision of trained personnel at all levels &mdash;a necessary prerequisite towards any expansion of the industry.  The scheme for training boys as fishermen continues to make satisfactory progress but an even more dynamic approach to the problem is needed.  I will refer to this later when I speak of our plans for the future.</P>
    <P>During 1965, 38 boys were admitted to training to supplement the 54 boys in training at the beginning of the year.  At the beginning of 1966, there were 40 boys in training and, as a result of the recruitment campaign carried out in the spring and summer months, further trainees were selected.  Fifty-eight of these new recruits have already been placed on vessels.  The training covers a two-year period commencing in each case when the boy is placed aboard a vessel.  The number of trainees from time to time is, therefore, a fluctuating one.  In addition to practical training on board selected fishing boats, trainees attend a shore course at Haulbowline naval base and Cobh vocational school.  Boys admitted under the scheme are paid an allowance <Col N="262" /> of £5 per week over two years&mdash; the equivalent of a £500 scholarship.</P>
    <P>Under the scheme for training experienced fishermen as skippers, nine fishermen qualified in 1965 and seven in 1966 for certificates of competency under the Merchant Shipping Acts&mdash; bringing to 67 the number who have obtained such certificates following attendance at courses under the scheme. Not only does successful completion of these courses make the fisherman more competent at his job, but it also opens the door for him to the acquisition of a large fishing boat under the Marine Credit Plan operated by Bord Iascaigh Mhara.</P>
    <P>I hope to see a worthwhile increase in the number of boys and men coming forward for training each year and I also look to the continued goodwill of all who have co-operated so whole-heartedly in the operation of the schemes.  I should like to record particularly my appreciation of the continued assistance of the Galway Vocational Education Committee and of the Cork County Vocational Committee.</P>
    <P>Progress is being made in the development of Killybegs, Castletownbere and Dunmore East as major fishery harbours and provision is made in the Estimate for Public Works and Buildings for the continuation of work at the three centres throughout 1966-67.  It is my intention to introduce shortly in the House proposals for legislation to facilitate the management and control of all five major fishery harbours&mdash;the three I have just mentioned, plus Galway and Howth.</P>
    <P>Harbour improvement schemes which were commenced last year at Cahirciveen and Renard Point, County Kerry, and which are partly financed by State grants, have recently been completed.  Other marine works at small landing places around the coast are also due for completion this year. A boring survey has been completed at Reen Pier, County Cork, this year as part of approved works.  The improvement of other harbours and landing places is also being considered where works&mdash;some large, some small <Col N="263" />&mdash;may be involved.  Among those under active examination are Burtonport, Darby's Point, Dingle, Killala, Kilmore Quay and Skerries.  In Dingle, where conditions at the harbour have deteriorated due to the silting, and at Darby's Point on Achill Island, preliminary boring surveys have recently been carried out to enable detailed designs and estimates of costs of any necessary improvement works to be prepared on a realistic basis.  I am not yet in a position to detail the new works that may finally be approved or to indicate when they may be undertaken. I can, however, assure the House that the improvement of harbours and landing facilities around our coast, where present or potential fishing activities so warrant, will receive top priority.</P>
    <P>The Maritime Jurisdiction (Amendment) Act, 1965, which provided for the extension of the exclusive fishery limits from three to twelve miles, came into operation on 1st October, 1965. While, in accordance with international agreement, certain concessions have been granted to fishery vessels from six countries whose vessels have habitually fished in our waters, the inner six-mile zone of the extended limits will be reserved completely to Irish fishing boats from the outer 1966.  In addition, fishing in the outer six-mile zone will be available only to Irish boats and those of the six countries with habitual rights therein. All in all, this should be of considerable benefit to our fishermen and I hope they will make the maximum use of the extended fishing area thus provided.</P>
    <P>While the figures I have given in this review for 1965 showed satisfactory increases on the previous year, I think most Deputies would agree that our sea fishing industry has the potential to make a still greater contribution in the future to our economic advancement. For this reason my predecessor initiated some time ago, in conjunction with Bord Iascaigh Mhara, a comprehensive and detailed study of the industry with a view to planning its expansion to a level that would be in <Col N="264" /> line with the Second Programme for Economic Expansion generally and related to what might reasonably be expected from a country in our situation. This examination, which involved a review of all aspects of the Government's White Paper of April, 1962, has now been completed and a full-scale development programme drawn up. This programme is already under way and will be pressed ahead vigorously during the next few years.  The achievement of the targets set will, I believe, create a momentum which will greatly facilitate the realisation of our full potential.</P>
    <P>In broad outline, we plan an increase in landings from the 1965 level of £1.7 million to £4 million by 1970, doubling employment in the industry and building up a processing industry with an output of £4 million mainly for export.</P>
    <P>In planning the development of our sea fishing industry, we must take into account our own circumstances and also international trends and developments. We must also try to assess what are our particular advantages and limitations so that we can exploit the former and work within the latter.</P>
    <P>The sea fishing world today presents a picture of a no-man's land of international waters being exploited intensively by the fishing vessels of many countries.  Some of these countries are developing their fisheries on a commercial basis while others look to the sea as a valuable source of protein and do not apply the normal commercial criteria to their fishing industry.  The capital investment by all these countries in boats and gear is enormous and is resulting in many instances in an over-intensive exploitation of fishing grounds.  This brings about lower catches per unit and because of this more investment in an effort to sustain catch rates.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that we cannot in the near future increase our landings of fish to anything like the level of landings by the bigger fishing nations of the world which, as I mentioned, have vast capital resources to invest in the maintenance and development of their fisheries.  However, what we may lose in quantity we can certainly make up <Col N="265" /> for in quality and in this connection we must establish a quality image for our fishery products so that they can command premium prices whether they are marketed fresh or in a processed form.</P>
    <P>We have natural advantages which can be developed in pursuit of this policy.  Within our territorial waters we have good exploitable shellfish resources for which a world demand exists.  We have very good inshore fishing grounds and we are also geographically located near good pelagic and demersal fishing grounds outside our territorial waters on the Continental Shelf.  Although the latter are being heavily fished by fleets of other countries, our proximity to the grounds should give us an economic advantage over boats of other countries that have to travel further from their home base.</P>
    <P>On the marketing side, we are also in a favourable position in relation to the United Kingdom.  The recent Free Trade Area Agreement with Britain gives us unqualified free entry for all our fish to the British market.  This will be of particular value in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>The full scale development programme which has been drawn up covers all facets of the industry and it is desirable that I should give some indication of what exactly we have in mind.</P>
    <P>The present fleet, which is in the main skipper-owned, will be expanded by the addition of suitable vessels in all classes from those suitable for shell-fishing to vessels larger than those hitherto in our fleet and capable of operating in all seas within reasonable distance of our coast.  Progressive skippers will be encouraged to invest in larger vessels and Irish companies will also be encouraged to operate such vessels as part of a combined fishing, processing and marketing activity. Private enterprise will be encouraged to invest in a limited number of modern vessels of the middle-water class and on the results of their operations we will judge the extent to which further expansion along this line should be undertaken.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="266" /> The very attractive terms offered under the existing Marine Credit Plan will continue and the Plan which hitherto applied to vessels up to 65 feet in length is with some minor modifications now extended to cover vessels up to 90 feet.  Grants of up to 25 per cent of the capital cost, but no loans, will also be provided for vessels larger than 90 feet.  Where capital investment from the private sector in the larger vessel needs to be complemented by loan capital, efforts will be made to negotiate the most favourable terms possible from commercial sources.</P>
    <P>Lest there should be any misapprehension about the effects on the smaller fishermen of the operation of the larger vessels envisaged, I want to make it clear that these larger vessels would operate mainly to provide the necessary raw material on a regular basis for the efficient operation of our processing factories, the products of which would largely be for export.  They would not be permitted in any circumstances to operate to the detriment of the existing fleet on which the livelihood of so many of our fishermen depends.  Many of our leading skippers have, I am glad to say, already reached a standard of competency which enables them to change to bigger boats and we will encourage more of them to do likewise.  The interests of the small fishermen will, however, continue to be safeguarded at all times.</P>
    <P>Side by side with increasing the size of our fleet, Bord Iascaigh Mhara will, through intensified advisory services, bring about the maximum possible increase in output of the existing vessels.  Educational trips to other fishing countries will continue to be organised for our skippers and constant improvement in vessel design, in gear and in equipment will be sought.</P>
    <P>Manpower in the catching sector is the most important single factor in increasing production and, accordingly, everything possible will be done to improve personnel training schemes and to encourage increased participation in them.  We propose to introduce a new comprehensive educational programme to ensure the most efficient <Col N="267" /> utilisation of available and future manpower.  My predecessor set this in motion by establishing a Committee of Education for the Fishing Industry which will advise me on the manpower requirements, on the educational programme necessary to meet those requirements and on the implementation of that programme.  The short-term aim of the programme will be to provide skilled manpower to meet our immediate requirements for fleet expansion and a crash programme for skipper training.  In the long term the programme should ensure that a growing pool of well trained officer personnel and deck personnel is available.</P>
    <P>My predecessor also initiated, as part of the programme, a survey of what are described as part-time fishermen with a view to seeing to what extent these part-timers could with advantage to all concerned be absorbed whole-time into the industry.</P>
    <P>While there are complex problems involved in the production of fish, we must remember that the end product must compete against other primary products in the food markets of the world.  If we are to succeed in obtaining a worthwhile share of markets in other countries and in commanding premium prices for Irish fishery products, the quality of all our fish and fish products must be raised to the highest status.  Our fishermen, distributors, processors, wholesalers, retailers and exporters have a responsibility to ensure that we market only products of the highest quality.</P>
    <P>To this end, I intend to introduce compulsory standards for the handling and distribution of fish from the catching point right through to the end of the distribution chain and I will ensure that the standards are fully maintained both for the home and the export trade.  In the case of processed fish products, my Department are co-operating with Bord Iascaigh Mhara and the Institute of Industrial Research and Standards in the preparation of standards for fish products, the first of which has recently been published by the Institute.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="268" /> Another aspect of marketing which is provided for in the programme involves the stimulation of demand, the improvement of design and quality of our fishery products to meet market requirements and through promotion, efficient distribution and hard selling, ensuring that we increase our home consumption and get an adequate share of world markets.  As a well developed home market is a sound basis for successful exporting, fish distribution in the Irish market will be rationalised so that fish is distributed efficiently from port to consumer. The programme also aims at greater involvement by fishermen's co-operatives in the marketing of their products thus ensuring that the primary producer will get a greater share of the end price.</P>
    <P>Bord Iascaigh Mhara will continue its policy of assisting co-operatives with their management and organisational problems while distributors will be encouraged to draw their supplies direct from ports and to deliver direct to markets.  There will also be intensified promotion through publicity, advertising, public relations and consumer education to secure the needed increase in our home consumption of fish.  Already various promotional activities such as the National Fish Cookery Competition, a similar competition for ICA members, public fish cookery demonstrations, fishery exhibitions and television, radio and press advertising have paid good dividends in boosting home consumption of fish but there is still ample scope for greater activity in this field.</P>
    <P>Despite the projected increase in home market consumption, it is to export markets that we must look for our real growth.  It is an objective of the programme to ensure that the maximum possible amount of fish exports will be in processed form, thus increasing the contribution of the industry as a whole to the wealth of the country and ensuring a much higher level of factory employment ashore.  Bord Iascaigh Mhara will appoint a trade officer in Britain and further officers will be appointed in other countries if this is considered <Col N="269" /> necessary.  This will intensify promotion and feed back necessary market information.  The board will also establish a technological and product development unit which will advise the industry on handling and processing problems and assist Irish processing companies in providing high grade products for all markets.  In this the board will also assist processors in the day to day problems that may arise in complying fully with the official quality standards I will introduce. Second only to the proposals designed to increase the volume of our fish landings, I rank improvement in fish quality as the next most important aspect of the whole programme for improving the economy of the industry.</P>
    <P>On the scientific side, my Department has an important role to play in the implementation of the programme of fishery development.  A second exploratory fishing vessel has been built for the Department in Killybegs and is in operation since last June. This will enable important research and exploratory work to be intensified in the interests of the fishing industry and the exploratory fishing operations should assist greatly in the opening up of new fisheries for our fleet.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Department's research work is to gain the maximum amount of knowledge about the nature, extent and magnitude of the resources of the fish stocks around our coast and in our rivers and inland waters.  The Department's scientific staff will, as heretofore, continue to work in close co-operation with their opposite numbers in other countries.  We are closely associated with many international bodies in whose work we fully participate, such as the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea, the North-East Atlantic Fisheries Commission and FAO.  To translate the results of the important basic research into commercial exploitation, the programme provides that Bord Iascaigh Mhara will have shortly on its staff personnel for liaison with the Department's scientific staff, so that the fruits of research can more readily be made available for the practical use of the working fisherman.</P>
    <P>The programme also places particular <Col N="270" /> emphasis on the development of our shellfish resources, the produce of which finds a lucrative market abroad.  Increased attention will be given to the development of new and improved catching methods and the expansion of shellfish farming operations will also be encouraged.</P>
    <P>The proposals for the creation of five major fishery harbours have already been announced and, as I have mentioned, engineering work at three of them is progressing.  In addition, attention will be given to the provision of improved landing facilities at smaller points around the coast where such facilities are required.  This activity is going on all the time and some months ago my predecessor set up a survey team to examine fully the fishing harbour facilities in South Kerry.  The work of this team, which has been making an on-the-spot appraisal of the facilities required to meet present and expected needs of the local fishing industry and where those facilities should be located, is now almost completed and will be followed by a similar survey of the Galway-Mayo coast.</P>
    <P>In formulating our plans and in expanding them in the years ahead it is essential that we keep in close touch with international developments, particularly in the technological fields.  In many instances solutions to production problems are dependent on the work of scientists and technologists. Consequently we must ensure that not only are we keeping abreast of what other countries are doing in this field, but that we are applying all available scientific knowledge for the purpose of commercial development.  I am very pleased to announce that following consideration and discussion over the past few months agreement has been reached with the Bureau of Commercial Fisheries of the United States Government for joint co-operation in specific fishery projects in which our two countries have a mutual interest.</P>
    <P>The projects will include the study of varying productivity of Irish fishing vessels; United States assistance in the establishment of an Irish Gear <Col N="271" /> Evaluation Unit to improve the gear on Irish fishing boats; a study of certain US boat designs and shell fish dredgers; a biological and scientific research project on shell fisheries; a study of US fish quality control regulations and standards; US assistance to Bord Iascaigh Mhara in the setting up of the product development unit to which I have referred including training of Irish personnel in food technology and product development in fish and fish products; and, on the Inland Fishery side, a study of control of fish movement and work on artificial spawning beds.  At a later stage hydrographic and oceanographic research in relation to fisheries will be undertaken.</P>
    <P>The joint co-operation on these projects will commence immediately.  As a first step, it has been agreed that the United States will send two Bureau specialists to Ireland in the next few months to help to establish and co-ordinate the comprehensive programme of co-operation in fishery development.</P>
    <P>The American authorities, like ourselves, have shown a keen enthusiasm for this proposal and we are both confident that the joint studies will show results of mutual benefit and pave the way for continued co-operation on fishery matters between the two Governments.</P>
    <P>From what I have said on the subject of sea fisheries it is clear that we are making every effort on all fronts to ensure that under the new planned programme of development the full potential of the industry will be realised with the greatest possible benefit to our fishermen and the economy generally.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that the high catches of salmon of the last few years continued during 1965 when the total weight of the catch by all fishing methods was 2,870,000 lb. &mdash; only slightly less than the 3,013,000 lb. in 1964 and greater than the 2,837,000 lb. in 1963.  We have been fortunate in the very good grilse runs which we have had since 1962 and from reports the spawnings of recent seasons have <Col N="272" /> maintained a satisfactory level for most areas.  The quantity of salmon exported was 19,800 cwt. in 1965 as against 22,900 cwt. in 1964.  These were valued at £759,400 as compared with £933,500 for 1964.</P>
    <P>Complete returns of catches for 1966 are not yet in but reports generally indicate that while for the fifth year in succession they were at above-average level, the gradually declining trend which started in 1965 is continuing. This is borne out by the monthly figures of exports, the latest of which shows that 15,333 cwt. was exported for the first nine months this year compared with 19,049 cwt. for the same period last year.</P>
    <P>Conditions for angling in 1965 were reasonably good and the number of rod licences issued at 12,805 was a new record, the previous best figures being 11,628 for 1964 and 9,745 for 1963.  It was generally a wet season and waters continued fairly high and suitable for angling.  Rod catches were successful in most parts.  The weight of salmon taken by rod and line was 416,290 lb. compared with 390,000 lb. in 1964.</P>
    <P>A matter of importance for the future of the salmon fisheries which recently came to the forefront was the increase in the Greenland catches of salmon.  These rose in 1964 to a level of 1,400 tons compared with an average of about 200 tons over the five preceding years.  Even though falling prices provided a disincentive to catch effort in 1965, the reduced yield of 770 tons in that year was still rather alarmingly high.  Most countries touching on the North Atlantic remain apprehensive that these salmon, on which their rivers rely for breeding stocks, may be seriously depleted by exploitation in Greenland waters and ultimately brought to extinction.  Admittedly the data for forming a firm judgment on the problem are not complete and the various countries concerned, under the aegis of the International Commission for the North Atlantic Fisheries and in co-operation with the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea, have organised study groups to acquire and <Col N="273" /> examine as much data as possible to see what measures could be taken to preserve a proper balance in catches and escapements.  The staff of my Department and of the Salmon Research Trust are, of course, participating in these activities and will continue to do so for as long as necessary.</P>
    <P>Another problem nearer home bearing on the welfare of the salmon industry which arose during 1965 was the growing use of monofilament nets in some drift net fisheries.  Many complaints have been made about the destructiveness of these nets compared with the traditional types and demands for their suppression were received.  On the other hand, it was argued that as their capacity to catch fish was superior their use should be allowed. To deal with the situation my predecessor had a series of public inquiries held to ascertain all viewpoints, and, having considered all the evidence, it was decided to debar the use of these nets for five years.  In this period, I propose to have control experiments carried out so that when the time comes for a review the pros and cons and the alternatives to a complete ban will be known to all concerned.</P>
    <P>I would like to pay tribute to the work which the boards of conservators have done to protect and develop the fisheries in their areas.  Protection is difficult as quite a number of people find illegal fishing a profitable sideline nowadays.  Indiscriminate taking of fish can ruin any fishery in a comparatively short time and but for the work of the conservators and their success in securing fairly heavy penalties for poaching offences, the situation could easily get out of control.  Other problems which the conservators have to deal with are pollution by sewage, industrial and other concerns and the removal of obstructions and clearing of spawning beds.  In this latter work, generous grants are available for any project which will assist fish to move upstream to spawn.  In many cases fish passes have to be constructed to help fish surmount obstacles and the engineers of my Department give every assistance in the design and execution of such works.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="274" /> The expenses of the boards of conservators are unavoidably rising faster than the income which they receive from the sale of licences and from fishery rates and consequently they have to rely on administration grants paid from the fund to keep solvent. The state grant to the Salmon Conservancy Fund has been increased to £33,500, partly because of this growing imbalance of the conservator's accounts and partly in anticipation of the projected reorganisation of the key staffs of the boards.  Certain proposals designed to meet this situation were included in the Fisheries (Amendment) Bill which my predecessor introduced in April last.  He had intended to seek the approval of the House to withdraw that Bill and to introduce a revised measure.  This I propose to do at a very early date, and the financial implications of full reorganisation of such staffs can, I suggest, best be considered at that time.</P>
    <P>Payments are also made from the Salmon Conservancy Fund in respect of river improvement works referred to earlier.  A major scheme at the Clifden Falls on the Owenglin River involving the construction of a fish pass is nearing completion.  This will open up the upper reaches of the river to fish and bring into use valuable spawning grounds which hitherto were inaccessible to fish.  In addition, many minor schemes are listed for attention during the year.</P>
    <P>Investigations are being continued at the experimental station at Glenties into the application of electricity to fishery management and exploitation. These investigations include the development of electronic fish counters, electrical fishing apparatus and the study of the effects of various kinds of electrical stimuli on different types of fish.</P>
    <P>Work on fish disease which has affected the stocks of over a dozen important salmon rivers is being carried on by a fish disease service which has been set up at my Department's Veterinary Research Laboratory.</P>
    <P>My predecessor set up a scientific committee, drawn from the Department's <Col N="275" /> technical staffs and outside scientists for the purpose of pooling information and concerting action during the progress of investigations. A co-ordinating committee broadly representative of salmon interests throughout the country was also set up to bring their knowledge and experience to bear on the planning and conduct of the investigations generally.</P>
    <P>The investigations into the disease at the Veterinary Research Laboratory have disclosed the presence in affected fish of at least four types of pathogen capable of killing fish.  Numerous experiments designed to reproduce the disease in healthy fish by utilising the cultures of the pathogens have failed to produce the true lesions of the disease.  Quite recently, however, the disease has been successfully transmitted to healthy fish by water siphoned from tanks containing diseased fish.  It is believed that water temperature is a significant factor in the propagation of the disease.</P>
    <P>Further investigations are continuing in an effort to identify the causative organism of the disease and to determine the conditions under which it attacks and kills fish.  Fish disease experts from other countries&mdash;Dr. Jensen, from Denmark and Dr. Sniezsko and Professor Ordal from the USA &mdash; have given our research workers the benefit of their experience in dealing with fish disease.  Thanks to their guidance, it has been established that the disease occurring in our rivers is not columnaris as known in the USA where this condition is endemic and responsible for heavy losses of fish.</P>
    <P>The expenses incurred in connection with these investigations including the cost of providing equipment services and experimental facilities at my Department's Veterinary Research Laboratory at Abbotstown and in the field fall to be met this year out of Subhead E (3) of the Vote.  I am happy to acknowledge, however, that the burden of this expense is being lightened by the public spirited action of two concerns which are already known for their beneficent interest in the fisheries&mdash;the Guinness Company <Col N="276" /> have provided £5,000 as an interest-free loan for spending by the Salmon Research Trust and the Electricity Supply Board have guaranteed a donation of £3,000.</P>
    <P>For the present I may say that although the occurrence of the salmon disease has been more widespread than in 1965 the severity of the outbreaks has varied considerably in different river systems.  Disease has occurred to a significant extent in the rivers Liffey, Slaney, Cork Blackwater, Lee, Bandon and Shannon; the Cumeragh river in County Kerry does not appear to be as seriously affected as it was in 1965 and some other Kerry rivers where there were outbreaks in 1965 have not been affected at all this year.</P>
    <P>Consideration needs to be given to the desirability of obtaining statutory powers of control to prevent the spread of communicable disease and to enforce such remedial measures as may be found practicable.  This is something that gives rise to many problems where we are dealing in the main with wild stocks which do not lend themselves readily to control and do not usually respond to any known methods of treatment.</P>
    <P>It has been encouraging to note that in 1965, a high proportion of the stocks of some rivers affected by disease remained healthy, commercial catches were hardly affected at all, anglers had fair sport and escapement of fish to the spawning beds was generally found adequate.  It will not be possible until returns are obtained after the end of the season to assess fully the extent to which stocks in the various rivers were affected this year.</P>
    <P>The boards of conservators have given full co-operation in the areas affected and their staffs have been removing all diseased fish from the rivers and ensuring that they are burned or buried away from the river bank. During the spawning season, now at hand, a certain discreation is necessary in this work so as to avoid premature destruction of potential spawners which even though lightly infected may be able to spawn successfully and produce disease free progeny.  Licensing control over exports of salmon and <Col N="277" /> rainbow trout has been tightened up and an inspection service is in operation to ensure that no diseased fish are exported.</P>
    <P>Work is continuing on rehabilitation of salmon stock in the River Lee in the light of the results of experiments carried out in previous years.  The carrying out of this work has been made possible by the valuable assistance and co-operation of the Electricity Supply Board, the Inland Fisheries Trust and the Cork Board of Fishery Conservators.  Owing to the presence of salmon disease in the river measures to facilitate the movement of adult salmon and smolts have to be modified this year.</P>
    <P>Investigations concerned with the improvement of methods of fishing for eels have been continued, with encouraging results.  Exports of eels in 1965 amounted to 8,400 cwt. valued at £121,000 as against 6,500 cwt. in 1964 valued at £92,000.</P>
    <P>Provision is again made for the award to honours graduates in science of studentships which will enable them to take up the study of sea and inland fishery problems for the purpose of their work for a higher degree.  Three studentships have been offered this year and three studies which were initiated in 1965 were continued in 1966. These studentship projects are worked out under the supervision of the university professors and the scheme is administered with the assistance of an advisory committee comprising representatives of the universities and of my Department.</P>
    <P>Last year's Vote contained provision for a project for research into the water quality conditions in streams, with particular reference to their fishery productivity.  After some delay because of difficulty in recruitment this project has only recently got off the ground with the appointment of two honours graduates as research fellows. These workers have completed an intensive course in water investigation techniques, and so on, at the Water Pollution Research Laboratory of the British Department of Industrial and Scientific Research, Stevenage, Hertfordshire. The research fellows are <Col N="278" /> now carrying out the investigation proper on the selected river systems &mdash; the Cork Blackwater and the nearby Martin, a tributary of the River Lee. In this venture they have been assured of the co-operation of University College, Cork, Cómhlucht Siúicre Éireann, the Institute of Industrial Research and Standards and the boards of fishery conservators for the Lismore and Cork districts.  This research into the effects of pollution, which will continue for about three years, is of a fundamental nature, and the information which it is hoped to obtain from it should be invaluable in the formation of future policy on pollution. It could also serve as a pilot scheme for planning a national water quality service, should circumstances in the future favour the setting up of such a service.</P>
    <P>The investment made by the Government in development of angling waters in the interests of home and visiting anglers has continued to show dividends.  The estimated income from angling tourism which just topped the £3 million mark in 1964 rose further, as I mentioned earlier, to about £3,600,000 in 1965.  The number of angling visitors increased from some 89,600 to about 102,000 over the two years 1964-65.  I must pay tribute to the spirit in which many local angling and development associations are co-operating with the Inland Fisheries Trust and Bord Fáilte in the building up of our angling tourist industry to such satisfactory proportions.</P>
    <P>The grant to the Inland Fisheries Trust had stood at £90,000 for the past two years and it is worth noting that over 50 per cent of the Trust's expenditure is devoted to the western areas with considerable benefit to the economy of many districts which have little alternative source of new income.</P>
    <P>The Trust's commitments for development work are very widely spread but even when these are met the danger arises that the opening up of trout and coarse fishing waters for angling may not be able to keep pace with the growing tourist demand.  It has, therefore, become evident that the Trust needs to be provided with increased funds to finance its development <Col N="279" /> activities.  The grant-in-aid has, therefore, been increased by £5,000.</P>
    <P>In considering the financial problems of the Trust it is necessary to recall that when this body was established it was envisaged as deriving its main income from the subscriptions of its members and enjoying certain supplementary grants of fisheries and on occasion of cash donations from an assumed body of well wishers including the Minister in charge of fisheries.  In the event the State has become virtually the sole source of financial assistance.  At the same time the objectives of the Trust have widened so that it now endeavours to serve the interests of tourist anglers as well as home anglers in a manner not contemplated originally.  At the present time I can only say that the immediate problems of the Trust are having my most earnest attention and that the long-term solution of the financial problem calls for a reappraisal of the whole situation.</P>
    <P>The provision for grant-in-aid to the Salmon Research Trust has again been increased this year &mdash; this time to a maximum of £2,500, which represents about one-third of the running costs. The remainder of the running costs together with a large proportion of the capital expenses of the Trust are provided by Messrs.  Arthur Guinness Son &amp; Co. Ltd., who continue to lend their most valued support to the work being carried on by the Trust in research for the purpose of improving and developing the salmon and sea trout fisheries.  The Trust recently completed ten years work and in that time considerable progress has been made with investigations into the running habits of salmon of known parentage, both spring fish and grilse.  Highly interesting experiments have also been carried out in the artificial propagation and rearing of salmon/sea trout hybrids.  These fish have shown remarkable growth rate and they have also proved to be self-reproducing. This development is receiving further study.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I am sure that Deputies will agree that all available <Col N="280" /> resources are being employed for the advancement of both the sea and inland sides of the fishing industry.  I am satisfied that in the achievement of progress we can rely on the willing co-operation of all sectors of this important industry.</P>
    <P>I accordingly recommend this Estimate to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have never had any close association with the fishing industry and consequently I have no detailed knowledge of it.  It might be more honest and correct for me to say, in fact, that my knowledge of fisheries is indeed very limited.  Like other Deputies, I have not been paying as much attention perhaps as I should to the industry, having regard to its importance socially and economically and bearing in mind its unrealised potentiality. When I speak about the potentiality of the industry, I refer, of course, to the expansion of exports.  These were stressed by the Minister.  I refer also to the expansion of employment, to which the Minister made some slight reference, because I believe there is considerable scope for further employment in the fishing industry.  This is extremely important at a time when so many are leaving the land and when there is a possibility of further considerable redundancy in industry.</P>
      <P>The employment position was not given to us today by the Minister, but I understood the position last year to be that we had approximately 8,000 people employed in the industry.  If my recollection is correct, there were 2,000 people in wholetime employment and 4,000 people in part-time employment. Then there were an additional 2,000 people employed in processing, packing and distribution generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the unrealised potential, I refer, of course, to the development of the tourist industry through angling tourists.  Considerable progress has been made in this field and we have all the indications we need that there is great scope for further development, both in inland fishing and in providing better facilities for sea fishing, that is, sea anglers.  In 1960, if my recollection is correct, we had approximately 12,000 angling tourists <Col N="281" /> for brown trout and in 1965 that increased to something like 46,000.  We had similar increases &mdash; perhaps not as great &mdash; in both coarse fishing and sea angling and there are enormous possibilities here of continuing this development. I think, perhaps, the financial assistance being given to the Inland Fisheries Trust for this purpose is completely insufficient and perhaps, too, there may not be sufficient co-operation between Bord Fáilte, the Inland Fisheries Trust and local associations in the development of this important aspect of our economy.</P>
    <P>It is a peculiar thing that the Minister's statement today indicates considerable improvement and development in the fishing industry generally, while anything one reads about the industry in the daily newspapers is a condemnation of the effort made over the years, and this refers to the continued neglect of the industry.  I remember reading some articles during the past few months, when I got some responsibility for this particular Department.  I saw something I could not believe to be true but apparently it must be true because it has not been contradicted, that is, that the total capital investment in fisheries by the Department over the years has been £2,225,000.  I could not believe that an industry as important as the fishing industry could have had that small amount of capital investment over the long years the Government are in power.  It is quite obvious that if we have failed to develop the industry and failed to realise the potential of the industry, it must be due to neglect and a lack of interest over the years.  It is obvious also that the first realisation of the greater potential there came as a result of the findings of the American survey team who investigated the potential of the industry generally; and with this start, development seems to have opened up.  There are considerable prospects for the development of fisheries, for increased catches of fish, both edible and industrial.</P>
    <P>The Minister's introductory speech this year indicates that all the time landings are increasing and efficiency generally in the industry is being improved, <Col N="282" /> but the whole movement seems to me to be much too slow. Why it is so slow is hard to understand but the main limitations seem now to be not only a financial one but a shortage in the number of trained fish crew people.  The scheme in existence for training people to man the various fishing vessels is not turning out sufficient numbers of trained personnel.  This year's evidence indicates there are fewer people now coming up for training than came up in the last year or so.  Last year there were 54 and this year I believe it is something like 38.  I wonder if the 54 in existence last year were first-year people, or did that represent, perhaps, two years' recruits.</P>
    <P>All the evidence indicates that what the industry needs is further catching power.  The fish are there; the terms for the provision of boats are reasonably generous; and it is a question of getting people to man the boats, because we are assured there is no difficulty in relation to markets.  I heard it said by somebody in An Bord Iascaigh Mhara &mdash; on an occasion when I was present at some function &mdash; that there were no fewer than 22 countries clamouring for our fish and that the demand far outstripped supplies.  It is difficult to reconcile this with the argument that has continued all along the line with regard to the conflict of interest between the small fishermen, the inland fishermen, and the larger merchants in the business.</P>
    <P>The small fishermen feel that if more fish were caught, their income will be reduced accordingly, because that has happened so often in agriculture. Most of those men to whom I have referred have an interest in small farms as well and they are afraid this will happen again if more fish are caught.  I was glad to see in today's statement by the Minister a further reassurance to those smaller fishermen that if the catching power is stepped up, as it can and must be, their interest will in no way suffer.  It is only by convincing those smaller fishermen that that is so we will get some sort of harmony and large-scale development into the industry.  Many people felt for a long number of years that considerable <Col N="283" /> development was not possible in the fishing industry.  Now, all those people who have studied the matter are convinced that fairly large-scale development is possible and is, of course, extremely desirable.</P>
    <P>I do not know what can be done to supply what seems to be the main limiting factor, that is, people to man the increased number of boats needed if we are to get landed the amount of fish required for processing, for continuity of supply and for the expansion of exports generally.  What is wrong that they are not coming forward? Are we giving sufficient publicity to the terms of employment, to the livelihoods available to those people who come along, to the normal income for the ordinary crew member and skipper?  Are these things being sufficiently advertised?  If they are, are they sufficiently attractive?  Life at sea has always been regarded as hard and hazardous.  More and more emphasis should be laid on the fact that with the use of up to date equipment, the change in the design of boats, all the modern aids in relation to weather forecasting, etc., these hazards are being considerably reduced, and it is possible to provide much greater comfort on our boats for fishermen today. I know that the bigger trawlers have now even got central heating, and I am sure that must have led to a complete transformation of the conditions which existed for our fishermen over the years.</P>
    <P>It is quite easy to see that in almost all types of fishing there is room for considerable expansion.  I have been interested for some time in the establishment of a fishmeal industry on the east coast, because it is with the east coast that I am most in touch as a Deputy.  I know that a considerable amount of exploratory work has been done on the possibility of providing the raw material for a fishmeal factory on the east coast.  I know also that it is very desirable that we should have such a factory.  In the past we have been importing on average about £½ million worth of fishmeal every year. As a result of the fairly detailed exploratory work which has been carried <Col N="284" /> out on the east coast over a period of 12 months, there is ample evidence to indicate that all the conditions are there to justify such an industry.</P>
    <P>As I say, I have been interested in this for some time.  I have been fairly closely associated with an effort to get one firm to establish such an industry. I was very pleased to find that Bord Iascaigh Mhara went about this investigation in a very businesslike way. They employed an expert skipper from Denmark and put this skipper on a boat with, I think, five or six or perhaps more local boats &mdash; approximately 50 foot boats &mdash; fishing on the east coast for industrial fish only.  These fishermen were completely uninitiated into this type of fishing.  I believe that the normal crew for one of these boats is about four or five members.  They introduced a system of fishing for this type of fish in which two boats worked together, and the number of crew members was reduced to five in that way. I believe that the average intake of these boats ranged from five to ten tons per boat, per day, over a period of 12 months.</P>
    <P>There are quite an amount of both sprat and sand eels to be found along the coast running from Dundalk to Arklow.  Apparently sand eels are available for a short period only.  They are available in very big quantities for about three months of the year.  Sprat which are also suitable raw material for fishmeal are available the whole year round.  The quantities of industrial fish caught by these boats during the 12 month period were ample justification and ample evidence of the fact that the raw material is there.  The reduction of the crew members needed to man each boat meant that the number of boats required for industrial fishing are there and are prepared to fish for this purpose.  Apparently there was some difficulty originally in convincing them that this was a worthwhile proposition but, after running the scheme for an experimental period of 12 months, during which the fishermen were paid an average of £9 per ton for their catch, they are extremely anxious to continue with this type of industrial fishing and to exclude all other fishing.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="285" /> The investment is fairly heavy, but so also are the profits in such an industry.  To process something in the region of 16,000 tons of fish into fishmeal would require a capital expenditure of £¼ million, but a unit half that size would be viable.  As I say, it is a good business proposition. I understand there are some firms interested in it, or at least nibbling at it and considering it.  I should like to say to the Minister that if they do not reach a decision fairly soon this is an obvious place where there should be State intervention and State investment. Some sort of State or semi-State company should be set up to exploit an industry which is obviously well worth while and should be followed up.  I do not know how it is that we do not seem to be able to make the progress that is made in other places in relation to industrial fishing.  There are dozens of fishmeal factories in Denmark, but it seems that we have found great difficulty in operating one fishmeal factory here.  There seems to be no reason why our efforts cannot be expanded in this field.</P>
    <P>Another thing which slowed up this experiment was that even though the income from this type of fishing was considerable there were no unloading facilities on the east coast for this type of fish.  For other purposes, for trout farms and mink farms and that type of thing there is a certain amount of this sprat fishing going on.  For a couple of years now I have been agitating to get a proper fish unloader installed at one of the ports along the east coast, but we are as far from that as we ever were.  We talk about investment in this industry.  This unloader costs in the region of £2,000.  We have got promises and promises, but there is no indication that we are going to get it.  I hope that with a new Minister in charge of Fisheries this small piece of equipment which is of great importance to the fishermen will be supplied.  This agitation should not have to go on for a long period.</P>
    <P>In the course of his statement the Minister referred to the development of our harbours, and to the selection of four major harbours for development. <Col N="286" /> He said that work was in progress in three of them.  This scheme was decided on about three years or so ago.  The Minister did not say how much money has been expended up to date.  Perhaps he would do so when replying.  It is a very small but important matter.  This work is going extremely slowly, perhaps because money has been scarce, but it does not get over the fact that the facilities at some harbours are deplorably poor.</P>
    <P>I went out to Howth to have a look at the situation there.  It is quite close to my constituency.  I saw the fish being loaded from one boat to the next and from that boat to another, and eventually on to the quay.  It is deplorable that such a situation should be allowed to continue.  Again, in relation to the development of the harbour at Skerries, which is a tidal harbour and which could be converted into quite a decent harbour at low cost, the talk has been going on for years.  People have been talking about it for 20 years and a colleague of the Minister from my constituency has been telling the people every year that it will be done.  Perhaps harbour development is really not relevant to the Estimate but it is an important part of the fishing industry.</P>
    <P>There is reference in the Minister's statement to the proposed handing over of the processing factories to a private concern and perhaps it would be a good thing if the Minister gave us more information about this important decision.  I have received a lot of criticism from various people implying all sorts of motives to the Minister in this respect.  Naturally I do not accept all of these criticisms as being correct or anything like it, but it would prevent this sort of criticism developing if, at the time such a decision is made, the terms of the handover and the reasons for taking this decision were given in some detail.</P>
    <P>I know that what the Minister has said is true, that this has been the intention for some considerable time&mdash; that it is well known that it was the intention that An Bord Iascaigh Mhara should get out of this kind of <Col N="287" /> thing and concentrate on development generally.  Apparently An Bord Iascaigh Mhara were showing a loss all the time on these processing factories. We should be told why that was so. I feel sure that they are very efficient people in An Bord Iascaigh Mhara. What then were the factors which operated against them which from what we can hear do not seem to affect the private concern who are prepared to go in and take over these factories and operate them, no doubt at a profit?  We must assume that they will and that perhaps they have resources available to them that were not available to An Bord Iascaigh Mhara when they were trying to operate the factories&mdash;that the private firms have means of ensuring a continuity of supplies that was not available to the Board.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to something that has got a considerable amount of publicity during the past year, something which the Minister dealt with today in some detail, the salmon disease. The Minister told us today it has been fairly well established by the experts that the cause of this disease is not columnaris.  The Minister will remember that the experts who first went to work on this disease were three people who could certainly be described as experts on this disease and they said beyond yea or nay that it was columnaris. There has now being a change of opinion.  I do not know if the original people are still part of the team and whether they are now convinced that they are at this time on the right track and that heretofore they were wrong.</P>
    <P>I have in my possession a copy of a very important letter sent to the Minister last year by the secretary of the Waterville Angling Protection Association in relation to this disease, requesting that something be done about it.  I think this letter should be put on the records of the House because of the fact that what was forecast in it seems to have happened in the time that has intervened.  The letter states:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="288" /> Dear Mr. Minister,</P>
    <P>As you are aware, a number of prosecutions were taken by the Kerry Board of Conservators last autumn against Rainbow Ltd., Dromkare, who operate under licence from your Department, in respect of excessive abstraction of water from the Cummeragh River for their fish farm, and gross pollution of Lough Currane in the area adjacent to the outflow.</P>
    <P>Evidence was given on these matters by, amongst others:</P>
    <P>H.D. Thornton, H.Sc., ARC SC.I., Public Analyst Dublin City and County, J.R. Harris, M.A., Demonstrator, TCD, Dr. V. Collins, D.Sc., Edinburgh University, M.Sc. California University, Principal Scientific Officer to the Freshwater Biological Association, Great Britain.</P>
    <P>There should be no doubt about the qualifications of these people.</P>
    <P>Dr. Margaret Browne, B.A., M.A., D.Ph. Cambridge, Lecturer in Zoology, Oxford University, Biological Consultant to Salmon and Trout Association in Great Britain since 1956.</P>
    <P>This evidence was conclusive and not challenged by the only witness produced by the defence, to everyone's surprise, a young biologist from your Department, who undertook to report to his superiors the evidence of those experts.  The tests were carried out on the bed of the lake and were exhaustive.  They showed that, for a considerable area, all healthy organisms, which would be expected in normal water, were absent, having either died from pollution or fled before it, the only living organisms found being those that thrive in gross sewage conditions. On the other hand in the water of the Cummeragh River above the fish farm, the bed of the river contained these healthy organisms in abundance, but none of the unhealthy varieties that exist in sewage conditions such as were found in the lake in the area of the exit from the fish farm.  However, Mr. Minister, you have no doubt been informed of this detailed evidence.  Suffice to say <Col N="289" /> that the tests disclosed massive pollution, much in excess of what is normally regarded as dangerous to fish life.  The drying up of the spawning river by Rainbow Limited was not denied.  The Justice convicted on all thirty summonses and in fining the company expressed his regret that he had not power to grant an injunction, so seriously did he regard the evidence he had heard.  This occurred early in October last.  As you are aware there are ten prosecutions pending at the suit of the conservators in respect of alleged offences since then.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>This seems to be an excessively long quotation and the Deputy will appreciate that long quotations are not in order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a very important matter.  No action appears to have been taken on this communication which forecast exactly what has happened in this respect.  It is very important it be put on record because of the failure of the Minister&mdash;in this case a new Minister&mdash;to take action. Apparently this letter has not been replied to and there is a considerable grievance on the part not only of Kerry Board of Conservators but of every board in the country because of the Department's failure to take this disease as seriously as it should have been taken, and to take the necessary and effective steps to bring about a solution of the problem.  With your permission, I consider it important to finish this:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been informed that your Department has exerted considerable pressure on the Board of Conservators to have these prosecutions shelved.  Meantime, since October, 1964, the fish have been rotting and dying in the lake.  This year has been the worst of all.  We bring these matters to your attention, and add that this deadly disease, which has been identified in Waterville as columnaris (as you are aware) has now spread to all the main southern rivers.  This was forecast by Dr. Collins in evidence, when explaining that fish becoming infected at <Col N="290" /> Waterville and which were able to do so, would hasten back to the sea and look for other rivers in which to spawn, thus spreading the fatal disease throughout the Irish rivers. We, many of whose livelihoods depend on the world-famous fishing at Waterville, put the following questions to you and would ask for an early reply:</P>
    <P>1.  Why is this pressure being brought to bear by your Department on the conservators, to stave off prosecutions which it is their clear duty to bring, and which they wish to bring to a conclusion?</P>
    <P>2.  Why does your Department continue to frustrate the Board of Conservators in their efforts to enforce the Fishery Laws?  Is it not the duty of the Department to assist and not to harass the Board in the due enforcement of these laws?</P>
    <P>3.  Why is your Department apparently so zealous to prevent these matters coming into court?</P>
    <P>4.  Is your Department quite indifferent to the fate of Waterville Fisheries and the rivers of the south, if not eventually of the entire country?</P>
    <P>5.  Why has this extremely dangerous situation been permitted to develop over the past two years in full knowledge of and in spite of the Conservators' repeated and urgent warnings and protests to your Department?  Any regular inspection must have disclosed the state of affairs existing in Waterville.</P>
    <P>As you are aware, this disease started in Waterville.  The experts have given their considered opinion that, unless checked, the disease might well damage the fishing in many rivers.  There appear to be indications that this is now happening. We, whose futures are at stake and who may be forced to emigrate, ask you to be quite open with us in explaining the attitude of your Department and their apparent anxiety to prevent the enforcement of the Fishery Laws in Waterville, <Col N="291" /> regardless of the consequences to us and, indeed, to the entire southern fisheries.</P>
    <P>If half of what is said in the course of that communication is correct it indicates that there was not sufficient concern for the spread of this disease and that the measures one would normally expect to be taken were not, in fact, taken.  At least steps were not taken as quickly as they should have been taken to prevent the spread of this disease.  As we now know we have this disease in 14 or 15 of our important rivers.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the co-operation which his Department have received from all the boards throughout the country.  I have never expressed an opinion on this subject that I did not say that every board in this country condemned the Minister for his failure to deal expeditiously with this disease.  I realise all the difficulties which exist.  They must be immense but communications must have fallen down in the Department, if the Department were doing everything that was possible, because they failed to convince the people who were most interested and most concerned in the matter.  I have not seen any change from the views held by the various boards during the year.</P>
    <P>Since the Inland Fisheries Trust was formed away back in 1951, and expanded in 1956, they have been doing wonderful work.  They are very short of capital and the increase in this year's allowance, something like £5,000, is still completely inadequate and will restrict the work they can do to a considerable extent.  It is quite obvious that there is enormous scope for development in their particular field.  As I said, they have done excellent work having regard to the capital available to them.</P>

      <P>I have not the date. Unfortunately, it is not dated.  I am sorry I cannot give that.  I went down for a day's fishing to the Corrib.  I think it was the second last day of the year for fishing.  I met some of the local fishing interests there.  They had some grouses which I felt were reasonable enough in the circumstances described to me.  They operate a fishing hatchery there.  Apparently there were some complaints about the inadequacy of it. An investigation was carried out by the Inland Fisheries Trust in order to bring the hatchery up to date and provide the Association with two rearing ponds as well.  This would require an investment in the region of £16,000.  It was felt for a long time that this money would be forthcoming and that this development work would take place. Apparently it is the cause of considerable disappointment that this has not happened.</P>
      <P>The local fishing interests would be completely satisfied if they could get about £4,000 and if the expenditure of the £16,000 in the present circumstances of shortage of capital was phased out perhaps over a period of four years.  If £4,000 were given to them immediately it would enable them to improve the hatcheries sufficiently and give them one rearing pond.  They could then carry on until the total expenditure took place over the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are 240 boats on the Corrib which are owned mainly by uneconomic holders on the shores of the Corrib. Those people apparently, on an average, earn something in the region of £150 per annum.  This is a very important supplement to their income. They certainly need, to keep the lake supplied with stock, something in the region of 300,000 fingerlings annually. They also complain that they are not getting the support and assistance they used to get from the Inland Fisheries Trust.  They say that in the past they had as many as four people working on the Corrib keeping down predators and doing all the necessary work associated <Col N="293" /> with the improvement of fishing on the Corrib.  They say the number is now reduced to one.  I hope the Minister will look into this matter and will meet them as far as possible because the Corrib is developing into a considerable tourist amenity area.  There are five hotels there and a sixth, with 60 bedrooms, is being built at the moment.  Altogether there are in the region 300 beds and this brings business and spreads income in an area in which it is badly needed.  I hope the Minister will bear that in mind when considering expenditure in this field.</P>
    <P>The Minister also referred to the difficulties which exist in Dunmore East and which have existed there for some time.  All of us who worked in that area in the recent past learned something about this.  Like the Minister, I think it is disappointing and regrettable that this disagreement continues and that no solution can be found to it. It appears that the main grouse which the local fishermen have is that the Northern Ireland fishermen are enjoying subsidies which they do not enjoy and on that account, it is unfair competition. As well as that, they have facilities to fish in British territorial waters which are denied to them in other seasons.  I wonder if the extent of those subsidies could not be examined and something done to even out the position because everybody is anxious to see a more prosperous industry in Dunmore East with all the necessary facilities provided for it. There are as many people in the area, if not more, who are in favour of allowing the Northern Ireland boats to fish as there are opposed to it.  One pretty big fish merchant there is apparently completely debarred from handling fish.  Everything possible should be done to iron out these difficulties.  The position seems to be at a standstill at present and that is too bad.</P>
    <P>In regard to the position generally, I am disappointed that the size of the Vote this year is so small.  As a result of the exploratory work which has been and is being done, and which is increasing every year, we have sufficient knowledge to indicate that there is scope for considerable expansion and for very much increased investment in <Col N="294" /> the fishing industry.  It is disappointing to those of us in the House and, indeed, when the Estimate is publicised outside, it will be also a matter of disappointment to people interested in the industry generally, that there has not been a much greater increase in the size of the Vote.  In fact, this year's amount represents a decrease but to some extent there are reasons given for this. If we are to take the industry seriously, we should contemplate a very much greater expenditure.  As I say, the evidence indicates that there is an opening for developing the industry. The number of new boats this year is encouraging.  According to the Minister, there are 31 new boats and four second-hand boats and this must have its effect in the years ahead in the form of increased landings.  However, the one important and limiting factor is the number of trained people available to man these boats and it is disappointing that these are not coming forward in greater numbers.  The reasons for this call for further examination because the whole future of the industry depends on getting more and more people into it.</P>
    <P>One fact which strikes me as peculiar, and it may be due to the promotional work which has been done in regard to the home consumption of fish, is in regard to the imports of fish which seem to be increasing.  In 1962, imports were valued at £596,536 and in 1965, the imports were in excess of £1 million.  I know that even countries which have developed their fishing industry as fully as possible and which have a thriving industry do at certain times of the year import considerable quantities of fish.  Apparently this is normal in order to keep up continuity of supply.  Another point is that there was in existence a very valuable repair service and I should like to know if this service has gone out of existence. By means of this repair service, boats were examined to ensure that they were seaworthy.  This was regarded as a very valuable service to the people in the industry and it would be a great pity if it has been abandoned.  If it has been abandoned, perhaps the Minister would tell us why.</P>
    <P>The fact that the limit of our territorial <Col N="295" /> waters has been increased to six miles and eventually will be extended to 12 miles, is a further indication of the scope available for developing the industry.  The preservation of these fishing grounds, if we are able to protect them, should add considerably to the income from fishing as a whole. I was pleased to hear the Minister announcing that repayments on boats bought on hire-purchase terms have been very satisfactory and I was also glad to see that the returns from fishing have improved to the extent that these people have been enabled to take advantage of the increased percentage which is allowed where the repayments are made within five years of the 15-year period.  A reduction of ten per cent is allowed on the cost of the boat as a result of the early repayment of the loan and recently I saw a reference to the considerable number of skippers who have been able to meet this target and take advantage of this ten per cent reduction.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann is of opinion that the Electricity Supply Board should not increase its charges to domestic consumers by seven per cent in view of the undue hardship which this price increase would create together with the inflationary situation which such an increase would initiate; and also considers that the ESB special charges should be abolished.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>When speaking on this motion last week, the Minister for Transport and Power repeated something which he is forever preaching. He said that wage increases are the cause of price increases and he neglected <Col N="296" /> to indicate the real cause of this difficulty.  It is extremely unfair of the Minister for Transport and Power to continue to carry on this argument.  He knows well that increases are brought about by many other things.  For instance, he neglected to refer to the fact that taxation brought about increases, particularly the purchase tax, for which his Government are responsible.  The Minister has a penchant for talking down to working-class people but his action in connection with the seven per cent increase is indefensible, I submit, for a host of reasons, and particularly for the reason that last year the Minister admits the ESB had a surplus of over £243,000.  He went on to say that if we had less rain in 1965-66 the ESB would have lost more. It would seem to me that the Minister is looking into the future, as he is accustomed to do, and has now taken unto himself the authority to indicate that we shall have less rain next year. One might almost believe he has consulted with the &ldquo;rainmaker&rdquo;.  This attitude will not suffice.  If we are to have regard to projections, we must not forget that the ESB will have four new stations in operation next year. Consequently, there will be more electricity consumed and the more consumed, the more the prospects of making a profit increase rather than diminish.</P>
      <P>When we think seriously in terms of utilisation of electricity, we must remember that the Minister is responsible for preventing more electricity from being used.  I refer to the special service charges.  It is reasonable to assume that if these special charges were not imposed, there would be a greater desire to use electricity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said already, one thing in which the Minister was wrong was his action in putting on this seven per cent increase without referring to the Department of Industry and Commerce.  We can recall the many speeches in which the Minister spoke about all the caution that should be exercised and we must bear in mind also what he did and what heed is taken of what he says and did.  Were it not for this lead given by the Minister, I do not <Col N="297" /> think we would have this truculent move on the part of the flour millers in the past few days.  Obviously, they thought that if the Minister for Transport and Power could have an increase of seven per cent in ESB charges without getting prior sanction, they could do the same.  Perhaps this is the type of inflationary encouragement of which the Minister should take serious notice.  From these benches we have repeatedly objected to the way in which increases have been extended, particularly in regard to ESB charges, because we know, and our motion indicates, the need and desire that something should be done to relieve rather than to discourage domestic consumers.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Booth spoke on this matter, his approach was that people could make arrangements to combat the difficulty by using less electricity. The people who are asked to do that, in so far as they are domestic consumers, are people who need electricity.  They have been encouraged to change from other types of lighting, heating and cooking to electricity and we now find a Fianna Fáil Deputy advocating that there should be less electricity used. Of course, people in his group can afford all the electricity they require because they are in the employer classes and can pay their ESB bills without worrying too much about seven per cent.</P>
    <P>The Minister said it was &ldquo;only&rdquo; seven per cent, as did Deputy Booth, but the extraordinary thing is that there was an outcry when members of the workingclasses who were organised tried to get increases of approximately seven per cent.  Apparently, there is nothing wrong when this is done by the Minister.  I hold that the Minister is premature in the matter of increasing ESB charges.  That is so even when you go on results of the previous year, which we can see were not bad.  The Minister has not yet indicated why he sees next year as being bad, why there will be a likelihood of or need for the absorption of the seven per cent increase.  He has not, to my mind, made a case for it.  Perhaps he is keeping it in reserve for the time when he goes to the Department of Industry and Commerce or when the ESB go <Col N="298" /> there to advocate that the increase should continue.  This is like locking the stable door when the horse has gone.  It is something that has happened and there is little likelihood, if any, that the Department of Industry and Commerce will not approve what the Minister has set out to do.</P>
    <P>If we look into the future without thinking in terms of rainmaking but having regard to improvements that have been advocated in the ESB, we must remember that the four new stations that are to be put into operation are put there for a purpose.  Or are we to assume they will be put there but not operated?  I understood that the more electricity is produced and the more consumed, the better.  We want people to use electricity.  It would appear that the Minister's action will deter people from using electricity.  We have been advocating that this charge should not be imposed on domestic consumers.  The way out of the morass in which the Minister may find himself is not to advocate that people should put out the light or that they should ignore the baby crying for a bottle. These things cannot and should not be done.  The Minister's action in this matter is extremely wrong and unfair. Certainly, having regard to his reputation for being the knowing one and talking down to the people, the example which he has set in this matter is extremely bad.  If everybody outside State Departments is going to take this lead from the Minister, you can forget about the Prices Act.  The Minister has certainly encouraged the flour millers.  I earnestly hope they do not get away with it, but there will be others to follow.  It is only natural to say: &ldquo;The Minister for Transport and Power can do this; so can we&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I know it would be too much to ask the Minister to meet us in some way in regard to this motion.  An acknowledgment that he made a mistake would be an admission on the part of the Minister which he has never been known to make.  If the Minister were to act in a reasonable fashion and give effect to what he says when he talks down to people as to how they should behave, he would go back to the situation <Col N="299" /> where there was no seven per cent and save a considerable number <Col N="300" /> of workingclass people from this vicious increase.</P>

      <P>I referred earlier to the transfer of the processing factories to a private concern and asked the Minister to give detailed reasons for this transfer. I forgot to ask him to state particularly the reason why it was decided not to hand over these factories to a fishermen's co-operative society.  I know there is a co-operative society only in Killybegs, but I believe there was a request that these factories be handed over to a co-operative rather than to a private enterprise firm. I can appreciate that the co-operative may not have had the resources necessary for the full utilisation and development of these factories.  If that is so, that is complete justification for it; but I think an effort should be made to explain to the fishermen why this concession was not given to co-operative effort in the fishing industry.  Everybody is anxious to see co-operation develop amongst the fishermen, and this sort of explanation should be given to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say a word about pollution. If we are to preserve, develop and expand the potential of our inland fisheries, we must have regard to the importance of preventing pollution of the rivers generally.  The present Minister is in a good position to appreciate how this can be done.  He has been <Col N="302" /> Minister for Local Government for some considerable time, and I am sure he was confronted on many occasions with problems arising from the use of treatment works in sewage disposal. There should be complete co-operation between the Department of Local Government and the Department of Fisheries in regard to this matter.  We all realise it is extremely important that we have the maximum industrial development should be weighed in the balance against this fishing amenity we should all be anxious to preserve, develop and expand.  In inland areas where it is proposed to set up sewage treatment works, every care and precaution should be taken to ensure that the operation of those works is so effective as to render the effluent safe for fishing in the adjoining rivers.</P>
    <P>Speaking generally, the Minister's statement was an encouraging one.  It shows we are taking the necessary steps to bring about that development. The only thing is that we are taking those steps much too slowly.  I am afraid we are dragging our feet about many matters in respect of which we should be making greater progress. The Minister gave us a fairly detailed outline of future intentions and future development prospects.  In the course of this account, he referred to the importance of establishing a quality image for our own fish products. Nobody will disagree with that.  Some time ago, in going through old documents, I came across a report in <i>Young Ireland</i>, August 22nd, 1921, and it is a remarkable fact that they were thinking along similar lines then, even though development has been so slow ever since.  The Minister for Fisheries at the time was a man named Etchingham.  He reported on fisheries to the Dáil.  He spoke about the importance of organising fisheries into co-ops, and improving marketing by better handling, packaging, and so on. He spoke of a national brand which would be a guarantee of quality and quantity.  We have had that sort of statement here as far back as 1921 but unfortunately we have had very little development since.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="303" /> The same report goes on to say that the Dublin committee, having charge of a fund to assist the people of Gorumna, requested the Department to purchase a motor-boat and that this was done.  It adds that the Lord Mayor and Alderman Cosgrave, TD, honorary secretary of the committee, lent valuable assistance.  I hope that the account we got today of the prospects for development and of the good intentions will mean that we shall not have to wait much longer for that development and that we shall see considerable progress in this sector of the economy in the very near future.</P>

      <P>In rising to speak in the debate on the Estimate for Fisheries, I should like, at the outset, to compliment the Minister on the very informative document he presented to us today.  However, there are some points with which I cannot find myself in agreement, particularly in relation to fishing off the Kerry coast.</P>
      <P>I do think that, in this year of 1966, we need a much more forward outlook and more progress in the fishing industry. There is vast wealth to be reaped from the sea around our coasts and particularly off the coast of Kerry, but unfortunately the necessary forward thinking to develop this wealth does not seem to be taking place.  I believe that, within a short time, we could be reaping at least £2 million out of fish caught off the Kerry coast which would give employment to between 3,000 and 4,000 of our people.  This is a very important industry if we could have it developed as it should be developed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was rather amazed that the Minister and the speaker before me should say that it is necessary to induce some of our part-time fishermen to become wholetime fishermen.  The first necessity is to get wholetime employment for what are called the part-time fishermen. In Dingle, we have 17 of the 50 foot boats, 13 of the 30 foot boats, 17 of the 50 foot boats in Cahirciveen, and so on, which are capable of landing at least six times as much fish as they do.  In actual fact, what is happening is that when fish are running plentiful, <Col N="304" /> those fishermen have to put up their boats because there is no means ashore to take in the fish they could land and handle or process it.  I could never understand why processing plants were erected in other parts of the country while Dingle, which has the largest fishing fleet, was left without one.  All too often this year, I have seen our boats having to pull in although mackerel were running in shoals and could have been taken in in hundreds of tons.  The tragic fact is that the fishermen had to come ashore and leave that wealth behind them.</P>
    <P>I was amazed to learn from some continental businessmen&mdash;some Czechoslovakians who were here on a trade mission&mdash;that they would take all the mackerel we could send across to them, provided it was frozen and handled in a particular way.  It is astonishing that An Bord Iascaigh Mhara have never tried to develop such a market or tried to induce the Government or the Department concerned to have the necessary plants&mdash;they are not expensive&mdash;established to enable this type of fishing to be developed.  It is true that we have a plant in the Cahirciveen area.  I have gone closely into the figures with the people concerned and I am informed that the charges are far too high to induce fishermen, particularly the Dingle people, to allow them to handle their fish.  It was built to handle large quantities of fish.  The freezing costs are far too high because they are working to a capacity of about only 20 to 22 per cent.  This is a drawback to our Dingle people, particularly, because handling charges can work out very expensive.  They have to deliver the fish to Cahirciveen and take it back again and the cost runs into as much as £10 and £12 a ton, which is a charge they cannot afford.</P>
    <P>This wealth of fish off our coasts must be recognised and handled and much more progress will have to be made in the matter.  In his opening statement, the Minister has shown that there have been increased landings from time to time but I do not accept that as being sufficient or anywhere near what we should be dealing with <Col N="305" /> now.  Hitherto, it was quite easy to show increases on the landings of fish because such landings were at an all-time low level.  The boats we already have off the Kerry coast are capable of landing, according to my information, anything up to £500,000 worth of fish if handling facilities such as I have indicated were available.  That fish, processed and marketed, would reach £1 million on the export market. Something will have to be done to tackle this problem immediately and satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>I am afraid our eyes are turned all too often to the very big boats that are spoken of as necessary for going out to the Continental Shelf to catch the fish that abound there.  However, many fishermen along the Kerry coast have pointed out to me that there is no necessity to go for that fish because our navy, such as it is, is trying to keep foreign fishermen out of our inshore fishing waters.  The people who are geared and equipped to fish on the Continental Shelf are trying to come into our waters which shows that there is plenty of fish off our coast, if we had the means to handle it.</P>
    <P>We have about 600 small boats off the Kerry coast and the fishermen are either wholetime or part-time.  The 30-foot boats with engines are considered the most suitable for the people concerned and I should like to see that aspect developed to a greater extent. It is the boat that would prove the best asset along the Kerry coast for lobster and any type of fishing because the people concerned are able to earn sufficient to pay their way, which does not happen with the larger boats.  We have plenty of fishermen and plenty of recruits available to go into fishing along the Kerry coast but until we can handle the vast amount of fish that can be landed there we cannot induce more of these people to go into the industry.  They would be taking on a boat and a liability because the only time they can get a price for what they have is when fish are scarce.  By and large, they have to pull up the boats when fish are plentiful.  That is a dreadful state of affairs.  There is room for development by way of cold storage, cold freezing plant and the necessary <Col N="306" /> processing plant.  If and when we get established in Dingle we would make progress which would be of help to the rest of the country as regards the development of the fishing industry. The people I mentioned are prepared to take all the mackerel we can get at a good price in 500-ton cargo lots.  We must have 500 tons at a time.  There is no way of getting that without the necessary facilities I mention.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of our fishing industry which is very valuable in my own area of Killorglin and which is left out completely is the mussel fishing beds at Cromane.  If I may say so, inexpert advice and bad handling prevented the mussel planting there from developing as it should have developed. Four years ago we had three processing mussel plants.  We were down to one last year and this year we have none. There are no mussels to process for development.  When I came to this House five years ago I put forward a scheme for mussel development.  We got a certain amount of money.  The first year we looked for £5,000; the second year £4,000 and £3,000 the third year.  This would have planted sufficient beds and got us going forward. A limited amount of money was put in and I was informed by advisers from the Department concerned that in 1964, 36,000 bags of mussels would be available plus the natural outcrop which would give 50,000 bags of mussels from the planting put down three years before.  In actual fact, the amount we reaped for that year was 9,000 bags.  That goes for the expert advice we had.</P>
    <P>I had enough experience of this type of shellfish to get the Department to plant the mussels in the inner harbour. In the outer bay the depredations of the starfish and the large amount of shifting sand in that area eventually swamped the beds that were planted. As a result, we have none at the moment.  We have a large acreage that can be planted in Castlemaine Harbour which would possibly yield 200,000 bags of mussels if they were farmed and handled properly.  This would give £200,000 per year to the smallholders there, and would keep 200 to 300 families employed.  This would be an <Col N="307" /> addition to the earnings on their smallholdings.</P>
    <P>The industry seems to have gone to seed and something must be done about it.  We must face up to the position in our fishing industry.  We ask for Department experts and why should this type of thing happen when the opportunities are there to develop the industry?  The fishing industry should be developed on a national scale.  There is an unlimited market for the right kind of shellfish in England and on the Continent.  We have the means, the boats and the expert technical advice but there is a necessity for some financial injection there.  We are without this type of fishing industry which in a small, poor area would have been a very large financial asset this year.</P>
    <P>The salmon fishing in this area is of immense importance, but particularly in the river Laune where we get a very large intake of salmon.  However, I must comment on the new scheme of licences.  The 600 rod fishermen who operate there from the different angling clubs have to pay £1,800 and in addition the 45 boats in the estuary have to pay something around £300.  The total contribution towards the expenses of the fishery board would come to £2,000.  Their catch amounts to one-sixth of the entire landings, whereas the local big fishing company with a total of five boats have to pay something around £30 landing five-sixths of the fish. There is inequality there and there should be a levelling off somewhere. Very big companies should be made contribute their part.</P>
    <P>Another thing that is causing a certain amount of uneasiness in the area is that individuals are allowed to take vast stretches of the river if they pay for it accordingly.  In the new Act some form of tax or charge for those people who are taking up long stretches of the river should be imposed.  Some of those people rent up to one-half of the entire river and get the best of the fishing.  It is unfair to the anglers who are excluded because of this type of development.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="308" /> Getting back to our fishermen, it is very necessary that proper repair services should be established, particularly in the Dingle area.  Many of our people have had to pay through the nose for repairs carried out to the boats there by the floating technicians sent down from time to time.  There are also different types of engines in as many as four or five boats in the entire fleet, and this is a great disadvantage. It is very necessary to have a repair scheme down there and to have a complete set of spare parts for one or two boats.  In that way our fishermen would not be held up as they have been in the past.  I mentioned a case in this House before about a man, who has since been repossessed, whose boat was in dock nine out of 12 months in one year.  Indeed, it had to go in for repairs six times in one year.  That is too much of an imposition on our fishermen.  It should be looked into and those men who put their time and hard work into trying to earn a living from the sea should be given a repair service somewhere around the Kerry coast to which they could take their boats and have them fitted out quickly. This would be of immense help to them.</P>
    <P>By and large, the Minister's document is a very good one and if I have anything to say it is that the Minister is not going far enough in the way of developing the landing of fish which abound on the Kerry coast.  I hope something will be done in this regard in the near future and that a development team of experts will be set up to examine the possibilities of the maximum development of this great source of wealth.  It would be a step in helping to keep our people on the Kerry coast from the emigrant ship.  There should be a development of part-time fishing.  By this means a man with a small holding can supplement his earnings.  That is what was done in the past.  Fifty and 100 years ago, it was the people on the small holdings who went out in currachs who landed the bulk of the fish.  That fact should not be overlooked.  If the people on the small holdings had engined boats, they could supplement their incomes and develop a natural asset.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>We have before us a Vote:</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £793,400 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st of March, 1967, for salaries and expenses in connection with Sea and Inland Fisheries including sundry grants-in-aid.</P>
      <P>The fact that we have the Estimate before us in the second week in December justifies comment made in the press during the past week as to whether in dealing with these matters Dáil Éireann is not becoming almost completely unrealistic.  While Standing Orders were amended by agreement to provide for this type of exercise, when one comes to think about it in the light of experience, it is obvious that we are discussing expenditure, 70 per cent of which will have been made at this point and, no matter how eloquent Deputies might be as regards the justification for the expenditure or the need to increase the expenditure under any heading, little can be done.  We have an Estimate before us now, as we have had others, for a year, nine months of which have already gone and in respect of expenditure which has already not only been committed but, no doubt, has been made by now.  We have had a speech from the Minister which is a combination of Estimates covering a period and part of another period and including some forecasts of planning for the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the first comments I should like to make arises from a query in regard to some of the figures given in the Minister's projection for the future. The Minister has told us that for the nine months of this year the total value of landings, including shellfish, is £1,424,539 as against £1,233,114 for the corresponding period last year.  The Minister goes on to indicate that it is planned to expand the industry between now and 1970 to the point at which the total value of landings will be £4 million, that is, roughly, an increase of 150 per cent.  According to the Minister, there was a 16 per cent increase last year.  If that figure of 16 per cent is multiplied by the number of years <Col N="310" /> remaining until 1970, the result will be somewhat short of the 150 per cent increase required, unless, of course, the Minister is expecting substantial increases in cost.  The weight might not necessarily increase to that extent but if the Minister is anticipating an increase in value, his target might possibly be easier of realisation.  As I understand it, this estimation was possibly based on the targets in the Second Programme for Economic Expansion which, as we were advised in the House not too long ago, have not generally been met this year.</P>
    <P>The second comment I should like to make arises from the comment by the Minister that the increase in the value of landings of herrings in 1966 has not been as high as was anticipated.  He indicated that that was possibly due to the regrettable difficulties at Dunmore East.  I certainly would not like to say anything to exacerbate that problem but I wonder whether everything possible has been done to try to resolve it.  The Minister might help the House if he would indicate, from the results of his inquiries and investigations and information he has, the comparative values and measures of assistance, both financial and technical, made available to our fishermen and to the fishermen from northern ports because there is some general public concern as to whether, in fact, the level of such assistance available to our fishermen is as high as that available in the North.  I do not know.  Therefore, I am putting the query.</P>
    <P>Has the Minister secured, by discussion or otherwise, the co-operation of his opposite number in the North of Ireland in the provision of facilities for our fishermen to fish off the Northern coast?  Of course, a problem might well arise because in the majority of cases the boats owned by the fishermen in this part of the country are neither large enough nor modernly equipped to enable them to fish so far away from their home base.  While hoping with the Minister that a solution will be found to any disputes there have been, I should like to get information in regard to that matter and an assurance from the Minister that <Col N="311" /> he will do what he can to help in the situation.</P>
    <P>The Minister tells us that four second-hand boats, approximately 70 feet in length, were purchased by fishermen with the help of finance from Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  Is this a new departure?  Were there any special conditions laid down in respect of the purchase of second-hand boats?  I understand that during the past year there were possibilities of 70-foot boats being purchased by people who were actually working in the fishing industry but their efforts were not too successful. I wonder whether any specific conditions were laid down in relation to the purchase of second-hand boats. Were conditions laid down that fishermen desiring to purchase boats must initially opt for new boats even of a smaller size?</P>
    <P>Deputies will be somewhat disappointed by the absence of any specific information regarding the reduction in the number of boys admitted to training during the year.  The figures given in the Minister's speech were: 54 boys in training in 1965 and 38 boys admitted to training during the year.  In an industry which is so important to this country, providing, as it does, a livelihood for thousands of people and providing, as it should, not only an increase in exports but also helping to provide fish in increasing quantities for the home market, it is somewhat disappointing that there has been a reduction in the number of boys admitted to training.  Is this because the industry is continuing to be considered by those who might normally be attracted to it as a stepsister of other industries?  I presume most of the boys come from areas in which fishing has been a tradition.  Is it because the youths in question feel that the industry is not offering them not only reasonable rewards in times of plenty but reasonable security and opportunities having regard to the risk which is the common fortune of everyone who goes to sea in a fishing boat? I hope we will get a more adequate explanation from the Minister of the fact that there were 54 boys in training <Col N="312" /> in 1965 and only 38 this year.  I hope we will get an indication of whether in fact this is a fall-off or not.</P>
    <P>In respect of the training of experienced fishermen the Minister says that nine fishermen qualified in 1965 and seven in 1966.  Does that mean a fall-off in experienced fishermen?  Does it mean that among the ranks of experienced fishermen there are not sufficient personnel capable of undergoing training and qualifying as skippers?  Is it that the attraction of undergoing training and taking over the responsibility is not sufficient or is it that they feel that the risk of being landed with a fairly heavy debt to pay back if they did qualify and get a boat is too great? Is it because with the uncertainty of the existing conditions they are unwilling to undertake such training?  It is quite clear that no matter what grandiose plans one may have for the fishing industry its expansion and success depend basically on the men who go to sea, and the type of boats and modern gear available to them.  After that it is a question of the facilities for disposing of the product once it has been brought back to harbour.</P>
    <P>While there is an indication that attention is being given to the development of five harbours as major harbours and others as minor harbours having regard to the importance of the industry it appears at this stage that these matters are not getting the attention they deserve and the capital expenditure was not made available early enough.  The Minister says that progress is being made in the development of Killybegs, Castletownbere and Dunmore East as major fishery harbours and there are two others, Galway and Howth.  Howth was what might be called a major fishing port&mdash;I am sure Deputy P.J. Burke can tell us that&mdash; more than 40 years ago.  There was relatively more activity at that time than there has been in recent years, although it is true that the period in which Howth practically died as a fishing centre has been passed.</P>
    <P>It is nevertheless correct to say that the facilities available in Howth are by no means satisfactory from the point of view of landing fish.  It is the common <Col N="313" /> practice, when boats come in to discharge fish, to have the fish handed across two or three boats because only a certain number can tie up alongside the quay wall.  Apart from the delay that arises from that method of unloading there is constant added risk to those engaged in the operation.  We have been advised that there are plans to develop the harbour and provide an additional pier to permit boats to discharge fish more efficiently.  We are advised that proper gear will be supplied. There will even be some primary processing.  The time has come now when something concrete should be done.  I shall not trespass on my colleague, Deputy P.J. Burke, because I am sure he will once more, as he has on so many occasions in the past, raise the particular problem of Skerries.  I am sure he will utter words of wisdom in relation to Skerries harbour and possibly a mild reproof to the Department in relation to it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not inconsiderable. The Minister referred to skippers who will be encouraged to invest in larger vessels and Irish companies which will also be encouraged to operate such vessels as part of a combined fishing, processing and marketing activity.  I should be glad if the Minister would indicate whether this will affect the livelihood, the security and the commitments entered into by skippers who have bought their own boats.  What will be the relative position of the skippers who own their own boats or who have got grants from An Bord Iascaigh Mhara and loans to purchase boats and who are now paying back those loans at the interest rates prevailing?  What will their position be in a port in which Irish companies may be operating in a combined fishing, processing and marketing arrangement?  What security will the skippers and their crews have and what guarantee will they have of getting a reasonable price for the fish they catch?  It appears to me we will have a kind of extension into the fishing industry of the supermarket, except that the companies with the <Col N="314" /> finance, the boats and the facilities to fish, to process and to market their goods will have a built-in advantage as against the skipper who has to rely on either the auctioneer or the co-operative to dispose of his catch.  Such skippers and their crews, possibly operating on a share basis, will be at a disadvantage.</P>
      <P>There appears to be in the mind of the Minister some idea that development on these lines might very well prejudice the position of those at present engaged in the fishing industry because he gives an assurance to the small fisherman in the following terms:</P>
      <P>Lest there should be any misapprehension about the effects on the smaller fisherman by the operation of the larger vessels envisaged, I want to make it clear that these larger vessels would operate mainly to provide the necessary raw material on a regular basis for the efficient operation of our processing factories, the products of which would be largely for export.</P>
      <P>The vessels referred to are vessels up to 90 feet, whereas the earlier reference is to vessels around 70 feet, and it is not quite clear whether the Department can, in fact, order things in such a way as to secure that the livelihood of those in the industry at present and those whom it is desired to attract to the industry will be reasonably protected.</P>
      <P>Reference has been made also to distribution in the Irish market.  I quote:</P>
      <P>Fish distribution in the Irish market will be rationalised so that fish is distributed efficiently from port to consumer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not so many years since we had an organisation, An Bord Iascaigh Mhara, engaged to some extent in endeavouring to organise, as part of their function, the rational distribution of fish.  A decision was made, however, by the Department to remove the buying and marketing of fish from Bord Iascaigh Mhara completely and that Bord Iascaigh Mhara would operate only as a development authority. We are told by the Minister, in <Col N="315" /> his introductory speech, that fish distribution will be rationalised so that fish can be distributed efficiently from the ports to the consumers.  He goes on to say:</P>
    <P>The programme also aims at greater involvement by fishermen's co-operatives in the marketing of their products thus ensuring that the primary producer will get a greater share of the end price.</P>
    <P>Those are excellent sentiments.  It is an excellent sentiment to indicate that the primary producer, in the case of the fish industry in particular, should get a satisfactory price for the goods he produces.  It is an excellent suggestion that those who work in the industry should get a reasonable living therefrom.  Although not stated here, it would be excellent to try to ensure that the Irish consumer, the ordinary family in the country, is able to secure fish at reasonable prices.  But it is not quite clear how it is proposed to do these things.  Certainly the Minister does not appear to make it clear. After taking away from Bord Iascaigh Mhara the responsibility for marketing or distribution, the Minister now says this Board will operate on the basis of private enterprise but will be rationalised.</P>
    <P>I think every Deputy would subscribe to the view that co-operative systems are valuable, certainly, co-operatives based on the fish industry which would secure for the fishermen reasonable returns for the work and risk in which they are involved, and which would secure fish for consumers at a reasonable price.  But I understand that in recent weeks one co-operative undertaking established for that purpose went bankrupt and was making appeals to either the Department or Bord Iascaigh Mhara for some financial assistance, because, although they had been operating for some time, they were operating against private enterprise and went bankrupt.</P>
    <P>I would be interested if, under the heading &ldquo;Development Programme&rdquo;, the Minister would indicate how one can operate a private enterprise <Col N="316" /> economy and, at the same time, rationalise fish distribution.  Is it to be done by an organisation which would handle all marketing and distribution of fish?  Evidently not; Bord Iascaigh Mhara were doing that, to some extent, and objections were lodged by private enterprise&mdash;those engaged in the marketing and selling of the fish &mdash;and, to some extent, by the fishermen themselves.  I would be interested to know if there is an answer to this problem.  In relation to the home market consumption of fish, we are told it may well be that the 13 per cent increase in the domestic consumption from 1965 to date may have arisen because the ordinary consumer in the city cannot buy meat and, while fish is dear, meat has become so expensive the ordinary housewife has to look around in desperation to try to spread her purchases.</P>
    <P>The reference to publicising of the nutritional value of fish is to be commended, as are the efforts of those concerned, even though it may well be to their own financial advantage. I refer to those engaged in the various operations such as cooking demonstrations <i>et cetera,</i> because we are all agreed upon the food value of fish. I think we are all agreed that for a country, surrounded on all sides by water, reasonable protection should be given to the inshore fisheries by the authorities and, in this connection, what is permitted to happen off the coast of this country is a disgrace. The sea fishing industry is of value from the point of view of the possibility it affords of increasing our exports, from the point of view of the possibility it should afford for the provision of abundant supplies of fish for our people at reasonable prices.</P>
    <P>Repeatedly, we have had a situation where the fish off the shores of our country are being hijacked by trawlers from other countries while we have but one corvette which goes chasing its tail around the place, and, by the time it arrives anywhere, the seas are fished clean and the trawlers are away, and we can then only send protests.  If we are to have expenditure, surely an expenditure which would <Col N="317" /> protect an industry like the fishing industry and the livelihood of those engaged in it should be supported in this House and the necessary steps taken?  We do not even have helicopters to try to follow the movement of foreign trawler fleets around our coastline : Spanish, Dutch and others all fish off the Irish coast.  But let some of the Irish fishing fleets go near the coast of France or Spain&mdash;I know that if they go near Spain, they will end up in some jail and be there for quite a long time.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer very briefly to the question of the pollution of our rivers.  Inland fishing, fishing for salmon and trout, is increasingly an attraction on our rivers and lakes. Other people who engage in coarse fishing are of very great importance, even of indirect importance, because of their value to our tourist industry. While this value is increasing year by year, we appear to be taking no steps to prevent the increasing pollution of our rivers and lakes.</P>
    <P>I will not talk about salmon disease because I know very little about it. It is becoming clearer all the time, particularly in relation to rivers leading into estuaries on which our towns and cities are situated that very little effort is being made to deal with pollution. If I may be permitted to mention it, we have canals which, if stocked with coarse fish, would prove a tremendous attraction to anglers from across the water and from various parts of Europe.  Deputies who have had more opportunities than I to visit various European countries will be aware that in Holland, Belgium, France and Italy, there is a tremendous interest in coarse fishing.  I do not know whether they ever catch anything in their canals and rivers, but their is a tremendous interest in coarse fishing, and it is very popular in Britain.</P>
    <P>This may sound almost like high treason to the man who fishes for salmon or trout, but the people who go in for coarse fishing are people who, if they were attracted over here for coarse fishing on our rivers, lakes and canals, would spend money, because <Col N="318" /> they would be satisfied with reasonable accommodation, would stay in the local small hotels, buy food and have their entertainment while on holiday. They are the people who save their money for a week or a fortnight's holiday. They like to spend their money and go home with nothing in their pockets.  They would leave their money here.  I would urge that under this heading there should be greater effort to deal with the problem of pollution and to see what can be done to cultivate coarse fishing in our canals.  We have one coming right into the city of Dublin which would possibly in its further reaches be ideal for that purpose.</P>
    <P>I will close on the note on which I opened.  Here we have an Estimate which, by our own decision, is almost nine months overdue. Whatever we may say about the matters contained in this Estimate, at the end of the discussion the House will be asked to approve it.  Already threequarters of the money in the Estimate has been spent.  We are beginning to look childish to the public: &ldquo;Do you approve of something you have done in advance?&rdquo;  I wonder how far that procedure would go in the local authorities?  Many Deputies are members of local authorities.  During the months of February and March, they engage in bitter discussions about the money that will be spent during the following year under all headings. What kind of an example do we give them?  We make our comments on the Estimate and at the end of the discussion, whether we offer criticism or praise, we will say &ldquo;Tá&rdquo; or &ldquo;Níl&rdquo;, or we may even go into the division lobbies.  It is a bit Gilbertian to say the least of it to go into the division lobbies to vote on an Estimate when, in fact, the bulk of the money has already been spent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasOHara" hpid="Mr. O'Hara Mr. O'Hara">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to wish the Minister luck in this Department. He is new to it and he is a rural man with a deep interest in the fishing industry.  I sincerely hope he will do everything possible to further the industry. I would couple with him the Parliamentary Secretary, whom I know <Col N="319" /> since he came into the House.  I also knew his father.  I wish him luck in the Department, and I would ask him to throw his weight behind this all important matter of the fishing industry in general.</P>
      <P>As other Deputies have said, this industry has been sorely neglected down through the years.  This is an island country and we should provide the facilities, the money, the goodwill and all the other things needed to put the fishing industry on a sound footing. The Minister's speech is a good blueprint, and it deals comprehensively with many aspects of fishing.  It surveys the whole position.  The regrettable thing is that the money has not been made available in sufficient quantities to implement the proposals contained in it.</P>
      <P>I remember some years ago discussing this matter in this House.  I admit that there has been a considerable improvement since then.  Quite a lot has been achieved, but not as much as should have been achieved and, in my opinion, the main reason is that the money was not made available.  That is a sad state of affairs.  It is hard to comprehend why that should be so in an island country, a country with a tradition of fishing.  Even in the days of British rule, a lot of fishing was engaged in here.  As Deputy Larkin pointed out, at Howth, Skerries and other centres, and even in my own county, fishing was engaged in with outmoded methods, boats which were not safe, and gear which belonged to a past age, and which is absolutely unsuitable today.  It is regrettable that many of our fishermen still engage in fishing with outdated equipment and boats, which is one of the reasons why the industry has not progressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many years ago, for those reasons, tragedies occurred along the Mayo coast, fishermen were lost at sea and this, of course, had the effect of turning people against fishing.  Sons of men who had spent their lives fishing refused to continue to engage in it because they felt they would be endangering their lives.  We must be honest <Col N="320" /> and admit that in many parts of our coastal areas, some of the piers and slips were erected in pre-Famine times and since the Famine, and I am afraid the engineers engaged in their erection and location were not very competent because they did not always have regard to such factors as prevailing winds and the safety of the harbours. It appeared to be a case of rolling a few boulders and rocks into some corner of the coast, and the winds blew and the storms rose, and the slips had broken backs as a result of storm damage.</P>
    <P>We must all admit to a certain amount of guilt because it was due to our neglect that some of the slips became broken and fell into disrepair and disuse.  It is true to say that nowhere in the Twenty-Six Counties has the fishing industry been so neglected as in my constituency.  We have heard of fishing centres, such as Dunmore East, Killybegs and Galway, being considered for the establishment of proper fishing facilities, including the necessary provisions for safe landings and so forth, and for the processing of fish.  On the other hand, though there are many locations in north Mayo ideal for development, very little attention has been paid to them. I protest against that neglect and I ask the Parliamentary Secretary, now in the Minister's place, to correct it, reminding him that there is a growing interest in fishing along that coast. It may have spread from Galway.</P>
    <P>I know young men who have left my constituency and gone to England. Some of their fathers engaged in fishing throughout their lives and I am certain the sons would be prepared to come back and engage in this form of industry, if they had the money to pay the deposits on modern boats and if the safe landing facilities so necessary along that coast were provided. Some years ago, many young men bought boats, paid their deposits and continued with the instalments, but had their boats broken up by high winds because of neglect to provide safe landing places.  There was nothing for those men but to take the emigrant ship again to America and to England, <Col N="321" /> having lost part of their life savings. It is hard to expect this sort of thing to encourage our younger people to interest themselves in the fishing industry.</P>
    <P>Along the north Mayo coast we have some fine ports.  There is Blacksod Bay which is known all over the world as a deep water port; it has been truthfully said that you could anchor the British Navy there at its greatest number.  There is Porturlin, Portacloy, the historic Killala and Darby's Point in Achill.  Something is being done for Darby's Point and I am glad to thank the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance for his efforts in that respect.  With the co-operation of the local Fianna Fáil councillor there, we got together and focussed the attention of the Department on the needs of Darby's Point as a fishing port and as a result, some action has been taken.  It was referred to in the Minister's statement.  I have seen the efforts being made there.  During the year I went there with Skipper Kilbane in the early hours of the morning.  The fishermen's main problem there was lack of proper lighting facilities.  This is being remedied, in co-operation with Mayo County Council and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>During my visit there on the boat, I could appreciate the skipper's point of view with regard to landing difficulties, particularly at night or in fog. The only guide ashore the fisherman had was a house on a hillside.  If it were late at night and the lights in that house were out and the visibility bad, I do not know how they could get into port.  When one considers that a boat worth more than £9,000 is at stake, one can appreciate the reluctance of people to engage in this industry.  It is wrong that we should allow this state of affairs to continue, particularly when people's lives may be endangered.  We can see the serious consequences for the industry.</P>
    <P>The majority of those engaged in the industry can be described as small fishermen who do not engage in business in a big way.  I cannot say how <Col N="322" /> many of those small fishermen there are, but I can assure the Minister that the number would increase substantially, if we provided the facilities for safer landings.  Deputy Clinton told of the system at Howth where the fish were passed along from one boat to another and eventually on to the quays and to vans and lorries.  Surely we must make some advance on this type of handling if we are to expect the industry to reach the targets set?  This is not the way to treat an important industry, especially when we consider that the lives of people engaged in it may be endangered.  The Minister appears to be optimistic about the future of the industry and I sincerely hope his optimism is justified.  It will be justified only if he provides the money and the facilities.</P>
    <P>I was proud to hear so much emphasis laid on the quality of the fish. Gone are the days when you could throw something slapdash into a box and sell it at a street corner, whether it was stale or fresh.  That method of marketing has gone, and we must realise that we cannot hope to build an industry, be it fish, turkeys, bacon or beef, unless we are prepared for the competitive markets now in existence. The Minister has put great emphasis on the importance of the export market.  We will have greater landings of fish.  I hope this happens.  It is of the greatest importance that the emphasis should be on the presentation of a good article.</P>
    <P>We have many advantages in this country.  We have the fish and we have a certain number of fishermen.  We can build on that but if we start to sell a bad product we will do more harm than good.  It will do a lot of damage to the industry generally.  We cannot over-emphasise that point.  I was one of the people whose goods for export were inspected in the past and I am glad to think that they were of sufficient standard for export.  The presentation of fish on the export market is of great importance.  Unfortunately, you will always have the type of gentleman who is prepared, for the sake of a few easy pounds, to act in a reckless way and perhaps with an Irish brand he may not only destroy <Col N="323" /> his own product but he may destroy those of his neighbours.  I am glad, therefore, that such emphasis was put on the importance of the proper handling of fish and the proper presentation of it, even to our own people.</P>
    <P>I am glad to know that the consumption of fish here has increased.  I hope it continues.  If we eat more fish, we will have more bacon and meat available for the export market.  Fish is good for our people and I sincerely hope that the increased consumption of fish means that our people are becoming more fish-minded.  Any promotional work that can be done in this regard within the country will bear fruit.  The ICA people in conjunction with RTE can do a lot of work in this regard.  They can further the sale of fish to our own people.</P>
    <P>Many other aspects of this matter have been dealt with.  There are many good points in the Minister's speech.  I was listening to this debate for a long time and I do not want to be guilty of repetition.  Generally speaking, I agree with the various points other Deputies have made on this Estimate.  Deputy O'Connor, one of the Fianna Fáil Deputies from South Kerry, certainly has a far greater knowledge of this industry than I have.  I cannot claim to have a great knowledge of it because I am an inlander.  People I know who have an interest in this industry have said that a lot cannot be done for it because of the lack of money.  I should like to pay a tribute in passing to the Inland Fisheries Trust.  They have done great work through the years in the matter of restocking lakes and so forth. In my own area, Lough Conn has been restocked and from what I know it has improved fishing in that lake.  There are other lakes which have been restocked also.  If restocking is done according to scientific methods by people who understand the work it will be of great benefit to the lakes and rivers.  While Deputy Larkin was speaking he reminded me of something. I am not sure if this is true or not but I was told that the Inland Fisheries Trust took out fish from a lake in my own part of the country. <Col N="324" /> They landed them on the side of the lake and allowed them to die there.  It should have been possible to transfer those fish to lakes or canals, if necessary, where they would have been of some benefit to people who are interested in coarse fishing.</P>
    <P>I believe we have a great potential here.  We can do a lot to develop our fishing industry.  Those fresh fish were allowed to die on the banks of that lake.  In fact, I believe the dogs devoured them.  That should not have happened.  When I was a young lad, I went out with a worm and rod to the local river where I could fish for trout up to a pound in weight.  This cannot be done nowadays and this is something I cannot understand.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure of what I am saying and I know people who believe what I am saying is true.  I cannot understand why such fish cannot be got nowadays.  Many tourists fish in that lake and are quite happy when they catch a fish which only measures one inch or one and a half inches long.  They can now only get fingerlings in that place.  It is not so many years ago when you could get trout weighing at least a pound.  They seem to have gone down in size.</P>
      <P>I took sufficient interest in my time in the activities of the Inland Fisheries Trust to offer a site to them free for a hatchery.  Someone from the Inland Fisheries Trust inspected the site and said that by and large he considered it to be a suitable location for a trout hatchery.  However, although that site cost my late father £300 I offered it free to the Inland Fisheries Trust if they wanted to develop the fishing industry in that area.  I wanted to encourage them to do something about fishing in County Mayo and the adjoining counties and in the hope that they would do some restocking in that area.  However, they selected another site and some restocking has gone on in different lakes in my part of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Inland Fisheries Trust, if they have the staff available, should try to <Col N="325" /> service some of the many rivers and lakes throughout the length and breadth of the country.  They should have a look at them, see what is the position, see if they could be improved with restocking and do something about the industry in general.  I am afraid, if it is a case of money, the sum of £5,000 mentioned here&mdash;I believe it is already spent &mdash;will not go very far because £5,000 is not a lot of money today.  In my opinion, they could do nothing worthwhile with it. I know that that is not the total Vote but even an increase of £5,000 is not sufficient to put the Inland Fisheries Trust on anything like a sound footing.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that this very important matter is not being made a political football because the viewpoints expressed from the Government side, by Deputy Larkin from the Labour Party, and by members of my own Party seem generally to be the same.  It all boils down to a question of finance.  I notice from reading the <i>Irish Press</i> particularly, because I read this paper as well as other papers, that the people in the Central Bank say that money is becoming a little bit more plentiful.  I hope that is true and when very conservative people like the people in the Central Bank talk that way one is inclined to think that things must be improving a little.  It would be in the best interests of the country if it is true.  That being so, I would ask the Minister and his Parliamentary Secretary to try to bring this industry to the position in which it should be, or near the position in which it should be.  If the young Parliamentary Secretary could achieve that he would certainly achieve something.  It is an industry that was neglected down the years and he would make history if he could use his influence to try to put the fishing industry on its feet.  He is young enough and intelligent enough for the job and I hope he will listen carefully to my appeal and do what he can to have this industry developed as it should be.</P>

      <P>My first duty is to congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary <Col N="326" /> and wish him well in his office. It is rather difficult to speak about this Vote to a young man who is only after taking up office.  I have been in the House for almost 23 years and I have experienced more frustration on this particular Vote than on anything else I have ever spoken on.  For the past 15 years I have been trying to get the harbour at Skerries reconstructed and extended.  I want to thank the Minister for Finance, Deputy Haughey, who when he was Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries went further than anybody else and gave us £1,200 last year to have a survey carried out. Three years ago in Dublin County Council we voted in favour of raising half the money.  I want the work on this harbour done.  I am just fed up over it.  We have done our job in the county council and time out of number when we go to the blessing of the fleet at Skerries&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has only just taken up this office and I cannot expect a miracle.  I wish him well in his new office.  I was saying that I have been completely frustrated over the matter of Skerries Harbour for the past 15 years.  I said that his predecessor gave us £1,200 last year in order to have soundings carried out, and so forth.  I want to take this opportunity of thanking the officers of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and the engineers who came to Skerries in regard to this matter.  We carried out the advice which was given to us by the skippers of the Skerries fishing fleet. It is not a very expensive job but it is a job which would mean a great deal to the Skerries fishermen.  If it is not carried out there will be no fishermen in Skerries in a few years time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position now is that they have to go out four hours before they normally would have to go out to the fishing grounds because the harbour is tidal.  The suggested improvements were made by the fishermen, accepted by the engineers of the Board of Works <Col N="327" /> and the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, and supported by Dublin County Council who are prepared to give 50 per cent of the money.  I do ask the Minister to ensure that this job will be done during the coming year.  I know that last year it could not be done because of the credit squeeze.  I do not know how we are situated in the council with regard to raising a loan but I would ask the Minister to do something about this. For years, on the occasion of the annual blessing of the fleet at Skerries, we have been talking and codding the people.  I agree completely with other speakers that we never have provided enough money to build up the fishing industry.  Successive Governments have failed to provide sufficient money. Only a small number of people are involved at present.  In Balbriggan there are now only a few boats where 20 or 30 years ago there were some 20 boats.  It is the same in Skerries. The Department have, however, done much in regard to getting the fishermen better boats.</P>
    <P>The Minister comes from a fishing area himself.  He may live inland but his constituency is surrounded by the sea and I want him to do something about this matter or we will have no fishermen in Skerries in a few years time.  At the moment it is complete drudgery for the fishermen who have to get up at one o'clock or two o'clock in the morning and leave from the pier.  If the weather is bad and the sea is rough and if the fishermen are outside the harbour when the tide goes out they cannot get in.  I am sincere when I say that I have been frustrated about this because I have been trying to do something for the people whom, with other Deputies, I have the honour to represent.  I know the Minister has to depend on the Department of Finance but if he can get the money this year would he please have the job done?  I do not intend to delay the House by speaking on other technical matters because they have been dealt with at length by other speakers. I cannot emphasise too much how I feel about this matter.</P>

      <P>If there is any way in which a harbour can be got in Skerries, Deputy Burke has chosen the right one when he says there will be a Fianna Fáil seat lost there if the harbour is not attended to.  I am sure the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries will take note of that, if he does not notice any other plea.</P>
      <P>I shall be very brief because my colleague, Deputy Larkin, went into great detail.  We are dealing with the Cinderella of Agriculture&mdash;the Fisheries Estimate.  Each year the Department of Agriculture gets full attention, but in the case of Fisheries only a few people interested say anything and are aware that the money being devoted to it is just a repetition of the amount devoted to it the previous year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall deal mainly with some points <Col N="329" /> affecting my own area.  I live just beside the sea and while there is no fishing harbour near me, there is a fishing village where people live, about 40 families, by the sea and the river.  I have said this <i>ad nauseam</i> in the House and outside it.  They look for nothing from outside, neither social welfare nor home assistance.  They are the most independent people I know. How they make a living is a mystery but they normally make a reasonably good living.  They have good times and bad.  This past season has not been the best.  Last year their hopes were raised.  Over the years it has been the practice that when the boys of the village reach the age of 17 or 18, they go to sea and disappear for three or four years.  Some come back and settle down in their mid-twenties or later.  Some never settle there.  Last year, a foreign firm&mdash;Danish, I think &mdash;came to the area and bought a fairly extensive piece of land.  They intended to erect a fish-processing plant at the mouth of the Boyne. Everybody in the area felt that this would give much-needed employment and possibly keep the young people at home.  Some schemozzle occurred later between this firm and a fishing association, as a result of which, following numerous discussions with the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, the association said they were going to take over the building of the fish-processing plant.  That was the last we heard of it.  I suppose the project has been completely dropped and that we are unlikely to hear more about it.</P>
    <P>This is a great pity as it would have achieved a double objective.  The Boyne is about to be drained.  We are told the work will start in 1968 and if so, if it follows the pattern of other fishing rivers, it will be out of use for fishing for a considerable time, seven years, the optimists say, and 13 according to the pessimists.  Possibly the truth is somewhere in between. What will happen to the people living on the mouth of the Boyne during that period?  Everybody felt the erection of a fish-processing plant would be the answer to a prayer and that these <Col N="330" /> people, as well as keeping their families at home, would be able to survive.  That hope has gone and something else must be done.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to consider this especially before 1968.  There is no point in waiting until the drainage scheme starts or until we reach the stage where no fishing can be carried out and we say to the people: &ldquo;There is nothing we can do for you,&rdquo; or &ldquo;We must consider doing something for you now.&rdquo;  If a scheme is to be devised, it should be prepared well in advance.  These people have a charter dated June, 1870, which entitles them to fish with nets on the Boyne.  It would be unwise to give up that right, although many people would like to see the netting of salmon stopped in the river.  They regard people who have to earn their living at the job, apparently, as an unnecessary evil.  The Minister, in the intervening time, might be able to have a scheme devised whereby these people will be enabled to exist during the period when fishing will be impossible.</P>
    <P>This applies to the mussel beds which are also used at the mouth of the Boyne.  I suppose many people know that because sewage from Drogheda is not always treated before being discharged into the river, the mussels in many cases have been condemned for human consumption.  As a result those who pick the mussels and sell them must sell them to people who take them away to other parts of this country or to England, process them and then use them as they are perfectly safe.  While they are highly dangerous to outsiders, the local people can eat them and it does not seem to do them any harm, even though they are condemned.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Naturally, mud coming down the river will completely destroy the mussels and something must be done to replant them, if possible, when the drainage is finished. Some years ago the December 8th floods washed away the beds and at that time the Department gave a substantial grant with which the beds were <Col N="331" /> successfully resown.  One would need to go there and see these people at work in all sorts of weather to understand how difficult a life they have. Having fished for the mussels by boat, they must take them out of the boat, and then sit down in the mud and pick them by hand into bags, no matter what the weather.  If they do not pick mussels, they have no money to live on, so that they have no choice.  However, they survive, and I should not like to see mussel-fishing completely destroyed, particularly at present when one enterprising man in the area has started a processing plant locally.  He did so because he found that picking mussels in Mornington and selling them at 8/6 a bag to a British buyer meant that the British buyer took them to England, processed them and put them in jars with screw-on lids.  He found that he got five in one case, and six mussels in most cases, in jars costing 10/- each.  He felt it was time to get in on the racket and he has begun processing mussels.</P>
      <P>Possibly the Department could give some assistance to this man and his family because they are attempting to start something which will be of immense value to the mussel-pickers in the area if the enterprise prospers.  A few attempts were made earlier to do this and for one reason or another, they did not survive.  The standard of hygiene must be very high and the instructions given by the medical people must be followed before the mussels are passed as fit for human consumption.  I recommend the Minister to get some inspectors down there so that some assistance can be given to people who are at present doing the job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference was made to the salmon disease and I am not going to join issue with the Minister as to whether or not it is one type of disease or another.  The facts are that in the south it has almost completely wiped out the salmon stock in a number of rivers, and I go along with Deputy Clinton when he says that it is almost certainly caused by the rainbow trout farms along the river.  Whether or not <Col N="332" /> it can be spread by fish going from one river to spawn in a river other than the one from which they originally came, I have grave doubts, but the salmon disease has spread from river to river.  It has not come north yet.  It has not come to the Boyne and I hope it will stay away.  I would not be competent to say whether any particular process can be effective in preventing it from spreading but the Boyne conservators have made a suggestion to the Minister and, of course, the Minister's experts would be in a position to judge.</P>
    <P>Every effort should be made to concentrate on the rivers to which the disease has not yet spread in order to keep it out of these rivers.  It was suggested that possibly it spread to rivers which would have been immune from it but for the fact that lines were used there which had been used in rivers where the disease was rampant. I do not know how true that is, but something spread it and we do not want it to get into other rivers, if that can be avoided.</P>
    <P>The question of restocking rivers has been mentioned here, whether or not the salmon are able to go up to spawn. We all know a very high percentage of the salmon stock must come from natural spawning, but the reseeding of the rivers by artificial means has resulted, in my opinion, in the very big increase in salmon catches over the past few years.  The number of salmon going through is very much greater in the last few years.  This leads me to the suggestion that the Minister should consider extending the season in some of these rivers.  It does seem remarkable that, for instance, in the Boyne, where salmon fishing finishes on 12th August, the run of small fish there at that time is bigger than at any other time of the year.  If it were left open for another month, no great harm would be done to the salmon stock, and it would mean an awful lot to the people who earn their living by net fishing.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, I am glad to note the Minister intends to withdraw the proposed new Fisheries Bill, because there <Col N="333" /> were a number of clauses in it which certainly were not put in by anybody who had the interests of ordinary fishermen at heart.  I think the people who put the clauses into the Bill were those who enjoy fishing with a rod and line and earn their livelihood in some other way.  It is always easy for those people to be very strict and to make it an expensive thing for the fishermen to try to exist, believing always that if they could be removed from the rivers, there would be more salmon going up.</P>
    <P>The question of traps has been raised.  There are a few traps on the Boyne and these are far more deadly than the other type and are usually owned by people who have other ways of living.  I have no objection to compensation being paid for the traps, if they have to be removed.  There is a certain period of years after which the licence, or the right to operate them, lapses and if that is coming to an end, then an effort could be made to prevent them being replaced, because they are deadly as far as catching salmon is concerned.  The man who goes out in a boat with a net makes only one cast into the river. Hundreds of salmon may pass up at the particular time he is out but there may be none at all when he is casting his net.  The traps are always there and the fish have a very poor chance of getting through even with the king's pass, the queen's pass, the president's pass, or whatever you like to call it.</P>
    <P>One other comment I have to make in regard to fishing is that these people who earn their livelihood at this occupation often have to fish at night. They have to fish by the tide, not, as Deputy Colley will appreciate, in accordance with a 45-hour week or anything like that.  The result is that they have to come down in the middle of the night, whether it is wet or fine. An effort should be made to provide some sort of lighting on the fishing ground because, as it is, it is a miracle they are able to carry out their job without any light at all, unless perhaps they have better eyesight than most of us.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to fishery protection, and the fishery boards <Col N="334" /> have been commended on their efforts at fishery protection.  I think there is something missing which was included last year and was included to a far greater extent the year before, that is, arrangements for the establishment of a national fishery protection force. There are in most areas what we call water bailiffs or waterkeepers and they usually operate under a man who is referred to as a superintendent, and by different names by the poachers when they see him around. These men are recruited for a very dirty, dangerous job.  They are the people who have to go out at night if there is poaching, or if there is poaching suspected and have to risk their lives in trying to prevent it.  I do not think the number of people prosecuted for poaching is any guarantee that poaching is being kept down.  If the waterkeepers do their job properly, nobody will be prosecuted for poaching because the poacher will not be allowed to get near enough to the rivers.</P>
    <P>In most areas there are excellent waterkeepers and it does seem a shame that their rate of pay and conditions of employment are so bad.  In most cases the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries suggest that these people are entitled to no more than the agricultural workers' minimum rate of pay. In some cases it is slightly over that. This year the Department of Agriculture introduced a new system and notified the trade union representing a number of these men that they would in future regulate their increases in wages and hours of work on the same basis as that of the farm workers.  That, in effect, was saying that these men should operate at a rate slightly over £9 per week.  The point that the Department were missing completely, apparently, is that these men do not work regular hours from 8 in the morning until 5 or 6 in the evenings. More often than not, they work at night and almost always have to work at weekends.  To suggest that the proper basis for fixing their rate of wages is the agricultural workers rate seems stupid.  The only reason that can be given for it is that it is the lowest rate these gentlemen could think of.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="335" /> I would ask the Minister, who has just taken over the Department, to examine this and see if he agrees that the people who do this type of work should be put on minimum agricultural workers' wages for all the hours of the day and night.  The argument has been put up that during certain periods of the year, particularly during periods of high water, these people do not have to work at all because a poacher cannot get near the river.  This type of thinking shows how very little the people concerned know about poaching and what happens when the water is high.  As often as not, salmon will go out into the field even, into the warmer water where the water overflows the bank and can be picked up with very little trouble to the person who knows what to do.  I would ask the Minister to have a hard look at this.  He should go back to one of his predecessors who suggested that a uniformed national fishery protection service should be set up, that there should be a regulation age for joining and that they should receive a certain amount of training to enable them to protect themselves.</P>
    <P>It is true that they need this protection. I remember a few years ago when one of them was involved with a poacher who was fairly useful with a bicycle chain, as a result of which the waterkeeper ended up in hospital for a considerable time.  He had to pay his own expenses.  When he came out, he lost his case against the man who assaulted him.  The district justice felt the night was so dark that this man could not be sure who it was who assaulted him, although he was quite sure.  This cost this fishery protection official more than he could earn for six months doing his duty.  This is something which should be guarded against and I would ask the Minister to take particular note of it.</P>
    <P>Most of the men were recruited over the years because they were fairly intelligent and fairly tough.  Most of them are relatively young men.  The older men are being let off, where possible.  More of them would be gone by now if the promise made to introduce <Col N="336" /> a pension scheme had been carried out.  Three years ago, we were told on the Estimates that such a scheme was being considered; two years ago, it was to be implemented &ldquo;in the near future&rdquo;; but last year, it was stated that it would apply only to the supervisory staff and not to the ordinary waterkeeper at all.  This was making a joke of the whole thing. While the supervisory staff do require a pension scheme, the same as the ordinary protection staff, the main group who require it are the protection staff themselves.</P>
    <P>If the Minister approaches this in a fair-minded way, he will see it is ridiculous to have the protection staff in one river being paid £3 a week less than those employed on a neighbouring river doing exactly the same work. These men have to supply their own transport, and the man who travels around on a bicycle now is very little use.  They have to travel fairly quickly from one area to another.  If the poacher hears the protection man is in one area, he may decide to move into another area and may get away with it, if the protection staff do not appear quickly enough.  The Minister will have to decide, after consultation with his officials, that it is not sufficient to give a couple of pence a mile to these men and to say to them: &ldquo;Supply your own vehicle now; take the risk yourself; carry your own insurance; if you are injured, that is your own fault; you are only entitled to a farm worker's wages; you are not very important to the nation anyway&rdquo;. A number of people who joined the service over the years decided after a short time it was not for them because there was very little compensation. I would ask the Minister to give this matter priority.</P>
    <P>As I said, one of his predecessors suggested that these men be supplied with uniforms.  There are two sides to that story.  If they are supplied with uniforms, they will be given more status and recognised as men with authority.  We always feel the man in uniform must have some authority. But the argument against the uniform is that in uniform they are too conspicuous. <Col N="337" /> If it is decided not to give them uniforms, they should receive, in addition to their wages, some compensation in respect of their clothing. These men do not work on the main roads.  They have to go across fields, hedges and all sorts of muddy places, mainly at night.  They are entitled to such consideration.  The other matters I would have liked to deal with have been dealt with so much better by Deputies Larkin, Clinton and Burke that I do not propose to delay the House any longer.</P>

      <P>Fisheries has been called the Cinderella of this Department and it is undoubtedly all that.  We have a gentleman down in Waterford and Lismore drawing tribute in the Irish Republic from Irish Republican fishermen for fishing in Irish Republican waters.  He does so under a Charter of Queen Elizabeth.  I have spent a long time endeavouring to have this matter dealt with, but it is as bad as ever. About ten years ago, this gentleman got another brainwave and sought to raise this tribute from £13 a year to £20 a year.  It took me a couple of hours to show him the foolishness of his ways.  However, it has continued at the £13 since.</P>
      <P>Now that we have brought in legislation here to get rid of British landlords and legislation to get rid of the ground rents in our towns and villages, it is high time this Department got a wash over and we got rid of this tribute being paid to the Duke of Devonshire under a Charter of Queen Elizabeth by unfortunate men who have no other means of livelihood. There are 66 drift nets in Youghal, each with three men.  That means almost 200 men have to pay this tribute, amounting to over £1,000, for the right of Republican citizens to fish in Irish Republican waters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well; we shall turn from that.  Last year, we were all amazed to read in the newspapers, just three days before the opening season in Youghal, a notice prohibiting the use of a certain net.  The men concerned had ordered their nets three or four months earlier and purchased them and prepared them for fishing when, lo and behold, the Fisheries Branch in Dublin got a brainwave to issue a notice that those nets were illegal, if you please.  I had to come up to Dublin, with my fishermen, to the then Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Colley, to ask him to straighten out the matter so that the fishermen concerned would be able to use their nets at least for the season.  I hope that particular section of the Fisheries Branch is now in order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is fantastic to think of a Department of State, which is paid by the taxpayers&mdash;and by the taxes of the unfortunate men concerned, as well&mdash; coming out with an order, three days before the fishing season opens, practically prohibiting those people from fishing at all because they had no nets <Col N="339" /> other than the nets they had purchased and which the Department declared were illegal.  That is not the way in which a Department should be run. That is not ordinary justice, as I know it, anyway.  I succeeded in getting for them a right to use those nets for that season.  However, it is unfair that a Deputy should have to come up to Dublin to have a matter like that straightened out.</P>
    <P>Is it the policy of the Fisheries Branch to drive all fishermen, who are earning their livelihood by fishing and who have nothing else to depend upon, off our rivers for the benefit of the gentlemen with the guilded paw who come over from Britain?  That is what we want to know.  To judge by the number of inquiries and whispers, and all the rest of it, it looks very like that.  I was down in County Waterford last week and there I met 18 fishermen who were operating those drift nets.  They told me they had to face an inquiry which was to be held last Friday by the Department in Youghal to wipe them out because of riparian rights.  It is just as well that we know where we are going.</P>
    <P>I heard Deputy James Tully make a case for the water bailiffs, and that is all right, but what about the man through whose land such a river flows and who is paying both rates and annuities for the bed of that river?  If I am paying rates and annuities for something and if the matter has gone so far that I am now told that if I am caught walking along the bank of the river, I shall be prosecuted, well, I can guarantee that I shall have my share of the fish.  We are about to establish that those who whipped in here excluded the fishing rights from the land when they were selling it under the Land Acts.  They held the fishing rights for themselves and left the unfortunate farmers to pay the rates and annuities for the land through which the waters flow.</P>
    <P>I want to know what stand the Department are taking.  Will it be the stand that those who are fishing in the River Blackwater will be driven out so that anglers can come over and <Col N="340" /> pay the grabber for the right to put a rod on the river the grabber grabbed? The ordinary people&mdash;the ordinary workers and the ordinary fishermen&mdash; will not be wiped out by that kind of thing but, to my mind, that is what is being attempted, and I have no hesitation in saying it.</P>
    <P>I met those unfortunate boys down there last week and this is what I found there, and it is wrong.  Some 60 men around that little village of Aglish are hauled into Youghal for a special inquiry to wipe them out.  We had the same position in respect of Dunmore East.  I hope that when our Taoiseach meets Captain O'Neill, he will see that there will be a bit of give on both sides in so far as the fisheries are concerned.  If fishermen, subsidised by the British Government, can come down here and fish in our waters, well then let the same rights be given to our fishermen in their waters.  They take and land their catches in Dunmore East: let our fishermen have the same rights to land their catches in Britain and in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I am pleading here for men who have spent their lifetime fishing.  It is a tough livelihood but it is their way of living.  They have to support a wife and children like every other family man.  They are decent, law-abiding men &mdash;too law-abiding for my taste&mdash;considering how they are treated.  I have a return here from the Lismore Fishery district of the total income of those men and particulars of the salmon taken by snap nets, drift nets and draught nets for the year 1965, the latest year for which I have particulars. The total figure for the season was £59,959 which gives each man fishing the noble sum of £210 a year, £4 a week.  These are the people who are to be wiped out of existence so that a few English nobs can come over here and have their photographs in the newspaper with the big fish they caught at Careysville last week and then you remember that on every fish they catch the fisherman again have to pay a levy, which is now, I think, a penny a lb.  We have that problem.  The gentleman with the rod, however, does not pay that levy.  He sends his salmon to the local hotel.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="341" /> Those are the points I should like the Minister to remember in his taking over of the job of Fisheries.  As I said, I had to appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to put a stop to the idiotic gallop of the gentlemen in his Department. I do not want to have to do the same thing again.  I do not want, either, the dose of bringing in a Private Member's Bill to deal with a disgrace which exists here practically 45 years after an Irish Government have come into power.  The disgrace is that of Republican fishermen having to pay a tribute to a foreign duke under a Charter of Queen Elizabeth for fishing in Irish Republican waters.  It is time we took a tumble to ourselves on these things.</P>
    <P>I shall conclude on the note that if we want to be generous to Northern Ireland or British fishermen let us see that it is not all give and no take.  If we are going to allow those fishermen into our waters to catch fish and land them in our ports, then there should be the same agreement in regard to our fishermen fishing in British waters and landing their fish in British ports.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have heard various Deputies discussing the problems of harbours on the east coast, such as Skerries, Clogherhead and various other places.  One thing we must accept is that the fishing industry must be of a certain size before the full benefits of marketing can assist fishermen to properly dispose of their catch at all times.  In small ports where you might have two, three, seven or eight trawlers when the Dublin market has been looked after the prices available for fish are not attractive enough to encourage fishermen to make greater effort.  The financial assistance from Bord Iascaigh Mhara for the purchase of boats is as generous as can be expected.  It is as generous in present circumstances as you could think about by way of increase.  In a place such as Kilkeel in Northern Ireland a greater number of larger trawlers produce a greater volume of fish than perhaps anywhere else on the east coast, with the exception of Howth or Dunmore East at certain times of the year, and the opportunities of <Col N="342" /> marketing are, therefore, increased a hundredfold.  As well as this, it is true to say that when you have one bad apple in a barrel all the apples become bad.  If you have one good fisherman such as at Kilkeel or at large English or Scottish ports, the skill and knowledge he has and the instruments he will use will lead others to do the same.  For instance, it costs about £10 a week to put a Dekka navigation system on a trawler.  It is not sold; it is rented.  The good fisherman having it could go out on a trawler in a fog and he could do the same trawl the following day and again the day after and go back to port in the fog.</P>
      <P>A fisherman is sitting on a boat worth £15,000 and expenditure of a trifle of about £10 a week is something, in relation to £15,000, that should be considered by all fishermen.  It will take the large port where one, two, three or ten per cent of the fishermen have done the job and have got such instruments as the Dekka navigation system to encourage others to do so.</P>
      <P>I find that small ports like Skerries and Clogherhead are at this disadvantage. They are also at the disadvantage that in regard to industrial fishing, there is not a factory within easy reach to process the sprats they catch.  They will always have a transport problem.  I think it was Deputy Corry who spoke about levies.  Even though there are levies on imported fish and the Government produce a subsidy for transport, it does not pay the total amount.  There is also the problem of loading.  Whereas at a large port where there might be a sucking unit to take the complete load of sprats out of the trawler in an hour on to a bulk lorry, in small ports, they have to use a bucket and winch and bring it up in lots of about four stone.  That is arduous work and fishing does not pay very well when you have to do that sort of thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is really a question of education and of development.  It could be development, as against my constituency, <Col N="343" /> in the larger ports.  It could be development where there are facilities for unloading all sorts of fish, better marketing facilities.  It is dreadful to plan your whole life, wondering whether the chicken or the egg comes first.  It may be that it is the expansion of ports like Howth that will occur.  I feel that the development that will come about will come in this way.  At the same time, you have to watch our small ports because there is nothing wrong with having ten or 12 boats in Skerries that perhaps, can unload in Howth and come back at the weekend to Skerries, if the larger port has facilities for marketing. I remember being out in a boat at two in the morning and seeing ten Kilkeel trawlers on the way back to Kilkeel, loaded, from the docks off Howth and when I left Clogherhead, every boat was in the harbour, in dock, the reason being that they had marketed their prawns in the Dublin market.  If they had stayed out for four or five days and had come back on a Friday evening with a full boat of prawns, the prawns might be gone by Monday morning.  The facilities were available at Kilkeel and they could unload twice as fast.  This is a thing we have to watch.  We must try at the same time to keep our small ports on the go.</P>
    <P>We have had trouble with salmon disease.  There is a case pending in the courts which I do not want to affect one way or the other.  There is the rumour widely circulated that we got our fry for our rainbow trout from the wrong source and introduced the salmon disease by this means. Happily, the rivers where I come from have not been affected.  It would be an extremely serious thing if this rumour were true.  I hope it is not true.  I hope the salmon disease will soon be a thing of the past.  Let us face the fact that it has been a most serious time for fishermen on the salmon fisheries and that their income has been greatly reduced.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry mentioned the question of riparian owners and the fact that we have to pay money back to Britain, and all the rest of it.  The <Col N="344" /> position is that where I come from, the corporation of Drogheda, which could hardly be called a British corporation at this stage but could be called an Irish Republican corporation, own the town and have it by a charter of King William of Orange and are charging lease rents from this day on. So, if a riparian owner of fishing is getting a lease rent, it is quite clear that our whole thought in 1916 and after was that we were not interfering with private property and the rent which falls to a riparian owner in this case is property just like a house, a boat or any other article.  That is something we have to face up to and buy out.  We can legislate, as we did in many other cases, to buy out the owner and offer him fair compensation. That is the way we have to do it and there is no use in saying that we should do it in any other way.</P>
    <P>I know there is a desire to get certain business through tonight and I do not wish to detain the House but I should like to say a word about this Dunmore East problem.  The whole argument about allowing foreign boats into Dunmore East is that there is more fish to process.  This is probably a proper approach.  It can affect the market for fresh herrings in the Dublin market and the other places around the country to some extent but the volume of fresh herrings that is available is not that big.  There is always the larger thing, that we can land at the same time in Britain while awaiting this organisation.  This Dunmore East dispute may affect the agreement we have with Britain.  In addition, the brotherhood of the sea is something that somebody who has not had much contact with the sea and with fishermen does not know about but it is many a time that a Kilkeel boat is towed into Clogherhead and it is many a time that a Clogherhead boat is towed into Kilkeel.  Being out on the sea, you are in a situation where, if you do not help your neighbour you can have very little hope that he will help you, and ramming boats off Dunmore East is not much help.  We can do a lot.  I do not want to detain the House I could have gone on further in this <Col N="345" /> matter.  I really think it was a mistake and we should reach some amicable agreement about it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to direct the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary and of the Government to the fact that for years past the fishing industry and the Department of Fisheries in general has been tossed about like a bad halfpenny from Department to Department.  At one time fisheries came under the Department of Lands, then under the Department of Agriculture, back again to Lands and back to Agriculture.  Since native government was established, we in this House and successive Governments have been merely tinkering with the fishing industry.  If we are to have a fishing industry, let us have a thriving and prosperous fishing industry. Are we to have a fishing industry which is nobody's responsibility, which is tossed about from Department to Department?  Fisheries has never been in charge of a responsible Minister.  It has always been under the administrative care of a Parliamentary Secretary, sometimes with delegated powers and more often without delegated powers. The time has come when, if we are to have a fishing industry, we must have a thriving fishing industry.  Let us have as our aim, ambition and intention the prosperity of those engaged in that industry.  Unless the industry is on a sound basis, I can see no hope for the complete revival of the fishing industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true that in recent years many efforts have been made to revive the fishing industry.  The general policy of the Government has been that there never have been sufficient funds made available or voted in this House so that development on the proper large scale could be undertaken.  The fishing industry gives employment to a very large number of people around our coast.  It is their traditional way of life. All our fishermen are honest, hardworking, courageous people and all they require is a decent standard of living.  They do not seem to be getting that decent standard of living up to the present.  Any proposals which come from the Department or which come <Col N="346" /> from Bord Iascaigh Mhara should be proposals which are in the long-term interests of the fishing industry and of all those engaged therein.</P>
    <P>Landings are going up, and it is very good to know that.  It is encouraging to know that the tonnage of fish landed around our coast is increasing.  We want to see the landings increase, and increase substantially.  If we are to have a thriving fishing industry, we must first have proper training of the skippers so that they will be able to skipper and man their boats and be trained in the new and modern techniques of fishing.  We must have boats and gear made available for all those who are trained and there should be proper credit and financial facilities available for enterprising young fishermen. Those well qualified to skipper their own boats should be provided with boats and gear.</P>
    <P>Safe anchorage is absolutely essential all around our coast.  The plans available in the Office of Public Works are by no means elaborate plans for the many areas around our coast where the fishermen require safe anchorage. If boats are available for fishermen, the least that is required is safe anchorage on the shore so that during stormy weather they will know they have sufficient safe anchorage and that there are piers and landing facilities available to assist them in their landings.</P>
    <P>In regard to the dispute which has been going on for some time at Dunmore East, it is time it was finished.  There is no point in throwing the responsibility on to the shoulders of anyone other than the Minister who is responsible.  The longer that dispute goes on, the worse it is likely to become.  The time has come to put an end to it.  We have a responsibility to our own fishermen and it is not right that our fishermen should be fishing at a disadvantage or in conditions of unfair competition. Therefore the responsibility rests with the Minister responsible for fisheries to take the necessary steps now without delay to see that whatever dispute exists between the Dunmore East Fishermen's Association and the <Col N="347" /> Northern Ireland fishermen will be brought to an end.</P>
    <P>I disagree greatly with Deputy Corry if he is making a declaration that Northern Ireland fishermen can be described as English fishermen.  I respectfully submit to the Deputy and every other Deputy that there are as good Irishmen in the north of Ireland as in the south of Ireland. It is up to the Minister responsible to see that whatever difficulties exist between southern fishermen and northern fishermen regarding the right of northern fishermen to fish on the south coast, or on any other coast, are settled.  That is a matter which should be taken up immediately between the two Governments.  It should be disposed of and it is the duty of the Minister who is paid by this House and by the taxpayers of this country to have as his primary concern the interests of our fishermen.  It is his duty to ensure that our fishermen will not be faced with unfair competition. I hope this time 12 months when the Estimate comes up again, this matter will be finished.  The responsibility is the Minister's and it is his duty to apply a remedy, to see that the unfortunate dispute which has gone on for so long and has got such international publicity in continental newspapers is ended.  He should take steps to end it and ensure that our fishermen will not have to compete against unfair competition from fishermen from elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I should like to make reference to the boatbuilding industry.  I do not know what progress has taken place in boatbuilding or how the boatbuilding yards are faring out.  There was a boatbuilding yard in Killybegs; there was one at Meevagh; there was one in Dingle; and there was one in Baltimore in County Cork.  I hope those boatbuilding yards are working at full time.  It is not so long since I visited the yard at Baltimore.  I was not impressed by what I saw.  I had hoped that the boatbuilding yard in Baltimore and the one at Dingle would have been extended and expanded. <Col N="348" /> I cannot say at the moment whether anything is taking place but I will make inquiries from Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  One of the things I have very clear recollection of is that during the inter-Party Government, there were proposals for the extension of the boatyard at Dingle.  From that day to this, no steps have been taken to extend that boatyard.</P>
    <P>I also recall that there were plans for the development of the boatyard at Meevagh.  Some people were under the impression that it was too near the boatyard in Killybegs.  There is no reason why we cannot have a good healthy, thriving boatbuilding industry in this country.  I fail to see why there have not been an extension and general improvement of and more orders placed in all our boatbuilding yards.  One of the most thriving and successful that I have seen is the yard in Arklow in County Wicklow.  I think that boatyard was privately-owned and managed by the firm of Messrs Tyrrell and Co.  I was most impressed by the activities taking place in Killybegs.</P>
    <P>The Government have under consideration the establishment of major fishery stations and centres.  I hope that if major fishery stations are to be established, it will not be to the detriment of the smaller centres.  I had, and still have, a very high regard for the earnestness, sincerity and courage of the fishermen of Schull in County Cork.  I am not satisfied that the developments which the fishermen of Schull put forward have been put into effect.  If there is any area on the south coast which would be suitable for development on a large scale, it is Schull.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to consider whatever representations come before him for developments in that area.  Because of the high standards of the fishermen, because of the landings, because of their courage and because of the geographical position of Schull, it is an area which is worthy of development.</P>
    <P>The Government should seriously consider an extension of the fishmeal industry.  I am open to correction on this, but I think it takes four tons of fish to produce one ton of fishmeal. <Col N="349" /> If fishermen cannot find a market for their fish, it would be a good idea to provide them with a market by way of a fishmeal factory.  It would be well worth while to encourage fishermen to catch fish for manufacture into fishmeal.  The prices paid for fish manufactured into fishmeal are not as high as those paid for fish for human consumption, but the fishermen would at least have a guaranteed market available to them.  Fishermen should be encouraged as much as possible to catch fish for manufacture into fishmeal.  There is an unlimited market for fishmeal.  I can never understand why, with unlimited quantities of fish around our coast, we do not catch sufficient fish to ensure a thriving fishmeal industry.</P>
    <P>Many years ago representations were made for an extension to the pier at Ballycotton.  When I was in the Fisheries Branch, Cork County Council were carrying out borings in connection with the extension of the pier.  For many years now, that extension has been under consideration.  It is high time there was a decision.  It is high time there was a suitable extension.</P>
    <P>In 1957 there was a proposal for the extension of the boatyard in Dingle.  That proposal should have been implemented long since.</P>
    <P>There is ample scope for increased fish exports to France.  I should like to know what efforts have been made in recent years, particularly within the past 12 months, to get an increased allocation for the export of fish to the French market.  This is a very important matter.  The French market is wide open and the Fisheries Branch could, I feel sure, obtain a bigger market in France for our exports of fish.</P>
    <P>I should like to make a short reference to the excellent work done by the Inland Fisheries Trust.  That body has done more valuable and useful work than any other body established in this country in the past 25 years.  The results of their work are there to be seen.  They have been responsible for encouraging increasing numbers of anglers from abroad.  I hope any <Col N="350" /> moneys they require will be readily available because their work is of national importance.</P>
    <P>The Trust should, I think, consider developing our canals.  Here I must make special reference to the Grand Canal.  The Inland Fisheries Trust could stock the Grand Canal.  That would be an added attraction for anglers.  They have at their disposal expert advice and dedicated men.  The value of their work and its importance is generally appreciated by the public. I have often wondered, however, why the membership remains so small.  It should be much more extensive.  The Trust deserves the support of everyone in the country.</P>
    <P>Fisheries policy generally will come up again for discussion, probably early in the new year, and we will then have an opportunity of expressing our views in greater detail.  With regard to boards of conservators, more funds should be placed at their disposal in order to ensure the fullest possible protection.  I have often wondered why water bailiffs are so overworked.  The reason is that there are not enough of them.  The protection of our fisheries is most important and the more money we spend in that direction, the bigger the attraction will be for anglers from abroad.</P>
    <P>The tourist industry ranks very high in our economy.  Hoteliers regard the angling tourist as the best kind of tourist.  He comes to fish.  He spends most of the day out of doors.  He is a good spender.  The more anglers who come the better it will be for the country.  I believe the increase in the tourist industry in recent years is largely due to the foresight, efficiency and organisation of those associated with the Inland Fisheries Trust.</P>
    <P>May I make an appeal now, an appeal which has been made every year since 1958, in connection with the Salmon Conservancy Fund?  The levy on the export of salmon should be abolished.  It is no use the Minister telling us and the country that the money collected is ploughed back for protection purposes.  The real fact is that it is being used to relieve the Exchequer of responsibility.  It is most <Col N="351" /> unfair that salmon fishermen, who have no other means of livelihood but who are engaged solely in salmon fishing, should have to pay a penny a pound, or whatever it is, on the export of salmon.  It is wrong and I would again appeal to the Minister to take the necessary steps to remove that levy. There is no justification for it and it is unfair and unreasonable that those salmon fishermen should have to pay this levy.  If funds are to be provided for the protection of our fisheries, there are other ways of providing those funds without the Government diving their hands deep into the trouser pockets of hardworking fishermen engaged in salmon fishing.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to say anything further, beyond saying that the Department of Fisheries, whether inland fisheries, the administrative section of the Minister's Department, or those associated with the administration of Bord Iascaigh Mhara, are dedicated to their work and we are extremely lucky in this country to have the services of those men.  I do not know of any Department which has the services of men so dedicated to their work as those in the Department of Fisheries. With the knowledge, skill and the expert advice available from the officers of that Department, there is no reason why any energetic, enterprising Minister, who has the full backing of his Government&mdash;and a Government determined not to be tinkering with the fishing industry but rather to put it on a sound footing so as to improve the standard of living of our fishermen &mdash;could not ensure that we will have the finest fishing industry of any country in Europe, when we have such a fine harvest all around our coast.  For that reason, I trust that the efforts of the Department will be renewed, with a view to a general improvement in the industry which is well worth saving and protecting.</P>

      <P>Many matters have been raised by various speakers here tonight. I will deal very briefly with, I hope, the majority of them, without <Col N="352" /> taking up too much of the time of the House.  Starting with Deputy Clinton: he mentioned the numbers engaged in the sea fishing industry.  In so far as the numbers are concerned&mdash;as we know them&mdash;we have the figure of wholly-employed people of 1,593 and of partially employed, 3,760, or a total of 5,353.  I should add, of course, that in addition we have no figures of the number of shore-based people involved. This would cover factory employment, employment in the distributive trade, fish auctioneers, wholesale staffs and so on.  They can be added to this figure of wholetime and parttime of over 5,000, which gives a fairly sizeable figure, although one which can and will be further extended in the year ahead.</P>
      <P>Again, on the question of the number of boys in training.  I think Deputy Clinton must have misread what I said because he turned the figures right around.  In my statement, I made mention of 38 new trainees in 1965 and 58 in 1966.  I presume the Deputy got it wrong, reversed the figures, and it is just as well that we should have that corrected.</P>

      <P>The repair service was mentioned by Deputy Clinton also.  I should say that this service has not gone out of action; it is still in operation and any repairs found necessary, following inspection, can be carried out in the boatyards.</P>

      <P>The same Deputy also mentioned the fishmeal factories and suggested that the State should intervene and finance some further factories or that a new semi-State body should be formed to operate the factories.  I am sure the House will be glad to learn that there are a number of fishmeal projects at various stages of formulation and that one has reached quite an advanced stage.</P>

      <P>Skerries harbour is a job about which the Deputies who have spoken, particularly those from County Dublin, know more than I do, but I would suggest that while Skerries has been waiting quite a long time for certain works, I do not think they will have so terribly much longer to wait.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Bord Iascaigh Mhara factories&mdash;these are the processing factories which were offered for sale by advertisement in 1962, but no offers were received.  Subsequently, one private firm entered into an agreement with the Board, under which the Board <Col N="354" /> processed fish for them.  The Board made losses on the factories, because of insufficiency of fish supplies.  This I have heard hammered out time and again: if you have not enough fish, you cannot make money on a factory, no matter who runs it.  The private firm has now taken the two factories and it has recently acquired two largestern trawlers and hopes to have adequate supplies of fish for the factories, to ensure their continuance and availability to those parts of the coast in times of glut, or where there is a genuine surplus.</P>
      <P>Salmon disease was mentioned here. This could be talked about for a very long time.  I know as much about it as most other people in the House, which is practically nil.  It appears from what expert opinion we have got that what is known about it so far is quite negative and that the positive statements about it and what it is are in fact not well founded.  This suggestion that it is an endemic disease called columnaris is not borne out by any and all of the tests carried out.  The early suggestion that it was such a disease was and should be taken as an early diagnosis, which, on testing, did not prove to be true.  It is true to say that those who, at the outset, gave as their immediate opinion, that it looked like it, are, from the tests since carried out, convinced themselves that in fact their early diagnosis was not correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position still remains that it has not been isolated.  It has not been finally determined what it is.  The best we can get by way of experts from all over the world have been consulted and every possible test and investigation capable of being done will be done in the hope of finding the cause and, possibly, the measures to deal with it.  But at the moment it would be unwise, as well as untrue, to say we are making any real headway in a positive sense to isolate this disease or to find the answer to it.  All I can say is that we are continuing to have the best available experts to try to find out what it is about, and I can assure the House that we will continue to do this. Let us hope that we can report some progress at a later stage.  At the <Col N="355" /> moment there is nothing I can add to what is already well known to the House.</P>
    <P>There was a suggestion that this disease related to the Waterville fish farm, Rainbow Ltd.  Again, there is no evidence to show that this is so.  There is no evidence to prove that this point is well taken.  I have heard those rumours and this talk myself, but, as I say, there is no evidence that this is in fact the cause of the disease. Naturally, any information which is sensible, or even any rumours if they are well founded will be examined, because this is a search for information which we cannot readily find.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not exactly a rumour in that case.  There were 30 different convictions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should not mix up convictions with the cause of the disease.  It is all too easy to say that because there were 30 convictions, this can be taken as the cause of the disease.  Even if there were 30 more convictions, that still does not prove the point.  I am not here to defend Rainbow Ltd. or anyone else.  Despite the convictions or any other information which may have been made known, there is nothing as yet that we know of to connect the disease in salmon with any action or lack of action or inaction on the part of Rainbow Ltd.</P>
      <P>Major fishery harbours were mentioned. Deputy Corish mentioned Kilmore Quay and seemed to think it should be one of the five.  Deputy Clinton asked what was spent already on major fishery harbours.  The estimated cost of providing the five major fishery harbours is £1,615,000, of which approximately £425,000 was spent up to October.  A quick breakdown is: Killybegs, estimate £300,000; already spent, £135,000; Castletownbere, estimate, £230,000, already spent, £90,000; Dunmore East, estimate, £275,000; already spent, £200,000; Galway, estimate, £350,000; already spent, nil; Howth, estimate, £460,000, already spent, nil.  That is as it stands at the moment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Larkin raised quite a number of points.  He suggested that a planned increase in landings to £4 million by 1970 is unrealistic, and said that the increase this year over last year was only 16 per cent.  We hope to increase the intake of our existing fleet and by additions to the fleet, to increase the overall intake between now and 1970.</P>
      <P>On the question of Dunmore East, the Deputy asked for a comparison of the subsidies and technical services as between here and the Six Counties.  I have not got the precise details of the operation of the subsidies which exist in the Six Counties, but I should remind the House that there is also heavy subsidisation for boat purchases down here.  The Deputy asked had we got reciprocal rights in the North and the answer is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.  He also mentioned the question of the purchase of secondhand boats and the financing of such purchases.  The answer is that this has been going on for some time. Loans are available for the purchase of these secondhand boats, but not grants.  We do not make grants available for the purchase of these boats, and lest anyone might rush off and buy one &ldquo;on spec&rdquo;, I should say that these boats have to be inspected by the technical people from Bord Iascaigh Mhara before any assistance is given by way of loan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A question was also raised about combine fishing, processing and marketing, and it was suggested that the big combines would work to the detriment of the small fishermen.  I think a comparison was made with the supermarkets as being somewhat similar in regard to the small shopkeeper. The interest of the small fisherman will be protected and his role in the future will continue to be mainly to supply the domestic market.  The bigger combines will, I hope, direct their <Col N="357" /> energies to the export market where there is ample scope for them, without crowding the small fisherman.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Hara protested that the fishing industry has been neglected in Mayo.  The only hope I can give Deputy O'Hara in this situation, if it exists&mdash;which I very much doubt in the context in which he places it&mdash; is a positive hope, because a specially appointed survey team are completing their examination of the harbour facilities in Kerry&mdash;I should say in South Kerry and this had started before there was any question of an election&mdash;and as soon as this South Kerry survey has been completed, it is our intention to have a similar survey made of the Galway and Mayo coast.  I think this survey will commence in the spring, and if the team work with the same expedition as they did in Kerry, I do not imagine anyone will complain.  I should mention that the team will comprise representatives of county councils, Roinn na Gaeltachta, An Bord Iascaigh Mhara, the Office of Public Works and the Fisheries Division.  We hope to have a reasonable survey done on the west coast, including Mayo, by the springtime.</P>
      <P>Deputy James Tully raised the question of staffs and pensions, working conditions and methods of payment. I should like to say in this respect that the first move has been made towards achieving uniformity in the wages of wholetime work people by relating their wage rates to those of the Agricultural Wages Board with a differential of 10/- a week, exclusive of overtime.</P>

      <P>We will get round to them as well.  In so far as a pension scheme is concerned, legislation will be necessary in respect of the discrepancies the Deputy raised in regard to the different levels of staff.  This legislation we hope will come along sometime and the implementation of its provisions will cost a bit of money. I am sorry Deputy L'Estrange has gone because I am sure he would be able to tell us where to find the money without imposing taxation.  I should probably be talking about Deputy Oliver Flanagan instead of Deputy L'Estrange, he saw such a bright future for fishing.  I daresay it was a view he held in the gloomy past when he was in charge.  According to him, we can eradicate all problems, improve the lot of the fisherman and land more and better fish, presumably cheaper for the consumer, without extra cost to anybody.  That was Deputy Flanagan's outlook.</P>

Any Order made under this paragraph may contain such incidental and supplementary provisions as the Government think necessary for giving full effect to the Order. On 5th July, 1966, the Government made an Order entitled the Arts Act, 1951 (Additional Function) Order, 1966, authorising An Chomhairle Ealaíon to establish and administer a fund to help creative workers in fine and applied arts who are advanced in years and or who, because of ill health, are unable to provide for themselves. The Council hope that the fund will be financed by voluntary subscriptions and gifts of property.  The Arts Act, 1951, provides that the Order will not come into operation unless it is confirmed by a Resolution of each House of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, this Bill is normally passed without debate as the services covered have already been discussed when the individual Estimates were taken.</P>
      <P>This year, however, there is one matter not already discussed.  As indicated in reply to a question on 26 October last, I am availing of the opportunity afforded by the Bill to provide for an increase in the interest rates of the Post Office and Trustee Savings Banks.</P>
      <P>The rate paid to depositors by these banks has never before exceeded 2½ per cent.  Interest rates generally have now moved up however and the commercial banks are paying 3½ per cent on thrift deposits.  It is desirable to bring the savings banks' rate into line. Section 3 contains the necessary provisions. I propose in addition to make suitable provision in next year's Finance Bill for the continuation of the concession under which interest on the first £2,000 of savings deposits or the first £4,000 in the case of a man and wife is free of tax.  With this concession the grossed-up value of the 3½ per cent interest will be £5 8s. per cent. This is a very attractive rate and I hope that its introduction will lead to a big increase in savings bank deposits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is proposed to introduce the new rate as from 21 December, 1966, in the case of the Trustee Savings Banks and 1 January, 1967, in the case of the Post <Col N="367" /> Office Savings Bank.  These are the most convenient dates having regard to the accounting years of the banks.</P>
    <P>The cost is estimated at about £1.3 million a year.</P>
    <P>The five Trustee Savings Banks at present operating in the State are obliged by statute to invest their funds with the Minister for Finance at a rate of interest not exceeding 3 per cent.  It is proposed to increase this maximum to 4 1/10 per cent to cover the increase of 1 per cent which will be payable to depositors and an increase to 12/- per cent of the maximum allowance of 10/- per cent in respect of the management expenses.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity to express my appreciation of the valuable work of the Trustee Savings Banks.  The Committee members voluntarily devote much of their time to the promotion of national savings. They deserve the thanks of the community for their important and fruitful work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister whether the income tax concession in respect of the interest payable on the first £2,000 deposited extends to super-tax. In the case of two people, a man and his wife, is their joint income liable or would they be entitled to receive interest on a deposit of £4,000 in the Post Office free of income tax and surtax?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The second point to which the attention of the House should be drawn is the fact that too many of us are prone to forget that this represents £1 million per annum on the Central Fund charge for the service of debt.  This is a charge which is steadily creeping upwards.  I think £1 million is at present enough to provide 2/6d a week for the non-contributory old age pension.  Can the Minister recall what the relevant figure is?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>This year 5/- for the non-contributory people without means cost £250,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="368" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is only about one-fifth. Even one-quarter then would provide nearly 5/- a week for the non-contributory old age pensioners and the blind pensioners.  We are now, owing to the stress of circumstances, which we are wisely meeting by allowing the Post Office Saving Bank to meet the competition of the joint stock banks adding to the Central Fund annual charge the equivalent of almost 5/- a week to the non-contributory old age pensioners.</P>
      <P>One other facet on which I should like to hear the Minister is that it is common knowledge to anyone concerned with matters of this kind, and to the Minister himself, that the banks are themselves forced into competition with themselves by the establishment of finance companies. Because of the fact that the rates they are prepared to allow on deposits with themselves have got quite out of touch with the current market rates, the joint stock banks are establishing finance companies offering for deposits threequarters of one per cent less than the current rate charged on overdrafts, which at present is something of the order of 6¼ per cent net.  Now we are allowing this body here to pay 3½ per cent free of income tax which works out at £5 12s for a person paying&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;for a person paying income tax at the rate of 7/- in the £.  How this will compare with what is available in the finance companies operated by the joint stock banks I am not prepared to say but I think it falls one and a half per cent short.  The Minister will have to keep in his mind that the banks themselves cannot get money at the current deposit rates and have been forced into the finance companies in order to get them.  I hope he will have better luck.  This is going to cost us 5/- a week on the old age pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is just one point.  This does not actually fall on the debt service charge in the Central Fund.  This increased interest will be paid out of the Post Office Savings <Col N="369" /> Bank Fund.  In other words, it will be met by the income from the various Government's stocks in which the resources of the Post Office Savings Fund are invested.  The Post Office Savings Bank is in that respect a self-contained operation.  It is entirely necessary to do this because if we want to keep the Trustee Savings Bank and the Post Office Savings Bank in the market for savings, and if we want to ensure that they continue to attract small savings to the extent we would like them to, we have no option but to go with the tide of rising rates of interest which is with us at present <Col N="370" /> and increase the rates to the extent we are increasing them.</P>
