      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs the amount of money still due to the Government by UNO in respect of commitments undertaken in Cyprus.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Aiken) Frank Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Aiken)</NameTxt>
      <P>Of the £1,224,535 of the total extra and extraordinary expenditure which we incurred up to 26th June, 1966 in maintaining contingents in Cyprus, two sums have already been paid, viz. £243,218 and £178,550 leaving a balance of £802,767 and this balance is covered by certain assurances from the Secretary General which I propose to repeat for the information of the Dáil:</P>
      <P>From March, 1964, when the United Nations Force in Cyprus was established, to 26th June, 1966, when the last three months Security Council mandate for the Force expired, the total estimated extra and extraordinary expenditure arising out of the maintenance of the Irish contingent was £1,224,535.  This was made up of (a) £977,765 in respect of extra allowances paid to our troops for service in United Nations peace-keeping operations; (b) £6,770 in respect of death and disability claims; and (c) £240,000 in respect of other expenses, mainly stores, clothing and depreciation of equipment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of the total expenditure of £1,224,535, £568,480 which was incurred <Col N="1314" /> since June, 1965 is covered by a firm assurance of reimbursement, and claims totalling £243,218 relating to this period have been presented and reimbursed. Claims in respect of the balance of the £568,480 are being prepared and will be presented in the near future.</P>
    <P>The remaining £656,055 relating to the period March, 1964 to June, 1965, is covered by an assurance from the Secretary-General that he will use his best endeavours towards its reimbursement, and of this amount £178,550 has already been reimbursed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it now the position that, having stood upon a point of principle that we would not accept reimbursement except from the general funds of the United Nations organisation, that we declined to accept reimbursement from the fund contributed to by only certain members of the organisation on the ground that that would be treating the troops like mercenaries, we now have to abandon that point of principle owing to the financial stringencies in which the Government at present find themselves?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, I have dealt with this matter on several occasions in the Dáil.  When we were asked to go originally in March, 1964, the Security Council had given a mandate for the Force for a period of six months.  We stated to the Secretary General that we thought it was unwise that the expense of the Force should be met by the voluntary funds and that we would not take it. Instead of the operation ending six months after March, 1964, the mandate was renewed for several periods since.  At a point we said we could not go unless we were reimbursed and we asked for reimbursement.  As I have described here, the Secretary-General has met the expenses since June last year and he has given an assurance that he would use his best endeavours to repay the expenses previous to that.  As I have said, a sum of £178,550 has been reimbursed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not answered my point.  I want some clarification <Col N="1315" /> with regard to this.  As I understood it, the Minister announced to the House a Government decision that on a point of principle, we would not accept reimbursement from a fund contributed by certain individual members of the United Nations.  We regarded ourselves as agents of the United Nations Organisation and not of any particular group of nations. This is a view I fully understand.  I understand the Minister now to say that that point of principle is abandoned on the ground that the operation has become too costly for us to stand.  I understand that.  What I cannot understand is this: Is this country prepared to sell a point of principle for cash, if we cannot in conscience continue to serve as servants of a group of nations rather than as the United Nations Organisation?  Do we continue to serve as servants of a group rather than of UNO and abandon the point of principle because we cannot afford to maintain it?</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot believe that. This question has been answered on at least two occasions in full.  I have answered it in full again today.  I do not believe it is appropriate for the United Nations to depend on voluntary subscriptions for the continuance of its work in any field, whether it is peace-keeping or other activities.  That is a very dangerous situation.  I spent three months last year putting forward a resolution, pressing a resolution, that we should get back to the compulsory payments for all activities of the United Nations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power if he will set up <Col N="1316" /> a commission to inquire into the workings of public transport by road, rail and canal, with a view both to the improvement of the services given to the public and the further development of the waterways as a tourist attraction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers) Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>The working of public transport in the State was very thoroughly investigated by the Committee of Inquiry into Internal Transport which reported in 1957.  Subsequent investigations include two papers on Internal Transport published by the Economic Research Institute in November, 1962 and May, 1963; and a most comprehensive investigation by CIE in 1963, the results of which are set out in the Pacemaker Report.  Copies of the Pacemaker report are in the Library of the House.</P>
      <P>The Transport Act, 1964, was drafted in the light of the information available from these reports.  That Act was accepted by this House as determining future public transport policy, subject to review after a period of five years.  A long term examination in regard to the movement of transport using road and rail is taking place in my Department with the help of other organisations such as the Economic Research Institute.  This must be based on forecasts of traffic over a considerable future period.</P>
      <P>The question of the development of inland waterways is a separate matter that is already being dealt with by Bord Fáilte Éireann as part of the tourist development programme.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances I do not consider that a commission as suggested by the Deputy would serve any useful purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Are we now getting ready to close down the canals?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Canals cannot be closed down until all navigation has ceased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully appreciate that the navigational aspect is one aspect of <Col N="1317" /> canals.  We should not forget that canals were dug over 100 years ago. There is quite a separate consideration to be borne in mind in connection with the canals, that is, the tourist amenities throughout the country for fisheries and their scenic advantage.  May we assume that whatever decision may be taken on the transport aspect of the canals full weight will be given to the views of the Minister for Industry and Commerce in regard to their amenity value for tourist purposes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, full value is being given to that view.  There are certain sewerage facilities in the Grand Canal which would have to be provided, if it were closed for navigation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance why workers employed by Government Departments are required to pay income tax at the full rate of 7/- in the pound; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may have in mind the apparent disparity between the standard rate of income tax, which is 7/- in the £ and the rate of 5s 3d which is used by employers for the purpose of PAYE calculations. The 5s 3d rate, however, is computed by deducting the earned income relief (one-fourth) from the 7/- rate.  Persons not within the PAYE system, including State employees, get the earned income relief before their income is charged to tax.  The tax on a given income is the same whichever method is adopted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that State employees&mdash;I refer particularly to manual workers with low wages&mdash;get no opportunity of making representations as to whether the income tax assessment is fair, would the Minister not agree that something should be done now to bring these people under PAYE so that at least they will know what they are being charged?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I answered a question on these lines last week.  I indicated that it was possible for State employees who were taxable to have deductions made over a period.  That was a question of option.  Some of them did not opt and had to pay over a shorter period.  I do not understand the Deputy's suggestion that State employees <Col N="1320" /> outside PAYE have no opportunity of questioning the tax paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously the Minister has little experience of the problems or the payment of lower-paid State employees.  What happens is that no deductions are made until the fall of the season.  Having deductions for the whole year made over a period of six months is most unfair, particularly because for some extraordinary reason, the extra deductions are made at the end of December.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The period can extend beyond six months and usually extends to ten or 11 months.  In some cases a final deduction is made in March, immediately preceding the new year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

I have had complaints before and since and I can assure the Minister the system is not working satisfactorily from the point of view of the people paying tax.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that a worker on a State farm, a single man, often has got a bill for as much as £15 at a time as a result of this system and that this has caused a lot of employment trouble on these farms?</P>

      <P>If the Deputy says so I must accept it, but there are means whereby the workers can have their tax deducted over a longer period.  If Deputy James Tully has any individual cases of difficulty and lets me have a note of them, I shall consider them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government (Mr. P. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 9 together.</P>
      <P>The removal after the event of election material on public display is the responsibility of those who carry out the posting not of the local authorities.</P>
      <P>Under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, the erection of advertisements relating to a Presidential, Dáil or local election or a referendum is exempted development on condition that the material is removed within seven days of the event.  It is open to the planning authorities to use their powers under the Act to enforce observance of the removal proviso but in the normal course such enforcement should not be necessary.  I assume that the removal of election material is being arranged by the bodies and persons directly responsible in the matter.</P>

    <P>Owing to the difficulties of recruitment, the Audit Branch of my Department was short-staffed over a number of years but is now at full established strength, and audit programmes are being designed which it is hoped will progressively eliminate the arrears and bring the audits of local authority accounts up-to-date within the shortest possible time.</P>

      <P>When speaking on the Second Stage of the Electricity (Special Provisions) Bill, I said that one method by which an interruption of the supplies of electricity could be provided against would be the negotiation of a voluntary arrangement by the employees of the Electricity Supply Board to give up their right to such action as would bring about interruption or serious danger of interruption in the supply of electricity.

      <P>Notwithstanding the unfavourable weather conditions deliveries of milk to creameries so far this year have been higher than in the corresponding part of 1965, a year when deliveries were at a record level.  Indeed, during the week ended 11th June, the latest for which complete figures are available, deliveries to creameries reached the highest weekly intake ever recorded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A few months ago when the continuing bad weather was having a pronounced effect on milk production, <Col N="1339" /> I had a discussion on the situation with representatives of An Bord Bainne and have since been keeping in touch with the Board on the position and I am satisfied that there is no question of the Board's being unable to meet any market commitments which it has entered into.</P>
    <P>I would remind the Deputy that a month ago I announced two very practical measures to assist creamery milk production, viz., an immediate increase of 2d per gallon on all milk delivered to creameries and an extra 1d per gallon allowance for high quality creamery milk as from 1st April next. I am confident that these price improvements will be reflected in increased production and that, despite the effects of the adverse weather conditions with which the dairying industry has had to contend in recent months, milk deliveries to creameries will establish a new record in 1966.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The whole purpose of the scheme is to increase cow numbers.  We have to administer the scheme along certain lines to ensure this.  The scheme is designed to induce a man on a holding to keep more cows on that holding.

      <P>If we were to accept this sort of arrangement as a general principle, we would get into very serious difficulties and in fact it would be impossible to administer the scheme.  The basis of the scheme is for herds on holdings to be increased on those holdings When you get into a situation where a man has his cows on another holding, we have to insist on certain safeguards.

In the case of kiosks and telegraph poles records are available only from 1st April, 1961.  In the five years since that date malicious damage to kiosks has cost £6,268 10s 4d and to telegraph poles and wires £56 14s 11d.

      <P>In accordance with the provisions of the Health and Mental Treatment Acts, institutional services must be made available without charge for the persons specified in subsection (2) of section 14 of the Health Act, 1953.  A person who holds a general medical services card would be regarded, as long as his name remained on the general medical services register, as covered by subsection (2) of section 14.</P>
      <P>However, in the case of a holder of a non-contributory old age pension who is detained in a public mental hospital, under the provisions of section 8 of the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1960, the pension is appropriated towards the cost of the patient's maintenance.  In such circumstances, however, the person-in-charge of the hospital may pay to the patient up to £1 a week, if, in the opinion of the person-in-charge, the patient is capable of making proper use of the money.</P>

      <P>There are two things: there are institutional services and institutional assistance.  If an old age pensioner goes into hospital, he has naturally a medical card and everything is absolutely free and nothing can be taken from him.  If he is there for shelter, the position is that I made an order which I circulated to all health authorities whereby of that pension the sum of £1 must be left with the person in receipt of such type of assistance and I also made provision that commitments such as rent, rates, insurance policies, <i>et cetera,</i> must be taken into consideration, to enable, for instance, a person who has to be there for a short time and who may have a dwelling outside will be enabled to keep that dwelling on and pay the rent for it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health whether, in view of his <Col N="1351" /> recent statement on the need for improving conditions of nurses in the Republic, he will now arrange for the upgrading of nurses' living-out allowances which are extremely unrealistic in the Dublin area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The salaries of nurses employed in the health services are on a national basis.  The present scales are in accordance with an arbitration award made in December, 1964.</P>
      <P>Living-out allowances are not paid but the salaries of nurses who are provided with accommodation, board and laundry are subject to deductions, at standard rates, in respect of these items.</P>
      <P>I am aware that nurses who live out, particularly in the Dublin area, feel that they are at a financial disadvantage compared with their colleagues who are provided with accommodation within a hospital.  Any claim for a special monetary allowance in this regard would, of course, be a matter for consideration under the scheme of conciliation and arbitration for local authority staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I glean some sympathy for the predicament of nurses, in Dublin especially?  It is an extremely cramped bed-sittingroom you can obtain at the moment at £4 a week. Would the Minister be prepared to consider the claim, taking into account particularly the situation of these people in Dublin?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the Deputy's question is that he does glean a great deal of sympathy, but the scheme of conciliation and arbitration for such nurses is there and it would be presumptuous of me to anticipate in any way what the findings of the arbitration might be. I would say, however, that I feel that non-resident nurses are at an economic disadvantage compared with resident nurses, who pay about £160 a year for board, apartments and laundary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also like to say to the Deputy, that from the purely economic aspect of this, where we have to build nurses' homes and where we are building <Col N="1352" /> nurses' homes at all, a more realistic living-out allowance might save a substantial capital investment in this respect.</P>

Advertisements should not give the impression that smoking is sophisticated and glamorous.  For example, glamorous situations should be avoided, in particular where they feature people of a certain distinction.  Advertisements should not over-emphasise the pleasure of smoking, should not over-emphasise the inhalation and exhalation of smoking or should not over-exaggerate the enjoyment of smoking either by facial expression or mood.</P>

      <P Just="Center">NEW SECTION.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 5, after line 57, to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where a person proves, to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners, that he has incurred expense on himself, his child or any dependant (for whom a dependent relative's allowance is granted for the year in question) arising out of the disability or illness in hospital of himself or that dependant there shall be allowed as a deduction from the income of that person before assessment, the vouched expenses so incurred in excess of £50 per person and up to a maximum of £300 per person provided that such person likewise proves that an application to the Voluntary Health Insurance Board for insurance against such disability or illness was prior to the beginning of such income tax year declined by such Board.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment relates to the allowances for tax purposes of the costs of illness.  It has been what I might term a hardy annual over the years and various Ministers for Finance have from time to time provided one reason or another why the amendment could not be accepted at the time it was introduced.  Bearing all these excuses&mdash; and I use the word &ldquo;excuses&rdquo; quite deliberately&mdash;in mind, the amendment now before the House has been drafted with a view to meeting each and every <Col N="1359" /> case made by the Minister and his predecessors in office against the concession that is involved.</P>
    <P>May I take the various parts of the amendment and make it clear where the amendment does meet any genuine objection that could be made by a Minister for Finance?  The amendment reads:</P>
    <P>Where a person proves, to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners that he has incurred expenses....</P>
    <P>In other words the onus of proof is put on the taxpayer and the Revenue Commissioners are entitled to demand in each individual case the type of proof they require so that they will be satisfied the expense has been incurred. In offering that, I must confess that I think the amendment goes even further than it should go in leaning over backwards to suit the Minister and the Revenue Commissioners.  It is quite clear on the face of the amendment now that the Revenue Commissioners will have ample power to reject the fake claim and to allow only the genuine claim.</P>
    <P>The amendment further goes on to limit the proof of the illness to the taxpayer himself.  Consider, however, the position of his child or of any dependant for whom the dependent relative's allowance has been given.  Incidentally, I note, just as I see that, that there seems to have been a clerical error, from the first drafting I made, of the wife being dropped out.  It was in my first draft, when I was making it more legible perhaps.  I may have dropped it out myself or it may have got dropped out later on, but obviously it would be appropriate to have the allowance also in respect of the wife. The position of the child does not perhaps go far enough because there would be the case of a child in the legal sense of the term but not in the tax sense of the term, a person over 16 years of age who was an invalid and who was not, therefore, still able to be at an educational establishment, who would not qualify for the tax allowance for children and yet obviously might be a person who would <Col N="1360" /> be causing the taxpayer very substantial sums in illness.  The dependant is limited to the tax code's own definition of &ldquo;dependant&rdquo;, again narrowing the desirability specifically to meet the objections that were made from time to time.</P>
    <P>The Minister, also, or his predecessor &mdash;I forget which&mdash;indicated at an earlier stage that the Revenue Commissioners would find great difficulty in satisfying themselves where the case of illness was one in a person's home, and so on.  Accordingly, to meet that point of view, the relief here is narrowed specifically to the expense arising out of disability or illness in hospital. The case has been made in earlier discussions that the effect of such a relief would be to ease the lot of the person who was a taxpayer and not to make any amelioration in respect of the lot of the person who did not pay income tax.  The special provisions of the Health Act make it clear that that cannot be, that it is limited to hospital treatment.  Under the Health Act, the provisions now are that there can be a special case up to an income limit of £1,200.  The overwhelming percentage of the cases that this would cover would be persons in excess of that figure and to whom the argument that was there heretofore, when the Health Act's limit was fixed at £600, would not now appear to be relevant.</P>
    <P>The case was made through the years, also, that it would be impossible administratively to cover this if every little tittle-tattle of expense was included.  We were never anxious to provide that.  We were never anxious to provide relief in respect of the big cases, the heart-breaking cases which virtually all of us, as Deputies, must have met from time to time.  Hence, the sum we suggest on which relief should be given is a sum in excess of £50 per person per annum up to a maximum of £300 per person per annum.  The relief that would be there, in those cases, would be well worth while for the taxpayer and certainly would not lend itself to any type of small administrative problem by reason of small bills or fake bills being sent in.</P>
    <P>The Minister last year, went on to <Col N="1361" /> make the case that if this was allowable, it would do damage to the Voluntary Health Insurance Board. We have no desire to do anything that would in any way damage the success of that scheme, a success of which we on this side of the House are justly proud.  It is one of the things that will be there, no matter what may come, as a monument to the enthusiasm, zeal and new thinking that was infused into the Department of Health when Deputy T.F. O'Higgins was Minister for Health from 1954 to 1957.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>We have provided, therefore, that an essential proof in a case such as this is that the applicant will prove he asked the Voluntary Health Insurance Board to cover him and that they refused.  They do refuse and, indeed, they must refuse, of necessity, to take the type of case where there is a chronic illness.  This relief will be of assistance mainly for the chronic illness&mdash;it is really more&mdash;the chronic illness we were thinking of when we put it down for discussion in the House and, we hope, for the Minister's acceptance.  The manner in which a family, almost well off, can suddenly see all their savings going by reason of the illness of some member of the family, or a dependant for whom the family is responsible, when they are outside the terms of the special provisions of the Health Act, is something that I am sure the Minister has met, as indeed we have met it.  It is appropriate that the hardship case should be met by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In an effort to ensure that he would have none of the objections to the amendment which he has voiced and which his predecessor, the former Deputy Dr. Ryan, voiced, on earlier occasions we have restricted this amendment almost to the bone.  We have, in addition, left the decision on the proof of evidence to the Revenue Commissioners rather than leaving it open because we felt that if it were left open, the Minister might take the line that it would be difficult to avoid false claims for relief under this section.  If <Col N="1362" /> there is any other reasonable way in which the Minister tells the House that he must have additional power for the purpose of detecting and preventing false claims for relief, then we are willing to look at any such suggestion by him most sympathetically.  Nobody is anxious to start anything that would mean a false claim for relief but there are genuine cases of hardship in this regard and we feel this to be an appropriate way of meeting them.</P>

I felt sympathy because I felt the Minister was on such a sticky wicket producing such lame arguments against this reasonable proposition and anger because this amendment has been before the House on five or six occasions and because speakers from all sides have spoken in favour of the principle, because the amendment is designed to give effect to a recommendation of the Income Tax Commission and, above all, because it is such a Christian proposition that we should strive to ameliorate the lot of the seriously ill as far as the impact of taxation on them is concerned.  It is terribly disheartening to think that such general agreement could be expressed for the principle and that yet we should time after time batter our heads against a stone wall.  I find it particularly disheartening, because, as I said before on this Bill, one came to expect a certain attitude from the Minister's predecessor which ill becomes the present Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is apprehensive that if he concedes the case for a special allowance in respect of sickness expenses, this will open the door to a wide field of claims for other special allowances.  I find it hard to believe that the Minister is really convinced that this is a valid argument.  Sickness and all that springs from it is something for which there is no parallel in the range of afflictions and needs for which <Col N="1363" /> one can reasonably make a request for tax allowances.  The Minister is under a grave misapprehension in so far as he appears to believe, from the tenor of his remarks last week, that we are seeking relief under this heading for surtax payers.  The Minister&mdash;I quote from the Official Report for 21st June, 1966, volume 223, at column 911&mdash;said:</P>
    <P>The person who would be liable to pay a very small amount of income tax possibly would not benefit to the same extent as a person who would be in the surtax bracket.  Therefore, to that extent, the State would not come to the assistance of all its citizens equally.</P>
    <P>There is no reference to surtax in Deputy Sweetman's amendment or anything to suggest that the allowance would automatically rank for surtax as for income tax.  Indeed, the provisions of the Finance Act, 1959, which extended certain personal allowances to surtax payers were restricted and confined.  The surtax relief is confined to the personal allowance.  We have the precedent with which the Minister should be familiar, the income tax relief for insurance premiums and for voluntary health premiums do not rank equally for income tax.  It does not rank at all for surtax.  In any event, we are not seeking this relief for surtax payers.  The maximum effective relief which would be available to any income tax payer under the terms of the agreement would be £105.  In order to obtain that relief, a taxpayer would have to be suffering tax on at least £300 of his income at the standard rate of income tax.</P>
    <P>As I stated last week, and as I stated before, this matter is the subject of considerable attention in the Fifth Report of the Income Taxation Commission. The Commission preparing its report had before it a memorandum from the Revenue Commissioners which opposed, in principle, reliefs such as this and, broadly speaking, made the same case as the Minister made last week, that this would open the door to other claims for special classes of persons and for special circumstances. <Col N="1364" /> Notwithstanding that memorandum from the Revenue Commissioners, the Income Taxation Commission went on to recommend at paragraph 96 of the Seventh Report that &ldquo;a taxpayer who incurs expenses on himself, or on any dependant, arising out of disability or illness which is serious and likely to be permanent, should be allowed the vouched expenses in excess of £50 p.a. per person and up to a maximum of £300 p.a. per person&rdquo;.  In other words, the Income Taxation Commission rejected the case which had been made to it by the Revenue Commissioners, the case which the Minister has now regrettably revived.</P>
    <P>The Royal Commission an Taxation and Profits in England recommended a relief also on the lines which we are now seeking.  The terms of that recommendation are also set out in the Report of our own Commission at page 30 of the Seventh Report.  It is true that the Report of the Royal Commission in Britain in this connection has not been accepted by the British Government, but that is not at all a valid precedent for our Minister for Finance to go on.  We all know the range of health services which are available without means tests, or without any discrimination whatever, in Britain and we have no parallel in this country.  To that extent the case for this amendment is very much greater indeed than it is in Britain.  The theory, the doctrinaire theory, which I believe has inspired the Revenue Commissioners in their approach to this, is that income tax should be a non-discriminatory tax which does not take account of special circumstances affecting one class of person or another and that the reliefs granted under the income tax code should be confined to broad categories of persons, such as married persons and persons with dependent relatives: in general terms, that the reliefs should be simple to administer and uncomplicated.</P>
    <P>Our amendment is far narrower in its terms than was recommended by our own Commission, to the extent that Deputy Sweetman has confined the reliefs which are sought to disability or illness in hospital.  We are getting away from the terms of our <Col N="1365" /> Commission's Report on even narrower and more circumscribed lines and to that extent the amendment should be all the more acceptable to the Minister, even if it falls far short of the demands of equity and justice.  The relief sought is confined to those who are seriously disabled or so seriously ill as to be confined to hospital. Furthermore, it is confined to those who have been refused by the Voluntary Health Insurance Board. Those who are normally healthy, who are not predisposed to illness, are, generally speaking, accepted by the Voluntary Health Insurance Board.</P>
    <P>It seems to me very wrong to discriminate in the tax sense against the seriously ill or those with a predisposition to illness; but that is what we are doing.  Surely equity demands parity of treatment as between those who are acceptable to the Voluntary Health Insurance Board and those who are not?  By accepting our amendment, the Minister will be giving parity of treatment to those who have been turned down by the Voluntary Health Insurance Board.  That is all we are seeking.  It is a very modest proposal. It falls far short of the amendment which we tabled here some years ago and which was criticised then by Fianna Fáil because it did not go far enough.</P>
    <P>The Minister suggested last week that the cost of this amendment might be some few million pounds.  That is utterly absurd.  Perhaps it is a bit foolhardy to endeavour to estimate the cost, having regard to the limited knowledge available to us in relation to the tax yield and the number of possible claims, but, nonetheless, I shall be foolhardy enough to suggest that the cost would not exceed £100,000 a year in terms of tax.  The need for this relief has increased over the years significantly and substantially, and particularly this year because of the increase in the standard rate of tax.  Those who are sick and infirm and who are liable to tax will now be asked to pay even more tax than they paid in years past.  That is a disgraceful state of affairs.  It is because we believe that a basic principle of justice and <Col N="1366" /> equity is at stake that we persist in putting down this amendment year after year and we shall continue to do so so long as we remain in this House.</P>
    <P>As I have said on several occasions, the willingness of successive Ministers for Finance to co-exist with inequity is altogether wrong.  It is a willingness which must be opposed at every possible opportunity.  There is a certain principle of equity at stake.  I believe there is even more than that involved. That is the fifth or sixth occasion on which discussion has taken place here. If parliamentary democracy means anything at all, surely the time has long since passed for acceptance of this amendment, backed as it is by the official report of a Government Commission; surely this amendment should have long since been written into our legislation?  If there is some dead hand of bureaucracy opposed to reform behind the Minister, then it is time the Minister cast that off, took an independent line and exercised his own undoubted intelligence and sense of fairplay in matters such as this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I want to say that one's personal feelings ought not to determine what one regards as fair and just legislation.  There are many facets of administration and legislation, facets with which one, as a Minister, would have a personal sympathy but in respect of which one could not ensure that, by adopting a suggestion made, fairplay would result all round.  This is one of the principal difficulties in relation to income tax relief in respect of expenses incurred in illness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I realise that Deputy Sweetman has very adroitly tried to circumvent, I must say very fairly, all the arguments that successive Ministers for Finance have put forward in refusing to accept amendments such as this.  The first difficulty that must be overcome is to avoid giving an unfair advantage to one particular category of taxpayer in relation to one particular aspect of unavoidable personal expenditure.  The income tax code has written into it certain personal allowances which operate, as far as one can devise, fairly <Col N="1367" /> as between one taxpayer and another. To pick out one aspect of personal expenditure, no matter how difficult it might be for the taxpayer, would inevitably give rise to claims for allowances in relation to other forms of personal expenditure.  Last week we had a number of amendments seeking relief for education, travel to work, and so forth.  These are all unavoidable personal expenditure.  If one were to yield to the very genuine, I have no doubt, entreaties of the Opposition for tax relief in respect of expenditure on illness, one would inevitably have to face similar entreaties for tax relief on other forms of expenditure.  I shall not analyse the wording of the amendment, although, as Deputy Sweetman says, there is one obvious omission.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>That may have been my own mistake.  I wrote that amendment down here last Wednesday because I was so disgusted with the Minister's reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The Commission on Income Taxation did make recommendations, with a limit of £50 at the lower end and £300 at the upper end, as in the amendment, but it did not differentiate between hospital and other expenses; to differentiate between these would, I think, introduce an important element of unfairness into the system.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I am dealing with the amendment as it appears, and in that respect we have had statements from other members of the Opposition who highlighted the expenditure incurred in an illness outside hospital expenses.  To limit it to hospitals would create advantages for people who are lucky enough to get into hospital. There are many people who at the present time are lucky to get into hospital; there are many illnesses which are not regarded as active illnesses and, therefore, not requiring hospital treatment. These sufferers from illness are usually either not admitted in the first instance or asked to leave when they <Col N="1368" /> become non-active patients.  If they are discharged from hospital and continue to suffer a protracted illness at home, then the terms of this amendment will not in any way relieve those responsible for paying their medical bills.</P>
      <P>Everybody is aware that it is possible for people to incur medical expenses outside of hospitals by way of medical attendance, appliances, and drugs used and administered in the home, as much as if that person were in hospital.  Therefore, the amendment, even though I admit it was sought to widen it in former years, would create that distinction as between taxpayers who would have dependants in hospital and taxpayers who would have dependants ill at home.  There is the other difficulty, which I repeat, that this amendment, or any amendment of this nature, would inevitably benefit people who are better off more than those who are less well off.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me take a couple of examples to indicate how people who are better off would benefit much more than less well off people.  In the first instance, there are people who would not qualify at all for ordinary health benefit, free or semi-free hospital treatment, and who may not be paying income tax at all.  Even though the limit of qualification was raised recently to £1,200, there are many people earning in excess of £1,200 with families who are not income tax payers and, therefore, would not benefit at all by the amendment proposed.  For example, a man earning £1,565 a year and having, say, six children, would not benefit at all by this amendment, because he would not be liable for income tax.  If he were earning £2,000, the relief under the amendment would amount to about £26 5s; if he were earning £5,000 his relief would be about £47 10s; if he were earning £6,000, his relief would be £60, and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. P. Byrne Mr. P. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Up to a maximum of £105.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Nevertheless, that indicates that the higher the man goes, the greater the benefit it would be for him.  There is one other problem in the income tax range.  As the Deputies are aware, if a dependant had an income of £180 a year in his own right, then the taxpayer of whom he is a dependant would not be entitled to a dependant's allowance and, therefore, would not qualify for relief under the section.  There are a number of other anomalies on which I do not like to go into too much detail.  Take a man who has two or three children injured in an accident at their home&mdash;maybe on a swing or a seesaw.  If the three of them have to go to hospital for a period and the cost of the hospitalisation, although perhaps less than £50 in respect of each of them, totals almost £150 then the taxpayer will not qualify. Even if only one child is injured and the hospital expenses amount to less <Col N="1370" /> than £50 but over a period of, say, three or four years, the hospital expenses amount to £200 or £250, the person of whom the injured child is a dependant will not be entitled to relief.</P>
      <P>If the State is to provide assistance of this nature to people who suffer injury or whose dependants suffer injury or contract a disease by reason of which they must go to hospital, then it ought to be fair.  Under the system proposed, or under any system that could be reasonably devised, it would be most difficult to ensure that that relief could operate fairly under the income tax code.  As I said at the outset, no matter what one's personal opinions or personal sympathies are, one must regard such a proposal objectively, and if it is not fair, if it does not operate generally, then it ought not to be enacted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised and disappointed at the reply of the Minister to this amendment because, with all due respect to his predecessor, the former Deputy Ryan, who is now a Senator, he did show some sympathy for the idea behind this amendment over the past two or three Budgets for which he was responsible.  His difficulty seemed to be trying to devise some method by which people who suffer real hardship could be assisted under the income tax code.  It seems to me from what the Minister has said that he has sought out very special cases to show that either some people would not get any benefit under this proposal or that those people who could be regarded as being fairly wealthy would benefit where they should not benefit.  I accept the Minister's argument in respect of those specific cases but I think he should&mdash;in his capacity as Minister for Finance&mdash;be one of the first to admit that there should be some relief in respect of people who have to incur severe medical expenses, not alone for one year but, in many cases, a number of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would be concerned about certain people in the middle income group, those people who are in insurable employment or those whose income does not exceed £1,200 per year as per <Col N="1371" /> the recent arrangement by the Ministers for Social Welfare and Health.  It is true that if they have to go to hospital they do not have to meet the full charge, but it is also true that they do have to pay to the extent of 10/- per day.  It is true also that under the present system they have to meet the expense of a doctor and they have to meet what has now become the very heavy expense of purchasing drugs or medicines.  I am sure Deputies Sweetman, Ryan and P. Byrne would not mind, if the Minister gave an indication that he would introduce a new proposal in the Seanad in the Finance Bill, at all changing to some extent because, as it is, the Minister seems to have closed his mind completely to any relief whatsoever for those who had to pay heavy medical expenses.</P>
    <P>It is not a good argument for the Minister to say that if he assented in respect of this amendment, he would have many other types of people asking for similar concessions.  He quotes education as one example and says that people would be looking for increased allowances in respect of the education of their children.  Whether that is desirable is not being discussed here but the plain fact is that when one compares health with education, the higher education, secondary or university education, need not necessarily be absolute as far as parents are concerned. It is desirable that every child should get an opportunity of developing himself to the extent of getting a secondary education and, possibly, a university education but ill health is something in which one has no choice; ill health and the incurring of heavy medical expenses are impositions on a family.  Many of us know families who have been beggared by reason of the illness of the breadwinner, his wife, children or some other dependant of the family.</P>
    <P>One of the things which attracts me about this amendment is that this concession is to be applied to those who have been refused admission to the Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme.  If we had not a Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme, I suppose there might be a legitimate <Col N="1372" /> objection by the Minister because then he could say that these people should be able to provide&mdash; although I would not go along with this &mdash;and keep on providing for such ill health of any member of the family. The people to whom this applies in the main&mdash;apart from those mentioned by the Minister in the surtax group, those who could be regarded as being wealthy&mdash;as far as I can see are those who could be severely handicapped and hurt in their financial position by heavy medical expenditure.  Some of the people I have in mind, those in insurable employment, those who even at the present time pay income tax in the middle income group, may have little nest eggs either in the Post Office, bank or in some other savings institution.  I suppose it would not be unreasonable to say that some of those people would have, maybe, £200, £300, £400, £500 or £600 in the family fund but a long illness would deplete these financial resources very quickly.</P>
    <P>The concession proposed in this amendment is not a big one.  I do not know if the Minister has tried to find out how much approximately it would cost per year.  I do not think it would cost a fantastic amount.  Like Deputy P. Byrne, I could not hazard a guess as to what it would cost but the question has been put up in Dáil Éireann so often I am sure it must be possible for the Minister's advisers to tell him approximately what it would cost.  We have spent long hours on discussions of proposals in this House which would cost relatively small sums.  As far as the Labour Party are concerned, we do not want these concessions applied to people who can well afford the expense for which it is proposed there should be some income tax relief, but we genuinely believe that, in relation to the type of person Deputy Sweetman has in mind here, this concession should be granted.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that the Minister has appeared to have closed his mind on this.  We all know that his predecessor, Deputy Ryan, had a very easy way in this House when it came to discussion and in his efforts to try to get from one stage of a Bill to another. <Col N="1373" /> I would plead with the present.  Minister to give further consideration to this, but if there should be an upper limit over which this income tax relief should not apply, I would go with the Minister then.  But I would be concerned with the man in the middle income group, that he should be helped and should not have his financial resources depleted by reason of the ill luck of having ill health, either himself or any dependant in his family.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I congratulate the Minister on the very first-class Opposition speech which he delivered from the Government benches?  I can only assume he is rehearsing for the day, which is not too far distant, when he sits on this side of the House and some other Minister for Finance is introducing an amendment such as the one now before the House for discussion.</P>
      <P>This amendment is primarily a Government amendment.  It is tabled in this particular restricted form by Deputy Sweetman simply to meet the objections raised to it on other occasions in the case of the more liberal allowance which we in Fine Gael have been advocating for people unfortunate enough to suffer from ill health, which can be a tremendous personal burden but can also be an extremely difficult family burden.  That is what Deputy Sweetman this year, and other years, together with the other members of the Fine Gael Party, has been asking this House to consider.</P>
      <P>It is rather disappointing, as Deputy Corish has said, that for the first time in this particular year, we find something less than sympathy from the Minister for Finance.  The Minister's approach to this is something like a person standing on the bank of a river who sees a few people drowning and who decides that he will not endeavour to save any of them because he could not save them all.  That is exactly the attitude of the Minister.  It was also the attitude of his predecessor: that because he could not save everybody in the water and bring them all to the bank at the one time, he would not make any effort to save them at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has asserted that it would be wrong to give this benefit to <Col N="1374" /> those who could benefit by it because there would be some who would not benefit at all.  I do not want to be too morbid but may I remind the Minister that under our present death duties code we do not have to pay estate duty on funeral expenses.  If we carried the Minister's argument to its logical conclusion, this is wrong because some people will avoid having this benefit because they disappear, their bodies cannot be found to be buried and when their estate is being administered, this advantage of not having to pay estate duty does not arise because they have no funeral.</P>
    <P>If we followed the Minister's argument to its logical conclusion, we would also do away with the advantage now applied to funeral expenses because some people who live beside a graveyard have a very small funeral bill.  The coffin can be carried from the person's home to the graveyard but the people who live at quite a considerable distance away would have funeral expenses which would run into a few hundred pounds.  That kind of illustration shows how unworthy is the Minister's argument when he says that no benefits can be incurred unless they can be applied to all and sundry.  If that is a valid criticism, it can be said that there are a number of allowances in the income tax code which it can be said do not apply to all citizens because all citizens are not paying income tax.  If that is to be the type of argument which we can expect in regard to all requests for allowances in future, it seems that we can never seek any reliefs in the income tax code.  The Minister said last week that this amendment could cost a few million pounds.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That amendment was put down in the name of Deputy Cosgrave. If that was going to cost a few million pounds, it would mean that one-tenth of the income tax payers in this country are suffering from serious illness.  We find that unacceptable.  If it is so, it is all the more reason for accepting this amendment.  If such a large proportion of our people today have such high <Col N="1375" /> medical expenses, and they are forced now to pay income tax on those expenses, then the case for the amendment cannot be rebutted.</P>
      <P>The Minister last week made a most unworthy suggestion with regard to this amendment which has been adequately dealt with by my colleagues here today. I would like to refer to a number of allowances which at present apply in regard to the income tax code, which if the Minister's argument is serious, should not be given.  Allowances are now permitted in respect of expenses incurred in the full-time education of children.  This is clearly something which does not benefit the poor, who either do not pay income tax or they have not their children receiving full time education so there is no advantage for them here.  Are we to understand from the Minister that he proposes to do away with this particular allowance because, in his view, it does not benefit all our people and should not be applied at all?</P>
      <P>Again, allowance is given in respect of interest paid on house purchase mortgages.  If the Minister is serious in his objection to our amendment, then we can only presume that he proposes to do away with the allowances given in respect of the interest paid in respect of such mortgages.  Again, this is something which applies only to the well-to-do people.  The poor have not enough money to take out a mortgage when they want a house.</P>
      <P>Allowances are also given in respect of life assurance premiums and in respect of premiums paid to the Voluntary Health Insurance Board. Irrespective of whether or not a person insures himself to the point of luxury, he will be given the allowance.  Likewise, if a person insures himself and his family in respect of Grade A treatment and institutional services in the very best and most luxurious nursing home, he will get allowance in respect of every premium paid.  This again indicates how fallacious is the Minister's argument that we should not accept Deputy Sweetman's amendment because it does not apply to everybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many allowances in the <Col N="1376" /> income tax code in respect of all kinds of services which people can get for themselves and their children, which to some extent are optional&mdash;they are certainly not obligatory&mdash;and if it is given in respect of those cases, then there is a clear case for giving allowances in respect of unavoidable expenses for hospital treatment.  We agree entirely that it would be better to extend the scope of the amendment so as to provide for medical expenses outside hospital.  If you confine this to hospital treatment, you will probably find that people will be advised by their medical advisers to go into hospital when in fact it might be better and cheaper to treat them at home.</P>
    <P>The restrictions in our amendment of £50 up to a maximum of £300 per person are put in simply because we know that on all other occasions when we have put in such an amendment, we have been told that we were too generous. It is less than fair that we are to be pilloried on this side of the House because we have kept within the suggestions made by successive Ministers for Finance.  It would appear that no matter what we say, we in Fine Gael will not be allowed to win by any Fianna Fáil Minister for Finance who will abuse us if we are too generous and if we are less so will tell us that it cannot be accepted because it does not give benefit to everybody.</P>

      <P>Neither I nor my colleagues mind, but we do not think it is right that there should be complaints with regard to this side of the House simply because we say there is lack of sympathy, or if there is sympathy, there is no action on the part of successive Ministers for Finance in the present Administration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I must confess I am bitterly disappinted with the Minister's reaction.  It is the job and function of the Revenue Commissioners to collect <Col N="1377" /> tax and it is the job and function of the Revenue Commissioners to do what they can to ensure that the laws in question have a uniformity but it is the job of the Minister for Finance, for the time being, while giving the most complete and careful examination to the advice tendered to him&mdash;advice, as I have said on many occasions before, which is unbiased&mdash;to make up his own mind.  If successive Ministers for Finance, down through the years, were to submit to what I might call the advice of the Establishment, then we would have no amelioration to meet difficult cases of one kind or another in the tax code.</P>
      <P>I said last week, and I repeat now, that the statement by the Minister for Finance last week and the statement made here today is merely a reiteration by him of the advice tendered to him to which he has not applied his own mind in any way at all.  I pay the Minister the tribute of thinking he has a mind of his own.  I only wish he would apply it in a case like this and not accept, without proper consideration, the Establishment view.</P>
      <P>Our whole system of Government is based on the assumption that we will have a skilled force of personnel, technically equipped, skilfully equipped to advise Ministers and the Government, and the advice they give is technically very good.  There are occasionally mistakes but the State has been extremely lucky in the manner in which the higher civil servants have through the years devoted themselves to the job of advising fearlessly in pursuance of their duty, without fear or favour. But Governments as we know them fail if Ministers do not make objective assessments for themselves, if Ministers do not take the advice offered to them and superimpose what they are supposed to superimpose, that is, their ordinary commonsense and the commonsense of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we were to have here merely the technical advice and the skilled advice of the Civil Service ruling us, then the composition of the Government would be the permanent Secretary of each Department.  That is not the type of government we have and, while paying the fullest tribute, as I have, to the <Col N="1378" /> Civil Service, I hope that will never be the type of government we will have. The type of government we have is one in which the representatives of the people are supposed to go in and sit down with the technical advice they have but not to accept it blindly, parrotwise.</P>
    <P>The speech made by the Minister for Finance today and his objections last week to any ameliorations for this class of harried taxpayer is, quite candidly and frankly, merely a reflection of the advice of the Establishment. I referred last week to the manner in which advice was given to me by the Establishment, honest and sincere advice, which I overrode at the time and which, I think, the present Minister for Finance and everyone will agree, I was quite right in overriding in relation to the provision of incentives for exports by tax reliefs.  It was at the time a breach of the accepted functions of the tax code.  This amendment we put forward today is a breach of the existing tax code.  That is why it has been put down.</P>
    <P>The Minister would be wise to accept the sincerity of the advice tendered to him here and to utilise his commonsense and the commonsense of the community rather than the technical advice of the Establishment.  Deputy Ryan made a perfectly fair comparison. If you see three people in danger and you cannot rescue all three, you do not go to the rescue of any one because to do so would be singling one person out for an unfair favour.  Of course, that is nonsense.  No humane person of commonsense would take that line in relation to three people drowning, but the excuse the Minister gave us for resisting this amendment is that it is not sufficiently broad in its application and that therefore it must be rejected. His predecessor on numerous occasions said that an amendment of this kind was much too universal for him to be able to administer.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has done himself a disservice in refusing to be big enough to accept the principle here. I do not mind about the wording&mdash; any wording that may be submitted, from either side of the House, might <Col N="1379" /> not exactly accord with the entire tax code.  However, the principle is one which should be accepted.  It is one that will be accepted when, as we hope, the people will be given an opportunity in the very near future of providing a different Government, with a different Minister for Finance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I have made some study of the questions posed by Deputy Sweetman last week.  In the first place, all home spirits, including whiskey, gin, vodka and liqueurs, are paid at the rate of £11 15s 11d the gallon, computed at proof.  That duty is provided in section 9 (3) of the main Bill.  I think the Deputy knows how the proof gallon is arrived at.  There are strengths over and below that proof gallon strength.  This is how the differential is applied in the case of imported spirits.  If the Deputy will look at the third definition in the Second Schedule, he will see that for every gallon computed at proof of spirits, the computation is at the full rate.</P>

      <P>The second definition deals with every gallon of liqueurs, cordials, mixtures and other preparations in bottle entered in such manner as to indicate that the strength is not to be tested.  Contrary to what Deputy Byrne suggested last week, liqueurs are of higher strength than ordinary whiskey.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>They may or may not be but the duty is variable according to the strength&mdash;whether it is above or below proof.  Normally speaking, imported liqueurs come in at a strength not more than 35 degrees over proof. It avoids examination of each particular consignment or bottle, as the case may be.  The 35 degree over proof is regarded as a very safe level from the Revenue point of view.  That will explain the difference between the £13 5s 6d and the £17 18s 5d.  The £13 5s 6d refers to 30 degrees under proof and the £17 18s 5d to the 35 degrees over proof.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise on the Fifth Stage a matter that seems to be particularly appropriate to the Finance Bill for the purpose of giving the Minister an opportunity of elaborating on the explanation which I am sure must have been brought to his notice today.  The Finance Bill is the measure through which the Minister for Finance crystallises his Budget suggestions.  This Finance Bill deals with his Budget proposals except the last proposal of the recent second Budget this year, which is to be dealt with in a Finance (No. 2) Bill, I understand. The discussion on the General Resolution No. 3 of the last Budget proceeded on the basis of certain trade figures.  We were all amazed this morning to see that the trade figures that were issued and on which this House fashioned its debate have apparently now been ascertained to be incorrect, incorrect to the extent of £1,800,000 in one month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like the Minister to take advantage of this Fifth Stage to explain to the House the circumstances in which that error crept in.  It does without question invalidate some of the considerations given to the general Budget debate during the past couple of weeks.  I am sure, immediately this <Col N="1382" /> error was found, it was brought to the Minister's attention and that he will be in a position, therefore, to give the appropriate explanation now.</P>
    <P>The Minister will realise also that this matter is one of very great importance because there is in the compilation of our economic statistics a very large percentage of figures at the end of the year put in as being balance not otherwise accounted for.  If that balance not otherwise accounted for could be influenced to the extent in one month alone, of a variation of this size, then it does raise some question as to the general accuracy of the figures.  Candidly, it leaves me wondering somewhat whether I was unfair once when I somewhat acidly expressed my views to a colleague when he challenged the accuracy of the figures in all.</P>
    <P>There is, I know, a prevalent view that there must be something wrong with the general statistical figures in relation to our balance of payments, because over the years if we were to accept completely the accuracy of the figures given, we might very well find that the basic position should have got even worse than it has.  We were accepting the position up to now that while there may have been some error, there was bound to be some margin of error and the margin of error perhaps cancelled itself out.  But when it comes to an error of this magnitude, the House is entitled to be told how it could arise and to be satisfied beyond question that even if it did arise, as it did in the returns for May last, the method of verification thereafter was such as to make it absolutely certain that any error in the future, whether made by reason of human frailty or perhaps computer frailty, would certainly be picked up at some stage before the figures fall to be assessed as the basis for economic policy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>This error, even though it is a welcome error in the event, was brought to my notice and I have asked for an explanation of it. As the Deputy says it impinges largely on the General Resolution No. 3 which we have been debating over the past couple of weeks.  It is my intention to <Col N="1383" /> deal with it in reply to that general debate.  I have not yet got the explanations for which I have asked to deal with it fully just now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that there are two distinct questions involved in the establishment of this new Ministry.  There is, first of all, the decision to establish a new Department of Labour and with that particular proposal we have expressed agreement. There is the question of whether the Government or the country are justified <Col N="1384" /> in continuing all the existing Departments as separate Departments with separate Ministers.  I propose, first of all, to deal with that aspect, and then to deal with certain other matters connected with the work which the new Department might perform.</P>
      <P>When speaking here last week, the Taoiseach gave certain figures for the number of Ministers in certain European countries and sought to imply that the fact that a number of other countries had in some cases slightly larger Cabinets was a justification for this country increasing the number of Ministers.  I expressed the view at that time that in all these cases, so far as my knowledge went, the population of the countries concerned was larger than the population here, and that the general tendency in many of these countries was a rising population.</P>
      <P>Since then, I have had an opportunity of checking the figures for a number of European countries, and the facts are somewhat different from those which were presented here, when we take into account the number of Ministers and the population.  Austria has a Cabinet of 12 and a population of seven million.  Belgium has a Cabinet of 20 and a population of 9¼ million.  Denmark has a Cabinet of 18 and a population of 4½ million.  Finland has a Cabinet of 11 and a population of 4½ million.  The Netherlands has a Cabinet of 14 and a population of 12 million.  Norway has a Cabinet of 14 and a population of 3½ million. Switzerland has a Cabinet of nine and a population of 5½ million.</P>
      <P>Those particular countries, by and large, have Governments of approximately the same size as we have; others are either the same size or less, but it is notable in each case that the population is higher than it is in this country.  Even for the lowest, Norway, the population is 3½ million, with a Cabinet of 14.  In all the other cases, the population is at least 1½ million more and in some cases it is twice, three times or four times the population of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we take even bigger countries with much larger populations, we find in France a Cabinet of 21 and a population <Col N="1385" /> of 46½ million, in the Federal Republic of Germany, a Cabinet of 22 and a population of 57½ million, and in Italy a Cabinet of 26 and a population of 50½ million.  So the suggestion that by the standards of other countries our Government are numerically small is not borne out by the facts.  The facts show that with two exceptions, in all the small countries in Europe the Cabinets are either the same size as or a good deal smaller than the Cabinet here, although the population in each case is substantially higher.  The two exceptions are Belgium with a population 9¼ million and Denmark with a population of 4½ million.  It is a mistaken philosophy when faced with difficulties for the Government, of necessity, merely to create new jobs, not new jobs for the people but new jobs for Fianna Fáil Deputies.</P>
    <P>This proposal, if it is to be considered, must be considered in the light of the present situation.  The present situation is that the number of new jobs provided has not merely fallen short of the Second Programme for Economic Expansion.  In actual fact, the published figures show that there are now 10,000 fewer people in employment than was the case when the Government assumed office and, in fact, before either the First or the Second Programme was put into operation. With the exception of a very slight rise in certain categories in industrial employment, the general trend in the numbers employed has shown a drop and, of course, a very substantial drop in respect of those employed in agriculture.</P>
    <P>This proposal by the Government is merely to establish a separate Department without, as the Taoiseach said, any change in policy or change in attitude.  I believe&mdash;and I think it is the general view in the country &mdash;that, in a country with a population the size of ours, faced with a lack of any worthwhile expansion in the economy, faced with the problem of high costs which is affecting so many sections, faced with the difficulties of securing sufficient revenue to meet current expenditure, there is no justification <Col N="1386" /> for increasing the number of separate Government Departments.</P>
    <P>We recognise, and have believed for a long time, that there is a case for a separate Ministry of Labour, and that the problems inherent in the present situation of our industrial relations justify that decision, but if we look at the functions which a number of separate Departments and Ministers have, there is no justification, once this new Department is established, for continuing a Department of Social Welfare separate from the Department of Health, or a Department of Transport and Power separate from the Department of Industry and Commerce. Certain functions in respect of communications might be transferred to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  It is a matter of opinion and a matter of decision by either the Taoiseach or the Government as to what precise functions might be transferred and views may differ between one Government and another as to what particular functions might be transferred from one Department to another.</P>
    <P>Some of the functions at present discharged by the Department of Transport and Power might well be appropriate to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, or <i>vice versa</i>.  It is not necessary on this occasion to discuss that matter in detail, because that can easily be done by an order, under the Ministers and Secretaries Act, transferring certain ministerial functions and responsibilities, but what is important is the fact that this particular decision to establish the separate Department of Labour should not be used as a reason for increasing the number of Ministers and adding to the already, for the size of the country and the population, inflated list of Government Ministers.</P>
    <P>The question of a separate Department and the functions appropriate to it was given a great deal of consideration in the NIEC Report and in that Report a good deal of reference was made to the functions which the present Department of Social Welfare, in its responsibility for the employment exchanges, exercised.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1387" /> I was disappointed to learn from the Taoiseach when introducing the Bill that the responsibility for these offices would now be transferred nominally to the new Department of Labour but only on an agency basis for the Minister for Social Welfare.  One of the criticisms expressed on this aspect of the matter was the fact that these exchanges had a history going back to the old poor law system and were generally regarded as responsible for administering the dole and the other payments associated with the social welfare benefits distributed by the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>The NIEC Report on Manpower Policy recommended certain specific changes which were listed under a number of headings.  In that Report it was recommended that five main changes were required: first, the image of the employment service must be improved; secondly, the employment service should seek to obtain advance notice of impending vacancies and payoffs; thirdly, it should gradually take on a more active role in facilitating the transfer of agricultural workers to other occupations; fourthly, more attention should be paid to vocational guidance to ensure that the worker finds the job for which his capacities and qualities best suit him and fifthly, that more information should be obtained about the relevant coverages of the various organisations operating in the employment market.</P>
    <P>When this matter was referred to by the Taoiseach in introducing the Bill last week, he said that it had been decided, however, that it was better to transfer the administration of these exchanges to the Ministry of Labour who will carry on in the exchanges, on an agency basis, the functions of the Minister for Social Welfare regarding the payment of benefits.  He said that the Minister for Social Welfare would, of course, continue to be responsible for the operation and development of the social welfare services and for Government policy in regard to them.</P>
    <P>The NIEC Report adverted to this and said that the employment service <Col N="1388" /> tends to be regarded as an unemployment service, that this is the natural consequence of the fact that for many decades the number of vacancies has generally fallen short of the number registered as unemployed so that for many people the employment exchange became a place which they had to visit regularly to collect unemployment benefit or assistance.</P>
    <P>This is the crucial criticism in regard to the placement services, that the employment exchanges were regarded merely as places where people got either the dole or other social welfare benefits and this particular decision, apparently, indicates that for the present at any rate and possibly for a considerable time, no effort will be made to change the character of these exchanges or to alter the general attitude and approach which the employment exchanges have taken to this problem.</P>
    <P>It may be that the present decision is merely an interim one but, surely, when the new Department was being set up was the time to make a break with what has been criticised, not merely by the NIEC Report but by trade union organisations as well as employers who have never used to anything like the extent to which it should be used the service which the employment exchanges should provide or never regarded the employment exchanges as providing the type of service which in any modern approach would be regarded as necessary if a manpower policy is to be effectively operated.</P>
    <P>On the general question of the functions which this particular Ministry will discharge, it seems to me that the economic aims in a modern society have certain well-defined objectives, such as full employment, a rising standard of living and reasonable stability in the value of money. These aims are difficult to achieve and even more difficult to achieve simultaneously. So far as the new Department is concerned, it would appear that it will have certain main functions &mdash; industrial relations generally and all that is involved in that description covering both legislation <Col N="1389" /> and consultation with the different interests.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that the question might well be considered whether the set-up and approach to industrial relations operated in this country is appropriate to our circumstances.  To a large extent, we have copied the British system, both in respect of trade union organisations and the employers' organisation, possibly because of the fact that many of the unions at one time had connections with and were largely offshoots of British unions.  It seems, however, that in many cases we have adopted the least successful features of the British system without minimising the disadvantages, and, while I was glad to note from the remarks of the Taoiseach that the Government still favour the right of free collective bargaining to which this country is committed by virtue of its membership of the ILO, I was disappointed that there was no general indication from him of the guidelines which might be adopted in considering industrial relations generally.</P>
    <P>It is true that legislation can only lay down general guidelines; it cannot make the system work.  This must depend on the parties concerned and in this matter the human element is a significant factor.  We have previously expressed the view, and I want to repeat it, that the problems involved in industrial relations are not easy to solve.  One of the difficulties that always arise in finding a solution of most industrial unrest is that the Government, or outside intervention, is only sought when there is an actual breakdown or a dispute develops to the point that a stoppage of work occurs.</P>
    <P>We believe the climate of opinion necessary for a calm appraisal of the problem involved in industrial relations should be developed and, if possible, brought about by laying down general basic principles which can be used as guidelines in tackling specific cases.  If this were done, it might be possible to get in advance a better relationship between management and workers and to secure from both sides in industry a favourable climate of opinion, as well as the better attitude and approach <Col N="1390" /> which should apply to harmonising relations between both sections.</P>
    <P>It is useless to wait until things go wrong before endeavouring to get agreement on these basic principles. In fact, one of the difficulties that has manifested itself on many occasions is that everybody is prepared to take action when the situation gets to a crucial stage.  Suggestions are made that different approaches might be considered and then when the crisis passes or when the difficulty is overcome, no effort is made to bring the parties together for a joint discussion to see what steps can be taken to improve the general situation governing not merely wages but conditions of work, promotion, and the various problems that affect and influence attitudes when disagreements occur.</P>
    <P>It seems to us, therefore, that the time to show initiative and imagination in bringing the different sections together is when there is a period of relative stability.  Undoubtedly, it is almost inevitable that at a particular time one or more disputes are likely to be taking place, or are present, but the trade unions or the employers' organisations should be invited by the Government to consider, without reference to specific disputes, the long-term principles which should in future govern increases in income, their relationship to productivity, the relationship between different groups of workers, and various sectional grievances over such things as status and the way in which relations, say, between managers and workers might be conducted.  These problems could be considered in isolation from particular disputes.  If in that way some long-term thinking were possible, it might well provide a solution for those difficulties which are so critically important for the future of the country.</P>
    <P>I believe we might as well look at what has been done in other countries and try to learn from experience in those countries.  In that regard, I think some attention should be directed to European countries as distinct from Britain and possibly even some of the methods adopted in the United States might be considered.  In that way it <Col N="1391" /> might be possible to get general agreement on the aims and objectives which should govern the approach to industrial relations, as well as the area in which both sides would concern themselves&mdash;not merely with getting agreement on but working out progressive approaches to the general relationship of different sections as distinct from merely questions of wages and salaries.</P>
    <P>In considering the proposal to establish a separate Ministry, I believe the Taoiseach should have indicated whether the proposed new Department would be staffed from the staff of existing Departments or whether it was proposed to recruit additional staff.  We believe it is not necessary that staff, other than the specialist staff which I suggested, should be recruited as technical advisers and assessors when the administrative staff should be available from existing Departments.</P>
    <P>It is quite wrong, with the fewer people in employment and with the decline in population, to recruit each time a separate Department is established, new staff when the functions and responsibilities of existing Departments have been transferred to a new Department.  We believe the present decision to establish this Department can be justified because of the serious situation affecting the whole economy as a result of industrial relations and the disagreements and disputes which have affected trade, commerce, output and employment but the decision to establish a new Department without amalgamating at least two, and possibly four, of the existing Departments, is one that does not commend itself to us.</P>
    <P>When the Taoiseach introduced this measure, he gave very little indication of what the new Department would deal with, what attitude would be adopted or what policy would be enshrined in it.  His speech in the main was one criticising the Opposition.  We remember on a previous occasion when decisions of this sort were brought before the House the criticism expressed and the vociferous clamour raised, not only <Col N="1392" /> in the House but throughout the country, against the establishment of a new Department.  On this occasion we accept the fact that there is justification for a separate Department of Labour but we are absolutely convinced that there is no justification whatever for continuing in their present form some of the existing Departments, more especially when under the legislation Ministers have virtually no responsibility.</P>
    <P>Time and time again Ministers, and especially the Minister for Transport and Power in respect of a number of statutory bodies under his control, have said they had no responsibility. This would apply to other Ministers equally, for instance, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs with regard to Radio Telefís Éireann.  They have all reiterated that they have no responsibility for the management or direction of these statutory bodies, and once the capital sum is laid down or the annual subvention decided by the Dáil and approved in the annual Estimate, the Minister's responsibility ceases.  In those circumstances, there is no justification for separate Departments and we are entirely opposed to it.</P>
    <P>We believe that the present proposal can only be justified if some of the existing Departments are amalgamated. It is a wrong conception of government that with fewer people in the country, fewer people in employment, it is more efficient in some way to create more Ministries.</P>
    <P>It is common knowledge that some of the existing Ministers are merely functioning as organisers of the Fianna Fáil Party and many of them virtually devoted the whole of recent months to electioneering.  Indeed a great many were disappointed, not excluding themselves, by their comparative lack of success.  Similarly, we now have more Parliamentary Secretaries than ever before, not selected on any basis of merit.  Many of them, both Ministers and Secretaries, are decent men but they should not be selected because they are decent men but because they have an effective job to <Col N="1393" /> function as Ministers or Secretaries discharging public responsibilities.</P>
    <P>If this country is faced, as it now is, with acute economic and social problems, the way to deal with them is not to propose the creation of more jobs for Fianna Fáil Deputies but by making conscious decisions of leadership which should be the function of the Taoiseach of the Government. So far as I can see, this Government are entirely backward-looking. They are irritated by the present and fearful of the future.  In those circumstances, the present proposal, unless it amalgamates two existing Departments, cannot be accepted by us as a genuine attempt to deal with the economic and social problems which affect the community.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to state expressly at the beginning that we are in full support of the appointment of the Minister for Labour, and have been for quite a long time.  So also has been the association with which we have a close affiliation, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  As the Taoiseach said, this proposal was recommended <Col N="1394" /> in one of its reports by the Irish National Productivity Council.  We are not so foolish as to believe that the mere establishment of a Ministry of Labour will resolve the industrial problems we may have now or in the future but as far as we are concerned, what is equally important with the establishment of a Ministry of Labour, is the actual Minister, the person of the Minister, because I think the House will appreciate that one who is to accept the delegate role which undoubtedly he will have to play will be somebody who has the ability to negotiate, if not directly, in combination, and able to make an attempt, successfully, we hope, to bring the two sides of industry together on various occasions when it is necessary to do so to solve any industrial problem that may arise.</P>
      <P>I was disappointed&mdash;I do not know whether it is possible for the Taoiseach at this stage to name the person he has in mind as the new Minister of Labour&mdash;that he did not do so because I suppose it will be the subject of another and perhaps duplicate discussion in Dáil Éireann.  What is important to the members of the Labour Party is the member of the Fianna Fáil Party who will be nominated by the Taoiseach to be Minister for Labour. I do not know if the Taoiseach wanted to make this a dirty debate but he was not in his usual form, and I thought he was pretty nasty here on Thursday when he alleged that the Labour Party amendment was put down in an effort to make an opportunity for personal attacks on the present Minister for Transport and Power.  I should like to remind the Taoiseach that we have a Labour Party motion on the Order Paper which is, I suppose, six or 12 months old, calling for the abolition of the Department of Transport and Power and this is one of the few opportunities presented to us of putting this issue before the House for discussion and decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said at the beginning and as the motion implies, we are all in favour of the creation of the new Ministry of Labour.  I do not know why the Taoiseach was so cross last Thursday.  He seems to be at great <Col N="1395" /> pains to defend the members of the Government as if he felt somewhat guilty about them and about their behaviour.  This is the second time in about eight or nine days that he felt constrained to defend various members of the Cabinet at a time when, in fact, there was no severe personal criticism or one might say, general criticism, of these 13 or 14 gentlemen.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach also alleged that the Labour Party wanted this to develop into a dogfight and that this was their usual practice, as if the members of the Labour Party were the only Members who at times engaged in interruption, counter-interruption and perhaps a few ejaculations.  The Taoiseach himself is no paragon as far as political behaviour is concerned.  He is not the worst but one can say of all those gentlemen that they are no paragons, as is displayed every day in the week at Question Time.  The Taoiseach had occasion to say in 1959 that he liked the cut and thrust of political life and he did not mind a few rows across the floor of the House.  In another speech here, he referred to the National Farmers' Association and said that if they went into a political fight, they should not be surprised if they came out with bloody noses.  I think the Minister for Transport and Power is well able to take care of himself also.  If he got a bloody nose from time to time, he did not howl for himself as much as the Taoiseach appeared to cry for him last Thursday.</P>
    <P>This sort of criticism is not peculiar to the Labour Party, Fine Gael or any other Party or individual.  We remember the violent personal attacks made on the late Deputy Norton.  We remember the personal attacks made by the former Taoiseach of the Fianna Fáil Party on Deputy Everett when it was suggested he might become Minister for Justice.  We remember the attacks made on the private secretary to the late Deputy Norton and questions were raised on the Adjournment by Deputy MacEntee as to how this man behaved in his private life and as to the type of his marriage ceremony.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Neither were the Taoiseach's remarks last week with regard to the Labour Party and the motives he suggested were behind this amendment. I do not want to pursue the matter.  We have asked in this amendment that the Ministry of Transport and Power be integrated with another Department and if we are critical of the Department of Transport and Power and of the Minister, I do not think it can be said that we are making a personal attack on him. We are certainly in a position and entitled to criticise the office itself and its effectiveness.  We are certainly entitled to criticise the Minister's administration of his Department. We are certainly entitled to question whether the position of Minister for Transport and Power is justified.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach, in defence of the Minister for Transport and Power, and I believe in defence of the Ministry itself, said that Deputy Childers was a conscientious, hardworking, dedicated and courteous member.  I do not think anybody will deny that.  I suppose it is true to say that he has always been all these things the Taoiseach mentioned since he came to Dáil Éireann.  That is all right but to what effect is this, so far as his Department is concerned?  I think there is a general feeling in the House that the Minister finds himself inhibited and restricted every time he stands up to answer a Parliamentary Question.  As far as his administration is concerned, he has under him, in the main, the majority of semi-State undertakings.  He has CIE, ESB, Bord na Móna, Aer Lingus, Aer Rianta, the B &amp; I, Irish Shipping, harbours and a few other things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think we, particularly, are entitled to question the effectiveness or usefulness of the Department of Transport and Power because the Labour Party had reservations about it when it was first established in, I think, 1959 or 1960.  At that time, we supported its establishment not as a Department of Transport and Power but in order to relieve the heavy burden on the Minister for Industry and Commerce, <Col N="1397" /> whoever he was at that time and whoever he has been since.  The late Deputy Norton, in that particular debate, doubted whether or not a Minister for Transport and Power would have sufficient responsibility for which he could be accountable in Dáil Éireann.  The comments at that time by the late Deputy Norton and the members of the Labour Party appear now&mdash;as they have appeared in the past two or three years, but particularly this year&mdash;to have been very wise comments indeed, because it is very difficult to see what real function, as far as Parliament is concerned, the Minister for Transport and Power has.  In respect of State and semi-State companies, it seems that his only function is capital control. These capital requirements are also laid down in legislation.  Their power to borrow is laid down in legislation. The Minister's only function is to come into the Dáil and to ask for an extension in these borrowing powers or an increase in their capital requirements. If one wants to go farther in respect of real control in the Department of Transport and Power, in the final analysis it lies with the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>Our genuine belief&mdash;apart from the Minister himself&mdash;is that the Ministry of Transport and Power is really redundant and could be absorbed in some other Department.  One of the features of the Department of Transport and Power is that it is a very large-scale employer of labour.  As against what has been said by some members of the Fianna Fáil Party, we have always, in this House, given our full support to the establishment and encouragement of these various State and semi-State companies set up over the past 20 or 30 years.  Because they are large-scale employers of labour, we are concerned. The Minister, in present circumstances, has no responsibility for labour relations.  If the Taoiseach asks any of those whom he knows in the trade union movement, he will be told that labour relations seem to be very bad in many of the State bodies. That is why many of the rows we have here in Dáil Éireann have happened. The Minister for Transport <Col N="1398" /> and Power has held himself absolutely aloof.  It is true that he has no legislative authority to intervene in these disputes but all the evidence in recent disputes has been&mdash;for example, in the CIE dispute and in the ESB dispute&mdash;that he did not do anything at all to attempt to resolve the difficulties. As against that, I think credit could and should be given to Deputy J. Lynch, the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, in respect of certain disputes, particularly the ESB dispute in 1961.  He made great personal sacrifice and great efforts to see that these would be resolved.</P>
    <P>The present Minister for Transport and Power seems to do everything according to the book.  The present Taoiseach is too experienced and too wise to know that one cannot work in any Cabinet post purely by the book, particularly when it comes to industrial unrest, strikes, or various disputes.  The Minister for Transport and Power does not appear to have had any interest in recent labour relations.  On one particular occasion, that is, the ESB dispute, at the very height of the dispute, he hied himself off to some place in the United States: I do not think he should have done that.  It is not one of our main criticisms against him but it is a small example of where he has appeared to divorce himself entirely&mdash; quoting the law, I suppose, himself&mdash; from a dispute which could have such very serious effects for the country.</P>
    <P>We decided we should put down this amendment but, again, we had reservations because, as far as the Minister for Lands is concerned, I am sure he, like many others before him, must at times feel very frustrated, when replying to Parliamentary Questions in respect of the Land Commission, merely retail what the Land Commission tell him in respect of this or that particular question.  The only function of the Minister for Lands appears to be in the matter of forestry and that is a relatively small item in the whole economy of the country.</P>
    <P>Again, as far as the Minister for Transport and Power and his relationship with semi-State undertakings are concerned, their terms of reference are laid down in the laws that have been <Col N="1399" /> passed here establishing them.  In most cases, maybe in the majority of cases, they have full-time chairmen.  They run these departments in the day-to-day administration and, I suppose, in the framing and formulation of policy. Therefore, it appears, again, that the only function of the Minister for Transport and Power is to keep a fatherly eye on them.  What he can do for them, I do not know, because his only function in the Dáil concerns the granting of capital and the extension of borrowing powers.  There does not seem to be anything else he usefully does in relation to these semi-State undertakings, and these represent the bulk of his activities in his Department.</P>
    <P>Despite what the Taoiseach said here last Thursday and in public pronouncements, he might consider a general revision of ministerial powers.  A previous speaker referred to the amalgamation of the Department of Transport and Power and the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  That is a suggestion that might well be worked upon.</P>
    <P>Again, as has been said, we have the biggest number of Parliamentary Secretaries any government here have ever had: I have not checked on that but I am sure it is right.  We have a Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and a Minister for Lands and Forestry, and each of these has a Parliamentary Secretary. It is very difficult to understand what some of these Parliamentary Secretaries are doing.  Despite what the Taoiseach says about the size of the Cabinet compared with the size of Cabinets in other countries, it would seem that there are Ministers who have pretty little to do and, mind you, the two gentlemen now sitting on the front bench&mdash;the Taoiseach and the Minister for Industry and Commerce&mdash;are not included in that statement.  We have always conceded, as far as Cabinet posts are concerned, that, for example, the Department of Industry and Commerce, the Department of Finance and the Department of Local Government are very much overburdened.</P>
    <P>Again referring back to the discussion so many years ago on the establishment of the Department of Transport <Col N="1400" /> and Power, we believe that roads might well be put into the care of the Department of Transport and Power&mdash; I do not mean with the same Minister. Roads could certainly be put into a Department that deals with transport and power.  I would seriously ask the Taoiseach not to close his mind entirely to a general revision of Departments&mdash; not alone of the personnel in the Cabinet but of the actual Cabinet positions. Take, for example, the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  It rarely has any business in this House.  I have talked about the Department of Lands. The Department of Justice may have business in this House on occasions. There may be an absolute necessity to have a Department of Defence.  Again, the Minister for Defence has precious little to do in this House and precious little to do outside, apart from the fact that in the past three or four years, half of the Army has been either in the Congo or in Cyprus.</P>
    <P>However, as I say, the appointment of a Minister for Labour is not the complete answer.  The Taoiseach in all his recent speeches has taken pains to talk about industrial relations.  He does that because he believes, I suppose, that an improvement is needed but, mark you, he can be pretty vague at times as well.  He was not vague in the Stadium on Sunday night and I think he was correct, when he said that he was going to resist, or not going to give in lightly to those who would press for more Government intervention.  He is too wise for that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Dr. Hillery)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Tea (Purchase and Importation) Act, 1958, provides for the control of tea imports so as to ensure that tea is purchased in and imported direct from the country of origin by either Tea Importers (1958) Ltd. or by a registered tea trader.  The Act does not apply to essences and extracts of tea, <Col N="1401" /> including instant tea, but the importation of these products is prohibited by the Customs Consolidation Act, 1876.  For some time I have been receiving representations to have the prohibition on the importation of instant tea removed as there is a public demand for it, especially for use in tea dispensing machines.  Instant tea is now being manufactured in some of the tea-growing countries and provision can be made for its importation from these countries on the same basis as leaf tea.</P>
    <P>Under the Free Trade Area Agreement with Britain, it is necessary to remove restrictions on the importation of instant tea manufactured in Britain as it is regarded as a manufactured product.  The purpose of the Bill is to remove the existing prohibition on the importation of instant tea and to make it subject to the same regulation as leaf tea, except in the case of instant tea manufactured in Britain which will be free of restriction in accordance with the Free Trade Area Agreement. The importation of leaf tea from Britain will, of course, continue to be prohibited because leaf tea is not manufactured.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is clearly a piece of instant legislation.  We have put this Bill into the machine of the House and we expect some instant legislative beverage to come out of it.  I must say that at the end of the Minister's speech it is as tasteless to me as it was before the Minister began, and I do not mean that offensively.  The Minister is dealing with an insipid product when he is dealing with this Bill.  I take it that the article known as instant tea was not devised or conceived at the time the 1958 Bill was being considered and certainly not, as Deputy Tully suggests to me, when the 1876 Bill was going through. Perhaps our ancestors were wiser in their generation than we are in ours. Certainly, if we are to judge by the taste of other instant beverages, I doubt if the Irish palate would become as addicted to instant tea as it has become addicted to the more traditional form of tea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the 1958 Bill was going <Col N="1402" /> through, concern was expressed that we were imposing a restriction on the importation of tea and that this would lead to one type of insipid tea.  Experience has shown otherwise and there is quite a reasonable variety of good-class, middle-class and indifferent-class tea.  I suppose that instant tea would be very much the same as tea. We can only hope that those who seek this improvement know what they are talking about.  We feel sure they do. These are the tasters, the experts, and we are the consumers and we can only learn by experience.  I should like to know how it becomes necessary to amend the 1958 Act if in fact instant tea was not in contemplation in 1958 because it does appear that no prohibition could operate against something which was not then in existence. Could the Minister tell us if instant tea comes from tea, because there are other beverages to which one applies the name of some natural product but which do not justify the title of the product itself?  This may be the extraction of the essence and which therefore removes the necessity to make tea in the traditional way, with boiling water and a hot teapot.  I should like the Minister to give us some further information on this matter before the conclusion of this Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Some years ago representations were made to a number of local authorities to supply some type of beverage to persons taken into the local clinic for treatment and who had to stay there for quite a long time. It was found that the machines available for dispensing this product did not contain tea and one of the reasons was that we had some type of exclusion order against what has been described as instant tea.  If this legislation remedies the situation now, then it is a good idea, because no matter what anybody says, most country people find it very difficult to become accustomed to drinking a beverage which they were not accustomed to drinking.  Hot chocolate and coffee might be all right, but in this particular area I found that the type of beverage in the machines did not answer up, whether it was palatable or not, and practically everybody was asking why could there not be tea. <Col N="1403" /> I could not understand it myself until I made an inquiry and found there was a reason.  I should like to know if in fact&mdash;and it may not be the Minister's function to answer this&mdash;this is instant tea or is it some kind of concoction which is likely to leave these unfortunate patients with a far greater disease than they had when they went in.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill gives us an opportunity of asking the Minister to provide us with some further information.  There are various blends of tea but we do hear older people saying that there is no tea now like the tea they used years ago.  I am reliably informed that the tea now on the market cannot compare with the tea which was available to consumers many years ago.  Is it correct that as older people now maintain, it takes at least four spoonfuls of tea to make a good pot of tea as against only two spoonfuls some years ago to make a first-class pot of tea?</P>
      <P>This Bill gives us an opportunity of asking the Minister if there are any set standards.  If one goes into a hotel or restaurant and asks for a pot of tea, sometimes one gets a pot of water disguised as tea and sometimes one gets a pot of far.  There should be certain set standards for tea.  There are set standards for coffee, for cocoa, for drinking chocolate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should enlighten the House as to what he means by instant tea.  Are there set standards where this tea is concerned?  Is it absolutely certain it will be in no way injurious to health?  Tea is our national beverage. It is taken at least three times a day in every home in the country, and sometimes six times a day.  In the very hospitable county from which the Minister comes, the teapot is available beside the fire the whole day through.  There are cases in which people have taken tea every hour of the day.  We have had no statement from the Minister for Health as to whether or not certain types of tea are injurious to health.  Is there any means of obtaining or finding out the standard of imported teas because <Col N="1404" /> those who know what they are talking about maintain that the tea coming in now is not as good as the tea imported years ago?</P>
    <P>I do not know if Deputies remember shell cocoa.  It came in an enormous carton, something like the cartons in which cornflakes are packed today. On the carton there was a teapot and then a certificate giving details of the quality of the cocoa.  During the war period, there were many substitutes for tea and some of us have not altogether affectionate memories of them.  Is this instant tea rally tea? What are the ingredients?  What is the nature of it?</P>
    <P>This Bill gives us an opportunity of focussing public attention on this matter and bringing the Minister's attention to the fact that the quality of tea seems to have deteriorated. People say the times are not as good as they were; that may be correct. They say the weather is not as good as it used to be.  They say tea is not like the tea it was some years ago. Perhaps, as we grow older, our tastes change but I would appeal to the Minister to ensure that there are certain standards which must be adhered to.  I make these few observations in the hope that everything will be done to ensure that this instant tea, for example, is really tea.</P>

      <P>The reason for the 1958 Act was that during the war we discovered we had no claim on a country producing tea.  The way to establish a claim is to buy in bulk direct from the country of origin, and so we are not dependent on any particular person for our supplies of tea. The prohibition did not relate to the 1958 Act but to the 1876 Act, and I have a copy of the relevant part here. It refers to &ldquo;extracts, essences or other concentrations... coffee, chicory, tea or tobacco.&rdquo;  It was away back in 1876 that this prohibition was established.  We have to remove this prohibition because of the Free Trade Area Agreement and in removing it for Britain, I propose to remove it for the countries in which leaf tea is produced. I do not know if tea is injurious to health, as Deputy Flanagan mentioned.  I have never heard this suggested but, if it were, I am sure our Minister for Health would be actively pursuing the problem.</P>

      <P>Lochtach agus atá an Bille Leasa Shóisialaigh i mbliana, fáiltíonn Fine Gael roimh gach feabhsachán atá ann.  Nílimíd ar aon intinn leis an Aire atá sásta leis an mBille. Táimíd mí-shásta nach bhfuil a thuilleadh ann do na daoine mífhortúnacha atá ag íoc go nimhneach as míghníomhartha an Rialtais.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The confidence with which the Minister introduced this measure is not that which we in Fine Gael very much like because we regard the provisions of this Social Welfare Bill as totally inadequate and very far removed from the much publicised intention on the part of the Government to publicise a programme of social reform analogous to their programmes for so-called economic expansion.  But, seeing the failure and collapse of their programmes for economic expansion, perhaps we should be grateful they did not try to propagate a programme of social improvement or expansion lest it should meet the same fate as their other programmes, because it does seem that the present administration are incapable of so ordering the economic affairs of this State as to make it possible for the less well-off members of the community to live any kind of decent existence much less to fully use their physical and mental capacities in the way in which society <Col N="1408" /> should arrange things, so that they can use them in the way which God ordained they should use them.</P>
    <P>The truth is that there are tens of thousands of people in this country who are living on incomes which are far below what is necessary to give them a sufficient diet, much less give them clothes and the other amenities to which they are entitled.  About a year ago, a valuable piece of research work was done by a group of sociologists and dieticians and their survey established that the minimum diet necessary to prevent malnutrition would cost, for a child between eight and 12 years of age, £1 10s to £2 per week, to provide food for a child of between 15 and 20 years of age would require between £3 and £3 10s per week, and to provide food for an adult, who had reached the point of complete growth, would require something in the region of £2 10s per week.  Yet we are, through our totally inadequate social services, giving many people less than one-sixth or one-eighth of what the sociologists and dieticians inform us is necessary to maintain properly a diet which will prevent malnutrition.  We are, in fact, giving to 15,000 people in this State 5/-a week.  That is what we give to parents, who themselves are receiving insufficient amounts by way of public assistance to provide themselves with a nourishing diet for their children.  Not only do we not give the fathers and mothers of children enough to keep themselves but we give them, for their hungry children, the totally inadequate amount of only 5/- a week in some cases.</P>
    <P>Is it any wonder, therefore, that a society, like the Saint Vincent de Paul Society, must spend annually a sum of over half a million pounds to bring some kind of relief and assistance to those tens of thousands of unfortunate people in our midst?  Is it any wonder that in a city like Dublin annually one and a quarter million free dinners are distributed?  Is it any wonder that we have so much despair, so much family ruin in a society which regards itself as doing enough by the standards which we operate here?</P>
    <P>We do not make light of the tasks <Col N="1409" /> which any Minister for Social Welfare must face in endeavouring to persuade his colleague, the Minister for Finance, to make more money available for social welfare purposes but we say that a Government, if correctly inspired, if sufficiently conscious of their obligations to all section of the community, would devote more money to social welfare, social insurance and public assistance generally than we are giving in this country.  We have the very sad boast that of the countries with which we may one day be associated in a greater Europe, the smallest proportion of our national income is spent on social security benefits.  A country like Austria, which is somewhat equivalent to ourselves in economic potential, in wealth <i>per capital</i>, is able to spend one and a half times as much as we spend on social welfare.  That is a country which orders its affairs better so that, perhaps, fewer people are in receipt of social welfare, but those who are receive a great deal more.</P>
    <P>We regret also that, under the Bill, social welfare recipients who are getting the small increase of 5/- a week are obliged to wait for that additional benefit until the 1st November next although they, in common with everybody else in the community, have had to pay their share of those increased taxes since the beginning of this financial year last April.  Not only that but, in addition to the taxes imposed by the Budget which gave the first indication of these changes in the social welfare provisions, we have had a second Budget which will tax not only what some people termed non-essentials like beer and petrol but will also impose an additional penal tax of five per cent on some of the essentials of life.  It is idle to say that the social welfare recipients are not called upon to pay these taxes.  There is no tax imposed in modern society, in a complex society, which does not percolate throughout the whole economic system right down to the most humble consumer. That is why every pound of taxation we impose is spread throughout the whole economic network down to the poorest of the people in the community.  All those people have had to bear their share of the financial <Col N="1410" /> burden since last April and no benefit will come to them until the 1st November next, although the second Budget of this year imposes a five per cent additional tax on many of the essentials of life as and from the 1st October next.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear, therefore, that the Minister for Social Welfare, when he was using pressure on the Minister for Finance earlier this year and considering his proposals in association with the Budget, did not take into consideration the additional £7 million in annual taxation which has already been forced upon us and will be confirmed as and from 1st October next so far as the wholesale tax is concerned. Even on the Minister's statement, it must be taken that those slight improvements are inadequate.  The Minister felt they were inadequate, even in relation to the first Budget.  they are grossly insufficient when related to the second Budget.</P>
    <P>Some years ago Ministers were very apologetic in this House when they postponed improvements in social welfare benefits and assistance to 1st August.  They had great difficulty in justifying the postponement at that time.  It now appears that they have accepted that people will not criticise them for postponing social welfare benefits and they believe apparently they can get some political kudos from making promises for the future and that whatever good and political advantage comes to them will be increased over a period by promising better social welfare payments in the future.  This is like people who say that the best thing about a holiday is looking forward to it and not the holiday itself or the recollection of the holiday afterwards.  That is a very pleasant theory.  Perhaps those who have time to think may enjoy looking forward to their holidays.  It is a tragic thing when one pays for one's holidays and does not live to enjoy it.  It is a tragic thing that many social welfare recipients, particularly those in receipt of old age pensions, will not live until 1st November next.  It will be remembered by this House that we brought the taxes into operation in March of <Col N="1411" /> this year to pay for imporvements which are promised to people who will not be alive on 1st November next.  If ever democracy has gone wrong and if ever an ironic situation was created, we certainly created it in this House when we tolerated a situation of that kind.  It is difficult to see how much further we can go in this regard.  It was, first of all, 1st August and now it is 1st November.  If they keep this up, it will come to pass that some year there will be no social welfare improvement at all.</P>
    <P>Social welfare policies on the part of the State should have a number of definite aims.  I feel that in this country, we have not yet achieved the first and most important of these aims, that is, the relief of poverty itself.  I have already indicated that the valuable research work done by expert sociologists and dieticians shows that our social welfare code does not provide everybody with a diet sufficient to prevent malnutrition.  How can it be said that we relieve poverty when we provide only such small increases to social welfare recipients?  The tragic situation also arises that, whenever small relief is given in social welfare benefits, local authorities operating a differential rent scheme take away one-sixth of the improvements provided in this House, so that of the 5/- being provided by the Minister to some recipients of social welfare benefits, 10d will go to local authorities who are operating a differential rent system.</P>
    <P>The second aim of a social welfare policy should be to achieve social equality and social opportunity.  Nobody can seriously suggest that the miserable pittance we make available to the poor amongst us had any significance whatever in establishing social equality and social opportunity.  the third aim of a social welfare policy is a political one.  The principal political aim which we have here is to secure the unity of all our country.  Nobody can possibly suggest we are making any logical contribution to the unity of our country when we compare our social welfare benefits with those in the North. The Minister may argue that the benefits <Col N="1412" /> provided in the North are not alone paid for by the Exchequer in the North but that money is also provided by Westminster.  That may or may not be so, but there is certainly a frightening gap in the social welfare code in both parts of our country. There is very little opportunity of having our country united when there is such a gap between the social welfare code in both parts of the country.</P>
    <P>Those things are not words spoken on occasions of special ceremonial. They are things which will determine whether we will ever be united as a nation.  Therefore, it behoves us not to be satisfied with our social welfare code.  We have a tremendously long distance to run before we can catch up with the northern portion of our country.  We will have to go further than we have already gone.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned that we have the worst record with regard to social welfare scales operating in Western Europe.  It is proper that I should quote what they have in some of those countries.  To social insurance here, we devote 4.3 per cent of the gross national product.  Denmark, on the other hand, devotes 5 per cent, Belgium, 6.4 per cent, Austria, which is similar in economic circumstances to us, devotes 6.7 per cent and Western Germany, 9.1 per cent.  With regard to family allowances, this is a country which probably has larger families and more children in relation to population than any of the other comparable countries.  Yet we devote only 1.2 per cent of the gross national product to family allowances. The Netherlands devote 1.6 per cent, Italy, 2.6 per cent, France, 3.5 per cent and Austria, again comparable with us, 1.6 per cent.</P>
    <P>With regard to public assistance, we devote only 5 of one per cent of the GNP for this purpose.  Although we have probably more unemployment when compared with other comparable countries, we can devote only .5 of one per cent of the GNP to assistance to people who, by statutory definitions, are destitute, whereas Denmark devotes 1.4 per cent and Austria .9 of one per cent.  With regard to social security payments, we devote 6 per cent of the <Col N="1413" /> GNP while Denmark devotes 6.8 per cent, Italy, 7.9 per cent, Belgium, 8.3 per cent and Austria, the most comparable country with us. 9.2 per cent.</P>
    <P>I have left out of my statement West Germany.  They are something of a financial and economical miracle and are well ahead of their neighbours and fellow-members of the EEC.  West Germany has the highest rate of employment in Europe and because of that has less need for a substantial social welfare scheme.  Despite this, they apply 9.1 per cent of the GNP to social welfare insurance.  Family allowances are as low as .4 of one per cent of the gross national product but that is probably because of the very good wages available in Germany and because the social insurance payments are so high and their services are wage-related, something to which I shall return to later.  To the field of public assistance, Germany devotes .9 of one per cent, though the number of people in receipt of public assistance is very small.  In total social security payments, Germany can devote more than one-tenth of gross national product.</P>
    <P>They are the targets which we shall have to strive for and to strike.  One of the clear obligations imposed on us by the Treaty of Rome is to maintain social welfare standards similar to those of our fellow countries so that no country will have an economic advantage by avoiding its social obligations. We have so far to go in this field that it is pitiable to see the Minister doing nothing this year but dragging his feet along the tedious, tiresome road we have been treating for decades.</P>
    <P>The result of several years of negotiation with British Governments came to fruition recently when it became possible to pay to people in this country in receipt of British Government pensions increases in those pensions to which they would be entitled if they were resident in Britain.  Some of those pensions over the years have been the subject of agitation, prolonged and insistent, from all sides of the House.  We are grateful to those who succeeded in bringing the negotiations to a successful conclusion, but how tragic it is that this has been marred by the knowledge that the result is that <Col N="1414" /> £286,000 has been withdrawn by an Irish Government from those in receipt of social welfare pensions here.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance in his second Budget speech this year gave as one justification for the increased taxes that various charges under the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill would add an estimated £1 million to the Exchequer bill.  But if our mathematics are right, the net position is that the Minister will save this year £168,000 because when the original Budget was going through, no provision was made for the saving of more than £286,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise for the excess.  It is the six figures that matter, not the last five.  No provision was made in that regard.  Possibly it was because it was not known fully what the consequences of the new agreement would be.  It may be that they are not yet known.  Many of those unfortunate people for years have had to rely on the comparatively inadequate Irish pension payments simply because they lived here.  Had they lived in Britain, they would have been in receipt of incomes three or four times higher and it is tragic that in the end of that period of purgatory, when a little bit of heaven seemed to be ahead, our parsimonious State stepped in and said: &ldquo;You are too well off; we shall withdraw the benefits you previously enjoyed.&rdquo;  It may be that a statutory obligation lies on the Minister to do so but we ask him to introduce an amendment to stop the ruthless hand of the State from falling on those unfortunate people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We in Fine Gael are disappointed that we here are still relating our social welfare code to what is regarded as the largest amount which the poorest wage earner can pay.  That is the basis of our pauper relief system &mdash;perhaps the most appropriate term to apply to our social welfare code. We determine what is the maximum amount the poorest paid person can pay and say that will be the amount of the social welfare payments and that our benefits will be related to <Col N="1415" /> that figure.  The result is that people in reasonable employment who enjoy a reasonable standard of living because of having a reasonable income make certain commitments for themselves and their families and find themselves depressed to an appallingly low figure of income and standard of living when misfortune comes on them.</P>
    <P>We think this is wrong.  We think it is something which needs remedial action.  We need here a wage-related, graduated welfare and pensions scheme and the sooner we introduce it the better.  We believe people in reasonable employment and their employers will not grudge a system of pensions and social welfare contributions which will provide better pensions and better benefits when people cease to be employed. At present a large number of private employers make up for the State's want in this respect so that when their workers become unemployed through illness or otherwise, they add to whatever the State pays a sufficient amount to maintain their standard of living.</P>
    <P>Employers are doing this in many cases out of their own generosity, but there are also in operation in various spheres of employment voluntary schemes operated by workers and trade unions&mdash;schemes of sickness and other welfare benefits.  We do not take from the credit due to employers, employees, trade unions and others for this but we think these are indicative of the willingness of people to contribute to worthwhile schemes.  That is why we press that as a matter of national urgency, we introduce a system of wage-related welfare and pension schemes.  It is something our economy can carry, something we will have to bring into operation if we are to take our place in the wider European world into which some people would bring us.</P>
    <P>To deal with some of the details of the Bill, may I express some disappointment that while the Minister has properly sought to improve the position of applicants for contributory widows' pensions, he has not gone far enough ?  We know it will be very difficult for some widows to establish <Col N="1416" /> yearly averages of 48 contributions. Forty-eight contributions is a very high figure.  It seems a person would have to be in constant employment during a very long period to be able to prove 48 contributions on average.  I appreciate it is provided that reduced pensions may be paid where the average is less than 48.  That is of some assistance but we feel the figure is still high and that the Minister should try to reduce this means test to 42 or 45 contributions.</P>
    <P>The Minister has at long last opened the door for private domestic servants, providing a scheme of unemployment insurance for them.  We regret the Minister has in mind, as he has stated, to limit entitlement to unemployment benefit to women with what he calls a good employment record during a minimum period of ten years.  We believe the effect of that will be to deprive a large number of women of any benefit, for the reason that we think the marriage rate for domestic servants is as high as, if not higher than, that for other sections of the community.  A large number of these girls marry at a younger age than in other sections.  The result is that many of them will be paying the additional amount of unemployment benefit when they are married and not in a position to receive any benefit within a number of years of commencing to pay it.</P>
    <P>In other words, a girl could easily start work in domestic service at 15 or 16, marry at 20 or 21 and have only six years' employment behind her and not be entitled to any unemployment benefit, even if she suffered during that period unemployment for as long as six or 12 months.  The Minister's argument may be that the demand for domestic servants is such no person need be unemployed for anything more than a matter of days.  That may or may not be so.  I am satisfied there are parts of the country in which the demand for domestic servants does not outrun the supply.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following amendments:</P>
    <P>1.  To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;Dáil Éireann refuses to give a Second Reading to the Bill until the Government provide for the amalgamation of at least two existing Departments, so that by the appointment of a Minister for Labour an extra Minister will not be required.&rdquo; (Deputy Cosgrave.)</P>
    <P>2.  To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;Dáil Éireann while approving the establishment of a Department of Labour, declines to give a Second Reading to the Bill until the Department of Transport and Power has been intergrated with another Department.&rdquo; (Deputy Corish.)</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>When I reported progress, I was referring to the speech the Taoiseach made in the National Stadium at the Social Study Congress on Sunday night.  This is one of the many speeches on the same subject made by the Taoiseach and members of his Government in recent times.  I am beginning to become distrustful of the content of this type of speech. First the Taoiseach talked about the pressure of public opinion for greater Government control and he went on to say the Government resisted that.  There was no real statement to the effect that it would be resisted in the future.  I wonder is the Taoiseach setting up cockshots so that he can knock them down himself?  He talked about the pressure of public opinion for greater Governmental control in the sphere of <Col N="1418" /> industrial relations and of the danger to our democracy.  What section of the public have asked for that?  Everybody is concerned in one way or another when a strike occurs, no matter what sort of strike it is.  I can see that strikes in important industries hit a great number of people.  Every strike, no matter what it is, causes inconvenience. Even the bankers' strike is causing a certain amount of inconvenience to people, although many seem to get on all right, even though the strike has lasted such a long time. I wonder if this demand has come from any section of the workers?  Wage and salary earners represent a big proportion of the population.  I suppose the number of insured workers would be about 750,000.  If one were to include their wives and children, the figure would represent much more than half the population.</P>
      <P>I know there are certain sections who do not want to see strikes at all.  It does not make any difference whether these strikes are lawful or justified, or whether the demands by those on strike are reasonable or not. There is a feeling in the country, that has been cultivated to a large extent, to the effect that the trade union movement and the workers wield much more power and influence than they should.  I do not think this is correct. The Taoiseach gets quite an amount of support in his own constituency. His vote may not be as large as that of Deputy O.J. Flanagan, but he gets a substantial vote&mdash;about 2½ quotas. Does he see this attitude amongst the workers of Inchicore or any part of his constituency, the workers saying: &ldquo;We want to exert this influence in order that we might get more&rdquo;? People are beginning to forget they are talking about Irish workers, their own kith and kin.  I do not think anybody has suggested there are any sinister influences in these sections of workers.  Is it suggested, as some people say, that they are selfish or unreasonable?  If they appear to be unreasonable or irresponsible, the reason for this unreasonableness should be examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach in that speech also said that if the trade union movement <Col N="1419" /> were not prepared to undertake this responsibility of showing restraint and having due regard for the economy, the Government would be required to act by force of public opinion.  I do not think sufficient credit has been given to the trade union movement over that period to which the Taoiseach referred in his speech here on Thursday last&mdash;from 1946, when the Labour Court was established, right up to the present.  During that period we have had national wage agreements. It ought to be said that the trade union movement did show restraint.</P>
    <P>If we have industrial unrest at present, surely it cannot be laid at the door of the trade union movement, who, in my opinion, showed terrific restraint when the Irish Congress of Trade Unions were prepared to recommend to all their members in the 26 Counties that no more than £1 per week should be demanded in this tenth round of wage increases.  This was a formidable task for Congress to undertake when one has regard to the fact that the last National Wage Agreement which commenced in January obtained in the vast majority of cases for a period of two years, despite the fact that the trade union movement could riddle it and with justification could have broken it by reason of the increase in the cost of living.</P>
    <P>Another gentleman spoke at the Social Study Congress on Sunday night, the well-known Mr. Douglas Hyde.  He was talking about young people and is reported as follows in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 27th June:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...They are rejecting our society because they do not respect it.  We must be worthy of their respect and build a society that will use their idealism and give them a challenge to meet&mdash;in other words, a more Christian society than we have got.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Mr. Hyde thought the same went for industrial workers. who were charged with irresponsibility during a period of strikes.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If industrial workers are irresponsible, we have to ask ourselves why?  It reflects a breakdown in <Col N="1420" /> human relations, because we fail to make the industrial worker feel that he is part of the enterprise in which he works.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Therefore, it behoves us, apart from the establishment of the Ministry of Labour, to look into the causes of industrial unrest.  This is referred to several times in the NIEC Report on incomes policy.  Anybody who read that report knows that the NIEC showed the justification for unrest among many sections of the workers. It seems to me that every time there is industrial unrest, every time there is a strike, there is a certain section in this country which is prepared to condemn that strike without asking any questions as to the reasons why these people went on strike.  For example, when a body of workers in this city, or in some town, who are existing on £8 or £8 10. a week, look for an extra £1 per week, as in the present circumstances, there is an outcry from a certain section which has not even inquired into what these workers are paid, or how many hours they work, but merely because there is a strike. In the present climate it is the popular thing to decry strikers and the trade union movement without looking into the causes.  Surely if after a demand, long negotiations, and a lot of patience on the part of the workers, they decide to withdraw their labour there must be an appreciation of that final act.</P>
    <P>There is so much blather and talk about a just society that one wonders will that be the new cliché.  There is no point in talking in terms of a just society to an agricultural worker, a road worker, or a factory worker on £7 or £8 a week.  The Taoiseach and the Minister know there are such people.  As against them there are the people who usually complain about strikes and about the undue power and influence of the trade union movement.  They are usually in relatively good surroundings and good circumstances.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach talked about the pressure for more stringent control by the Government in industrial relations. There are other people who talk <Col N="1421" /> about disciplining the trade union movement.  There are people who blame the leaders of the trade union movement as if the leaders could say to any group of men who felt they had a justified grievance: &ldquo;You must not go on strike.&rdquo;  This is not a dictatorial movement ; this is a democratic movement.  Decisions are made within the trade union movement as decisions are made in general elections. If we get a Fianna Fáil Government which we consider not to be a good Government, that is the decision of the people and the people must live with it.  If a group of men, no matter what type of employment they are engaged in, decide they will not sell their labour to someone who is not prepared to buy it at the proper price, they are entitled to do that.</P>
    <P>Anyone who talks loosely and stupidly about disciplining the trade union movement does not believe in democracy.  The only one criticism I would have in that respect would be that not a sufficient number of trade union members are turning up at meetings where vital decisions are made.  In particular not enough trade union members are turning up at annual meetings where officers are elected and committees selected. The point I am making is that those people who talk about disciplining the trade union movement believe in the jackboot method.  The trade union movement believes that decisions should be taken in a democratic way and, once taken, should be executed.  It is the business of the leaders of the trade union movement to put the facts before the members, to abide by their decision, and to see that it is carried out to a &ldquo;T&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce&mdash;possibly the new Minister for Labour; we have not got that secret yet&mdash;and the Taoiseach recognise and, in turn, the trade union movement have recognised for a number of years, that changes in industrial legislation are necessary.  I remember at meetings of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions over the past four or five years, resolutions which I am sure ended up in the office of the Minister for Industry and Commerce which were passed by representatives <Col N="1422" /> of the trade union movement asking for some changes to be made.</P>
    <P>We can all agree with the Taoiseach when he said last Thursday that it is inconceivable that legislation passed in 1946 to lay down our code for industrial relations would be appropriate in 1966.  Things have changed; standards have changed; workers have got a new dignity; and having got that new dignity they are demanding new and better standards.  The are not prepared&mdash;particularly manual workers&mdash; to be regarded as coming within a category which is separate and distinct from other workers and salary earners.</P>
    <P>In any case, the members of the trade union movement recognise that many desirable changes could be affected particularly in the field of industrial relations legislation.  Let me say that so far as negotiations and settlements on wages and salary issues are concerned we proclaim that we still have a democratic system here in all our institutions and in any changes made there must be no infringement of the constitutional or democratic rights of the trade union movement or individual members.</P>
    <P>In his speech at the Stadium the Taoiseach said that the aim of policy should be to make social justice the criterion of economic activities and institutions and not the interest or power of individuals or groups.  What he intended to say may have been misrepresented&mdash;I do not know&mdash;but in view of the tenor of his speech many people will assume that that was directed only at the trade union movement.  We must remember that there are other individuals and groups who could be regarded as power groups.  I know we have the Restrictive Trade Practices Acts and other legislation introduced to deal with such people.  Over and above that, it must be recognised that there are groups who can have a tremendous influence on the economy in the way they manipulate and rig prices, despite the best efforts of the Taoiseach or the Minister for Industry and Commerce. If any warning is to be directed to those who it is alleged would not have the interests of the economy at heart it should be directed to some <Col N="1423" /> of those power groups in industry, in banking and in finance.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said:</P>
    <P>...Remuneration ...should be determined in a fair and objective way, in the light of the national interest, by consideration of equity.</P>
    <P>I think we would all agree with that sentiment but we should make greater efforts to put it into practice.  There is nothing fair or just in the manner in which we treat certain sections of the community.  There is nothing fair or just in the manner in which we treat the lowly paid workers.  We had a discussion on social welfare here today and there is no point in talking about the just and fair manner in which we treat many of those who are dependent on the social welfare weekly grants.</P>
    <P>On many occasions references are made to the NIEC Report on an incomes policy.  I do not know whether or not the Government have done this deliberately, but it does appear that while the NIEC document has been accepted by the Government, the only effort that has been made in recent times is to apply an incomes policy to wage and salary earners.  I know that the Minister for Industry and Commerce is attempting to stabilise or curtail prices by the Prices Act, and here again the NIEC recognise that there is a certain amount of dissatisfaction. Undoubtedly there is dissatisfaction among those who are lowly paid as against those who do not appear to contribute a tremendous lot to the community but who are in receipt of big incomes per year.  I do not think we can be proud of this society or that we can afford to be complacent about it.</P>
    <P>Certainly we cannot afford to threaten, for example, the 100,000 male workers in this country who have less than £10 per week.  We should think about that now and again.  We should think in terms, not alone of general statistics or of the figures that are rolled out here, say, during a Budget debate, but of the 100,000 males who have less than £10 a week, and of the family man who has a wife <Col N="1424" /> and three, four or five children, and ask ourselves how can these people exist, what standard of life must they have, in the year 1966, on £10 a week.</P>
    <P>It is assumed, in any case, again according to what the Taoiseach said last Thursday, that the Industrial Relations Act, 1946, will be changed, to what degree we do not know. Whether it will be a drastic change or not, we do not know or whether the legislation will be drafted in accordance with the wishes of the two sides of industry, the employers and the trade union movement.</P>
    <P>The Irish Congress of Trade Unions in the last two or three years at the annual conference urged the extension of the Labour Court.  I do not profess to be a practising trade union official and I am not as qualified to talk about the Labour Court as some of my colleagues undoubtedly will during this debate but I assume that the Labour Court will not be changed to the extent of compulsion in the manner in which the recent ESB Bill was framed and was before the House two or three weeks ago.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, who appears to be a reasonably sensible man, speaking in Killarney&mdash;or maybe it was Ennis&mdash;recently, appeared to be pretty annoyed about people who criticise the trade union movement and he asserted that good labour relations can in the main be cultivated rather than legislated for.  If in framing his legislation he is to be guided by what he said in that speech he certainly will be on the right lines but if there is an element of compulsion, as there has been in two Bills introduced by the Government, I do not think he will have the goodwill of the trade union movement and, again, may I say that I believe such legislation cannot be implemented?</P>
    <P>I do not want to go back on the ESB dispute.  I think the Government have a fair appreciation of what the Labour Party said on that occasion and of the conviction they have in respect of that type of legislation.  As my colleague, Deputy Kyne, said, no matter how many laws you pass, you cannot make men work.  In that particular dispute there were 100 fitters <Col N="1425" /> involved.  You could fine them for being on strike.  You could fine their trade unions for their being on strike. If they resigned their jobs, there is not a thing you could do about it.  You cannot make men work, no matter how many laws you pass here.  I am certain that if Deputy Hillery is to be Minister for Labour he will be glad to get away from that hastily conceived legislation that he introduced in connection with the ESB dispute of some few weeks ago.</P>
    <P>I presume that in the consideration of a new industrial relations Act there will be consultation and full consultation, with the trade union movement and the employers' side because it is only by mutual trust that you will get machinery that has a fair chance of success.</P>
    <P>I am presumptuous also to believe that in the extension of the Labour Court the Minister will adhere to the practice that has obtained since 1946, that is, of consulting the employers and the unions on the appointments to the Labour Court and that he will accept the nominees of these bodies.</P>
    <P>An effort was made some time ago by the Minister for Health to get away from this system of appointing the nominees of the trade union movement to certain State bodies.  He was unsuccessful in that.  This will be a big point of issue with the trade union movement and if the Minister takes power unto himself to appoint his own nominees without having regard to the various interests who should be represented on the Labour Court he will find himself in trouble.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that the system that has obtained for 20 years, since 1946, has been really defective in any way. The Taoiseach was one time Minister for Industry and Commerce.  Deputy Jack Lynch was Minister for Industry and Commerce for some time.  Deputy Hillery is the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I do not think that either of the sides concerned has given any of these Ministers a bad representative. The trade union movement will be as much concerned as the Minister will be to get the best man there and I am assuming that the practice that has obtained for 20 years will continue.</P>
    <P>One of the most crying needs of the <Col N="1426" /> trade union movement, and, I suppose, of the employers also, is the extension of the conciliation services.  There are too, too few conciliation officers operating in the country.  Small disputes happen that do not get the publicity on radio, television or press.  They are small when related to the whole economy but are very big in relation to the economy of the village or provincial town or small town in which they happen and it is very upsetting, to say the least of it, for these small communities to have to wait for days and sometimes weeks until a conciliation officer has the time to get down in order to try to resolve the problems that have arisen.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, last Thursday, talked about the function of the Labour Court, particularly of the conciliation officers, with regard to the promotion of good relations and the prevention of strikes.  This can be a very important function for these conciliation officers because the State, through the Labour Court, interferes only when the trouble has happened to the extent of men going on strike. We all appreciate that when men make up their minds to go on strike, they may think the next morning that they may not have taken the right decision, but, because they are proud men and have taken a decision, they are determined to carry it out and do carry on a strike for perhaps four or five days or a week. If the conciliation officers can step in and attempt to prevent strikes we will have gone quite a long way not alone towards good industrial relations but towards ensuring that the economy of the country and of these particular places and industries will not be disrupted.</P>
    <P>I do not know to what extent these services may be extended but the promotion of good relations is one of the most important duties that any Minister for Labour can undertake because, while it is not deliberate, there is a certain amount of distrust and there always will be until there is some improvement as between employers and employees.  Unfortunately in the main, the only time that employers and employees get together is when there is a dispute.  This is <Col N="1427" /> crazy.  I suppose it is more or less similar to the situation in which we find ourselves now.  We propose the appointment of a Minister for Labour; we propose an improvement in the Industrial Relations Act; we propose changes in trade union law, in the middle of this unrest.  The Government must take a certain amount of responsibility for this in that they did not do anything at all during times of relative peace as long as things were going on all right.  In 1964, and most of 1965, nobody was talking about good or bad industrial relations. During the various periods of the National Wage Agreement since 1946 or 1948, there was no attempt to improve industrial relations by way of legislation or to improve trade union law where a Government had the power and the function.</P>
    <P>This may not be the best time to re-legislate for industrial relations and for trade union law.  It occurs to me in fact, that it will not be done within this session and we trust things will have settled down on the industrial front, so to speak, in the autumn and may be in an atmosphere which we hope will be calm and peaceful, we will get an improved Industrial Relations Act to the extent of having a better Labour Court, to the extent of having better and more conciliation officers, all of whose jobs will be to prevent industrial unrest rather than to correct it.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Tully, will be able to talk about the position of agricultural workers.  The Taoiseach was somewhat vague in his speech last Thursday.  He promised Deputy Tully he would deal with agricultural workers and the type of arbitration they would have access to, but I do not think he developed it very much. I think he must recognise, even as a townsman like myself, that the Agricultural Wages Board is out of date. In any case, it is weighted against the agricultural worker.  There is equal representation for the agricultural workers, the trade unions and the farmers' organisation, but the man in the middle is the important one, and he has not been the best selection <Col N="1428" /> down through the years.  I suppose he always feels he should support the Government by in turn supporting the farmers.</P>
    <P>The two big parties in this House are certainly not unaware of the support of the farming community.  They are a little restricted in their regard for the agricultural vote but that is not the point I want to make.  I believe agricultural workers should have access to the Labour Court.  As far as I can gather, the Labour Court will be extended to such an extent that there will be two, three or four sections of the Court.  The agricultural community and the rural community in general and the forestry workers should have access to the Labour Court in order to try to ensure that they will not be deprived so far as their wages and working conditions are concerned.</P>
    <P>As far as trade union law is concerned, I can only give my own comments and I do not pretend to speak on behalf of the trade union movement or on behalf of my own trade union.  In this field, trade unions will certainly be willing to discuss with the Minister for Labour desirable improvements in trade union law.  The trade union movement have made efforts to ensure, where possible, an amalgamation of the unions.  I do not hear anybody giving credit to the trade unions for trying to do that.  A sub-committee has been operating in the Irish Congress of Trade Unions over the past two or three years to see how they can amalgamate some unions.  That is not an easy task because every small union, and there are many with a long tradition and with members who are proud of their association with these small unions, is very reluctant to submerge itself or lose its identity by amalgamating with others.  I think we should give the trade unions credit for making this effort.  I do not know how successful it has been but they are keenly concerned with ensuring that there will not be a multiplicity of unions in big jobs.</P>
    <P>We have not before us any direct proposals, apart from some general <Col N="1429" /> statements the Taoiseach made.  I know he would not be in a position to give absolute details.  The trade union movement would be very critical of any new power the Minister for Labour would take to himself as to the formation of new unions or, for example, the cancelling of the negotiating licence of a union.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions in accordance with international Conventions, in accordance with the Convention of the International Labour Office, recognise the right of groups of workers to form themselves into a separate trade union or into a new trade union. On the other hand, whilst recognising that constitutional right, the Congress on every occasion possible have condemned splinter groups and generally do not condone the idea of a number of small unions, particularly, as I say, when these unions are representative of one particular concern.  They believe that a small number of unions is a better negotiating body and that in itself is one of the biggest advantages.</P>
    <P>I refer to the ESB legislation and I trust that, on consideration, the Minister will decide to scrap it.  If this Industrial Relations Act will be so all-embracing as we are led to believe it will, surely he will devise some better method to ensure that there will not be industrial unrest in any of the vital industries and in any of those industries where a strike would have an effect not alone on the economy but on a big body of workers?</P>
    <P>We certainly will not be in a position to judge the Minister for Labour or his activities until his Estimate comes up, I suppose in another 12 months' time.  So far as the Taoiseach is concerned, he wants to keep the Minister for Labour a very busy man.  If I understand correctly, he will be delegated the task of directing a manpower policy.  That is a formidable undertaking. He will be concerned with industrial training and redundancy compensation.  He will be concerned with the various reports of the Committee on Industrial Organisation. In my view, these reports were some of the most valuable documents ever presented to the Members of Dáil <Col N="1430" /> Éireann.  Unfortunately, like so many of the other reports and documents, they are not followed up.  There are excellent recommendations here, recommendations designed to ensure that under free trade, whether with Britain or with Europe, industry will not be disrupted. The Minister or his predecessor was forced to concede recently that Irish industry just was not facing up to the task that the CIO report said they would have to undertake in order to prepare themselves for free trade.</P>
    <P>I believe these recommendations can be implemented only in consultation with the workers, and we have too little consultation with workers in Irish industry.  We have had that situation one might say, all the time.  If the work of the Minister for Labour is to educate the workers, in the sense that they know all they are doing and what they are working for, I think it will be worth while.  The majority of people in factories are doing automatic jobs and getting wages every week but they have no idea what the effect of the greater production will be on the economy of the country.  I do not say the employers mean that deliberately, nor do the workers want it either, but so far as industry is concerned, many of our workers operate like robots.  I do not say it should be the first consideration. The amount of work they do and what they get for it are equally important for them and for the whole economy.  They have not a clue about the Second Programme for Economic Expansion.</P>
    <P>Deputy Childers has it off by heart: he knows it backwards.  There is no point in the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the Taoiseach and all the economists in the Government knowing all about the Second Programme for Economic Expansion until the chaps down on the floor know what it is.  If you say &ldquo;Second Programme for Economic Expansion&rdquo; to the majority of ordinary factory workers, they will have some vague notion that the economy is going to expand but they will not be able to give you any details. They have not even an appreciation of the production of their own factories because employers do not <Col N="1431" /> talk to them or consult them.  There is this cleavage between the manual workers in these factories and what is described as management.  If, in giving orders, managements gave the reason why a change was needed and if they took workers more into their confidence, not only would it provide for better labour relations and help to avoid unrest but it would be good for the economy also.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party have done a good deal towards the education of workers and many of the unions have set aside money for such development, holding seminars and so on; but this has only scratched the surface of the problem.  The bulk of the education can be given only by management in consultation with the workers.  I believe that if the Minister for Labour tries to initiate and establish that sort of understanding between the two sides in industry, he will make a tremendous improvement and for that alone his portfolio will be worth while.  I trust I shall not have to retract that in another three or four years.</P>
    <P>There are other things in this measure that are important in themselves, for instance, the tasks which the Taoiseach said would be allotted to the Minister for Labour.  Very important among these is the research section.  I know we cannot be taught much and that we may not be capable of accepting a great deal in the matter of industrial relations from certain countries.  The trade union movement in Europe has undergone radical change, particularly in Germany where during and after the war, it disappeared completely.  I suppose it was relatively easier for them to establish a new foundation for a trade union movement than for, say, Britain or ourselves, where we have been tied to a certain type of trade unionism for 100 years or more.</P>
    <P>Let me assure the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who may be Minister for Labour, that if he can get the goodwill of the trade union movement in any new legislation he proposes to bring to the House, its <Col N="1432" /> passage will be easier than if he did not have consultation or if he had haphazard consultation.  I believe much of the consultation with the trade union movement over the past 12 months has been somewhat haphazard and perhaps confined.  I shall not go any further than &ldquo;confined.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In the absence of real details about the Ministry of Labour, it is difficult to discuss the matter further.  I want to conclude by saying that we genuinely believe that the Department of Transport and Power should not be scrapped but should be absorbed into some other Department.  As I said before, the Minister may be courteous and kind and all these things, while other Ministers have different personal qualities.  We are not concerned about these but about the Minister's effectiveness, and we are primarily concerned to ensure that Ministers of any Department of State should be prepared to come to the House and answer practically any question asked here.  The Minister for Transport and Power is very knowledgeable but he is not able to do this: he is precluded from giving any information regarding semi-State companies.  We represent the taxpayers and as their elected representatives we vote the moneys for these enterprises, and I do not think it is good enough that we should be in the dark about the activities of these State concerns.  The Government can retain Deputy Childers in the Cabinet; all we ask is that since his Ministry has no real function, it should be amalgamated with or absorbed into some other Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We in Fine Gael welcome the establishment of a Ministry of Labour.  In fact we are surprised that this Ministry has not long since been established.  It is strange that this State, now 44 years in existence, has not before now had a Department of State to deal with the greatest contributing factor to the wealth and production of the country.  We have allowed the human element in the production of our wealth and welfare, and in the production of our peace, social and industrial, to remain in a state of <Col N="1433" /> complete anarchy or subject entirely to laws of chance and to reactions of persons to other persons.</P>
      <P>That such a crazy situation should have existed so long is a reflection upon us all.  We are therefore glad to see that even at a time of great industrial unrest, of great labour unrest, this step is being taken.  Our only regret is that it was not taken at a time of calm, a time of peace when perhaps judgment could be made which would be wise and which would be sound and fair. The danger is that now we have created for ourselves a hell in human affairs and the wisest decisions are not taken in hell.  It may be said that is a strong word to use, but where you have the interests of the workers and the interests of the owners of wealth, the interests of all citizens, in jeopardy, each conflicting with the other, each subject to daily whims and fancies and stresses, it makes a mockery of State affairs to suggest that you can plan an economy, plan social improvements, plan the future of society in such a situation.</P>
      <P>We are not suggesting for a moment the regimentation of the human elements that contribute to what might be called the labour pool.  I do not think that is necessary but what we consider desirable is that we should have a pool of wisdom, a pool of consideration and understanding by all people of the problems of others.  We have rendered all that impossible by setting people on different sides of the fence, as it were, and instead of bringing down the fence over the years, we have added to it and as it became rotten at the bottom, we have thrown in soil and flotsam and jetsam of all kinds to pack it up and tried to cover up the holes. We would hope that the new Solomon, whoever he may be, who will become the new Minister for Labour will be able to restore some degree of peace and sanity to this terribly disordered world, so disordered that our whole society and everybody in it has suffered.</P>

    <P>We in Fine Gael regret that the Government have so long been dragging their feet on a manpower policy.  We have had nothing so far except the publication of a number of meaningless phrases in what has <Col N="1434" /> been termed a White Paper which in itself did not go as far as those who advised the Government recommended it should go.  The White Paper is totally inadequate; it has not got comprehensive views on our problems, nor does it make any comprehensive suggestions as to how the problems, as they see them, can be solved, but we would hope, now that the Government have made the conscious step of realising the extent of the problems and establishing the Ministry, that there will be some really progressive work in relation to manpower policies.  It is imperative that these should be because, great as our problems are today they are nothing compared with the multitudinous problems that will arise when the gate of the proposed Free Trade Area with Britain opens up.  So far, we have been able only to hazard a guess as to the consequences this new arrangement will have on a number of Irish industries.  We are rather timidly hoping that, in the long run, all will be well but, even in that long run, when many of us will be dead, there will be day to day, week to week and year to year problems, and individual problems of persons and families, that will not be solved unless we tackle this arrangement in detail and with an entirely new approach.  We may have our statistics, our statistical abstracts and all kinds of reports of experts but, fundamentally, all matters relating to labour and the production of wealth here are matters of human welfare and that is where we have been terribly neglectful of the human element, the human welfare, the human contribution to our society.</P>
    <P>In relation to the proposed Free Trade Area and the growing pains we are now about to suffer, we shall need to have a comprehensive scheme to provide for the support of people who may be required to make way for what we call efficiency programmes. We shall have to ensure that such people are provided with a standard of living comparable to what they previously enjoyed, that they are provided with a proper system of retraining and that, while they are retraining, <Col N="1435" /> they are adequately paid, in full.  Otherwise, they would never approach the problems with which they would be faced with the confidence and with the security to which they are entitled.</P>
    <P>We have spent a great deal of time and effort and we have spent a colossal amount of money, year in, year out, on improving the efficiency of our machinery in our industry and, indeed, on our farms.  Government grants are freely available for adaptation but these are all primarily in relation to machinery, to physically impersonal things.  We should have to spend a great deal more money and more effort than that in ensuring that the persons to operate these machines, and their families, receive all the encouragement and assistance they will need in this new challenging situation.</P>
    <P>We, in Fine Gael, feel that the day has long since passed when we ought to have a greater degree of share of ownership in this country.  If we had a large number of workers owning part of the industries in which they work we should not, perhaps, have had the tremendous cleavage which has unnecessarily existed between management and employees.  Share ownership is not the entire answer to these problems but it would certainly contribute something towards the creation of industrial peace.  This, perhaps, is primarily a matter for a Finance Bill but it is about time the State gave fiscal encouragement to firms who give shares in their industries to their workers.  It would be a step along the right lines.  Certainly, it would be no compensation for a proper income and we do not suggest it would ever replace incomes, proper wages or proper conditions of employment. These would be incentives over and above these things which could have a tremendous stabilising effect on our industrial relations.</P>
    <P>We were glad to hear that the Taoiseach proposes to take out of the hands of the Department of Social Welfare the operation of our employment exchanges.  If ever institutions were devised for the destruction of the self-respect of individuals, <Col N="1436" /> they are the labour exchanges.  It could well be written above the doors of those places that those who enter into them should abandon all hope because the prospects of getting a decent job out of a labour exchange, with an adequate standard of living and the long-term prospect of employment, are very rare.  They are supposed to be institutions to provide people with alternative employment when their previous employment comes to an end through no fault of their own but rather are they punishment stations in which people have to endure a standard of living and a degree of intolerance which should not be meted out to any human beings.</P>
    <P>We think that there is no prospect of the so-called labour exchange improving under the Department of Social Welfare.  It is supposed to be an institution of State for the relief of human distress but, over the years, the Department of Social Welfare has become little more than an accounting agency to the Minister for Finance, imposing all kinds of restrictions and powers against the provision of relief to people in distress.  Perhaps we can now hope that, under the Department of Labour, labour exchanges will become conscious of the obligation on them not only to register people as unemployed but to seek out and, if necessary, to create new opportunities for employment.</P>
    <P>We would hope that the day will soon disappear when we require unfortunate people in receipt of unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance to produce letters or documentary evidence of their efforts to get alternative employment.  At present, unfortunately, our labour exchanges have such a deplorable reputation that very many employers will not avail of the service of the labour exchanges because they would expect to get nothing but the worst in the people the employment exchange would offer.  We need to elevate the standard and the status of our labour exchanges so that the very best jobs and brains in the country will be pooled in the employment exchange and so that people will look to it as a positive instrument for the creation of a labour force which, in turn, will create new <Col N="1437" /> wealth, new production and new opportunities for our people.  Why this must be operated on what is called an agency basis, I do not know. I should prefer to see all matters relating to employment and unemployment taken, once and for all, out of the niggardly hand of the Department of Social Welfare and the hands of the Department of Finance.  I should rather see this created as a new positive source of wealth and production which it can never be so long as it is related to a non-productive service, a kind of mendicity institute, which the labour exchanges have become over the years.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach and other members of the Government have certainly been loud and frequent in their remarks about industrial relations in recent times.  We, in Fine Gael, were presented with perhaps what was a politically embarrassing situation recently when, at a time of extreme crisis, the Government brought in a Bill dealing with only one section of employees in the country.  I refer to the recent ESB Bill. There is no need for me to reiterate, except for the benefit of those who would try to confuse the people otherwise, that Fine Gael supported that Bill for one reason only and that was to preserve the life-giving power of electricity, to preserve human life, to preserve the life that went into industry and to maintain 200,000 people who, without electricity, would have been unemployed and, therefore, unable to bring home a wage packet at the end of the week.  We did it, likewise, so that agriculture, which has become dependent to some extent on electricity, might be able to continue to operate, Those who are now making smart alec speeches and who are trying to put us into the company of our traditional enemies and, by so doing, trying to condemn us for the company we keep, might remember that if we had to endure even one week's discontinuance of electricity supplies then certainly there would be nobody in the public life of this country who would not take all necessary steps to ensure that the necessary electricity supplies were provided. It is necessary to assert that we of Fine Gael would not countenance for one moment the injection of the <Col N="1438" /> spirit of statutory restrictions of that kind into any sector of our life which is not as vital as electricity.  There is a similar measure on the Statute Books for years, not only in this country but throughout the world, in relation to the provision and maintenance of water supplies&mdash;again, because water is a necessity to life.</P>
    <P>Electricity today is no less essential than water and any person who argues otherwise does not know the facts of life.  We wish to make it clear to the Government that any further repressive legislation they have in mind will not get our approval.  We are particularly conscious of the fact, and we believe the nation should be aware of it, that the worst record for industrial relations exists in the State-sponsored concerns and Government Departments. The majority of industrial disputes in any recent year have been in State-sponsored concerns and there exists the worst cleavage between management and employees.  If there were any less excuse for such a cleavage to exist, it is in State-sponsored concerns and Government Departments. One can understand a certain amount of opposition in private firms in which an employer personally loses if he has to give greater wages to his employees, if he loses because his sales go down as a result of increasing prices, and if his profit margin diminishes as a result of giving improved conditions to his workers. That may happen but in the long run, however, better wages are one of the great stimuli to increased efficiency and production.  These perpetual attacks on the workers are grossly unfair.  The countries which have the greatest efficiency and production are those in which labour is fairly and properly treated.</P>
    <P>Here we have large concerns in which the management have nothing personally to lose, because their high salaries will still be paid and their golden handshakes are equally certain, but yet we have had the worst warfare in industrial matters.  That must give us reason to pause before we increase the power of the State to intervene, to dictate or to set the pace in industrial relations.  If our whole <Col N="1439" /> industrial machinery is to operate like the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, which has one dispute concluding when another is beginning, we will clearly have an even worse state of affairs in the future than in the past.  Likewise, if the whole industrial relations situation is to be on a pattern similar to that of CIE or the ESB, then the anarchy which we have known up to now will pale into insignificance compared with the outright warfare which will operate and soon make us look as bad on the industrial scene as Venezuela is today where the prices of commodities have multiplied ten times within 12 months and wages have also multiplied ten times within 12 months, with the result that rather than being better off, everybody is worse off than before.</P>
    <P>If we are to have further steps taken to deal with the industrial situation, it is imperative that, once and for all, we restrict the right of employers to lock out their workers.  This must be restricted without any more ado in State-sponsored companies.  There is no justification whatsoever for the kind of thing that happened in CIE last year where some of the workers decided that they would not work for one day out of seven and CIE retaliated by locking out everyone in the passenger transport end of their business.  It caused untold hardship to the workers and immeasurable hardship to the community.  That kind of conduct is inexcusable and people who do that sort of thing should get the order of the boot and not the golden handshake.</P>
    <P>Similarly, in the situation affecting the whole financial structure of the country, in relation to the banks, over 50 per cent of the people who are not working in the banks have been locked out by the management who are under a statutory obligation to maintain the banks and to keep them open.  Every person who has an honest penny in the bank would be well advised to write a letter to his bank manager tomorrow demanding payment of the money within seven days or, in default, to issue a petition to wind up the bank. We would bring the banks to their senses very quickly.  That is the kind <Col N="1440" /> of thing which the community needs to do to stop these latter-day industrial tyrants from upsetting the community and creating the idea that labour is the cause of industrial unrest. Management in these State-sponsored concerns and Government Departments has been primarily responsible for the mess we are in at the moment and that is what causes some of us to have some misgivings about the proposals to deal with the situation.</P>
    <P>We need a fair approach to the problem.  We need an approach which will have proper concern for the community and for everybody in it and we have not had that kind of approach from the State-sponsored companies, or any Government Departments dealing with the matter, in recent times.  How is it that we of all the countries in Europe have the worst record in industrial relations in most of the recent years, certainly in 1961, in 1963, in 1964 and in 1965?  All indications are that we are well on the way to having a record again this year. Why is it?  All countries have their employees and all countries have their employers.  All countries have their Governments, but no country has a Fianna Fáil Government, except Ireland. That is a perfectly simple sum in arithmetic which I am sure even the Minister for Transport and Power, with his knowledge of statistics, will be able to work out.  We alone have a Government who have allowed industrial relations to get into the absolutely chaotic conditions in which they are. We alone have the misfortune to have a Fianna Fáil Government who wanted people to believe that all was well and that everything in this world could be got with little or no effort, by a scratch in favour of a Fianna Fáil candidate, and that once that was done, all would be well; but we find that the Lemass who wanted to lead us on has been leading us nowhere and we have gone around in turmoil and anarchy, into the situation in which we find ourselves.  It is a miserable boast and let us hope it will be more humble in the future.</P>
    <P>We in Fine Gael have asked for a refusal to be given to this measure, <Col N="1441" /> notwithstanding our support for a Minister for Labour, until such time as there is an amalgamation of at least two existing Departments.  Our leader, Deputy Cosgrave, in a thoughtful and thought-provoking speech today, pointed out that there are several Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries at present who have no worthwhile State function to perform and that their only justification is similar to the justification for some of the Taoiseach's appointees in the Seanad, that they are full-time organisers for the Fianna Fáil Party, paid out of the taxpayers' pocket.</P>
    <P>What policy decisions requiring his attention for&mdash;we will give him a short week&mdash;a 40-hour week has the Minister for Defence to make, requiring him to apply all his energy and brains, sitting on an unmentionable part of his anatomy or otherwise? Nobody in his senses could visualise a Minister for Defence in this country having anything to occupy him for 40 hours a week.</P>
    <P>How could anybody visualise the Minister for Transport and Power working the same number of arduous hours, having sufficient to occupy his fertile brain for the same length of time per week?  I agree it could take him that long to refuse to answer questions addressed to him here.  What is the sad experience of most Deputies who address questions to the Minister for Transport and Power on any matter affecting power supplies&mdash;coal, electricity, oil, transport, the movement of goods and persons inside or outside the country, on the sea, in the air, or on the land?  The Minister has no function in the matter.</P>
    <P>How can a man, who has no function in these matters, be occupied for 40 hours a week?  How, in the name of all that is holy, can the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs occupy himself for 40 hours a week in matters relating to the movement of letters from one individual to another, or the passage of telegrams, or the answering of telephone calls?  He has nothing to do with Radio Telefís Éireann or, if he has, he certainly will not answer here.  That kind of public service certainly does not require two managing directors, <Col N="1442" /> one in the shape of the Minister and the other in the shape of the permanent secretary of the Department.  Indeed, the Department of Defence, to which I referred earlier, has three bosses&mdash; the Minister for Defence, the Secretary of the Department of Defence and the Chief of Staff.  It is fantastic to think that we have this huge aristocracy over what is a non-policy making Department.  Any policy to be determined in relation to the Department of Defence and defence matters must be done by the Government.</P>
    <P>The Department of Social Welfare is, as I said earlier, little more than an accounting agency for the Department of Finance.  What can the Minister for Social Welfare do, but once a year, if there is a Budget only once a year, or twice a year, if there are two Budgets, or more often according as there are more Budgets, go to the Government meeting and plead that, because of a rise in the cost of living and because of various other factors, he ought to be given an increased allocation for his particular beneficiaries? Then, having got that, he can put them through the computer-mind of his bureaucrats and decide what is the best way in which to distribute the allocation.  That is an exercise which does not call for any more than two weeks work in a year.  Once the decisions are made the law must be applied. It does not require two managing directors in the shape of a Minister and a Secretary of a Department to say what section, subsection, paragraph or clause will decide whether Maggie Murphy gets a contributory or a non-contributory pension.  These things&mdash; the amount, the number of dependants, and so on&mdash;are all set out in tables. They are not something which requires a ministerial brain and all the majesty of ministerial office to determine year in and year out.</P>
    <P>This Department is there primarily to relieve the less fortunate in the community.  There is no reason why it should not be associated with the Department of Health, which is the Department with a particular function in relation to human welfare and human happiness.  In the one particular field in which the Department <Col N="1443" /> of Social Welfare could have taken worthwhile steps it failed hopelessly. I refer to employment services.  It is now losing that particular wing and that makes it all the more justifiable to wind up the Office of the Minister for Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>Why, incidentally, the Minister for Labour will act as an agent for the Minister for Social Welfare in future I do not know.  I do not think the Taoiseach fully explained the matter. The argument may be that there are some people at the labour exchanges who are, in fact, incapable of being re-employed and that the Minister for Social Welfare must, therefore, give them employment assistance. I would much prefer to see this whole employment service taken out of the Department of Social Welfare and transferred to the Department of Labour.  In the event of it being decided, after a proper investigation, that particular registrants at the labour exchanges are incapable of being usefully employed, a certificate could be issued by the Minister for Labour and the persons concerned could be transferred back again to the Department of Social Welfare to receive social welfare payments as distinct from payments administered by the Minister for Labour.</P>
    <P>The trade union movement has been attacked, a member of the Labour Party said, most unfairly.  It has great difficulties.  Many of these have come to my knowledge in both my public and my professional capacity.  I am not a little concerned that very many of the ordinary members of trade unions are very concerned about what they consider to be the weaknesses of the trade union structure, the failures of trade union leaders, or what they regard as the dictatorial attitudes of trade union leaders.  All these are things primarily within the ability of trade union members to remedy themselves. Deputy Corish mentioned that it was unfortunate that all trade union members do not participate actively enough in trade union affairs and do not attend meetings as regularly as they should.  He would like to see an improvement.  We all share the same anxiety that trade union members <Col N="1444" /> would realise that their interests are being served by their own trade unions and they only let themselves down in their relatively minor duties so far as membership of their organisations is concerned when they fail to be sufficiently interested.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that, while people abuse the trade union movement for what they call multiplicity of trade unions, there are, in fact, almost twice as many employer organisations as there are trade unions, and the employer organisations are catering for a much smaller body of people than the trade unions are.  The latest year for which figures are available in the <i>Statistical Abstract</i> is the year 1962 and, in that year, there were 55 trade unions for 286,382 workers.  For 13,567 employers there are 46 employer organisations. I am afraid I gave a wrong figure earlier.  The figure I gave for the Dublin area was a misreading of the table.  There are almost as many employer organisations for 13,000 employers as there are trade unions for 286,300 workers.  If there is to be rationalisation on one side in relation to labour then there must also be rationalisation on the other side in relation to employers.</P>
    <P>A good deal more could be said on the problem of labour relations but I do not wish to detain the House for a variety of reasons.  The opportunity provided by the establishment of a new Department of Labour and a new Minister for Labour is one which will not occur again.  We can only hope that the Government, who have drifted along for so long, are now at last appreciating their responsibilities.  We can only hope and pray they did not let things go too far before they took this right decision and that now that the decision has been taken, the machinery, when set up, will be properly used.  But, for goodness sake, let us ensure that, before we have another Minister of State in this country, followed by the operation of Parkinson's Law and the accompaniment of a Minister by a Secretary to the Department, a private secretary, personal staff for the Minister's office, assistant secretaries, principal officers, etc., etc., we terminate one of the existing Ministries.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1445" /> The country is not in a mood to tolerate the overhead expenditure which any Minister necessitates, overhead expenditure between £15,000 and £20,000 a year, when we throw in with it what I have mentioned already, the fact that it costs £3,000 per car per Minister.  These things are not small.  I know the Minister for Transport and Power thinks that ten times that sum is nugatory, but it is not. It is important that in a time of crisis the right example be given by those in high state.  That is why we in Fine Gael tabled the amendment that a Second Reading of this Bill should be refused &ldquo;until the Government provide for the amalgamation of at least two existing Departments, so that by the appointment of a Minister for Labour an extra Minister will not be required.&rdquo;  That amendment was put down by Deputy Cosgrave, a man of obvious sincerity who is respected by everybody in the community, and I suggest that the Taoiseach and the Government would be well advised to accept the amendment.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude, I should like to say a word in praise of the staff of our Labour Court who have been operating in extremely difficult circumstances for many years past.  One does not wish to single out any one person more than another, but the people with the most unenviable task are the men who have been in the bearna baoil, the conciliation officers, who have operated not a 40-hour week or a 42-hour week but what sometimes has been an 80-hour week.  They are magnificent men.  If anybody deserves a golden handshake, it is these people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be the new Ministry will be able to give them suitable promotion, but if ever people deserve well of the community, it is the conciliation officers.  It is not during big strikes, with the publicity surrounding them, that these men do their most useful work.  They do great work on those occasions, but it is in the settlement of the small disputes, in helping the workers to understand the employers' problems and helping the <Col N="1446" /> employers to understand the workers' problems, that they have contributed greatly to a better understanding in industrial relations for some time past.</P>
      <P>It is perhaps unfair to ask these officers to continue to operate in exactly the same way in future as they have in the past.  I do not think it is going to operate to the benefit of either party in any of the disputes, but these people deserve well.  Their work, because of its very nature, is confidential, and a great deal of it will go unrewarded.  However, I do think it is proper that Dáil Éireann should place on record its appreciation of these people who, without status and without any sanction, have been able to achieve a great deal of peace and a great deal of compromise which has worked greatly to the benefit of those involved in the disputes and of the community in general.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Having listened to Deputy Corish's speech I have been tempted to make a few observations. In January last, I spoke at some length regarding the difficulties of bringing about the amalgamation of trade unions.  I pointed out the natural pride that each small trade union has in its own contribution to the trade union movement and the firm belief that no other organisation can look after the interests of its members as well as itself.  I went on to suggest that, perhaps, in the first instance, we should strive for a federation between unions catering for similar trades.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another snag has, however, been brought to my attention in the meantime. Not so long ago we had an amalgamation between two major engineering unions, and I have been told that the legal costs involved in this were very considerable; in fact, they were frightening.  I believe that had these unions realised that this amalgamation was going to cost so much money, they would have had second thoughts about proceeding with it at all.  In regard to whatever token sum we shall vote for this new Department of Labour, the Minister must accept, if he is anxious to facilitate the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and trade <Col N="1447" /> unions desirous of amalgamating, that the State will take upon itself the legal costs involved.  This is going further than the redundancy payments for officers and officials.</P>

      <P>I have discussed proposals, and my trade union made representations last week.  I do not agree with all their observations, but they made them as an individual trade union.  I have made some study of this problem and I thought it is as well to air these difficulties well in advance, because the legislation dealing with trade union law and industrial relations will not be before us until the autumn. I agree with Deputy Corish that what we require is the maximum of discussion and information.  I agree with him that employers do not give enough information to the people working for them.  I agree that professional managements are often very lacking in their understanding of industrial problems.  I agree with all these things, and the more often they are mentioned, the better chance we have of bringing about an improved situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the memorandum sent out to the various interested bodies, there was no provision for making the Labour Court facilities available to employees in State bodies.  Some time ago my trade union was taking up a case on behalf of one of its members.  This member worked in Gaeltarra Éireann.  We found that under the provisions we could not use the facilities of the Labour Court.  These people have no representative body.  I do know that salesmen and travellers in the Pigs and Bacon Commission and in An Bord Iascaigh Mhara would be eligible for membership of our union.  This, I am sure, applies to other trades and professions, <Col N="1448" /> that no provision is being made for these people, as is being made for the Civil Service, for access to the Labour Court.</P>
    <P>Those are two matters arising out of this proposal I wanted to mention. There will be difficulty in bringing about a reduction in the number of trade unions.  I have dealt with that at length on a previous occasion and I do not wish to deal with it again, but I should like the Minister seriously to consider the matter.  I hope there will be a report from the new Minister for Labour, when he is appointed, in respect of the State paying any legal costs arising from voluntary amalgamation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party, on this Bill, are in favour of the idea of a Department of Labour, concentrated on industrial relations matters, giving its undivided attention to an important section in our national life. While we consider it extremely important to have good relations in this area for our wellbeing economically we consider, however, that an opportunity could be availed of to shed ourselves of one Ministry, the functions of which do not appear to us to be too well marked and, indeed, the continuance of which as a separate Ministry appears to us to be unwarranted. Indeed, one could say&mdash; though this is not possibly the best occasion to say it&mdash;there is a lot to be said for a complete re-examination of all ministerial duties.  This, perhaps, should be left to a time when we have more leisure to go into it.  But one could think offhand that a Ministry of Defence could easily be amalgamated with a Ministry of External Affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would hope that in this further talk of rationalisation of Ministries all Deputies could take part in it because, remember, we have to become very militant and very conscious of efficiency when it comes to industrial matters.  It might not be a bad thing at all if we considered this. Progress is not necessarily guaranteed in this area of industrial relations by the creation of another Ministry.  It <Col N="1449" /> does not automatically mean we have come to grips with the problem.  It merely means that a Department is formed in which a man can give his attention to this area and that good may flow from this attention if the proper spirit and impartiality are given to the job; but there is nothing of itself in the creation or the establishment of a further Ministry which marks progress.</P>
    <P>I got the impression from the Taoiseach's opening speech that, in fact, he regarded the fact that we had an extra Ministry as a milestone passed in this industrial area.  We will have to wait and see that this milestone has been passed.  The number of things that have come from this area of industrial relations in recent years make it a pretty complicated area.  It is no longer simply a single individual confrontation between an employer and employees.  Today the area of industrial relations brings in a host of other factors, has connections with other Departments of State and calls for quite a number of additional questions to be solved and considered, if we are to look at the whole picture of industrial relations in its totality.  Such a Department, obviously, will have to consider the drawing in of the separate threads which at present are involved in this matter of job training, bring all the agencies involved in this area together and get something co-ordinated out of the lot.</P>
    <P>Recent NIEC and other reports have hinted at, and at least have referred in passing, to job forecasting, to the actual need for increasing skills in the working population, and the areas where these skills should be increased. All these matters come within the ambit of this Ministry and all, of course, against the background of the dimensions opened up by the freer trade areas, the areas evidently that are opening up before us for the first time, creating for us a moment of truth competitively with other countries.  It will mean that methods of forecasting of skills will become extremely important and this is something that has become apparent.  Even in conditions of unemployment as we have, one may encounter bottlenecks <Col N="1450" /> in certain skills and the provision of skilled workers would also need to be looked into by this new Minister.  Even in conditions such as we have at the moment, certain skilled categories can be in short supply in certain areas.  The new Minister, presumably, will consider this.</P>
    <P>The Minister, presumably, will also be concerned with growth centres in different parts of the country.  One is a little unhappy at the moment at the lack of emphasis on the placing of growth centres.  One is left with the unhappy feeling that, perhaps, the Government do not deliberately intend to concentrate on the further expansion of these growth centres.  I would hope that the Minister would be concerned with advance in these particular areas.</P>

      <P>We believe in the establishment of growth centres.  I do not see any particular moment of truth in saying that growth centres are formed in different parts of the country.  There are reports which show that the trade union representatives agree with the idea of these growth centres.</P>

      <P>The change-over to employment agencies, making them real agencies of employment, is extremely important because up to now these establishments were the last places, when one was without a job, in which one would want to look for a job.  I hope the new Minister will concern himself with seeing that they become real places for job placement of people out of work.  This would be a welcome improvement.  I suggest that the first step towards making these employment exchanges places of hope rather than places of despair would be the demolition of most of them and, of those remaining, at least a coat of paint to make them somewhat more cheerful, but the present bastilles around the country which go under the name of <Col N="1451" /> employment exchanges, quite apart from the misery of being out of work, are like draughty poorhouses, the appearance of which is not conducive to giving an unfortunate individual any hope, quite apart from the amount of payment he receives there.</P>
      <P>These are some of the things I suppose this Department will be concerned with.  It is something we have thought in recent years was called for. We thought the area of industrial relations was becoming complicated and important enough to warrant the full-time attention of a competent individual who would look after developments in this sphere.  Perhaps he cannot perform one of the functions of the late Countess Markievicz such as bringing coal up the stairs in certain parts of Dublin but he certainly would, in our day, perform a pretty valuable function.</P>
      <P>The most important thing I see in this Department is that at least the Minister would maintain impartiality in the area of industrial relations.  This is the area in respect of which I for one feel the most disquiet.  It seems to me that this Minister will need to have a very wide smile indeed to get over some of the suspicions of the trade union movement.  Those who spoke in this House earlier about outlawing strikes and tidying up industrial relations will discover that if they interfere with the system in operation at the moment, far from improving the situation, will tend to make it much worse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember that the Taoiseach some years ago said that class war was dead. I hope we will not find that class war comes back as bad as it ever was.  I am fearful it will come back if the law is brought into voluntary agreements entered into between employers and employees.  If you bring judicial interpretation into those matters, you will find that there is no legal short cut to industrial peace.  It seems to me that there can be no substitute for good, honest negotiations between employers and employees.  If the State is seen by the worker to depart from this and to come down heavily in law on one side <Col N="1452" /> against the other, it seems to me that we will put the clock back in industrial relations rather than forward.</P>
    <P>Although it may appear at the present time that we are top of the board in the international strike league, we must look carefully at what has happened during recent months.  Before this, the majority of strikes took place because of contract of employment, holiday arrangements, interpretation of agreements and so on.  The great difference between those strikes and the strikes in recent months is that the more recent strikes have been called because of the failure of employers to concede the £1 a week increase.  We can get all sorts of hypothetical reasons to explain the present sickness in industrial relations but we do not have to go very far to seek the real reason for them.  As I have said, they have been caused by the refusal of employers, throughout the country, to concede the £1 a week increase.  We cannot leave out of this refusal the policy decision of the national employers' organisation, the Federated Union of Employers, to its constituent members not to concede this £1 a week to their employees.  The sufferers from this obdurate policy have been the community and consumers at large. The strikes which have taken place can be attributed to this decision of the national employers' organisation.  Therefore, bad industrial relations is a false basis on which to base your assessment of the strike position in this country.  As I have already stated, the majority of strikes before this have not taken place for reasons of pay; they have taken place because of a contract of employment, holiday arrangements, the worker's interpretation of agreements and so on.</P>
    <P>As regards industrial relations and the system of voluntary bargaining which has been in operation up to now, we have the example of those countries which have in fact brought the law into the conduct of industrial relations. Those countries have not a strike-free record.  They have not secured happier industrial relations by doing so.  Such countries as Australia and the USA who have brought the law into their <Col N="1453" /> conduct of industrial relations have not avoided industrial unrest as a result. In many cases they have landed themselves into more trouble.  It is regrettable that despite the fact that some countries committed to this idea in the past now appear to be changing their attitude, we are now deciding to bring the law into these areas.  President Johnson has given hope of the repeal of certain Acts brought into force in the USA.  Some of those countries which brought the law into industrial relations are now thinking of handing the situation back to collective bargaining between employers and employees.</P>
    <P>If the new Minister in his Department seems to favour strong interference by the State in industrial relations and the law which would seek to hedge around the fundamental rights of unions to strike and to limit the qualifications of unions, he will have a lot to explain to the workers when he seeks to improve relations between the employers and the unions.  He will be seen, not as a man bearing goodwill and good relations in those areas, but as a kind of policeman with a big stick coming into a particular area to make sure that certain lines are followed.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies, I am glad to say, have been as struck as I certainly have been by the number of Deputies who are ready to tell us how many unions there are in this country, that there are too many trade unions and to tell us of the shortcomings of the unions, but very few of those Deputies&mdash;they belong to the two main Parties, and most of them have extensive business interests&mdash;will bare their hearts about the shortcomings of management. Surely in the kind of society we live in, we must realise that much of the industrial unrest is caused by the decisions of individual managements. Individual managements have the initiative on economic decisions, not the unions.  The unions are there to react to the decisions of the management but the decisions must lie with management. Strange as it may seem, no Deputy has come in here and told us of the shortcomings, the inefficiency of management.  Despite this, they can talk at length about the inefficiency of trade unions.  Despite the inefficiencies <Col N="1454" /> of management, I have not heard of any rumours of a law to penalise inefficient managers.  Despite this, their inefficiency may, in the future of free trade, condemn employees to unemployment. Official reports, while referring in a vague way to the shortcomings of Irish management, have not seen fit to suggest strong penalties on managements who do not become efficient, who do not see their way to play their full part in their country's efforts to become economically viable.</P>
    <P>Employers have been nurtured for years behind high tariff walls.  This being so, it is ironical that no special Department is being set up to deal with their culpabilities, their shortcomings. These changes in the law, the changes suggested in industrial relations, may make the position far worse than it is. Instead of putting the clock forward, we may be putting it back.  The system we have had up to now has worked reasonably well.  If we are high in the strike table, we can see reasons for it in this policy decision of the employers federation not to grant the £1 a week. As I have said, the system has worked reasonably well in the past and there is no reason why it should not continue to do so in the future.</P>
    <P>One thing is certain: The struggle between employers and workers will continue for as long as our society continues.  The best job any Government can do in this area is to promote industrial growth.  We can say one thing with certainty in an uncertain situation: the more jobs there are, the more prosperity there is, and the less trouble there will be in industrial disputes.  It has been noticeable that as soon as the economic thermometer appears to be going down, the fewer the jobs become and the more intensified the struggle becomes.  The fundamental task of the Government, therefore, must be to promote industrial growth, to ensure by their policies that such growth is maintained.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that instead of seeking global solutions in this area of industrial relations, we should endeavour in individual instances to see that relations are improved.  We could see to it that there is a grievance procedure <Col N="1455" /> in each firm in the Republic, that there is machinery whereby personal complaints between worker and foreman, for instance, are properly processed.  Such complaints have in previous years accounted for the bulk of trade disputes.  We must therefore see that such machinery, such procedure, is instituted in each firm so that each worker knows that his complaints will be pursued individually.  In many firms it is still a mystery to the individual employee how his complaints can be dealt with by the management. In many firms, managements will not bother with complaints.  Consequently such grievances are bottled up over the years and can later lead to major flare-ups on what might appear to be trivial pretexts.  I have seen it happen. Then when a dispute bursts out, managements ask in an incredulous fashion why this happened.  They say: &ldquo;We have always had good relations&rdquo;&mdash;on the basis that they have not heard a complaint.  &ldquo;Have we not provided work for these employees?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>No country in recent years has been more afflicted than ours with various week-end seminars on employeremployee relations.  We have had Ministers speaking to businessmen and other influential decision-making groups, about the joint interests of management and employees; yet all this advice appears to have fallen on extremely barren ground if we are to judge by the number of industrial disputes. One of the problems is that the prophets of industrial relations do not go to the trouble of seeking out the facts.  Just because the majority of humanity work for somebody, practically every one of those people considers himself an expert.  This is not the case and I suggest that many Deputies would be better employed talking about the shortcomings of management, that they should concentrate on that aspect rather than the other.</P>
    <P>The unions are in the process of examining their own structure and I think the agency which would have the most authority, certainly the most acquaintance with the subject, are the unions engaged in this kind of work.  I <Col N="1456" /> do not think it helps in this process to push it in a legislative fashion by coercive action.  We must not forget this about the trade union structure: It is a democratic set-up in which decisions are taken by the majority of workers in any firm.  Many people form the impression that a strike is aimed at themselves alone.  There are letters to the newspapers.  People must realise that to take part in a strike workers must have the most serious reasons.  The economic degradation consequent on a strike is shocking.  One needs the most serious reasons to take part in a strike.</P>
    <P>In many of the industrial disputes in which I have been unfortunate enough to have been involved, I have never seen a lack of people coming to meetings and playing a full part in the deliberations leading up to a dispute. One can exaggerate the scare stories of minorities being the bullies leading to strike action, forgetting that the majority take part fully in the discussions leading up to this serious position.</P>
    <P>The Labour Court has been mentioned. I think the conciliation section of the court have definitely done great work during the years.  They were stationed in that rather inhospitable place called Griffith Barracks and did a tremendous job in face of grave physical obstacles in bringing parties together and suggesting solutions.  In this matter, no one speaks of the successes. We all appear to spend a great deal of time talking about the disasters and the successes never hit the headlines.</P>
    <P>The Press has been singled out now and again for the unfortunate part, it has been alleged, it has played in certain disputes by playing up certain factors at issue in a slanted way, thereby adding fuel to the flame.  I do not know if this criticism has been merited.  It has been said on many occasions that unions do not sufficiently meet the Press and explain fully the issues involved.  This is a complaint that can also be levelled at the employers. It is no substitute for negotiation to break out in long advertisements when the dispute has commenced.  The efforts should begin much earlier than the outbreak of the dispute.  Then we would have fewer ignorant outbursts by the <Col N="1457" /> public and fewer outraged reactions when disputes break out.</P>
    <P>The new Minister and the new Department will have to deal with a problem largely insoluble, a problem in which any of us would be very wrong to think that peace in totality can be restored.  A struggle goes on in a democratic society between employers and employees.  As far as possible, the State should maintain a neutral pose in this struggle.  It can contribute very positively to the avoidance of this struggle by having through its own laws, for instance, good factory conditions, by seeing to it that the economy continues to go forward, by seeing to it that job opportunities are increased, and so on.  The day on which it departs from this neutral position and begins to interfere in the struggle, on one side or the other, on that day trouble is brought infinitely nearer.  We certainly will not see industrial relations restored to the position we have had in previous years by this kind of attitude.</P>
    <P>Whoever the victim for the sacrifice is to be in the present Government, I personally wish him well.  He will need a good, long neck.  I would say he would want to be choosy about the dinners he speaks at.  I would suggest the first thing he should do to give himself a good send-off in this hazardous occupation is to get certain amendments into the new legislation we are told is on the books and make quite sure that free collective bargaining is not interfered with.  If he does that, we may get him a union card later on.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>The creation of a new Department of State should be a matter for excitement and speculation. That should be particularly true of a Department of this kind, dealing with the various aspects of labour policy and labour problems generally.  I regard the introduction of this legislation to set up a Department of this kind as one of extreme importance indeed.  Probably we are even at this stage regaining that grip of the problems that exist which the First Dáil and the Second Dáil had when they had a Ministry of Labour at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1458" /> I regret that in his opening statement on the Second Reading, the Taoiseach confined himself very largely to vague generalities, instancing here and there the odd specific proposal which did not create any kind of debating momentum.  I was particularly disappointed when he did not mention the Labour Court, with a view to strengthening it or substituting some other kind of tribunal for it.  While I see the difficulties of trying to bring the workings of labour within the law, I nevertheless fail to understand why they cannot be so brought within the law.  If people were to be reasonable in these respects, probably a tribunal the decisions of which would have a binding effect would, in the long run, work out for the betterment of both management and labour.</P>
    <P>In a debate such as this, in dealing with this very important problem, accentuated by the conditions in which we live, the great and varied unrest which we are experiencing, we should be particularly careful to be, as far as is humanly possible, impartial and to strive for what should be the fundamental thread going through all this Department&mdash;an impartial one, trying to keep a fair balance as between management and labour.  I do not think there would be any trouble in achieving that, once management is fair; neither do I think there would be any trouble in achieving it, once labour in its conception of management is fair, too&mdash;provided that there is always room for the give and take so very necessary in all human relations.</P>
    <P>I regard this legislation to set up this Department as a stepping stone which should be very carefully set so that it can lead to other stepping stones in the direction of peace within the ranks of both employers and employees.  I would not for a moment suggest that this Department of Labour should consider itself as having for its primary objective the settlement of industrial disputes.  If it is to interest itself in that aspect of our affairs, it should be to detect danger spots before the trouble arises.  In this way, it would be able to enter upon the arena where the dispute is about to take place, or <Col N="1459" /> likely to take place, and use its good offices to see that the dispute did not take place, causing loss of money, man-hours and production, with all the terrible consequences that flow from a strike if it is prolonged for any length of time.  The detection of danger spots is much more important than being expected to go in when the danger has lighted up.</P>
    <P>I must confess that I share the view of the Taoiseach as expressed at the Social Study Congress the other night when I think he asked, in effect, where was the dividing line between what people expected the Government to do and what they should do themselves. That has been the curse of our State for a long time, that far too much is being expected of the Government and less emphasis is placed on individual and collective effort.  That is only achieved through proper leadership. Once people are led into the belief that by supporting a particular Party they can get something that they could not get by supporting another Party, there is an end to the proper leadership that encourages individual and collective effort.  Even the Fianna Fáil Party are beginning to see that now.  Running through their speeches is this emphasis on individual and collective effort and community spirit.  They are trying to get away from the other viewpoint that one had to belong to succeed.</P>
    <P>That is all I propose to say on that aspect of the relations between people and Government.  As I said, I believe this is a debate that should be conducted with as little acrimony as possible because we are all agreed about the setting up of this Department&mdash;the Government.  we in Fine Gael and the Labour Party.  There may come another kind of debate when the person who is being nominated to this Ministry, if he is not already a member of the Government, comes up for discussion.</P>
    <P>I would not have offered, if I may say so in passing, the very stringent test imposed by Deputy O'Leary just now when he said the new Minister should be choosy about the dinners he attends and choosy about what he says.  If he is a normal sensible person who is not <Col N="1460" /> afraid to go to any dinner he likes, and not afraid to give utterance to honest thought processes, I think he is probably the right man, because in the end people respect the truth and the expression of proper opinion relating to any set of circumstances at any given time.</P>
    <P>Of course there are faults, and always have been faults ever since the beginning of the world, on the part of management and on the part of labour.  These faults must be shared.  I deplore the remarks of Deputy O'Leary towards the end of his speech when he referred to management.  He talked about drones behind a high tariff wall.  I think that was unwarranted. If they were drones, they did succeed even with the help of tariffs down along the line in developing some very good industries.  All I can hope is that when the tariff walls disappear, these industries will get the encouragement and support of our people which they should get, having regard to the great efforts which they put into the industrial drive in their time.  It is due to them that that should be said, and I am saying it without reservation.</P>
    <P>In the setting up of this Department, having due regard to what the Taoiseach has said by way of general observation, I think the danger spot must be stressed again.  For that reason, I think this Department should lay great stress on public relations, and that certain people in this Department should be continually in touch with the public relations officers of the larger unions or groups of unions so that they can keep their fingers on the pulse of things and be able to watch out for any trouble that might ensue.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that this Department will deal with, and find it easy to deal with, organised labour but my real interest in this Department centres on the rural areas.  I should like to see the Department interesting itself in the various rural areas which are becoming depopulated but in which nevertheless there are a considerable number of unemployed people who are able and willing to work, if given the opportunity to do so.  In this respect <Col N="1461" /> I can see the Department doing very valuable work for rural Ireland and for the countryside that is still populated but where employment problems are forever present.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that this Department is, even only on an agency basis, to operate the employment exchanges, because in that I can see the beginning of what I am urging, that is, an interest in these areas where large numbers of people are signing on at the employment exchanges and collecting their money.  Specially trained people will see in the districts the possibility of organising them for labour to good result.  That will probably be the most important part of the work of these people.</P>
    <P>I see no reason why this question of manpower will not be inextricably mixed up with the Department of Labour, and I do not see any reason why there should be an increase in the number of Government Ministers resulting from the setting up of this Department.  The Taoiseach has already got a sufficient number of Ministers, having regard to our population, to our output, and our wealth generally.  I do not accept the argument he put forward relating the numbers of Ministers in this country to the numbers in other countries when there is such a wide difference between the population of this country and the populations of the countries with which the Taoiseach purports to draw an analogy.</P>
    <P>I believe there are various ways in which there could be a cutting down on Ministries.  For instance, there is the Department of Transport and Power.  I am not going to respond to the Taoiseach's invitation to attack the present incumbent of that office.  I have no intention of doing so.  I think the Department could carry with it the Department of Posts and Telegraphs because the money orders and stamps side of the Post Office really runs itself. So far as Radio-Telefís Éireann is concerned, I do not see why another State body could not be added to the already imposing list which the Minister for Transport and Power supervises, or is supposed to supervise.</P>
    <P>As I have said, I have no intention <Col N="1462" /> of criticising the Minister for Transport and Power personally.  I think he does his best but his best is not very much because he is not allowed to do very much.  He has to tell us from time to time that he has no function in dealing with the day-to-day administration of the various bodies over which he presides, or which he supervises, or for which he has ministerial responsibility, whichever phrase you care to use.  We do not criticise him for that.  Rather do we criticise the Government and the Taoiseach in particular for not giving to this man, in whose praise he spoke in such extreme terms the other day, a Ministry of greater responsibility.  When we were being criticised for attacking the Minister for Transport and Power, I really think the truth of the matter was that the Taoiseach was defending himself because it must be evident to everyone that while they are anxious to keep Deputy Childers in the Government, they are not prepared to go so far as to trust him with full responsibility but are only giving him a sort of mock responsibility for boards which manage themselves.</P>
    <P>The Department of Social Welfare and the Department of Health could go together.  I know, of course, that someone will refer before this debate is over to the fact that at one time an extra Government Department was created and an extra Minister appointed by Deputy J.A. Costello in his time when he appointed me, in fact, as Minister for the Gaeltacht. That, of course, is so, but it was an important Department and one which we were not left very long to work and it certainly has not been worked very well since&mdash;but that is a matter for another day.</P>
    <P>We on this side of the House welcome the creation of this Department and wish it well.  We wish its incumbent well, whoever he be, and all we hope is that he will be suitable and give satisfaction to our people, both at Government level, Dáil level and to the people throughout the country. At the same time, we adhere rigidly to the view expressed in the amendment we have down, that the creation of this Department should not involve the appointment of an extra Minister <Col N="1463" /> of State, particularly at this time of economic stringency.</P>
    <P>In any event, from what I have said, it can be gathered that my anxiety as far as the workings of this Department go will be for rural Ireland where the ability to mobilise our manpower, to apportion it, to see that the opportunity for employment is given there is of vital importance at this time when our people are leaving the land, particularly the small holdings and sweeping into towns and cities where they come into organised labour which is a simple and classified thing and with which it is easy to deal and to grapple.</P>
    <P>I hope that when the Department is set up and the Minister is finally nominated and approved, he will make that a concern of equal importance to that of organised labour.  If I were to have any of the choosing in this regard, with special reference to the state of our country and of the population, if I were the Taoiseach selecting, I would select a countryman who understands the country view rather than a townsman, a countryman who would be most helpful in bringing about the situation we all desire.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Corish said earlier this evening that we in the Labour Party welcome this appointment because we believe, and have always believed, that one Minister who should be in a Government in this country is a Minister for Labour. We have an amendment down but not, as the Taoiseach said, because we want to get the opportunity of attacking the Minister for Transport and Power.  As a matter of fact, while we disagree entirely with the operation of his Department, we consider that the Minister for Transport and Power is a very likeable sort of fellow.  Therefore, if anybody has got the impression that we in the Labour Party want to pillory him and are taking an opportunity on this or any other Bill to do so, he is very much mistaken.  In fact, what we are trying to do is to prove that the Department of Transport and Power is superfluous.  The Department was set up some years <Col N="1464" /> ago with a great flourish of trumpets. It was supposed that by separating the responsibility for the Department of Industry and Commerce from Transport and Power it would leave two competent men with competent staff free to deal with the situation before them in a much better way.  All we have to do is to look at what has happened since to realise that those who set up that Department made a bad mistake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>You had the support of the Labour Party because we thought then you were going to do a good job, but, in fact, the Minister for Transport and Power, who happens to be Deputy Childers but who could be anybody else in the Fianna Fáil benches, and who is, apparently, carrying out Government policy&mdash;this is the point which many people seem to miss &mdash;did very little of note except to close branch railways all over the country. We were told the other day that a lot of money has been saved by the Department of Transport and Power, particularly in CIE, but any money saved there has been saved at the expense of workmen's wages.  That is a fact which cannot be denied and the sooner we get down to that fact and show exactly what our objection to the Department is, the sooner we are likely to persuade the Government that they have, in fact, made a mistake.</P>
      <P>Personally, I do not care, nor does any member of my Party, if Deputy Childers becomes Taoiseach tomorrow morning in the re-shuffle of the Cabinet which must follow.  If the Taoiseach feels that he would make a better Taoiseach than he does&mdash;he obviously thought so the other day&mdash;there is an obvious way to deal with it.  It is more than ridiculous to suggest that, because of the fact that the Taoiseach considers that Deputy Childers is doing a very good job and the Department are doing a good job, he should be continued when everybody else in the country considers that the Department of Transport and Power is a washout.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What happens when questions are directed to the Minister for Transport <Col N="1465" /> and Power in this House?  I am sure he must be as ashamed as we are when he stands up and says that the Minister has no function in the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That means you are asking the wrong questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>We are asking the wrong Government.  The Taoiseach, the other day, said that Deputy Childers dealt in a gentlemanly way with tendentious questions.  If the Minister gives a straight answer to the questions asked, they do not tend to become tendentious.  That happens when it appears that there might be a chink somewhere by which the questioner can get in and get the information sought in the original question.</P>
      <P>Again, I am not blaming the Minister. I am simply saying that he is carrying out Government policy and Government policy apparently is that when a Minister is appointed, he is warned that he must not have any say in the running of the Department, that all he has to do is to go into the House and say he has no function in regard to the subject matter of any question which may be asked, that the Deputy should take it up with CIE, Bord na Móna or anybody else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another aspect of this in relation to which I personally was inclined to blame the Minister, but, on reflection, feel that he would not take the responsibility on himself, that somebody else must be at the back of it.  Of all the Ministries, there is only one which has so far arranged that pension schemes for lowly-paid workers take into account the social welfare old age pension when assessing the pension to which they are entitled at the end of their working day and that Department is the Department of Transport and Power.  We had it in Bord na Móna and it was trotted out on a number of occasions in CIE and apparently it has become the norm of that Department.  No other Department of State and no other employer that I know of has attempted to say that a person who has been paying for his pension through the years is not entitled to it in full but is entitled only to portion of it because of the fact that he will <Col N="1466" /> receive a contributory old age pension, despite the fact that he has been paying for that contributory pension and is entitled to it by law and, if not employed in the Department of Transport and Power, would normally get the full pension and those employed by the Department of Transport and Power and who do not stamp cards are entitled to the full pension.  It is a type of thinking that is very difficult to understand.  I was under the impression that it must have come from the mind of one individual. I would not blame the Minister because I am quite sure that he would be far too decent a man to stoop to doing a thing like that.</P>
    <P>Here in this House, two years ago, he told me that a bog worker would be entitled after 40 years' service to a pension of over £6 a week and when I pursued the matter further, I found that the year in which the worker would qualify for that pension would be the year 2003.  Surely it is not reasonable to suggest that a Department that thinks in that way has a right to survive in this century?  Surely the idea that people should not get by way of pension what they paid for belongs to a century gone by.  The Minister for Labour will, we are told, have certain responsibilities.  One of the things the Taoiseach, when I asked him if it was proposed to preclude agricultural workers, said was that he would deal with that later, and later he said that agricultural workers were being excluded and that they might be taken in if it were thought necessary later on.  Of course I can see a number of arguments in favour of leaving agricultural workers out if one thinks the same way as the Government.</P>
    <P>For instance, agricultural workers have their minimum rate of wages which is accepted by most people as a standard wage.  The rate they receive is the lowest in the country and they work the longest number of hours, longer than any other workers.  It is nice and handy, when people like me try to get increased wages for various types of manual workers employed by the State&mdash;on forestry, in the Land Commission, in the Office of Public Works, right round the whole lot&mdash;to be told <Col N="1467" /> that they themselves have little more than agricultural workers.  So long as the agricultural worker's rate can be kept down, there is no danger of the State employee being able to make much of a step forward.  I was hoping&mdash; perhaps it was too much of a hope&mdash; that when this new Ministry was being created, an effort should be made to treat the farm workers of this country as first-class citizens, but apparently the Government are still determined to treat them as second-class citizens because all workers are treated in one way except agricultural workers who are treated in that different way.  They get unfair treatment with regard to holidays, wages and in their conditions of employment.</P>
    <P>Maybe the Taoiseach, the Government, or whoever framed the Bill, had at the back of his mind the idea that if you were expecting trouble through redundancy, re-training and re-settlement of workers, it could come from one section and that would be the agricultural community.  While it is true that the number of people in employment is dropping year by year, last year there was a slight step forward in industry.  All the time agricultural workers of all types are getting fewer and fewer, the result being that last year we found about 14,000 agricultural workers of various types leaving the land.  In previous years we had 12,500 and 12,000 and this would be quite a headache for a Minister for Labour.  If there was a question of re-training and re-settlement, those are the people who would cause quite a headache.  The Taoiseach said the other day he was going to use his fairy wand on the ESB workers.  He waved it around and said: &ldquo;We will solve the problem and leave agricultural workers out of it completely.&rdquo;  By doing that, he will find that he is dealing with a relatively small problem, where industrial workers are concerned.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the Taoiseach even at this late stage to reverse the decision he took and to include agricultural workers.  Whether we like it or not, agriculture is still the primary industry of this country and if we are <Col N="1468" /> going to treat the people who work in the primary industry as second-class people, we will have trouble.</P>
    <P>Great play was made by Deputy Lindsay on some of the comments made by Deputy O'Leary.  Deputy Lindsay seemed to see something sinister in the suggestions Deputy O'Leary made.  May I repeat one?  He referred to the fact that all the trouble with regard to strikes did not come from the workers.  I want to say from my experience of 20 years as a trade union official, that about five per cent of the trouble comes from the workers and 95 per cent from employers who still cannot realise that without workers, they are not able to continue, that without workers who are treated properly, industry and agriculture must collapse.</P>
    <P>It seems to be quite a popular thing today to say that workers are causing a lot of trouble.  We have all sorts of meetings, an odd seminar and an odd big dinner speech.  Like Deputy Lindsay, I have no objection if a Minister wants to make a speech and say something which he cannot say in the Dáil.  In all these things if the audience is right, the theme seems to be the workers are wrong.  I am not claiming they are 100 per cent right but from 20 years experience, I am satisfied that they are at least 95 per cent right.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach threatened&mdash;I think &ldquo;threatened&rdquo; is the only word to use &mdash;the other evening that if the trade unions did not do certain things and the trade union officials did not face up to certain responsibilities, the Government would have to take much more serious action.  My experience in dealing with workers and with trade union officials is that it is quite usual that most of the time trade union officials are in fact attempting to find a solution to problems before they come before the general public.  This is where I would find fault with our press.  I am aware they have a difficult job.  I am aware they are sore if somebody takes a clip at them.  Like the old man in the story, they have the power and are able to get their own back.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that certain journalists <Col N="1469" /> have got into the habit of highlighting a strike, giving front page inch-high headings for a strike involving a small number of men, while a hundred agreements made in very serious circumstances seem to be overlooked. That is the order of things.  I honestly believe that, despite all the talking here about wildcat strikes and people doing irresponsible things, if the matter were dealt with fairly on both sides, most of these strikes might never occur, and if in fact the number of disputes which are settled, many of them through the Labour Court and many of them without going near the Labour Court, were counted, it would be found that the number of strikes which take place represent only a very small fraction of disputes which start and never reach that stage.</P>
    <P>It is most unfair of people in authority who are able to get the ear of the press, radio and television, to be always trotting out the same old story: &ldquo;The workers did this; there is a strike on and the economy will be ruined by selfish workers.&rdquo; It seems to me that selfish employers are sitting snugly in their ivory towers knowing that they have more money and that with luck they will be able to hold out and force the strikers to accept terms they would not accept in the first days of the strike.</P>
    <P>The new Minister for Labour no matter who he may be, will have to deal with this matter and will have to adopt a fresh approach.  He will need to ensure, before he brings a proposal before this House dealing with workers, that he has got the two sides of it and that we will not have the situation we had a few weeks ago in which with a dispute in progress, one set of people involved had a big stick over their heads while the others sat back and waited to see how hard they would be hit by that stick.</P>
    <P>I believe that people in this country because of the fact that they normally have poor wages and find it extremely difficult to carry on, are not in the position that they can hold out for a long time.  Trade unions have luckily reached the stage of progress or growth when they are prepared to stand by one another and what was enunciated <Col N="1470" /> by Larkin in 1913, that an injury to one is the responsibility of all, is generally appreciated.  If we attain that stage&mdash; and we are getting to it very fast&mdash;we shall have less of the situation in which unfortunate people are made to walk the streets until they have no more money and then must return to work.</P>
    <P>It is very easy to come to this House and talk about strikes and the harm strikes do but I can never understand why, while one strike seems to be important enough for the Government to introduce legislation, another strike, which is causing quite a lot of trouble over a longer period, does not seem to be the concern of the Government.  If the Minister for Labour is going to finish up as a responsible Minister and not find himself in the position of the Minister for Transport and Power, he must take an interest in what is happening and know the facts and be prepared, if necessary, to answer for his Department because, as I said already, one of the biggest troubles here is that the Minister for Transport and Power is not in a position to do that.</P>
    <P>When a new Department is set up, we usually find a set of officials manning that Department and I should be interested to know where those officials will come from.  Does it mean an entirely new set of departmental officials?  Where and how will they be recruited?  I think that should be explained in the House before finality is reached.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach explained that even with the addition of a new Minister, the Cabinet would not be any bigger than a number of Cabinets he named throughout Europe.  The answer given by Deputy Cosgrave is, I think, valid, that the populations in those countries are so very much greater and the size of Parliament in those countries so much greater than here that the comparison is not at all fair.  It is impossible to compare a Parliament with slightly over 140 members with a Parliament of several hundred members and say that they have the same number of Ministers as we have.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach suggested that the employment exchanges or, as they are better known, the labour exchanges, would in some way be run on an <Col N="1471" /> agency basis for the Department of Labour by the Department of Social Welfare.  This is one matter in which the Minister must take an interest because at present, except in the case of public employment on very rare occasions, nobody, so far as I know, has ever obtained a job by going to a labour exchange.  They sign on and it has become the recognised thing to go daily to those dark, gloomy buildings, stand around in a queue, sometimes for hours, sometimes if they are lucky, not so long.  Perhaps if it is raining they may have to stand outside and wait to get whatever few shillings are due to them, but there is no question of offering them employment or telling them where it is likely to be found.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Labour must first try to familiarise employers with the process of applying, as employers in Britain and other countries do, to the labour exchanges for workers so that when people sign as unemployed, they do not alone sign for credits and payments at the end of the week but in addition, apply for a job.  This must have a fresh approach.  At present I know nobody who has ever been offered a job at the exchange and I know many workers, employed and unemployed.  They would be so surprised they would probably fall down if told there was a job available and they were given a card to go to it, unless it is public employment.  Even there, the situation often arises in which six men are wanted and the labour exchange gives a list of 20.  The man recruiting the labour takes the six he intended to take anyway, no matter where the priority is on the list, and that is the end of it.</P>
    <P>If necessary, the Minister must set up a new department within the employment exchanges and make them real employment exchanges.  I think he would require to make them completely separate from the present system under which people have accepted that they just go there to sign for the dole or unemployment benefit.  In addition, while we have in the Department of Social Welfare at present very courteous people dealing <Col N="1472" /> with the public there are quite a number in the employment exchanges who, I fear, were not taught how to treat poor people properly.  They, perhaps, consider it beneath them to talk civilly to an unfortunate man who has a tear in his coat or the seat of whose pants is hanging down because he has not had a job or any money for a long time.  It would not do the Minister any harm if one of his first acts were to try to put in all labour exchanges a notice which appears in at least one of the dry cleaners in this country.  It is taken from Emerson.  I mean this seriously because I have had the experience of going in and out to these exchanges and finding people there who shout at applicants, ask them what they are doing and suggest they have not been trying to find employment, and a lot of other things.  If the Ministry is to be a success, it must settle down to doing the job which it was originally intended that labour exchanges should do, find work for the people.</P>
    <P>The amendment which we put down and on which we intend to vote tomorrow afternoon is for the purpose of trying to persuade the Taoiseach that without impairing the efficiency &mdash;if that is the word&mdash;of his Cabinet in any way, he could reduce the number of Ministers.  We picked the Minister for Transport and Power because we believe that his one Ministry is certainly not doing its job.  There are quite a number of other Ministries that could possibly be joined together. Somebody said that the Department of Defence is necessary.  I suppose it is, but personally, while the Minister for Defence is a personal friend of mine, I believe the Department of Defence could very well be joined with the Department of Justice.  Social Welfare and Health are two others that have been mentioned here but I am not so sure about them because I believe Health is a Department which is so big that it would almost require two Ministers and Social Welfare, unless relieved of a considerable amount of its duties by the new Minister, would also have its hands full.</P>
    <P>The Department of Posts and Telegraphs, since being given responsibility <Col N="1473" /> for television and radio, is, in fact, I suppose, a more responsible job than most people give the Minister credit for.  We are quite convinced that it should be possible to link the Ministry of Transport and Power with at least one of the other Ministries and that there is no reason at all why we should attempt to continue it, if we are in earnest about the credit squeeze we have heard so much about in the past few months.</P>
    <P>Finally, if the Minister is really serious about doing a good job&mdash;we know that quite a number of people have been forecasting who that Minister is likely to be; we hope the forecasts are right&mdash;I should like to advise him that he must, before interfering in any way with the trade union movement in the job of running labour relations, ensure that he will not go in as a partisan fighter who is prepared to come down on the side of the employer.</P>
    <P>It was suggested earlier that the trade union movement are anxious to have their labour relations amended and that industrial legislation must be changed in the near future.  Personally, I am not too happy about that.  I believe the trade union movement, given the proper opportunity, are well able to keep their house in order.  If the Minister for Labour, who will be appointed following tomorrow's decision, does his job properly, he will get the full co-operation of the trade union movement.  If he attempts to bully or to wave the big stick, then I am afraid the Minister for Labour will be a far more unpopular man than the poor Minister for Transport and Power seems to be at the present time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate may perhaps be divided into two parts: (1) the appointment of a Minister for Labour and the functions that Minister is likely to have, and (2) the amalgamation of certain Ministries on the ground that the country has more Ministers than it needs at present.  In relation to the first, the Taoiseach gave a historical survey which, while he coloured it to some extent from his own point of view, was at any rate an <Col N="1474" /> approach to the appropriate discussion of the measure.  He left a great deal to be desired, however, when he came on to discuss the functions of the new Ministry and, in relation to that, there are certain points on which we should like some clarification.</P>
      <P>Apart from that, however, when he went on to discuss the amendments, he showed, to say the least of it, a lack of the temper appropriate to a Taoiseach and a lack of discretion in his manner of dealing with that subject. I can understand his being a rattled man.  Certainly if he heard one-tenth of the things being said about him and his Cabinet around the country he would be very rattled indeed.  It is not at our desire that there is any discussion of that Cabinet.  It was the Taoiseach himself who put it in issue when he said, a fortnight ago, or so, that he had the best Cabinet in Ireland on those benches.  You cannot possibly say you have the best of this or the best of that and expect, at the same time, that you will not be criticised and that a different point of view will not be put forward.  It has been said here on many occasions by the Chair that the advocacy of one side of an argument, even though it might be out of order, inevitably brings the other.</P>
      <P>Before I go on to the more general question of the powers and functions of the new Ministry, I want to reiterate and underline some of the quite extraordinary fallacies in the Taoiseach's speech and which were referred to earlier today by the leader of the Opposition, Deputy Cosgrave.  The Taoiseach said categorically as reported at Column 1301 of the Official Report of 23rd June, 1966:</P>
      <P>So far from there being too many Ministers, as Deputies opposite appear to imply, we have a small Government in this country by any standard of international comparison.</P>
      <P>Of course, that is untrue.  It is untrue whether you take the standard of gross national product, the standard of population or the standard of size.</P>

If he had not put that in issue it would not have arisen, but he did.  We can take it quite simply, point by point, Minister by Minister, if he wishes, starting at the end and going down the line, with an honourable exception sitting opposite me.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce spent two whole weeks going around his constituency in Clare, going into every village in Clare, when he would have been better advised to try to deal with labour troubles up in the city of Dublin rather than Presidential electioneering to that extent.</P>

      <P>To that extent, it would be true to say it about him, but not in relation to his personal business. No, I do not expect the Minister for Industry and Commerce to give up politics.  He is a politician and should be there as a politician for the purpose <Col N="1476" /> of adding commonsense to the advice of technical people, however well qualified they may be.  However, certain people should put first things first.  The troubles which the country was encountering two or three weeks ago did not justify the absence of the Minister for Industry and Commerce from his post of duty at that time. But, of course, the Taoiseach, when making that speech on Thursday last, was doing it in a fit of pique and temper and it is totally contrary to the facts.</P>
      <P>There is a Cabinet of 12 in Austria and their population is more than double ours.  There is a Cabinet of 20 in Belgium, compared with our 14, and their population is more than three times ours.  In Denmark, there is a Cabinet of 18, compared with our 14, and their population is one and a half times the size of ours.  Finland, with a population of 4½ million, can manage with a Cabinet of 11.  The Netherlands have a Cabinet the same size as ours and yet it is able to manage a population of 12 million.</P>
