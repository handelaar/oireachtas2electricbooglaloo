      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the ESB that the output of Screebe power station during 1965 was 2,054,000 units; the number employed during 1965 varied from 15 when the station was working to two when the station was idle, and the amount of turf consumed at the station during the same period was 4,677 tons.</P>
      <P>The station was built to provide an outlet for surplus hand-won turf in the area and its capacity was based on the assumption that approximately 30,000 tons per annum would be available. Deliveries have fallen very much short of this figure but there is at present no intention to discontinue the operation of the station.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The indications were that there was a very good supply of turf available in the area and, as the Deputy knows, grants were offered for bog roads and drains to enable turf to be brought out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>From an examination made of the area at the time, it seemed that there would be as good a volume of turf from that area as any other.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not say.  It depends on the number of people who work at providing turf for the power station.  The price of it is fairly reasonable and I have had no complaints of lack of access facilities to the bogs concerned.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy knows, there is nothing that need at the moment be a cause of anxiety to the Limerick Harbour Commissioners. They have made a proposal for a three-way split of the revenues to be derived, and I am in consultation with Foynes Harbour Trustees now to ascertain what their final views are in the matter.  I do not think the Deputy has any reason for alarm at all.</P>

The additional service, which will be operated with Viscount aircraft, will commence on 27th April, 1966, at a frequency of four round-trips weekly. It will operate at a daily frequency during the period 23rd May to 31st October, rising to a frequency of eight round-trips weekly during the peak period 6th June to 8th October. Accommodation on the Dublin-Shannon and Shannon-Dublin sectors of the Aerlinte transatlantic services will continue to be available.  These latter services, operated with Boeing jet aircraft, will provide a frequency of nine flights weekly rising to 23 flights weekly from Dublin to Shannon during the westbound peak period, and eight flights weekly rising to 21 flights weekly from Shannon to Dublin during the eastbound peak period.  The usual Aer Lingus services between Shannon and London, Shannon and Manchester and Shannon and Paris will also operate in the summer season 1966.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 7, 8 and 9 together.</P>
      <P>I am informed by CIE that there are isolated cases of dumping of rubbish in the Grand Canal in Dublin city and that the Board take all steps possible to prevent such dumping and to remove obstructions, when they are known to exist.  The city section of the canal between Inchicore and Ringsend was thoroughly dredged between June and December, 1964.</P>
      <P>CIE are obliged by statute to maintain the Grand Canal in a fit condition for navigation and they are fulfilling this obligation.  Two excavators are employed in cleaning the canal and maintenance barges are also employed on maintenance work.  In addition four weed-cutting machines, including two of a very modern type, are engaged keeping weed growth in the canal under control.</P>
      <P>No decision has yet been reached on the long-term future of the canal or on the question of transferring responsibility for the canal from CIE to some other authority.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state, in respect of each prospecting licence issued for oil and minerals over the past ten years, what were the results, indicating what profitable activities were set on foot, the area of operation, the amount of employment given, and the period of operation.</P>

      <P>Mineral exploration is carried out by private concerns and the information regarding findings lodged with my Department is confidential. I may add that as is normal with mineral exploration in the majority of cases the findings are negative or inconclusive.  Following exploration over the past ten years, 11 State mining leases and 32 State mining permissions to develop and exploit minerals and 12 petroleum leases were granted.  Particulars of these so far as they relate to the period up to 30th June, 1965 will be found in the half-yearly reports which have been laid before the House.</P>
      <P>In the period since 1st July, 1965 one lease has been granted to Mogul of Ireland Ltd., in respect of an area of approximately 1,000 acres at Silvermines, County Tipperary.</P>
      <P>Particulars are not available of the number of persons employed by the companies to whom the mining facilities in question have been granted.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state in respect of (1) tea and (2) coffee the total amount imported for each of the years 1964 and 1965; the amount imported from each country; the prices paid; whether it was imported directly or indirectly; and, if it was imported indirectly, if he will give the names of the agents concerned.</P>

      <P>As the answer to the first part of the question is in the form of a tabular statement, I propose, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to circulate it with the Official Report.</P>
      <P>The information in the statement has been prepared by the Central Statistics Office and shows imports on the basis of the country of origin of the goods.  Particulars of imports by reference to the country from which the goods were consigned are not compiled. Deputies will be aware, however, that, under the Tea (Purchase and Importation) Act, 1958, tea may be imported only by Tea Importers (1958) Limited and by them only from the country or origin, except for certain quantities imported under licence where the country of origin is land-locked and must export through another country.</P>
      <P>Following is the statement:</P>
      <P Just="Center">IMPORTS of Coffee and Tea in each year 1964 and 1965.</P>

      <P>Changes in this figure cannot be considered in isolation.  What is significant is the total figure for cows, including first calf heifers, and heifers in calf.  At June, 1965, this total was 1,740, 714&mdash; an increase of 138, 514 on June, 1964.</P>

      <P>We are very satisfactorily reaching the target set, which was to have 1,700,000 cows by 1968 <Col N="231" /> so that we could have an annual cattle output of 1,500,000 by 1970.  At the present moment we have 1,547,000 cows and 193,000 in calf heifers, which means that between cows and in-calf heifers, we are over the 1,700,000 already.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole purpose of any rationalisation or reorganisation of the structure of the dairying industry in this country would be to ensure that, by the elimination of all uneconomic factors, the industry would be made more efficient and capable of paying a better price to the dairy farmer.  That would be the whole purpose of the exercise.  I have already met the Creamery Managers' Association and discussed with them the question of redundancy.  I have indicated to them that I accept in principle the statement in the survey report that if there is to be any redundancy&mdash;and it is not by any means certain that there will be&mdash;the principle of compensation for such redundancy should be accepted by all concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. J.A. Costello Mr. J.A. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>On the adjournment last night, I was drawing the <Col N="242" /> attention of the Minister and the House to the provisions of section 22 of the Bill.  I was doing so in connection with certain damage that had occured in the Anglesea Road area of my constituency during the exceptional floods some time in November of last year.  In the exceptional floods that had occured about two years ago, many of these houses were subjected to damage from the flooding of the River Dodder.  Last year they were again damaged in the flooding.  On this occasion not merely was the structure of many of the houses concerned damaged very considerably, causing the owners or occupiers to be subjected to liability for very serious pecuniary damages, but the boundary walls, the side walls and rere walls of the gardens were completely flattened by the floods that came from the Dodder.  That had happened before, so that whoever was responsible for the control of the Dodder was put on notice.</P>
      <P>While I think I may submit that under section 4 of the 1962 Act, which this section 22 replaces, the principle of the Minister having discretionary power to relieve distress in cases of flooding has been recognised, in view of the fact that flooding causing severe damage to these houses occurred before, it was, I believe, impossible to secure any cover by insurance companies against subsequent flooding. Accordingly, these people were faced with great liability under covenants in their leases from their head landlords to replace the walls which had been completely flattened out by the Dodder when it overflowed its banks. Each of these people is now faced with very serious loss.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I visited some of these houses and saw what happened myself.  Not merely were these walls flattened, causing these people to be liable to replace them at great expense, but inside the houses their goods such as bedding and furniture were seriously damaged also.  I know of no provision enabling the Minister or anybody else to give a grant in ease of the owners of houses <Col N="243" /> whose houses have been flooded and in consequence of which furniture and bedding is damaged.  But certainly in section 4 of the Act of 1962 there is discretionary power in the Minister to give grants to people whose houses have been damaged in consequence of wind, rain or floods.</P>
    <P>The people, faced with the liability of heavy expenditure, formed themselves into an association and their spokesman interviewed the Department of Finance.  The case made by the officials there was that the Minister has no power to give a grant for the walls of the gardens to the houses.  He has power to give it for the houses but not for the walls.  Section 22 is now repealing the section in the 1962 Act. For that reason I was asked to take the opportunity afforded by the Fifth Stage of this Bill to bring the grievances of these people before the Minister and the House in order that provision should be made, in the Seanad if necessary, to meet their situation.  I gave what my constituents thought was the officials' attitude: &ldquo;We are sorry. If it was your house was damaged, we might think about it.  We cannot do anything about the walls of the gardens, the boundary and side walls.&rdquo; This has happened before.  A sum of £200 or £300 had to be expended in the previous flooding by a number of these people in connection with their liabilities under covenants in their leases to repair and keep in repair. Consequently, I say the local authority and the Government were put on notice to meet the situation.  In equity and justice, they ought to meet it now.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with the interpretation put by the officials on this section 4.  It is intended that the Act of 1962 shall be replaced by this Act.  Therefore, instead of the section in the Act of 1962, the operative section enabling the Minister to exercise discretion will be section 22 when this Bill comes into operation.  The allegation that houses are confined to the structure of houses, in my view, cannot stand up legally. I have very clear authority for that proposition and have so advised my constituents.  In the ordinary concept in the mind of a person who owns a <Col N="244" /> house, when he speaks of his house, he does not mean the four walls of the house or anything inside it, or even out-offices, garages or anything like that.  He means the entire of his house, including the back and front gardens and the walls or any other structure surrounding it.  That popular view is in strict accord not merely with the most ancient view of legal commentators but also of fairly recent legal authorities. I can quote authority for the Minister and his officials, for the proposition I have made.  I do not want to read a law lecture to the Dáil but I think the Minister's advisers ought to know the legal position.</P>
    <P>Speaking from recollection, as far back as the 17th century, Coke on Littleton, a very ancient commentary on the law of real property, dealt with the meaning of &ldquo;house&rdquo;.  One would think it was made for this particular section.  This distinguished Elizabethan, I think, a Chief Justice, rules as follows: &ldquo;The word `house' contains the buildings, curtilage, orchard and garden&rdquo;.  Now, if it comprises the garden, surely it comprises the garden wall?  If there is any doubt about that definition, it was adopted and amplified, if necessary, in a case, St. Thomas's Hospital against Charging Cross Railway.  The Minister and his advisers can have the reference in the Law Reports in which it is to be found if they so desire&mdash;J. &amp; H., 404, Johnston &amp; Henry.  In that case, the Judge, Vice Chancellor Wood, said that the word &ldquo;house&rdquo; comprises all that would pass by a grant of a house and would include not only the curtilage but also the garden or paddock which is necessary adjoining to the enjoyment of the house.  The garden passes and garden walls must also be included: that is not the official attitude. One might consider that if the walls of the house were injured by the flood, they should be included but here we cannot secure a grant because it is a garden.  In considering this Bill when it is in the Seanad, the Minister should introduce an amendment to section 22 as it stands at the moment in order to remove any possible doubt and give the Minister for Local Government, <Col N="245" /> with the consent of the Minister for Finance, power to give grants to cover the people whose property, including their garden walls, has been injured in the recent floods.</P>
    <P>I think I am right in suggesting that the principle has been established by the Act of 1962 for the giving of a grant for damage to house property caused by flood.  That is in section 4 of the 1962 Act and that section is being carried into this Bill.  I suggest that the Minister should consider the amendment of this section so as to make the position clear.  I should really prefer him to bring in a separate section to cover specific cases of the kind I have mentioned, where damage has occurred before by flooding and notice is thereby given to the Department of Local Government or to the Minister of the possibility of recurrence.  Where damage does occur again, it should be almost a matter of right for the Minister to give relief.</P>
    <P>In the particular area to which I am referring, the flooding was very serious. In fact, one of my constituents paddled a rowing boat up Anglesea Road during the flooding caused by the overflow from the Dodder banks.  While I am speaking on behalf of and putting forward a case for justice for my constituents in Anglesea Road, there is a wider principle involved also.  I myself was captured in a flood, a pool of water, out in Templeogue on 18th November last on the evening of the removal of the remains of the late Mr. W.T. Cosgrave to the church.  I was stuck, as a result of a flood coming down over the banks on the right-hand side of the road as one goes out to the church and out on to the left on to a farmer's land beside it.  My state car was lifted bodily on to the ditch and, as water came down, the wall was completely damaged.  The man who owns the property there told me that it would cost him £300 to repair that wall and that he has been refused a grant.  Surely it is inequitable, in these circumstances, that the Minister should not at least have discretion in relation to the giving of a grant?  Other <Col N="246" /> people, too, have approached me about other cases of a similar type.</P>
    <P>An unusual flooding, causing private damage, is something that comes within the principle enshrined in section 4 of the 1962 Act and section 22 of the present Bill and consideration should be given to it accordingly. While there is any danger of flooding occurring, one will not get any insurance company to indemnify one against possible loss.  Therefore, unless the local authority do a better job since the last flooding than they have done before, these private people are in the position of possibly having to meet another liability although they have already met one of a very substantial character.</P>
    <P>I press on the Minister the urgent desirability of dealing with this matter in the Seanad.  Section 22 should not be kept to narrow confines.  If possible a section should be introduced to give the Minister discretion&mdash;that is all I ask&mdash;in relation to private individuals whose property is damaged as a result of exceptional floods particularly when the local authority, charged to prevent the flood, has allowed it to happen a second time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Deputy Costello's plea on this point.  He has represented this area of Anglesea Road for many years and I have represented it lately.  The last floods have brought back to us how terribly essential it is to take precautions and to try to prevent a recurrence. Dublin Corporation have brought in a new scheme there but it will be many years before it is finished.  In the meantime, the surroundings of these houses may again be damaged as they were damaged twice in the past few months. As Deputy Costello has pointed out, it is not merely in Anglesea Road that action is needed because people in many other parts of the country are affected also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A definition of &ldquo;house&rdquo; would help very much.  Deputy Costello also has produced evidence of definitions given in other places.  I would support his <Col N="247" /> plea to the Parliamentary Secretary to ask the Minister that, when the Bill comes before the Seanad, it be amended to include the curtilage of a house or even a definition of &ldquo;house&rdquo;.  I am reminded that the definition of &ldquo;house&rdquo; is in the Bill but I suppose we do not quite agree with that definition.  I would ask the Minister to widen that definition to include the points made by Deputy Costello.</P>
    <P>A very serious matter in relation to people concerned is the fact that insurance companies have refused to re-insure.  If that happens, they may leave these houses because the local authority cannot help them very much in that respect.</P>
    <P>Every effort should be made to help people to preserve the existing stock of houses.  In the case of the Anglesea Road, Ballsbridge, houses, had the walls been strong enough, there would have been no floods.  The rush of water from the River Dodder swept everything before it and caused thousands of pounds damage.  The persons concerned who suffered through no fault of their own are entitled to consideration and I support Deputy Costello's able plea in that respect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already spoken at some length on this Bill.  Consequently my final comments will be brief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, I should like to thank the Parliamentary Secretary for his acknowledgment of the co-operation he received from both Deputy Tully and myself throughout the discussion on the Bill.  The Parliamentary Secretary has considerable experience of local government and I am sure he realised that we were sincerely trying to improve a measure that I, personally, believed to be defective from the start.  I expressed the view that the Bill fell very far short of the expectations and hopes of the people.  False hopes were raised by the way in which the Minister heralded this housing legislation. We needed to make a complete break with tradition and to make fundamental changes in our housing legislation if we were to succeed in clearing the way for a real housing <Col N="248" /> drive by removing the many obstacles impeding progress, so that the necessary number of houses could be built in the shortest possible time when money again became available.</P>
    <P>Instead of that, instead of removing dual control and the division of responsibility as between the county council and the Department, the Minister preferred to continue the same sort of defective legislation.  In this measure he has re-enacted most of the existing legislation.  Undoubtedly, some marginal improvements have been introduced.  Despite the improvements, introduced in the Bill as drafted and embodied in amendments which have been accepted, I maintain that the Bill still falls very far short of what is required in order to solve the housing problem.</P>
    <P>On the night before the Bill was introduced, the Minister stated that the target would be 14,000 houses per annum, at a cost of approximately £20 million and that he expected that this target would be reached within a few years.  That statement was made last June.  In my view, we will not reach the target which the Minister announced in anything like the time which he then suggested because all the obstacles that have existed over the years remain.  Some of them may have been reduced slightly but the same inherent weakness as existed in the housing legislation remains and, in addition, there is a credit squeeze in operation at the moment which, incidentally, is now being referred to by Deputies on the Government benches as if it were an act of God, with which they had absolutely nothing to do and had no responsibility for, which, of course, is quite ridiculous and indefensible.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael Party put down a fairly large number of amendments to the Bill, most of which, I am sorry to say, were rejected.  We put down these amendments because we knew from practical experience as members of local authorities what it was that was preventing us from providing the houses required in our constituencies. Most of our amendments have been rejected, in my view, unwisely, and grants and other incentives remain <Col N="249" /> practically the same as they were in 1948.</P>
    <P>I fail to see how the Minister hopes to reach the targets he has announced. I think it was Deputy Cunningham who said that there was no shortage of money and that houses were being built at approximately the same rate as always.  That may be happening in Donegal.  I should like to know the number of houses being built there, both in the private and the public sector.  I know that in my constituency we are just closed down because we have been waiting for money since last September.  There are practically £1½ million worth of housing proposals in the Minister's Department still awaiting sanction and we just do not know when it will be forthcoming.  I am in touch with private builders in County Dublin who tell me they are down to 80 per cent of their normal activity.  I do not know whether to accept that or not but I do know that there is a great recession in the building industry.</P>
    <P>Early last year and, indeed, throughout most of the year, the Minister was expressing the view that there was no shortage of money for house building. That may have been his opinion but it gave a totally false picture of the situation. The situation in County Dublin is that over 97 per cent of all houses built were built by private enterprise in the past seven or eight years and if private enterprise ceases&mdash;and it is slowing down at the moment and no new plans are being made and no new contracts are being signed&mdash;we will lose the skilled workers; they will emigrate and they will not return.  In these circumstances, I do not see how the Minister can expect to reach his target.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that one of the improvements that would be introduced in the Housing Bill would be to make more people eligible for SDA loans and grants.  That is quite true but the position is that we have been flooded with applications since the building societies and other credit organisations have failed to supply the necessary accommodation.  On paper, <Col N="250" /> the applicants qualify but we can do nothing about them.  Daily, people ring me up asking if I could do anything in their case.  They tell me of houses having been finished since last September and that they are paying enormous prices for accommodation in flats and elsewhere and cannot get into the houses because the builder will not let them in until the house is paid for.</P>
    <P>The intention, I am sure, was good but it is quite obvious that the targets mentioned will not be reached, like many of the other targets mentioned in the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion.</i></P>
    <P>I got a report some time ago which I think should be on the record of the House.  It relates to the effect of bad housing on mental patients.  The report was supplied by the Chief Medical Officer of the largest mental hospital in this country to a visiting committee on 16th November, 1965.</P>
    <P>I will read the first paragraph:</P>
    <P>For many months now I have felt a growing concern over the number of tragic housing situations involving our psychiatric patients.  As the mental health services of the Dublin Health Authority deal mainly with patients from the lower socioeconomic groups, it is inevitable that problems of housing accommodation should be widespread amongst both the inpatient and the outpatient population.  In too many of these cases the psychiatric break-down&mdash;indeed, repeated break-downs&mdash;can be seen to follow directly from the deplorable housing conditions involved.  Often such factors make it impossible to discharge patients from hospital and in other cases considerably delay their return home.</P>
    <P>I visit one area where the degree of overcrowding is deplorable, namely, Ballyfermot.  I visit it usually every second Sunday.  I see evidence of the stress on people where as many as 15 to 20 persons may live in one small house.  They might see some hope this week of families where five persons are living in one room being housed and in the following week the families <Col N="251" /> being housed are families of eigth persons living in one room.</P>
    <P>Targets are not being reached in Ballymun or anywhere else.  The Minister has given us as an explanation that weather conditions have been deplorable during the year for the building industry.  That is quite true. The weather has been most unsuitable for building operations and that does provide some sort of explanation but I do not think it is the complete answer.  It is wrong to give people the impression that this problem will be solved in a much shorter time than will be the case.  The figures quoted and the targets mentioned are much more optimistic than the measures taken by the Government to provide houses would justify and much more optimistic than the rate that can be achieved on the amount of money being provided.</P>
    <P>A short time ago we tried by way of a motion in this House to improve the housing situation by the introduction of a tenant purchase scheme. That was rejected also by the Minister. That rejection was a grave mistake. If our suggestion had been adopted it would have considerably eased the problem in regard to local authority housing and would have had other beneficial effects also.</P>
    <P>The main thing that can be said about this Bill is that it is an enabling Bill.  It merely enables local authorities to spend more and to contribute more through the rates than they have been doing while, at the same time, there is no increased contribution from the Department of Local Government.  If it is fair to expect the ratepayers to increase their contribution towards this housing drive, it is equally fair and reasonable to expect the Department to improve theirs.  There is a real housing crisis and, as I have said before, the responsibility for that crisis must be placed fairly and squarely at the feet of the present Government.  The facts are there.  We do not have to analyse the figures.  The Government have failed to reach the targets set all during the past eight years and we have not yet got back to the number of <Col N="252" /> houses built per year all over the country before this Government came back into office.  The figure is down considerably and how anyone can say that there is more activity and more work than heretofore is something I cannot understand.</P>
    <P>As I have said, we are waiting for money.  We are waiting for money for housing sites.  We are waiting for the signing of contracts for the building of houses.  At the moment, the Minister is probably in a position in which he can do absolutely nothing about that but that does not relieve him of responsibility when he introduces a measure like this, a measure which would clear the way for a comprehensive housing drive, once the money becomes available, and, in my opinion, the Government have an obligation to give priority to expenditure on housing. Someone suggested he would be prepared to take money away from roads and put it into housing.  If that were the only way to get the necessary money to build houses, I would be prepared to reduce the amount spent on roads and divert it towards housing.  I have been in many continental countries in which there is an immense amount of industry.  The roads in many cases are not as good as ours.  Until this crisis is overcome, we could afford to divert more of the money used on roads into housing.  That step is called for.</P>
    <P>I said I would not say very much on this, and I do not intend to say much on it.  I have already spoken at some length.  Deputy Jones and I were in communication with the Department in relation to compulsory purchase and when Deputy Jones comes to speak, as I hope he will, he will deal with that.</P>
    <P>There is another matter which has been brought to my attention.  It is the devesting of cottages in certain circumstances. A case has just come to my knowledge in relation to a house that was vested.  Apparently there was a fundamental flaw and it cracked right down the centre of the chimney. This would be a reconstruction job completely outside the tenant purchaser's <Col N="253" /> ability.  As a result of the passing of this legislation, the Government will be able to get back the house, but it can never be vested again in the same tenant.  If that is so &mdash;I must admit I have not probed the Bill to the extent of finding out whether or not it is so&mdash;I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary to have a look at that aspect before the Bill is finally passed because I can visualise the extreme case in which it might be desirable to have the power at least to move in in such a case, devest the cottage, do what needs to be done, and hand it back.  I know that would be a very bad practice because tenant purchasers might get the impression that they could afford to neglect ordinary everyday repairs in the knowledge that, when the houses fell into a very bad state of disrepair, the local authority would take them back, do the repairs, and then vest them in the tenants again.  That would be a very bad thing and there should be safeguards in any measure designed to enable something like this to happen to prevent such an eventuality.</P>
    <P>In the course of earlier discussions, I referred to the system of valuing houses for loan and grant purposes.  I put down a question to the Minister asking him if he could see his way to doing something about this.  I did that because of the very considerable deposit required.  In the Dublin region the deposit is never less than £500 and, in some cases, it is as much as £700.  It would be quite an exercise if some change were made in the system of valuing.  That would give us a check, too, on whether or not there is too much profit made.  I asked the Minister whether he was considering any change in the system for the valuing of houses for loan and grant purposes and if he intended increasing grants.  We know, of course, that he has not increased grants, but his reply was: &ldquo;While I do not propose to make any change at present in the prescribed method of determining the value of a house for the purposes of house purchase loans, I am keeping the matter under review.&rdquo; I do not know whether the Minister has given <Col N="254" /> any further consideration to this, but I certainly know that the existing system is not satisfactory.</P>
    <P>The valuation put on by the local authority valuer, in my experience, falls very far short of the selling price, and in many cases debars a would-be house purchaser from ever owning his house.  It is a matter of urgency that that should be changed.  It was fixed some years ago.  I know the people who build houses have the right to appeal, but when they appeal to the commissioner the local authority does not have to accept that valuation and, as far as I know, never does accept the valuation.  It may increase the original estimate but not sufficiently to leave the house purchasers free to buy their house without having to provide a very large deposit.  There is a scheme in England whereby the entire money is provided.  The local authority buy the house out completely and hand it over, that is, in cases where people are graduating from local authority houses to the SDA type of house.  This makes more local authority houses available for the people.</P>
    <P>I was anxious&mdash;and it was a very small request, but apparently the Minister did not see his way to meet it&mdash; that the full subsidy would be given in the case of temporary dwellings like caravans, where in emergency cases, of which there are many at the present time, such accommodation supplies the housing deficiency.  In every case so far the Minister has refused to grant the two-thirds subsidy.  The number is not so very big; it would not affect his budget enormously, but it would alleviate a considerable amount of the hardship endured by those who are compelled to pay extra rent because of the lack of subsidy.  The Minister can say he does not prevent the local authority from making up the deficiency from the rates but there are many here who will agree with me that rates are at the present time much too high and are rocketing every year, including the present year.</P>
    <P>There are certain improvements in this Bill and we are glad to see them. However, these improvements have not <Col N="255" /> changed the whole housing legislation in any fundamental way, and that fundamental change is necessary.  We must accept what we have got and the people should know what we have got, a very limited measure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Clinton, I have already made some observations on this Bill and I avail of this opportunity merely to refer to matters appertaining to the needs of the people of my constituency.  In saying that, I think it is tragic that in the recession which we in this country are experiencing, particularly in regard to the acute shortage of money, housing, the most essential of all our services, should be the first to suffer in this credit squeeze.  It is true to say that there is dismay, anxiety and unrest in the minds of all members of housing authorities, and particularly in the minds of all those in need of rehousing, about the present situation.  For some months past it has been the experience of those who are members of local authorities that it is impossible to secure from the Minister's Department the amount of money required to proceed with our housing commitments.  Many of us have plans for the provision of much needed houses for a considerable length of time, plans which have reached the final stage and merely rest in the Minister's Department awaiting sanction of the money involved.  Despite the many questions raised in the House and the direct representations of the officers of the local housing authorities, there is no sign whatsoever of these moneys coming to hand for the purpose of proceeding with these schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a matter of grave concern to us that we have arrived at that sad and sorry situation.  There is a great social obligation on us all to end the long purgatory of waiting by these people in appalling circumstances, grossly overcrowded conditions, lack of essential sanitary services and sometimes rat-infested hovels or tenement flats.  Apart from that great human problem of the housing of our people which is a serious blot on our society. <Col N="256" /> at large, we are also concerned about the employment content involved in this important industry, the building industry.  The recession to which I have adverted has already hit that industry and there is evidence of a falling off of activity in all housing authorities. There is evidence already of a fall in employment in the building industry, and the trade union chiefs of the various unions representative of that industry are fearful that unless there is some fulfilment of promise by the Minister, that unless the necessary moneys are forthcoming soon, we shall have reached a serious crisis in the building industry by the middle of this summer, with widespread unemployment and perhaps the loss of many of our tradesmen who will be obliged to seek work in other places, most probably abroad.  I would appeal to the Minister, despite the difficult situation in which he may find himself, to insist that in the order of priority housing must take first place&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>What about education?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and that he must find the necessary money to proceed with this essential service.  In respect of education, it is in the very same category as housing, grandiose schemes and no money.  I sincerely hope the Minister will be honest with the local authorities and indicate to them as soon as he possibly can the allocation of money for which they may hope in respect of their present commitments, at least.  It is not good enough to invent the various stalling devices with which officialdom is gifted in order to find excuse while the real excuse is lack of money.  We must be honest with our housing authorities and tell them precisely where they stand, indicating, if there is this shortage of money, their particular allocation and let them decide the priorities in their own realms.  The stalemate evident at present must be resolved or it will lead to chaos.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am perturbed that this rigidity in the allocation of money has now reached a stage when, although moneys <Col N="257" /> are sanctioned by the Department of Local Government, particularly in respect of SDA loans, and when in normal circumstances the local authority could pay these loans forthwith on demand, it is now the procedure that they must be requisitioned from the Department of Finance and even then we experience long and undue delay causing great embarrassment, anxiety and hardship to homebuilders until moneys approved many months previously come to hand.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that in my own town of Clonmel we have what seems to be the best scheme of housing planned for a long time at Gortmalogue for which we secured, luckily we felt, the services of the National Building Agency for the erection of the houses.  We have £40,000 for this purpose and we need another £60,000.  Despite all our representations to the Minister's Department there is no sign of this money coming to hand.  It was hoped that the Gortmalogue scheme would be commenced by the National Building Agency last August and some 50 house-builders, mainly young married people in my own town, paid their deposits and hoped that by now or very early this year they would be living in this nicely-planned scheme.  Their hopes have been dashed; they have been completely frustrated in their desire to occupy these new homes.</P>
    <P>It is all the more disconcerting when we realise that a semi-State body like the National Building Agency is involved. The corporation felt they were fortunate in getting the services of this body but my feeling now is that we would have been much better off if we had got one of our local contractors in the hope of not being involved in the amount of red tape associated with this Agency and the Minister's Department in general.  I appeal to the Minister so that the essential money for this purpose will be made available without further delay.  In regard to the suggestion in this connection by the Minister that the corporation in fact have money available that they did not utilise, he or his officials were under a misapprehension.  Any moneys available for housing purposes to Clonmel Corporation are committed to loans or grants or other facets of <Col N="258" /> housing.  Unless we receive approval for some £60,000 for this scheme it cannot be commenced and there is no hope of finding an alternative source in regard to this money.  It is self-evident that many local authorities have sought money for housing purposes, whether for new houses or repairing cottages, and have, in fact, been refused by the lending agencies including the banks and it is to the Minister's Department we look with hope for approval of this much needed money to proceed with these essential schemes.</P>
    <P>A similar situation exists in regard to a small scheme of houses in Clonmel known as the Old Bridge.  The people of Old Bridge have always been regarded as a people very much an entity in themselves, something akin, perhaps, to the people of the Claddagh in Galway.  They live across the River Suir in County Waterford.  They have a special love and respect for the area and it is the desire of the corporation that they should be allowed to remain there in decent housing circumstances. For that purpose this very nice scheme of houses was designed for Old Bridge and application for sanction for the necessary money has been in the Minister's Department for a considerable time and there is yet no indication that the money is forthcoming.</P>
    <P>There are many other housing schemes in my constituency about which I am very concerned.  Only today I put down a question to the Minister in respect of the need to expedite approval for a site for rehousing people in urgent need at Ardfinnan, Clonmel.  This small town has a most serious housing problem.  It has been found extremely difficult to find a suitable site there.  A site chosen some time ago by the housing authority of Tipperary South Riding was turned down by the Minister on appeal by the aggrieved landowner.  The council were put to the trouble of selecting another site which was the subject of a further objection and inquiry.  The findings of the inquiry are with the Minister's Department for some time and we are anxiously awaiting his decision in the matter.  I hope that decision will be <Col N="259" /> favourable and that this much-needed site at Ardfinnan will be conceded to us as soon as is humanly possible so that we may rehouse these people.</P>
    <P>As one who knows the housing needs of my constituency reasonably well, I have no hesitation in saying that Ardfinnan is the worst area in respect of housing.  For such a relatively small population the incidence of those needing houses is high and many working class people are living in extremely bad conditions.  Therefore, I again express the hope that the Minister will realise the urgency and importance of sanctioning this site so that we may erect these much needed cottages.  Of course when one has arrived at the happy state of having secured sanction for the various stages of house-building, one comes to the question of money.  I can only hope that by the time this essential scheme for the erection of these cottages is put up for tender, this appalling credit squeeze will have eased and we will be able to find ways and means of securing the necessary money.</P>
    <P>I want to draw the attention of the Minister to an anomaly which I think should be rectified without further delay.  Quite recently I tabled a question to the Minister for Finance asking whether tenants of local authority houses had the same rights as the tenants or owners of private houses to appeal to the Commissioner of Valuation where they were aggrieved by the valuation fixed and which they thought was unfair.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well; I will take it up at the appropriate time with the appropriate Minister, but I did feel that if it was not strictly appropriate now, it was certainly very relevant.</P>
      <P>I want now to refer to the document which the Minister issued in November 1964 entitled &ldquo;Housing&mdash;Progress and Prospects&rdquo;.  This is a useful document containing quite a lot of valuable information and also containing certain lines laid down by the Minister for the public at large and particularly for officers of local authorities and county managers.  I want to refer to a particular aspect in this booklet in which the Minister refers to rents.  He differentiates between rents based on current building costs and those actually charged in the majority of cases by the local authorities.  Clearly in this document the Minister recommended the variation, or a rationalisation, of the rent policy adopted by most local authorities.  He says:</P>
      <P>As a further step in the same direction local authorities have been encouraged by the Department to adopt graded or differential rent schemes under which the rent charged to a tenant varies according to his family circumstances.</P>
      <P>He also says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The inhibiting effect of heavy housing charges is, in fact, being increasingly felt by many local authorities, some of whom have faced the difficulty <Col N="261" /> by increasing the rents of their old houses, thus enabling newer houses to be let at rents less than the full economic level, without imposing an unduly heavy burden on either the tenants or the rates.</P>
    <P>He goes on to refer to the income taken in rent and the manner in which it varies.  The whole intent of this paragraph is towards a recommendation that housing authorities should vary their present rent structures.  Whether or not the Minister intended it, this paragraph to which I have adverted has been taken as a clarion call from the Minister to county managers to proceed forthwith to increase council rents.  Already some managers have embarked upon a rackrenting device of this kind.  In my constituency there is great indignation and unrest at the attempts being made by the county manager to increase the rents of the tenants of Clonmel Corporation and in the county council area of South Tipperary.  The proposals made seem to me to be nothing less than outrageous.</P>
    <P>In respect of Clonmel Corporation, it is proposed that the differential rent system be applied to all houses, old or new.  The House will agree that this is a radical change and a complete departure for the majority of houses and particularly for older houses, from the fixed rent system which the tenant had come to know and understand.  It is a change to differential rents which would very from week to week in accordance with family income and which would involve people in what they term an odious means test whereby they would have to reveal the income not only of the breadwinner but of all the earning members of that family.</P>
    <P>Many tenants regard that as a variation of their tenancy agreement, a document solemnly entered into to pay a certain rent, the only variation included in that agreement between tenant and council being that in regard to the rates variation, which they have been meeting from year to year according as the rates went up or down.  The Minister's recommendation is now being used by county managers as a money-raising device to butters <Col N="262" /> the rates at the expense of the tenants of local authorities.  It is neither fair nor equitable to apply this new device or these new standards to old structures, many of which were built 20, 30 or 50 years ago.  The comparison between those old houses, from which the managers now wish to extract an economic rent in terms of modern standards and values, is odious.  Those houses are entirely lacking in the modern amenities of bathrooms, hot water, built-in presses, terrazzo floors, concrete paths and tarmacadam avenues, even at the backs of the houses.  The standards of old houses <i>vis-á-vis</i> new houses are primitive and archaic.  From any standpoint, managers or members of housing authorities cannot be justified in seeking to extract from the pockets of those tenants the hard-won earnings of the family.  It must be borne in mind also that when those people first entered those houses some considerable number of years ago, as newlyweds, they may have found it difficult then to meet the rents prevailing but there was no redress for them by way of a graded differential rent system.  They had to meet the demand of the local authorities.  They met that demand through good times and bad.</P>
    <P>It seems to me to be flagrantly unjust that when those families have reached the happy stage of having reared some of their children, and those children have gone out to work, they should have imposed on them this rackrenting device of a differential rent.  In respect of some of the proposals made by certain housing authorities, which are being resisted vigorously and vehemently, and up to now, successfully, the proposals are so out-landish and so extreme that in respect of some schemes it is now proposed to very the rents on a differential basis upwards to 300 per cent.  The lower rented houses can increase to 300 per cent; the middle income group can increase to a maximum of not less than 125 per cent and with regard to the more modern dwellings it is proposed to increase to a ceiling of not less than 75 per cent.</P>
    <P>The Minister may have laid down <Col N="263" /> those conditions in a time of relative prosperity, or alleged prosperity, in this country but he must realise now that we talk in different circumstances. We are being admonished now&mdash;at least the working classes of this country are&mdash;that in respect of the wage demand which is in the offing they cannot hope to secure more than 3 per cent, otherwise the economy of this country may be disrupted, or so Government spokesmen tell us. They say 3 per cent for the working classes and yet managers of housing authorities have the audacity to increase the rents of working class people by upwards of 300 per cent.  I submit to this House that it is the height of folly to admonish the working classes of this country, or the trade union movement, to be moderate, reserved and disciplined in their response if this kind of carry-on is to be allowed by housing authorities.</P>
    <P>I am adverting to this matter because the fight we are waging in Clonmel and which we waged last night in the council chamber in defence of tenants' rights is a fight for the tenants of all Ireland because the clarion call of the Minister, which has been conveyed to managers, will, most likely, sweep like a prairie fire through every housing authority in Ireland. At a time of restraint and acute shortage of money, it is greatly to be deplored that housing authorities are now turning for increased revenue to the local tenants by the extraction of some extra thousands of pounds, to bolster up the rates, from the pockets of the ordinary working classes.</P>
    <P>May I bring to the Minister's notice, as well, the necessity to facilitate the local authorities to proceed with their commitments in respect of piped water? Many of us have a proud record in this respect.  We want to continue the good work of providing piped water for all our people.  It is disturbing that in relation to many of our schemes, now at the stage of final planning and with the Minister's Department for some time, there is no indication as to when the final approval of the Minister will be forthcoming so that the much needed work can commence.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that the piped water <Col N="264" /> supply schemes in respect of Ardfinnan, Dundrum and Emly, which are in the Minister's Department for some considerable time, should now be approved and the money provided so that we can proceed with the schemes.  The areas, to which I have referred, are essentially dry areas and there is great hardship imposed on the farming community, cottiers and householders generally in those areas by reason of an acute scarcity of fresh water.  It is disheartening to a progressive county such as South Tipperary, having made such progress, that we should now reach what seems to be stalemate in respect of our plans.  Unless some early break-through is forthcoming in respect of those essential schemes, many of our dedicated planners, engineers and officers generally will become disillusioned and frustrated in their efforts and we shall fall into a state of inactivity which will be detrimental to the people we represent.</P>
    <P>I shall not take up the time of the House any longer on this subject, except to express the hope that the Minister will take a clear and positive step in relation to the Government's financial obligations to meet their commitments in respect of the housing drive.  They should end the atmosphere of doubt, suspicion and distrust and, at least, be good enough to give to all of us in local authorities some idea of the amount of money we can hope for in the ensuing year in respect of our commitments.  I hope that matter will be cleared up at the conclusion of this debate.</P>

      <P>It is agreed that one of the first social obligations of any State to its citizens is the provision of an adequate educational system and, of course, to ensure that those of our people who cannot afford education be given it free.  High in this list of priorities is the provision of adequate housing, at low cost, to those of our less well off fellow citizens.  There has been a lot of emphasis placed in this debate on our country having one of the worst housing records in Europen, arising out of figures formulated by a UN journal.  I think it only fair <Col N="265" /> to analyse the figures presented by this journal.  The journal quoted is not being entirely fair to our country.  The figures arrived at are on a unit basis, rather than on a single dwellinghouse basis: to put it another way&mdash;on a flat complex basis rather than on a single dwellinghouse basis.  After all, there is very little valid comparison between living in a flat and paying the rent and the eventual ownership of one's own house.  This is the point this UN journal missed.</P>
      <P>Deputy Hogan, I think, mentioned the February edition of the OECD <i>Observer</i>.  Again, the figures quoted in this journal were 3.2 units per 1,000 of the population in this country. This is also arrived at on a unit basis, rather than on a single dwellinghouse basis.  It would be helpful and desirable that the Department of Local Government should bring this point to the notice of the Secretariats of these very helpful and informative magazines when they come to formulate their comparisons in the future. For instance, can Ireland be compared with an economic giant like West Germany?  I do not think so&mdash; that is in relation to housing, of course.</P>
      <P>There are one or two points I should like to raise in relation to the constituency which I represent.  There are a few black spots in it, namely, the centre of Dún Laoghaire, Shankill and Sallynoggin. In the centre of Dún Laoghaire there are many Victorian and Edwardian dwellings in which families are living in the most appalling conditions. Having conducted a survey there myself only recently, I was astounded and, indeed, shocked, to see the conditions in which some of them live.  These people are paying rents to landlords which they would gladly pay to the State for the privilege of living in a local authority house.  I do not use the word &ldquo;privilege&rdquo; loosely, as some of these families are so desperate they would consider it a privilege rather than their entitlement to live in a proper house or flat with its attendant dignity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, in the Shankill area, there is <Col N="266" /> one estate in particular where families are living chock-a-block in rooms fit for only two or three persons.  I also noticed three cases of families living in outhouses at the back of those houses I have already mentioned. Shocking! On this point, the Department of Local Government should ensure that those people living in the Shankill area should have priority in respect of a first-class new estate which is now being erected there.  It will be completed by September or October. But I would appeal again to the Department to ensure that the people living in this area are given priority in respect of this new Shankill estate.</P>
    <P>The housing programme has gained speed and the Minister has a lot to be proud of.  These points I bring by way of observation and not with any particular desire to criticise.  The system of grants is dealt with extensively in the new Bill.  One hopes that in the future when young married couples are purchasing their own houses with local authority loans some of these grants they receive will go towards the cost of lowering the interest on the loan or, indeed, in the future&mdash;in the distant future&mdash;towards the giving of interest-free loans.  I relate this particularly to section 15 of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Those grants are the same grants as were there in 1948.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>My point is that some of those grants should go towards reducing the interest on the loans, or the total abolition of the interest payable on the loan.  Maybe I did not make that point clear in the first instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another point I should like to mention before I conclude, that is, that the Department of Local Government should issue a directive to local authorities to give all those people who seek a housing application from, in the first instance, a pamphlet setting out clearly how they fit into the statutory requirements in respect of housing priorities.  This would give everyone so applying a clear indication as to when they could hope for a house.  It should also give people some idea of the <Col N="267" /> housing programme in the area.  This most important leaflet or pamphlet would leave no one in any doubt. Doubt in respect of housing leads to speculation of an uninformed nature, leads to anxiety in most cases and, in other cases, to ill health.</P>
    <P>Finally, the housing panel.  This is the panel on which names are entered in order of priority.  Could there not be two panels open to public scrutiny: the first panel on which the person's name is entered at the moment of application and the second panel to which such a person's name is transferred in order of statutory priority? This second panel would have opposite such a person's name the reason for its being transferred to it, stated clearly and plainly without any legal jargon. The position at the moment is that people seeking local authority houses are convinced that public representatives, councillors and Deputies, can pull a house out of a hat for them. If they are told clearly by a process of communication that when they fulfil various requirements, then and only then will they be considered for housing, it would do away once and for all with the idea, a fraudulent one on the people, that councillors or Deputies have pull in respect of housing.  It is my hope it is not the case.</P>

      <P>There is one important function that councillors and TDs have to perform in respect of <Col N="268" /> the allocation of houses.  It is to ensure their constituents get fair play. I am sure even Deputy Treacy will agree with this pure sentiment.  It might also bring an end to the practice of some representatives writing to recipients of houses, on the publication of the panel, congratulating them on their success.  We all know that when public representatives receive the housing panel, their first urge is to take out pen and paper and write to those fortunate enough&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to involve myself in this interchange. I should like to make a few remarks about the situation in my constituency, particularly in relation to the operation of section 5 in regard to essential repairs to houses.  Last year, during a similar debate, I asked the Minister to consider paying such grants on certificates of payment which the Department received from the engineers inspecting the work on behalf of the local authority.  In the interval, that has not been happening.  Perhaps I did not make the case clear enough and I shall try to make it clearer now.</P>
      <P>For instance, John Brown applies for a grant under section 5 of the Housing Act.  His application is filled by the local authority and if ultimately reaches the Department.  The local authority send out an inspector to examine the work and on his report decide it is suitable for a grant.  Up to that stage it has been accepted by the Department.  The person proceeds with the work and when it is completed, the local authority engineer goes out and inspects the house.  He decides the work is sufficient to qualify for the grant and he issues a certificate of payment to the local authority.  About a year ago Leitrim County Council passed a resolution asking the county manager to pay on the council engineer's certificate because the delays in payments coming back from the Department were desperate.  When the council's certificate for payment goes to the Department, there seems to be no money there with which to pay the grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Heretofore we had to wait until the Department paid us before we could pay the person concerned.  All of the people using the benefits of section 5 for new houses or for reconstruction are poor people who cannot afford to wait.  Many of them are married men with families living on small farms; some of them old people.  At the moment they cannot get credit from local contractors or from builders' providers because they, in turn, cannot get credit from the banks.  If this scheme is to be as successful as we <Col N="270" /> should like it to be, we must insist that the Department speed up payment of such grants.  On the score of the circumstances of people availing of such grants, the Minister might make recommendations to the valuation people not to increase the valuation of houses after reconstruction in this way. The people concerned are poor.</P>
    <P>Another matter I should draw the Minister's attention to in this respect is the size of the grants.  They have not been increased since 1948 and we all know the increases there have been in building costs in the meantime.  I appeal to the Minister to have another look at this matter with a view to increasing the reconstruction grants. On the question of building new houses, I doubt if any new houses have been built in my constituency during the past few years.  In this matter I do not know if the Department of Local Government are entirely to blame.  I think a certain amount of blame attaches to county managers who, I suggest, should examine their consciences. The Minister would know more about this than I do.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with Deputy Clinton that we should take money from roads, particularly from by-roads, in order to continue our housing programme.  That might suit him, coming from County Dublin, but if he lived in a county where only 25 per cent of the roads are blacktopped, he would think differently.</P>
    <P>The payment of grants generally is being delayed, more so for the past year or year and a half than hereto-fore. It is not unusual nowadays to find a grant being held up by an inspector just because a door has not been painted, because a pane of glass in a window is broken or for some other such trivial reason.  That is not being fair.  If the Department are so hard up financially they should convey to the applicant that they will pay him when the money comes to hand rather than having him putting in the pane of glass or painting the door and then having to notify the Department again.  In that way the whole vicious circle begins again and <Col N="271" /> can mean a waiting period of from four to six weeks.</P>
    <P>Another problem is this.  Very often in an area where new houses are being built, application is made to the Department for a group water scheme.  Yet, when it comes to paying the grant for a house, the Department pay only the grant for an unserviced house.  I had a case recently where a man installed a bathroom with all the fittings, but was paid only the grant for an unserviced house.  Anybody who completes a house to that extent is certainly entitled to be paid the grant for a fully serviced house.  He has bought the goods and all he requires is the water.  He may get a temporary supply that would not be suitable.  But he has committed himself to the contractor and the builder's provider and has paid for these goods. If he has not paid, the contractor and the builder's provider are waiting for the money.</P>
    <P>I have seen this work in reverse. Within the past six months a person in my constituency decided to build an unserviced house.  He made application to the Department but was refused the grant for an unserviced house.  He discussed the matter with me.  I told him I did not think it was fair, but I asked him why he would not build a fully serviced house.  The reason he gave was sensible.  He said he had sufficient to build an unserviced house and that he had nobody else living with him; but the Department would not give him the grant. Yet, When a house is completed with bathroom and fittings, they pay only the grant for an unserviced house. That indicates clearly that the where-withal is not there to pay.  If the Department told the people the exact position and when they would be paid, it would not be too bad, but to hold the matter up and deprive people of grants is not fair.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the position of vacant vested cottages.  These cottages had been occupied by people who now have emigrated but are still paying the rent.  Some of them have been vacant for three or four years. Neither the local authority nor the Department, as far as I know, have <Col N="272" /> any power to take over these cottages. The Minister should either take power to himself or give it to local authorities to deal with this problem.  It is most unfair to see houses built with the aid of grants from the Department and the ratepayers not being made use of.</P>
    <P>Another problem concerns the purchase of vested cottages.  I admit it is probably more prevalent in my constituency than others, because a number of our people are compelled either to emigrate or migrate within the county.  Some of these people whose cottages have been vested are compelled for financial or other reasons to emigrate and they offer the cottage for sale.  The Labourers Acts are so wide that most people come within their scope.  I had a case recently where a married man with a wife and four children, was working in a particular place.  There was also a single man working in the same place.  Both were in receipt of about the same wage. The married man wanted a house very badly but all he could afford to pay was £200.  The unmarried fellow paid £400 and succeeded in getting the house.</P>
    <P>The Minister should do something about this problem.  He might say there is no reason why the married man could not get an SDA loan from the local authority.  However, I happen to live in a county council area where the county manager decides that John Brown is not so creditworthy and asks him to get two sureties.  John Brown is unable to get the sureties and the manager decides he will not give him the capital he has applied for.  I pleaded with the Minister before, and I do so again, to give a direction to county managers on this matter.  Not all of them carry on this business of looking for sureties, but a few of them do.  What better surety can they get than the deeds of the house for which the person is applying?</P>

      <P>At the outset, I am sorry Deputy Andrews is not here.  I do not know if he is a member of a local authority.  I am not, and I am given to understand he is not either. I do not think it was fair or correct <Col N="273" /> of him to impute to members of local authorities the type of allegation he made in respect of them here this evening.  When challenged in this respect, he did not substantiate his allegation. The House is the place to substantiate these matters.</P>
      <P>As far as my own local authority are concerned, I am aware that the members make representation to the executive, the manager.  I am also aware that it is in the light of the specific recommendations of the county medical authorities in regard to the conditions in which people live that the manager discharges his function in this matter.  I have no reason to think that what Deputy Andrews said here&mdash; that members use their influence and claim credit for themselves for obtaining favours for housing applicants&mdash;is widespread.  I do not know.  But it is unfair to publicly impute to members of local authorities, who are giving their time to these problems, the type of motive the Deputy imputed here this evening.</P>
      <P>In regard to the Bill, there is a matter to which I should like to draw the attention of the Minister in public. Deputy Clinton and I have already spoken to him on it.  It concerns a procedure which we feel would be useful in speeding up the provision of houses where local authorities are concerned. This consists of the bypassing of the present procedure whereby the local authority have to obtain possession of land by means of a compulsory purchase order, if they are unable to obtain it simply by agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is very well aware that the procedure of a compulsory purchase order is adopted (1)  where the landowner is not prepared to dispose of land for housing purposes by agreement; (2)  where there are title difficulties in regard to the land being acquired; and (3)  where agreement cannot be reached on compensation. Having thought about this, we feel it would be an improvement on the situation if, where a landowner is prepared to dispose of his land, he agrees to give it to the local authority for housing purposes and the only <Col N="274" /> question at that stage is the price the authority are to pay for the land. Where there is agreement on this issue, the Minister ought to be able to do in the first instance what he would do in the last instance when a compulsory purchase order is made: in other words, he would appoint an official arbitrator to decide a fair price for the land.</P>
    <P>The position at present in regard to compulsory purchase orders is that we have the procedure whereby there must be advertisement of the council's intention to acquire the land by proceedings. This requires notification in the papers and a time lapse between notifications.  That, of itself, is perhaps no great drawback.  I am sure the Minister is aware that the procedures councils adopt at that stage have been invalidated by reason of defect in the drawing up of the compulsory purchase order by the local authority due either to faulty mapping or to the documents they are required to prepare on this matter.</P>
    <P>Having been informed by the local authority that they propose to acquire land and that the landowner is willing to dispose of it but that there is disagreement on price, we suggest that the Minister be empowered, at that stage, to take the procedure which he finally takes under the compulsory purchase order machinery and which is enshrined in the Third Schedule to this measure &mdash;in this case, in section 5 (2).  This procedure, if adopted by the Minister in the first instance, could be helpful in speeding up the process and in avoiding unnecessary delays.  For that reason, we decided that it would be a useful thing for the Minister to do.</P>
    <P>There is a precedent, I think, in section 9 of the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act, 1957.  A person, who has applied to the local authority for a loan and who is aggrieved by the amount of loan awarded to him, has the opportunity of appealing to the Commissioner of Valuation and he may recommend an altered valuation which may or may not be accepted by the local authority.  Having decided that this is a type of precedent which the Minister could use in this measure to short circuit delay and the risk sometimes of a compulsory <Col N="275" /> purchase order being voided by reason of one of the defects which I have mentioned, I would hope he might give some further attention to this aspect of the matter.  It would be appreciated if the Minister, when replying to the debate on this Bill and to our motion, would refer to this matter and perhaps tell the House the reasons why he thinks it better he should follow the procedures laid down in this Bill rather than the type of procedure adopted by way of ministerial amendment.  Perhaps, before taking this Bill to the Seanad, the Minister would have another look at it to see if this suggestion is not worth adopting.</P>
    <P>The debate on this Bill is now nearing its conclusion in this House.  It is a Bill which consolidates all the housing legislation up to this.  It is a long Bill and it has been dealt with here at great length.  Speaking for this side of the House, I am sure we hope that the effect of the discussion here, and the Bill which has resulted from it, will be of great use in the speeding-up of the solution of problems in regard to housing, particularly at local authority level.  The wording of our motion refers to the decline in house-building, the consequences that stem from that and the provision of finance to make a housing drive effective and then the steps which could be taken to deal with the situation.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been hearing at length about the decline in house-building. As the Parliamentary Secretary said last night, if there is less money at the present time, there must be less housing, although he pointed out that there would be more money in the coming year.  However, I think the effective point is that the cost of building has gone up so much that the provision of extra money does not automatically ensure that houses will be available to people, in proportion. Some years ago, a housing survey was mentioned.  The Minister said he had instructed the local authorities to carry out a survey and I should like to know if it is complete and accurate. Up to quite recently, the local authority in my county has been issuing notices from time to time in the <Col N="276" /> local newspapers asking for details from people in various areas who require housing.  These details are still flowing in to the local authority indicating in some places more and in other places less than might be anticipated in regard to a need for more housing.</P>
    <P>It is not yet possible to state the total housing needs but certain it is that local authorities have a formidable programme which would require comprehensive and phased planning. This, of course, presupposes that all the initial work that is required has been done or can be done.  For instance, sites must be available.  I do not know what the position generally in the country is, but in my constituency the local authority finds it extremely difficult in places to obtain sites convenient to existing services.  That is a matter that requires careful planning. In the past, where water and sanitary services were made available, particularly in the case of villages, they were installed on a rather confined basis and without regard to future requirements.  It is becoming increasingly evident that the need at present is to provide fully serviced homes. That means that the homes must be built in close proximity to existing services or in areas to which these services can be extended.</P>
    <P>One factor impeding progress is that a county manager, in supplying demands for the provision of water and sanitary services, may have to slow down the extensions necessary to enable building to take place.  I would hope that under the Town Planning Act now coming into operation more generally a clear indication will be given as to areas earmarked for dwellings as against industrial use so that the necessary extension of water and sanitary services will be undertaken in those areas.</P>
    <P>There is another matter in connection with which the Minister might use his good offices.  Employment grants are made available during the winter period.  These grants could be used for the purpose of development of building sites so that the sites would be capable of being used when the question of building arose.</P>
    <P>The financing of housing is a very <Col N="277" /> important matter.  Local authorities are anxiously awaiting an indication from the Minister&mdash;which I expect to hear from him when he is replying to the debate&mdash;as to the amounts that will be available to them to meet their housing requirements in the immediate future.  The Minister previously spoke of local authorities planning for anticipated needs, not for a period of a year but as discovered by the housing survey and making their financial arrangements on that basis.  Local authorities should have from the Minister a firm indication of the finances that will be available for this work.</P>
    <P>Reference was made here a short time ago to the fact that grants remain practically the same as they were.  The Minister must appreciate that building costs have increased.  If the amount of money available for housing is not sufficient to keep pace with increased costs will some consideration be given to the introduction of new systems of providing houses?  Would the Minister say if any thought has been given, for instance, to the new system building and as to whether its adoption would help to solve the problem?  It has been suggested that new techniques could be adopted in school building.  It is estimated by the engineers of the Office of Public Works that a prefabricated building could give from 50 to 80 years services and, in some cases, if properly treated, could last 100 years. The Minister should give very serious consideration to the question as to whether such methods could be adopted to deal with a housing problem in the case of a local authority that is in dire need.</P>
    <P>Despite the efforts which have been and are being made by local authorities to provide housing, there still obtain the problems which flow from bad housing conditions.  This has been a legacy down through the years, and there is now, urgent necessity to get rid of this festering canker in our social conditions.  This situation is particularly evident in some of our rural towns.  I have in mind those in which in the past housing was owned by foreign landlords.  Naturally enough, <Col N="278" /> they built these rather small houses. These passed in those days, but they would now be regarded as hovels. When a local authority goes in to deal with one of these in one particular town it is alleged that more favourable treatment is being given to one portion of the local authority area as against another.  I mentioned on an earlier occasion&mdash;I do not think there is any necessity to impress it on the Minister &mdash;that the conditions in which people live in these hovels is quite tragic.  It is something which always appals me. However, even in the building of our own houses, we are inclined to limit the amount of bedroom space.  This can lead to undesirable social conditions. I should hope one would not have to expatiate on these conditions in order to impress on the Minister the undesirability of the situation.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the Government to make provision in the forthcoming Budget for a substantial increase in personal and dependants income tax allowances as they bear no relation to the purposes for which they were originally intended.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night I was demonstrating the inadequacy of these allowances in present circumstances.  These allowances were last fixed in 1960. Originally, I believe income tax was intended to ensure that those who had a surplus after providing adequately for their own needs and those of their families would contribute portion of that surplus towards the upkeep of Stage services.  We seem to have gone a long way from that idea.  The Minister and the Government must recognise that it is a bit unfair, to put it mildly, that the single man should be taxed on anything he earns over and above £6 per week.  It would be valid for me to argue, I think, that rather than putting that person under an obligation to contribute to the running of State <Col N="279" /> services, the State and the community should be under an obligation to give that man a better income and a better standard of living.</P>
      <P>I do not think £312 free of tax is any longer real, particularly when one remembers that this amount was fixed in 1960.  If we have regard to the increase in the cost of living since 1960, this exemption level should be raised to something like £400.  These allowances have certainly not been adjusted side by side with the increase in the cost of living.  The average growth rate in the economy since 1960 has been four per cent.  This means an increase of 25 per cent over the period; in relation to that increase, the exemption level should be something in the region of £390.  It must be abundantly clear that £312 as an exemption level for a single man is a ludicrous figure.  The allowances for a married couple were fixed approximately six years ago.</P>
      <P>I want to give an example now of a single worker who is required to pay income tax.  Deputy Tully will correct me if I am wrong.  The average wage of a farm worker is £7 10s per week. He gets £390 per year.  When one takes the personal allowance, the earned income allowance, and makes a deduction of £20, say, for other allowances, such as working clothes and social welfare contributions, one finds that that worker is taxed on £38 per year.  If you make that figure £39, it means he is paying approximately £13 per year income tax.  Under PAYE, he pays every week out of his £7 10s five shillings income tax.  It is generally accepted in the House, certainly it is protested from the ranks of the Labour Party, that this average wage is too small, not perhaps so much for a single man as for a married man with family responsibilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think I need pursue the argument in respect of these allowances because all these arguments have been dealt with pretty fully in the report to which I referred last night.  That report, published in 1962, made very positive recommendations with regard to these allowances.  I do not know whether the Government have accepted these recommendations in principle or <Col N="280" /> accepted them in the hope that they may be implemented at some future date.  I think the time is past when these recommendations should be both accepted and implemented by the Minister for Finance and I hope that he will take steps to implement them in his forthcoming Budget.  Recommendation 36, which says that the personal allowance for a married man should be at least twice that for the unmarried, does not need any argument. It seems ludicrous that a man and his wife should have less by way of allowance than two single people living together.</P>
    <P>Our motion is in accord with the recommendations of the Commission. That Commission recognised that these allowances were unreal and unfair, particularly the allowances for the family man with children.  They recommended that these allowances be adjusted.</P>
    <P>I believe they should be adjusted in such manner that greater emphasis would be laid on those in the higher income groups and on the wealthier classes.  It has often been protested here by the Taoiseach that we have no people of real wealth in this country. A former Minister for Finance in the Fianna Fáil Government brought in regulations to allow the Revenue Commissioners to introduce tighter controls to prevent evasion and, above all, the avoidance of tax.  There are so many loopholes in the income tax code that there are some people who avoid rather than evade the payment of income tax, and do that within the law.  There are many examples of this, the expense account and so forth. On the other hand, we have the agricultural worker with £7. 10s. per week who cannot avoid the demand made on him and the payment of tax at the rate of 5/-per week.  We want to make sure now that the weight of taxation will not be as heavy on those with reduced incomes.  That was the viewpoint of those who made the recommendations in this report and I trust that not alone will the Minister accept the principle enshrined in our motion but that he will have due regard to the recommendations to which I have referred.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion. I should like to support it for reasons of simple justice.  I am not, unfortunately, a very eloquent speaker but this is a motion which speaks for itself. As the previous speaker has said, since the personal and dependants' allowances were last adjusted, the cost of living has risen by approximately one-third, and it is only simple justice that the income tax allowance be adjusted and brought up to date.  These allowances were, at any time, small enough but they have now become even more inadequate, due to the falling value of money over the past six years.  In order to give some effect to the purpose for which the allowances were intended, this motion should be accepted by the Minister.  We have here a new Minister for Finance.  This will be his first Budget.  I am ignoring last year's Finance Bill for which the present Minister cannot be blamed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>He was here last year but he did not prepare the Bill.  I am trying to be reasonable.  I do not believe in blaming somebody for what is not properly his responsibility.  The Minister was very skilful in defence of it but I am quite sure that in his heart he was not particularly anxious to claim credit for many of the provisions in it.  Now that we have a new Minister, I hope he will bring new thinking into the Department of Finance, that new ideas will be examined carefully, that old methods will not be preserved merely because they are there, that where a particular tax fails to give satisfaction, it will be reviewed and, if necessary, changed or abolished as the case might be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To given an example, I would refer to the question I put down to the Minister the other day in relation to the PAYE system and State employees. As I said to the Minister, the system of tax collection in respect of State employees does not operate satisfactorily from anybody's point of view.  I receive a constant flow of letters complaining about this and asking can anything be done about it.  There does not seem to <Col N="282" /> be any reason why State employees should be treated differently from anybody else in the State.  The answer the Minister gave was that that was the rule and he did not see any reason to change it.  That is not a reason; it is not even a good excuse, and the people who are being taxed in this manner are dissatisfied.  The Revenue section are not even collecting the money as quickly as they would if these people were taxed under the normal PAYE method which applies in private industry.  That is one example of a system that should be changed.  However, the Department of Finance, in the rather stodgy fashion in which they are inclined to move, are holding on to this system merely because they are unwilling to make a change or because they are indifferent to the position.  I am hopeful that the new Minister will approach these problems with a fresh mind and with a greater willingness to make changes where changes are necessary.</P>
    <P>Increasing income tax allowances is not what one would describe as a new idea, but it is a step in the right direction. What I should really like to see is an examination of the whole income tax position on the basis of cost effectiveness. There are many thousands of people who are paying relatively unimportant amounts in income tax, and the administrative cost of collecting these amounts of money must far outweigh whatever benefit they bring into the Department.  In my view, it is a waste of effort and of money.  I should like to see a more realistic examination of the income tax position, preferably by an outside authority not cluttered up with official thinking, a body who would arrive at a realistic figure at which it pays to collect income tax.  I would say the figure would be in the region of £500 or £600, and that the people who are paying tax below that are not worth bothering about.  What we would save in administration would more than offset what is lost in tax. There would be a benefit to the economy; this extra money would be in circulation, and there would be other methods by which the Minister <Col N="283" /> could collect it.  There is far too much effort being put into collecting small sums of money by the income tax people, and this is purely tax for the sake of tax.  Taxing a man purely for the sake of collecting the money is not only bad economics but bad politics as well.  I hope the Minister will bear this in mind in the forthcoming Budget.</P>
    <P>I am not sure if the figure is correct, but I understand that 75 per cent of the income tax is paid by about 25 per cent of the people contributing, and that the balance of 25 per cent is collected from the vast bulk of 75 per cent of the people.  We could improve that position without a great deal of effort, simply by raising the allowances and permitting the smaller fish to escape through the net.</P>
    <P>There is one other idea I should like to put to the Minister.  Since the family is the unit on which this State is founded, the family must necessarily be the prime consideration.  I am not trying to suggest that single people are of no consequence or unimportant but, generally speaking, the most important part of a person's life is the time when he is or ought to be married.  It is to assist people towards marriage that I make this suggestion. The cost of getting married today, with the price of houses, the price of furniture and the cost of living generally, is so expensive that people saving to get married, taking the past two years into account, are lucky if the sum of money they have is worth as much today as it was two years ago.  If they are to increase their savings, they must be given some assistance.</P>
    <P>What I suggest is that when a person gets married he should be given an income tax rebate for the two years previous to his marriage, not at the single rate but at the married rate; in other words, when he gets married, he sends in his marriage certificate to the Department and claims for the previous two years.  The amount involved in this would be only £160.  This is not a fortune but to a person trying to set up a home, it would be a considerable help.  This would have a beneficial effect on the whole economy.  It <Col N="284" /> would encourage more marriages and earlier marriages.</P>
    <P>Most people getting married think of the major items; they do not take into consideration the smaller items, but these small items which they overlook are the things which give the headaches in the first few years of marriage.  This tax rebate would help where it is most needed; it would help people to start off married life and make some provision for the starting of a home.  This is one aspect of what I mean by fresh thinking by the Department and I should like to see the Minister make a move in this direction and not merely follow the routine tax code which we have had and make no effort to change it.</P>
    <P>The income tax allowances themselves are, as have been demonstrated, inadequate.  There is an overwhelming case for increasing them; indeed I should be interested to see if the Minister even attempted to defend the present allowances.  I should like to mention particularly the dependant's allowance which is merely £60 per year.  If a child's allowance is £120, it seems utterly inadequate that a dependant's allowance should be £60 a year.  The cost of keeping an adult is in many cases, particularly an elderly adult getting medical attention or help, far greater than the cost of keeping a child and to give £60, in that case is utterly inadequate.  No case can possibly be made for it.</P>
    <P>I know that other members wish to speak and as we are anxious to conclude this debate tonight, I do not intend to pursue the argument any further. I do not think it is necessary.  If the Minister is in any way reasonable and fair, he has ample opportunity to demonstrate the fact on this motion. I feel he must accept the motion and make the recommendations we suggest in the forthcoming Budget.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to support the motion and also to advert to Motion No. 16 on the Order Paper, the terms of which I understand are being considered in conjunction with it, although separate decisions may be necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of both motions is to secure a review of the position concerning <Col N="285" /> income tax allowances in advance of the Budget.  This matter has been discussed on many occasions and normally it is discussed each year either during the Budget debate or in the subsequent Finance Bill debate. On this occasion the motions have been put down prior to the Budget rather than by way of amendment to the Finance Bill or for discussion in the Budget debate, in order to get the matter considered in advance.  I believe there is general acceptance of the view that the drop in the value of money and the general increase in prices have very seriously affected the benefits which should be available in respect of the personal allowance, the married allowance and the children's allowance and also the dependant relative allowances.  It is some time since any worthwhile changes were made in these allowances and there has been a very substantial increase in the cost of living.</P>
    <P>In particular, I want to direct attention not only to the position of married persons and those who are employed and in receipt of wages and salaries &mdash;in their case they probably have received whatever wage and salary adjustments were made and although there has been no consequent adjustment in the allowances for income tax, to the extent that wages and salaries have been adjusted, they have benefited &mdash;but to the position of retired persons on fixed incomes.  The position regarding pensions is in the main unsatisfactory in that the pensions have always been based on pay at retirement, and while that was reasonably satisfactory when prices were static and the value of money remained constant, with the continuous drop in the value of money, that method of calculating pensions operates unfairly and inequitably to such an extent that over a number of years now, there have been a number of pension increase Acts and these pension increases are varied in amount and have always applied to a period which failed to compensate in time for the changes that occurred and did not apply so as to give those who retired at an earlier date the same rate of pension as persons similarly employed who retired more recently.</P>
    <P>Persons on pensions or dependent <Col N="286" /> on fixed incomes, say, from investments accumulated from past savings or some other fixed income have been very severely affected by the drop in the value of money and the fact that allowances in respect of income tax have not been increased.  I want to urge the Minister in framing the Budget to consider sympathetically the position of these categories.  In addition, I believe there is a very strong case for increasing both the personal allowance and the dependant relative allowance and the children's allowances.  These allowances were all framed at a time when the cost of living was lower and when the amount of money considered adequate or reasonable to cover the particular category concerned was much less than is needed today.</P>
    <P>In recent years in Britain an increase was granted and in general the amount allowed in respect of exemptions from tax was brought up in order to compensate for the drop in the value of money.  With very few exceptions, there has been no comparable change here and there is a very strong case in equity to increase these allowances, particularly in respect of those living on fixed incomes either from investment or pensions, or in the case of persons retired whether they are living on pensions or have some other income of a small amount from investments, or perhaps from the letting of a house or property of some sort.</P>
    <P>The question of children's allowances is also important.  The actual children's allowance under the social welfare code was increased but that allowance is payable to certain categories, some of whom benefit because they are not liable to tax in respect of it, while others who receive the children's allowances are liable to income tax and in many cases the actual increases are of virtually no benefit to them because of the fact that the relief in respect of income tax was not altered.</P>
    <P>The two motions on the Order Paper were put down specifically for the purpose of drawing the attention of the Minister and the Government to this problem.  No category in the community has been so severely affected by the rise in the cost of living, in the widest sense of that term, and the drop in the value of money, as retired persons <Col N="287" /> and persons living on fixed incomes.  Over and above that, a number of people who are self-employed, people on the lower scale, who are within the income tax code, with responsibility for educating children or for providing the ordinary needs of their families, find that rising costs and rising charges which they have to meet, either in respect of education or in respect of ordinary house-hold outgoings, are all pressing more severely on them now, with the drop in the value of money and the rise in charges, than they did previously. Faced with that situation, they find that there has been no worthwhile change in income tax reliefs in recent Budgets.  The changes last year in respect of certain pensions and allowances were strictly confined to those coming within the social welfare category. There is a very strong case for granting relief in respect of income tax.</P>
    <P>Another problem adverted to, not directly contained in these motions although contained by implication, is the question of allowing medical expenses, properly incurred, as an appropriate deduction in respect of income tax.  This matter has been the subject of consideration here and there is no doubt that there is a very strong case for it.  Both the Minister and his predecessors expressed sympathy with that point of view in the course of recent Budget and Finance Bill debates.  The fact that Ministers recognise the strong case that has been made, the justice of the case, and the reasonableness of the proposal, indicates that there is a general recognition both in the Government as well as in the Opposition that some action should be taken.  This discussion now focuses attention on the gravity of the problem in advance of the Budget.</P>
    <P>I suppose the Minister for Finance at Budget time has always to balance one item of expenditure, or one measure of relief, against another, but, as I said, no section of the community has been so severely affected by the rise in prices as retired personnel and those living on fixed incomes, in addition to those who, because their income <Col N="288" /> is known and is capable of careful assessment, either under PAYE or generally under the income tax code, pay a full and adequate share of the tax burden.  Similarly, self-employed people on small incomes who are unable, because of the nature of their business, to compensate themselves for a rise in prices, who for one reason or another are not able to pass on the full increase which would be warranted to compensate for the drop in the value of money, deserve consideration.  Their claim for a reasonable share of whatever reliefs are possible in the Budget is overwhelmingly strong.  Many years ago when the Commission on Income Taxation considered this problem, this matter was considered as one which required action and certain recommendations were made in regard to it. So far I think it is correct to say very few of those recommendations have been implemented, and certainly not implemented to the extent necessary.</P>
    <P>I understand that there is agreement to finish this debate this evening at 7.30 and consequently those who wish to contribute have to be reasonably brief, but I want to urge the Government and the Minister to consider this matter sympathetically.  I want to express the view that there would be support for any relief measures designed to alleviate the difficult problem created for income tax payers particularly in respect of the personal and dependant's income allowances, as well as the married allowance and the children's allowance.  I would ask that practical proposals be introduced to ease some of the problems and to lighten, in so far as we can, the burdens which so many people have to bear because no adequate recognition has been shown in recent budgetary reliefs of the change in the value of money and the fact that these changes have not been allowed for in revising the rate of allowances for income tax purposes.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> It has been said that the standard rate of income tax has not been increased for some years.  That may be strictly correct in so far as the rate has not been increased, but the impact of income tax on taxpayers has been increased because there has been no increase whatever in personal allowances either for married people or single people, or in the children's allowance, since 1960 at least.  Since then, the cost of living has been increasing rapidly.  The value of the children's allowance at £120 is not worth nearly what it was and neither is the married allowance of £394.  Presumably when these figures were fixed, they were meant to be sufficient to permit married couples to have a frugal standard of living and the children's allowance was intended to be sufficient to support a child.  However, all that has changed. The value of money has drastically changed and I suggest to the Minister that an allowance of £394 for a married couple is entirely inadequate.</P>
      <P>I make the same case in regard to the £120 for the children's allowance and the same case for the single person's allowance.  Has the Minister considered, for example, by how much the school fees for secondary schools have increased since the children's allowance was fixed at £120?  I would venture to suggest to the Minister that school fees have gone up on at least two, and probably three, occasions since the allowance was fixed at £120. I can also tell the Minister that most secondary schools are threatening a further increase this year.  Therefore, I say there is an unanswerable case to be made in respect of the children's allowances, the married allowance as well as the single person's allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave also made a plea on behalf of retired people.  Here, again, the Government are attacking the income and assets of retired people in two ways.  I have a case of a person who retired a short time ago.  He invested £1,100 in six per cent Exchequer stock, 1985 to 1990.  That was in November, 1964.  The £1,100 worth of stock cost him £1,083 10s.  Since then the value of that stock has fallen to <Col N="291" /> £1,024, through Government action, because, in order to get money, the Government have had to introduce loans at a higher rate thereby depressing and devaluing this man's capital which he invested to keep him for the rest of his life.</P>
    <P>At the same time, the personal allowance for income tax in respect of this man is permitted to remain at the same rate.  Therefore, the Government are attacking this retired person in two ways.  They are devaluing his capital.  Although he invested it in Government loans the value of it has gone down.  On the other hand, he has not, in recent years, been given any increase in his tax free allowance. That is not fair; it is unjust.  If the Minister gives any thought to the problems confronting both married people, who are trying to educate children and give them secondary education and retired people, who are trying to keep body and soul together on a small fixed income, he will agree that there is an unanswerable case to be made for giving relief to those people at once.  I know there are other Deputies, who have put their names to the Fine Gael motion, who wish to speak and I do not wish to take up the time of the House any longer.  In fact, I do not think it is necessary.  The case is there and the Minister cannot really refuse the case that can be made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Corish has suggested, there are scores of deputations at this stage of the year who are traditionally seen by the Minister for Finance.  Each of them puts forward points of view that certain taxation should get relief.  They make those pleas, strictly from their own point of view, of course and do <Col N="292" /> not care what other taxation is imposed in order to secure that relief. With such deputations as I have had in this debate, I find myself inhibited in that I cannot indicate to the House, to any extent, what my intentions are in relation to the Budget.  To do so would indicate some degree of disclosure for which I would be strongly criticised.  Perhaps the criticism might lead to something in the nature of what happened to other people in my position in other countries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not.  What I propose to say, as a result of the position I find myself in, will be purely factual and in no way will I be arguing for or against either motion or the spirit of either motion.  I hope, for that reason, that it will be understood that whatever figures I use will only be factual and they will not indicate my mind in any way.  It is unfortunate that the procedure has now developed which puts the Minister for Finance in this position because, as the House is aware, if a question were asked at this stage, or early in the year, as to whether the Minister would give any of the reliefs proposed in those motions the answer to such Parliamentary questions would be that it was not my intention to disclose my budgetary proposals at that stage.</P>
      <P>However, as I said, I can only be factual and I can, in no way, indicate what my mind is.  Naturally, every Minister for Finance is impressed by arguments in favour of taxation relief and every Minister for Finance, I am sure, will say that the form of relief proposed is something he would dearly like to concede but that he has to have regard to budgetary considerations. In other words, where else would he get the money?  This is the stock reply to such an argument during the course of the Budget Resolutions or the debate on the Finance Bill that follows.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me come to what I said will be the purely factual part of my speech. I realise that there are many others who wish to speak and, therefore, I will <Col N="293" /> be as brief as I can.  The existing scheme of personal allowances achieves two purposes mainly.  In the first place, the personal allowance, augmented by the earned income relief, determines the effective exemption limits for the various broad categories of taxpayers with wholly earned income.  The effective exemptions in force at the present time are £312 for a single person, as Deputy Corish pointed out.  For a married couple the allowance is £525; for a married couple with one child, it is £685, and for a married couple with three children, it is £1,005.  In other words, any person in those categories who earns those amounts or less is not liable at all for income tax.  This system provides an automatic form of tax graduation which rises more steeply when the taxpayer passes into the surcharge stage, which, in our country, is £2,500.  That is when his income, after deducting allowances and reliefs, exceeds £2,500.</P>
    <P>A person's effective rate of tax, by virtue of this graduation, that is, the rate which is got by dividing the total amount of tax for which he is liable by his total income, rises gradually from a fraction of a penny in the pound to a rate, which in the case of the highest incomes, approaches the maximum combined rate of income tax and surtax, which is 13/10d, in the pound.  The personal allowances and reliefs secure that, in this graduation, account is taken of the different personal circumstances of various categories of taxpayers.  Therefore, in a given case the appropriate aggregate allowances determine the effective point at which liability to tax commences. They also achieve the result that the effective rate of tax varies upwards as income rises above the point of commencement of tax liability. It should be emphasised that the exemption limits for the various categories of taxpayers do not represent amounts above which income is confiscated. The amounts from there on are taxed at, as I said, graduated rates or points.  They are, in effect, tax-free margins, in excess of which income is <Col N="294" /> taxed at such a rate as gives varying effective rates of tax on the total incomes of different individuals.</P>
    <P>It is suggested that the rates in operation, to which I have referred, may be regarded as subsistence rates below which tax ought not to be collected from an individual.  I do not think it was ever consciously decided that these rates of relief were to be regarded as subsistence levels. But, nevertheless-as Deputy Corish pointed out&mdash;there was in the Seventh Report of the Commission on Income Taxation a recommendation to the effect that the principle should be recognised that income tax should not be payable on the income needed for minimum subsistence.  Deputy Corish said the Government ought to indicate their views on that.  Of course, the Government have done so&mdash;in the second White Paper on Direct Taxation, paragraph 28 of which says:</P>
    <P>It has always been recognised that income tax should not be payable on the income needed for minimum subsistence.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it is.  Again, I want to say I am not arguing; I am trying to be factual.  It should be emphasised that, while these rates may remain static, nevertheless there has been a gradual increase in the incomes of people generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The suggestion has been made that income tax allowances have not risen in line with the cost of living over a number of years.  Let us take 1938 as a year for which we can give rates of tax in relation to certain income, at the same time giving a reasonable spread of time, to indicate whether, in effect, people are better or worse off as a result of income taxation.  It must be emphasised that in the meantime, too, for many categories of taxpayers there are certain social benefits which were not in existence in the pre-1938 days which are, in income tax jargon, described as social transfer payments; for example, children's allowances as such.  These must be taken into account as well when one is assessing the <Col N="295" /> actuarial effect of income tax in relation to tax-free allowances.</P>
    <P>I think it can be demonstrated that the increases in over-all income of the average industrial worker in relation to the amount of tax he pays leave him much better off as of now than he was, say, in 1938.  If I take the index of average weekly workers in industries producing transportable goods as a guide, I can demonstrate here that there is this definite increase.  The increase in remuneration for industrial workers, if I take October 1938 to equal 100, was about 379 per cent, as compared with a rise in the cost of living&mdash;again as measured by the cost-of-living index&mdash;of about 228 per cent, that is, over about the same period.</P>
    <P>On the basis of this increase in income of about 379 per cent, I can indicate here how workers in certain average categories are better off.  In 1938-39, a single person earning £150 paid no tax.  The equivalent net income, at 1965 prices, would be £492.  A married man earning, say, £200 in 1938-39 would pay no tax and his equivalent net income, at 1965 prices, would be £656.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1938-39 a married man with two children earning £450 would pay £3 tax and, at 1965 prices, the equivalent net income, after tax, would be £1,467.  Take a single person at the present time earning £718: his tax would be £96, leaving him a net income, after tax, of £622.  A married man earning £957 would pay £102, leaving him a net income of £855.  A married man with two children earning £2,154 now would pay £323 tax, leaving him a net income, after payment of tax, of £1,831.  It will be seen from these figures that, by and large, even if the allowances have not altered over a period, the ordinary workers&mdash;and I <Col N="296" /> am sure these figures will be within the categories of what Deputies would regard as ordinary workers&mdash;are better off taxwise than they were over 25 years ago.</P>
      <P>Another useful comparison would be, of course, the rates in Ireland for the average person compared with the rates in England.  I think we can say that, up to a certain point somewhere between an income of £3,000 and £4,000 a year, the Irish person in every category, the single person, the married person and the married person with children, is better off up to that stage.  For instance, the single person earning up to £312 pays nothing.  In Britain he pays £2 13s. 4d.  I do not wish to go through a litany, but a single person earning £500 pays £44 in Ireland against £40 in Britain.  A single man earning £1,000 pays £163 in Ireland as against £186 in Britain, and so on until we reach the level of £3,000 to £4,000.  At £4,000, the rate in Britain is lower by reason of earned income applying to surtax rates.  They give roughly similar figures for a married man with two children.  At £1,000, he pays £36 here and in Britain, he pays £52.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>One must take the total obligation of the tax not only in relation to the standard rate but to the allowances as well.  It is only fair to indicate that taking the standard rate with the allowances, the average Irish single person and the average man with a wife is better off in the ordinary categories&mdash;the vast majority of people are better off taxwise here than in Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave mentioned retired persons on fixed incomes.  Of course they have a problem in that the salaries on which they retired were lower than the salaries at which a man in the same position would retire in later years.  There has been an attempt to bring these rates up, but nevertheless it remains difficult to bring them <Col N="297" /> up to rates equivalent to those enjoyed by men retiring now.  Even in these cases, pensions paid to retired persons are regarded as deferred income and they enjoy earned income allowances as well as personal allowances.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave mentioned medical expenses.  That is outside the motion. It is a matter that crops up during the debate on the Finance Bill.  It is not something to which I should refer now, the time being limited.  Deputy Corish mentioned two areas in which the Income Tax Commission made some recommendation&mdash;one, that the personal allowance for married persons should be at least twice that for unmarried persons.  The Government have in the White Paper on Direct Taxation set out at paragraph 30 of Part III that the personal allowance for married persons is £394 and for un-married persons £234: £84 of the allowance is attributable to compensatory adjustment made on the introduction of PAYE.  It will be seen that married and single allowances revert to what they were in 1959-60, which represented a ratio of approximately two to one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not realise we would get into deep social, philosophical and personal problems, on all of which the Minister seems to have embarked in his closing remarks. Perhaps he did this as an avenue of escape from obvious objections to the present scale of allowances and to the fact that a person is paying tax on a larger proportion of his earnings than in 1939.  That is a development which has converted income tax from being a tax paid by people who could afford to pay it into a regressive tax which now lies on an increased proportion of our people irrespective of their capacity to pay it.  If this trend is not reversed by multiplying&mdash;I use the word in its strict mathematical sense &mdash;personal allowances, then we will have increasing regressive taxation in this country, which is contrary to what all progressive democracies are seeking to achieve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's figures are interesting and stimulating and we are grateful to him for producing them, but they cannot cloak the fact&mdash;indeed they disclose it to people who did not already know it&mdash;that a larger proportion of the people's income is now being taxed than heretofore.  Apart from that, standards have risen since 1939 and what are now regarded as the necessaries of a proper, full and adequate life, were considered luxuries in 1939. If our standards are to improve, if the money which people spend on worthwhile things is to increase, if we are to <Col N="299" /> provide the necessary stimulus for initiative, then we must multiply the personal allowances and that is what we in Fine Gael and our colleagues in the Labour Party are seeking in our respective motions.</P>
    <P>We appreciate the Minister's administrative difficulties in speaking about the matter a fortnight before the Budget but there does not lie upon us the same obligation of silence as that imposed on the Minister and we say that the Minister cannot expect people to restrain themselves in wage demands and salary and income demands if he fails to make their present pay packets capable of meeting their requirements. At present there is no doubt that people's pay packets are unable to meet their necessary family and medical requirements and the obligation which lies on them to look after elderly people.  It would go a long way to encouraging restraint in our community if the Minister were to take positive action at Governmental level and provide increases in personal allowances, marriage allowances and child allowances to compensate for the decline in the value of money and also to provide some means for people to obtain for themselves and their dependants some of the things which have now become very necessary if they are to achieve a full and adequate life in their time.</P>
    <P>I have no wish to go into details. The Minister has given some figures which speak for themselves.  I am sure there are other Deputies anxious to speak, and I will give way on that basis.  We will not thank the Minister if he increases these allowances in the Budget.  We think it is the very least he must do.  While we do not expect him today to say he is going to do the right thing, we are quite certain he will, or else he will have to face, personally, politically and nationally, very severe criticism.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. P. Byrne Mr. P. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make briefly this point in relation to what Deputy Cosgrave said earlier on and the Minister's remarks on it.  A widow who is dependent on an investment <Col N="300" /> income or a widow in receipt of an annuity does not receive an earned income allowance as distinct from a widow in receipt of a pension.  I formed the impression listening to the Minister he was under the impression that perhaps she did.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>No. I specifically mentioned people in receipt of a pension which was regarded as a deferred income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. P. Byrne Mr. P. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will appreciate there are widows, particularly of self-employed persons, usually professional persons, who may not receive a pension but who may have been provided with a source of income or annuity through insurance by her late husband.  Such a person, particularly if she has a large family, is harshly treated by the tax code at present.  I want the Minister to be quite clear what our mind is in this matter.</P>
      <P>There is one further point.  Any discussion of taxation of wage earners must advert to the vicious and restricted code of rules under which salary and wage earners are taxed.  It is an old maxim that equity is a stranger to income tax.  The Minister's predecessor was prepared to live with that.  I earnestly trust Deputy Lynch will be more open-minded and less conservative than his predecessor.  Wage and salary earners are viciously taxed in this country, but they constitute over 80 per cent of the total taxpayers.  In no part of our tax code is the British law we have taken over less suited to our conditions and our economy than the code of rules under which wage and salary earners are taxed.  As Deputy Ryan said, we are grateful to the Minister for the figures he produced. They established conclusively that, proportionately speaking and allowing for the decline in the value of money, the State is calling upon a certain type of person through PAYE to pay taxation, a type of person who would not have been called on in 1939.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1939 the personal allowance was £120.  It is now, in effect, £150, because I am leaving out of the <Col N="301" /> reckoning the rule bringing in other personal allowances to adjust for the reduced rate of relief which was done away with when PAYE was brought in.  The personal allowance for the single person increased by only 25 per cent since 1939.  But the £ of 1939 is worth in today's terms approximately 6/8d.  That cannot be got away from. In 1939 the child allowance was £60. It is the one allowance increased more generously than any other since 1939. It is now £120.  In terms of 1939 values, however, it should be £180.</P>

I should like the Minister to explain what effect a statement from him at this stage on the increase of income tax allowances would mean so far as the Budget speech is concerned.

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The biggest trouble under the existing arrangement is that a single farm worker with <Col N="302" /> £8. 5. 0. is taxed on everything over £6. 5. 0.  In effect, he pays tax on £2 of his earnings.  Does the Minister think that £6 per week is a living wage for a single man, or is this an attempt by the Government to try to prove that anything in excess of £6 is spent on luxuries and should be taxable? If not, what is the justification for it? Would the Minister say why somebody living 30 or 40 miles from Dublin, who gets up at 6.30 a.m., drives to work in Dublin as a builder's labourer and drives home again in the evening, who with three of his pals must pay for the tax and insurance of a car and pay for his meals while out, is not allowed anything in the way of tax-free allowances? Yet if one of those people used the car to travel a much shorter distance from one job to another, to do supervision or something like that, he could claim and get a tax-free allowance. Maybe the Minister might try to explain that?  If he cannot do it this evening, he may do it on Budget Day.</P>
      <P>The Minister gave me some figures which I corrected.  I have a very good authority for the figures I am giving: they were given by the Minister himself. The figures, which he gave me on 4th May, 1965, are to be found at columns 494, 495, 496, 497 and 498 of the Official Report of that day.  If the Minister takes the trouble to read them, he will realise the strength of the argument made here tonight and last night.  The figures show that a man who was earning £200 in 1938 would receive £608 today as its equivalent value.  In 1938, he would pay £4. 13. 9d. tax and today he would pay £14. 5s. tax.  The increase in his taxable income is 393 per cent and, at that time, he was paying 2.3 per cent of his income in income tax while he is now required to pay 11.6 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we go down to the other end of the scale, we find that a man earning £1,000 in 1938 would receive as its equivalent now a sum of £3,040.  In 1938-39 he would pay £156. 7. 6d. in income tax while today he would pay £475. 7. 7d. which is an increase of only 54 per cent.  He was then paying 15.6 per cent of his salary in <Col N="303" /> income tax and he is now paying 24 per cent.  Will the Minister try to explain why it was considered equitable to increase by more than five times the amount of taxation collected on the income of the man at the bottom of the scale while the man at the top of the scale has an increase of about 80 per cent?</P>
    <P>Take the position of the married man in the same situation.  For an income of £300 in 1938-39, he would receive an equivalent income now of £912.  He would then be paying £2 16 3d. and would now be paying £8 11s. which represents an increase of 974 per cent.  He would then be paying 0.9 per cent of his income and he is now required to pay 10.1 per cent.</P>
    <P>Let us go to the other end of the scale.  Take the man with £1,000 in 1938-39 who would now receive as its equivalent a sum of £3,040.  He would pay 13.4 per cent then and only 22.4 per cent now.  Therefore, it appears as if the man at the bottom of the scale, right along, is having more of his income taken away in income tax, for some extraordinary reason.  It carries on.</P>
    <P>Take a married man with two children who had an income of £500 in 1938-39 and who would receive now as its equivalent, an income of £1,520. He would be paying 1.7 per cent then, while he is now required to pay 10.5 per cent.  On the other hand, a man who had £1,000 in 1938-39 and who would now receive as its equivalent £3,040 was then paying 10.7 per cent and is now paying 19.9 per cent.  This pattern runs right through the whole thing.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister has taken the trouble to look at these figures or whether he believes it does not matter a whole lot that these people are not paying so much.  If he put himself in the position of some of these people who are trying to live, he might change his mind.  Take the case of a single man who has his sister or his mother housekeeping for him&mdash;quite a common thing in the country&mdash;who is not suffering from any disease, who is being treated as <Col N="304" /> a single person and is asked to pay income tax on £6 5s. 0d. per week.  I think the Minister will then realise that the whole situation is absolutely ridiculous and that no matter what else he does in the forthcoming Budget, the one thing he must do is to increase the allowance.</P>
    <P>From 1956-57 until 1959-60, the personal allowance for married people was £310.  In 1960-61 it was £394. Does the Minister consider that that was a fair increase?</P>
    <P>A single person received a personal allowance of £150 then while it is now £234.  Let me comment on the statement of Deputy Corish last night and again this afternoon that two brothers living together would have much more by way of personal allowance than a married person, even though what they are getting is ridiculously low.  However, if a man and a woman living together could prove they were not married they could draw much more than they would if they proved they were married.  That, also, is rather a stupid situation to have in a country such as this.</P>

      <P>The widow who had £175 in 1956-57 has £259 now. For children, a person received £100 then and £120 now.  Deputy Byrne made the comment that it was the only reasonable increase given.  I do not know whether Deputy Byrne is married.  I do not know whether he has schoolgoing children.  I do not know whether he has children going to secondary school or college.  If he has, I wonder what use an allowance of £120 would be.  He would soon realise that it was absolutely useless as an incentive to people to keep their children at school or to apprentice them to a trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the dependent relative, the allowance is now £60.  The £60 is of very great use to the Department of Social Welfare because when that Department give any kind of a pension which goes over £80, then no claim can be made.  The Minister puts the two together and asks what the person will do if he has an income of <Col N="305" /> £80.  What can the person buy with it? Of what use is it to somebody who is trying to keep a dependent relative?</P>
    <P>It seems that the whole situation, from start to finish, was thought up, dreamed up, by people who have no idea whatever of what the people with a low income have to cope with. I think that what is wrong with most of the things in this country is that those making the rules, in cases such as this, are people who never knew what it was to have to try to live on a very small income.</P>
    <P>Reference was made by Fine Gael Deputies to people on a fixed income and people on a small pension.  Is the Minister living in the clouds?  Does he not know that a person with a small income from an investment or even a pension finds it is not nearly enough on which to live at present and that to take income tax out of it is nothing short of criminal?</P>
    <P>Take the person who has an old age pension and who was drawing unemployment benefit for three or four years.  Such a person retires from his job and has a small pension.  He was drawing unemployment benefit between 65 and 70 years of age and that is free of tax.  When he reaches 70, he gets his old age pension and immediately becomes liable for income tax if he is single and has over £6 5s. a week. Surely the State is not so badly stuck for money, no matter how bad things may be at present, to have to take pennies from the pockets of those who can so ill afford it?</P>
    <P>The Minister says he must oppose the motion before the House.  He would do both the Government and himself a much better service if he would say here that he accepts the principles of <Col N="306" /> the motion, that he agrees that the present situation is unjust and unfair and that, if he possibly can, he will take the necessary steps to bring about an improvement in the situation when he introduces his Budget in a fortnight's time.</P>
    <P>The whole situation in regard to income tax seems to me to be a throw-back to the days when the people at the bottom had very little say as to the way the country was being run.  In one way, it is a reflection on themselves; it is a reflection on the working people who have not yet realised that, so long as they continue to elect to high office here people who do not appreciate their difficulties, so long will the situation continue that the shillings which they so badly need are taken out of their pockets for the purpose of holding two elections in one year or for the purpose of giving money away for things for which we believe it is not really needed.</P>

      <Col N="311" /> Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the adjournment of the debate, I was referring to the motion on housing which is before the House and to the necessity for an increase in building activity.  I inquired as to whether the housing survey has been completed or not.  I also referred to the difficulties in regard to site acquisition. I said I had hoped that planning in regard to this matter would undertake a reasonable assessment for some years ahead to enable the local authorities to deal with a programme of building which would be properly spaced and financed.  I was referring to the number of houses which could be provided by the finance made available. I pointed out that the extra money mentioned by the Parliamentary Secretary as being made available would be more than swallowed up in increased building costs. One of the things I suggested was the type of system-building which I understand will shortly be available.  In fact, I understand Cement Limited are already producing this type of unit in Limerick at present and perhaps these might be available.</P>
      <P>Would the Minister say whether the statistics we have in respect of private housing are reliable, financially or otherwise?  One of the valuable things we have at present is that people in houses capable of being repaired are assisted in carrying out reconstruction work.  An increase in the reconstruction grant would help further in this matter.  In some cases the local authorities bear portion of the cost, but the stress is always on the finances of the local authority.  There was this question of raising the ceiling of the income limit to enable more people to avail of these grants.  However, that imposed on local authorities the responsibility of making more money available. In this case the Minister should be able to come to the assistance of local authorities by making more available from central funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="312" /> Housing is admitted to be a social need and we should encourage people to put houses into a reasonable state of repair by helping them along.  In the main the people in that type of house are people unable to undertake the provision of a new house from their own resources.  Consequently, if they could be encouraged to repair their own houses in such a fashion that they would not be in need af a new house, it would be a most valuable step.</P>
    <P>We should encourage the provision of proper sanitation by making it attractive to people, through reconstruction grants, to provide these facilities. While the grant for the provision of sanitary facilities is very valuable, the amount is totally out of keeping with present-day costs.  There, again, the Minister might be able to do something about this.</P>
    <P>The Minister has heard a lot in regard to the payments of grants.  I do not propose to delay the House further, beyond saying to the Minister that I am sure he is aware that the payment of grants, both for new houses and for reconstruction, seems to have been delayed for various reasons.  This may be due to the fact that the inspection staff in his office are overburdened at present and unable to submit final reports.  However, one thing is certain. A great many people are annoyed that, having completed the work and having demands maade upon them for payment for materials provided, they are not in receipt of the grants as quickly as they expected.  Perhaps the Minister would say whether the work was expedited when previously local authority engineers were used for this purpose and whether their use at present would ensure decisions being given more quickly than at present?</P>
    <P>The other points have been discussed so often during the progress of the Bill and the various motions before the House that I do not feel there is any necessity to repeat them now.  We hope that this Bill will obviate the necessity in future for motions of the type we have down on the Order Paper <Col N="313" /> at present.  We hope it will remove the present inadequacy of housing.  We hope the Bill will result in local authorities making a firm assessment of their housing needs and having a planned programme in regard to the financing of their housing.  That having been done, we hope real progress will be made.  Nothing at any stage, either in the examination of plans and programming or the planning of the finances necessary, should be unduly delayed.  I would hope that with that type of procedure, those in need of houses who look to this Bill for the amelioration of their needs can face the future with confidence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Minister could honestly disagree with what is stated in this motion, namely:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann draws attention to the decline in the number of houses being built in recent years and to the serious consequences resulting from the current restriction on finance available for housing, and calls on the Government to take effective steps to ensure that the output of houses is immediately expanded and that the necessary finance is made available for this purpose.</P>
      <P>We know the present housing situation in the country is critical and is causing grave concern.  In Dublin city, with which I am quite familiar, the situation is that when a young couple marry, there is no chance whatever of their obtaining a house either privately or from Dublin Corporation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last week the Minister stated that the price of a house now would be £3,400 and that the deposit would generally be £600.  For a newly-married couple to try to pay a deposit of £600 is impracticable in the extreme. It would represent savings of about £2 per week for six years, which would be out of the question for a normal man earning an average week's pay. This means that there is no hope whatever of newly-married couples acquiring a house for years and, therefore, they must resort either to a furnished <Col N="314" /> flat or move in with in-laws.  When they move into a furnished flat, they have no fixity of tenure and the arrival of a baby will mean eviction, as Christian principles do not hold in this country. A married couple with one child will be evicted at the shortest notice as soon as the baby's birth is made known. They must then either move in with in-laws or have the family unit broken up in the Dublin Health Authority shelter, thus separating husband and wife for years.</P>
    <P>I have seen many cases of families living with their in-laws in corporation houses in Dublin and the picture is a grim one&mdash;15 or 16 people in a two-bedroomed house and mixed families sleeping together in one room.  Apart from the moral aspect, it is a deplorable situation to which the Minister is turning a blind eye.  Many of these young married girls must walk the streets of Dublin with their children and just seek refuge there at night.  No wonder so many of them find themselves on the street, from family dissension arising from so many people living in overcrowded conditions.  We have over 400 people on the Dublin Corporation priority list and the figures given to me by the Minister today indicate that 698 houses were handed over to Dublin Corporation in the past year.  How could Dublin Corporation cope with the vast number on their priority housing list at the rate at which building construction is going on?  It leads me to believe that as a housing administrative body Dublin Corporation fails badly.</P>
    <P>Last week the Minister stated in reply to a question that families of five were being re-housed.  I have a letter from Dublin Corporation stating that the name of one family of five living as sub-tenants is on the waiting list and that the man will be notified, but the letter adds that there are more seriously overcrowded cases on the waiting list.  I can only assume from this that families of five are not being catered for at present by Dublin Corporation and that the answer given by the Minister was wrong.  We have a situation in which hundreds of families of five, and thousands of families of <Col N="315" /> four or three people, are awaiting accommodation, who are frustrated, with no hope or possibility of being housed in the next few years at the present rate of building by Dublin Corporation.  There are many cases of families living in hovels which are structurally sound but in which the sanitary conditions are deplorable.  In a few cases I have seen families having to use the public toilets half a mile away and the landlords are not being compelled to effect the proper repairs to these houses.</P>
    <P>In regard to the question of medical priority for housing, as I understand it, the only medical priority which Dublin Corporation will consider is active tuberculosis.  We have cases of people who have been treated for tuberculosis and as soon as the X-ray becomes normal and the tuberculosis is not active, they are immediately taken off the priority list.  There are no houses for them and they are compelled to live in overcrowded conditions which of themselves are conducive to a reactivation of their condition.  There is no consideration given to any other ailment, or any physical or mental disability, heart conditions or bronchial asthma, where proper ventilation is required.  Dublin Corporation medical department will not consider these as priorities but only active tuberculosis. Many of these cases are compelled to live with in-laws where active tuberculosis prevails and still the corporation will not give priority to families living in these households.  I brought one case to the attention of the Minister for Health who deplored the situation but felt he was powerless to deal with it.  It was the case of a family with two children living in a house where there was active tuberculosis, but because the mother or the father of these children had not active tuberculosis, they would not be considered for rehousing.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made various excuses as to why the Ballymun scheme is not ready and why the houses have not been handed over. Yesterday he came out with the ridiculous statement that the much in the <Col N="316" /> area prevented these houses from being handed over.  The people are living in such conditions at the moment that they would not mind an over-abundance of muck on the street, as the Minister chose to call it.  I believe there is something more sinister behind the Minister's attitude, and that he wants the higher rents settled before he decides that they will be given the houses.  The flimsy excuse he has offered is no explanation for what prevails in Ballymun today.  The Minister was talking about increasing the rents in these corporation houses.  By the Minister's standards, the tenants may not be paying the requisite rent, but the Minister should remember that corporation tenants have no rights whatever: they cannot paint their front door; they cannot alter anything inside the house; and if they want to leave the house for over six weeks, they must seek permission before hand. There are many cases in which these families may have what the Minister would call affluence for a few years, but as soon as the families get married, they are back again, almost in poverty.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Minister has any justification for increasing the rents as he proposes.  We have the case of Keogh Square, Dublin and Mount-pleasant Buildings, those substandard dwellings which are a disgrace to our city.  I might be inclined to call Keogh Square the debtor's prison because once you fall into arrears with your rent, are evicted by Dublin Corporation and put into Keogh Square, no other term would apply to Keogh Square except the debtor's prison. There are no proper plans under way by the Department to deal with those substandard dwellings.  Despite all the promises nothing has been done.</P>
    <P>Now let us come to the question of dangerous dwellings and dangerous buildings, which are declared dangerous by inspectors on certificates signed in Dublin Corporation by architects who do not see the buildings. This is happening in Dublin.  In many cases buildings, which could readily be repaired and made available to young married couples, are demolished, as an administrative expedient, <Col N="317" /> and nothing is done to prevent it.</P>
    <P>Dublin Corporation have no proper plans for coping with the housing crisis in Dublin city today.  The present construction programme could never hope to cope with the situation. We will shortly have an expanding city where the housing situation will probably be the worst in Europe.  At the present time, we need a reappraisal of the method of allocating houses.  We need a reappraisal of establishing the priorities.  The Minister, despite numerous requests, has ignored this. He, and he alone, is responsible for this.  He could change the present situation if he would apply the points system whereby people, who are so many years on the waiting list, would be given some priority and cognisance would be taken of the condition of the dwelling.  Under the present system, a family with two children and in which the mother could never have a third, will never be housed.  Medical proof will never be accepted by Dublin Corporation.</P>
    <P>We have misleading statements by Dublin Corporation.  The Minister makes misleading statements in the Dáil, so much so that the people who call on the Deputies regularly find that only families of five people are housed at the present time.  The Minister is responsible for this by making a misleading statement in the Dáil last week.  Dublin Corporation Housing Authority should establish an information service and should provide a monthly bulletin on the situation as it exists at the time.  Perhaps this could be applied to other cities, but it should be made available regularly to the people so that they will know exactly what the situation is like.</P>
    <P>If such a service were made available, the people would be patient.  It is time for the Minister to look into the affairs of Dublin Corporation Housing Department, which is so bogged down trying to cope with so many problems that it takes almost six weeks to receive a reply to a letter.  The Minister would be well advised to look into this problem and <Col N="318" /> see if it could be streamlined so that more effective work could be done and information made available to the people.  With regard to the housing situation, in general, there should be some system whereby the building of houses would be given priority over other building projects.  The necessary finance should be made available because housing is an urgent problem, and it should be given priority over other projects.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> The provisions of this Bill regarding housing grants are a source of disappointment to me.  In a nutshell, there is no increase whatever in the standard grant for building a house over and above the grant made available in 1948.  In 1948 the grant, which was allocated in respect of a five-roomed house, through a public utility society, was £285.  Under the present Bill, that grant is confirmed at £285, notwithstanding the fact that the cost of building such a house has increased enormously in the meantime.  I do not know by what percentage the cost of building a house has increased since 1948 but it is at least double and perhaps much more.  I am speaking about the standard grant payable to the white collar worker and other people in receipt of an income of £1,500 a year who might reasonably be expected to provide their own houses and who, in my opinion, should be encouraged by the Minister to provide their own houses.  As I say, there is not one penny piece by way of financial encouragement to those people contained in this measure.</P>
      <P>The Minister cannot seriously contend that he has made a real effort to encourage people, such as those I have been speaking about, the white collar employees, self-employed people and other people in the £1,500 per year bracket, to build their own houses.  I know the Bill enables the local authorities to give supplementary grants, subject to a means test.  That is merely a provision in the Bill which enables the local authorities, at the expense of the rates, to pay increased supplementary grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is rather difficult to follow the <Col N="319" /> Minister in this.  His colleague, the Minister for Health, appears to be saying that the local rates have borne as much as they can in respect of health services.  If we are to take what he says at its face value, it means that any further increase in the health charges is to be borne by the State instead of by the local authority.  On the other hand we have the Minister, in this measure, failing to provide one pennypiece by way of increase in the standard grant but saying to the local authorities throughout the county: &ldquo;You may do so, if you like, at the expense of an addition to the rates&rdquo;, which are already at saturation point.</P>
    <P>In my opinion, housing is a national problem which should be tackled at national level and such financial encouragement as is given to builders of houses should be given out of the national Exchequer.  We know how reluctant local authorities are to increase the rates and we know there are several items for which they are liable, as a local authority, over which they have no control.  The temptation, then, is to cut down on housing grants and things in which they have discretion. I say the Minister and the Government have shirked their responsibility in this item of the standard grant.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal with another aspect of the Minister's failure to encourage people to provide better houses for themselves in this Bill.  In 1948 reconstruction grants were given and the maximum reconstruction grant for a five-roomed house was £140; the maximum now is £140, before this measure and for some years back.  It still will stand at £140 when this measure becomes law.  I do not know when that maximum figure of £140 was fixed but the Parliamentary Secretary seems to know and perhaps he would tell me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> We know now that the reconstruction grant for a five-roomed house was fixed at £140 in 1958.  I take it the Parliamentary Secretary will agree with me that the cost of reconstructing <Col N="320" /> houses has increased, and increased considerably, since 1958.  The cost of labour has gone up, the cost of materials has gone up, and the general all-over cost of reconstructing has gone up.  Yet the reconstruction grant will stand at £140 and the Minister is not even putting into this measure a provision to enable local authorities to provide increased supplementary grants for the reconstruction of houses. I think that is a mistake.  There are many houses in this country belonging to farmers with valuations of under £60 which could be reconstructed and made to last for a considerable number of years.  I think the Minister should, in this measure, have taken steps to encourage these people to reconstruct their houses and, in that way, save money and leave more money available to other people who have no houses and for whom new ones have to be provided.</P>
      <P>I should like to deal with this because it is a problem which Cavan County Council took up with the Minister, without any satisfactory results. I have stated, and it cannot be denied, that the cost of reconstruction, just like the cost of building, has increased considerably since 1958. There does not seem to be any reason, therefore, why there should not be a proportionate increase in the reconstruction grants.  When this measure goes through, and if all the provisions of the measure are availed of by the local authorities, there will be a wide gap between the cost to the farmer of building a new house and reconstructing a house, because the farmer with a valuation of under £25 will qualify for a grant&mdash;if the local authorities accept the Minister's invitation&mdash;of £900.  But, if that farmer has a house which could be reconstructed by spending £700 or £800, he will get a grant of only £140.  He will, obviously, be inclined to leave the house which could be made habitable for a great number of years to come and embark on building a new house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When you take a county like Cavan, you find how unfair and unjust is the Minister's refusal to increase the reconstruction grant.  In the six years 1958-59 to 1963-64 2,767 houses were <Col N="321" /> reconstructed in Cavan, while, in the same six years, only about 460 new houses were built, that is, only about one-sixth of the number reconstructed. That shows that to say to farmers of a county like Cavan they will not get one penny increase in the reconstruction grant, either from the State or the county council over the 1958 figure, is unfair and unreasonable.</P>
    <P>Cavan County Council carried out a housing survey&mdash;I presume at the Minister's request&mdash;in 1963.  That survey revealed that out of 3,238 new houses in the county, 1,923 were, according to the county council experts who inspected them, capable of being rendered well fit for human habitation, for habitation by the people who owned them.  Of these 1,923 houses capable of repair, 1,635 were occupied by farmers and 1,550 of these 1,635 were occupied by farmers whose valuation did not exceed £30.  There is not one penny being provided in this measure to enable these people to meet the cost of reconstruction and not one section in the Bill to enable Cavan County Council to provide more money for those people.</P>
    <P>I do not think I am being unfair to the Minister when I say Cavan County Council did everything possible to get the Minister to see the reasonableness of their approach to this reconstruction question.  They sent a memorandum to him; they offered to come and meet him as a deputation and to argue the matter with him.  Cavan County Council refused from early 1964 until their January meeting this year to implement the Minister's increase in supplementary grants because the Minister refused to see their point of view and increase the reconstruction grants.  It was only in desperation that they at last agreed to implement the increased supplementary grants for new houses.  They were smoked out, so to speak, by the Minister on the basis that he would not yield at all on the question of reconstruction grants.</P>
    <P>I tell the Minister now that this matter was not approached on a political basis by Cavan County Council. Some of the Minister's best friends in the county are members of the county <Col N="322" /> council and they were very strong in their support of the majority decision that there should be an increase in the supplementary grants for reconstructing houses.  It is hard to see the Minister's point of view in this.  He simply adopted the attitude, as far as my county council are concerned, of digging in his heels and saying: &ldquo;I have made up my mind, and that is that&rdquo;. Does the Minister not see the necessity for reconstruction?  One can make out quite a good case for reconstruction in some parts of rural Ireland as against building new houses.  The Minister cannot deny there is a flight from the land or a movement from the land in most parts of Ireland.  Those houses which could be reconstructed if the owners were encouraged to do so would do the people living in them for their day.  In many cases, it is unlikely that the children of these people will stay in the locality.  It is more likely that they will follow others of their generation to the towns or out of the country.  In such circumstances, it could be considered a waste of money to encourage people to build new houses when reconstruction would do.</P>
    <P>Lest I might be misunderstood, lest the Minister might try to suggest that I am advocating the reconstruction of houses that are not fit for reconstruction, I wish to make it perfectly clear I am doing no such thing.  The houses I am speaking about are houses which have been certified by the engineering and medical staffs of Cavan County Council as being fit for reconstruction. I am not advocating reconstruction of any other houses.  I rose specifically to deal with this point and I shall conclude by saying it is very regrettable that the Minister in this measure has not increased by one penny the standard grant allocated in 1948 for new houses.  It still stands at £285.  Since that figure was fixed, the cost of building houses has increased considerably.  It is also regrettable that the Minister has not fallen in with the reasonable line put forward by Cavan County Council in the matter of reconstruction grants and the preservation of worthwhile houses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall speak only briefly on the concluding Stage of this <Col N="323" /> rather formidable Bill which has had so many airings already in its various Stages.  It is not necessary to say again that to a great extent the Bill can be described as work that has been done by the draftsmen to bring a collection of Bills under one heading.  One or two major points developed during the course of the debate.  One is that it is quite clear there has not been any rethinking on the part of the Minister or the Department on the matter of the respective responsibility of city and county managers on the one hand and elected representatives on the other in the matter of housing.</P>
      <P>Efforts made by members of the Labour Party to bring some reality to this matter have been resisted in a number of ways.  We still have sections dealing with city and county managers and quite a number of sections which will be dealt with by ministerial regulation. We appreciate that a tremendous amount of work for the housing of our working classes has been done by ministerial regulation.  There was an opportunity to reduce the number of such regulations in this measure but it is not being done.  The general public and their representatives in corporations, borough councils and county councils are being treated just as they were previously.</P>
      <P>The Bill sets out to improve the provisions of the 1954 Act to give the local representative some alleged authority.  Under the 1955 Act, when they went to use that authority, they found they could not do it.  Labour spokesmen have gone on record quite clearly as stating, that aside from the merits or demerits of city or county managers, a very serious principle was involved.  That is the democratic right of elected representatives to make decisions for the people they represent. Under quite a number of sections, and many of them important sections of the Bill, elected representatives have not got this right any more than they had it under previous legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some people may say that public representatives do not exericse the right in the same responsible manner as a paid official, but it should be clear that until such representatives have the authority and the responsibility, <Col N="324" /> they cannot be expected to act in quite such a responsible manner.  When it is left, as it is, in many cases, under this Bill to the city or county manager to make a decision, and a public representative is in the position that, irrespective of what he thinks or what decision he wants made in regard to a particular matter, it is clearly a function within the control of the manager and the part he plays is of necessity reduced.</P>
    <P>In the discussion of the Bill, a serious and earnest attempt was made to persuade the Minister that in this year of 1966 the arguments in favour of State grants for the building of new houses, and so on, were over-whelming, and, while I think it is true that it has been said publicly from time to time that the purpose of these grants is to assist house-building activity and to encourage those engaged in it to play a more active role, nevertheless the State grant has been held out as an inducement and assistance to people providing their own houses.  Yet the level of State grants at £285 has remained unaltered since 1948.  In resisting the arguments, the Minister, to my mind, made no case for refusing to review the situation at this time.</P>
    <P>As a representative of an urban area where there is great need to assist people desirous of purchasing their own houses and where the financial resources of many people are not very great, it appears that the Minister's decision to continue effectively to draw the line to the disadvantage of such people is unfair and unjust.  I do not think anybody argued in the discussion on the Bill regarding the special assistance available to people providing their own houses in rural areas where the objective of the additional, special assistance is to try to secure that people will remain in rural areas rather than migrate to urban areas.  But the margin was drawn in such a way that people with the same income, following the same occupation, people with much the same general expenses and possibly living close to each other, possibly working in the same undertaking, have been treated on a different basis, <Col N="325" /> depending on whether they lived on one side of the line or the other.</P>
    <P>The Bill makes certain provisions enabling local authorities to advance money and in certain cases to assist people in buying or repairing or reconstructing their houses, and also to assist groups and so on.  Having regard to the problems local authorities face in obtaining adequate technical staff to ensure that where they make loans or grants, the money advanced is applied only to a dwelling that is properly erected and where the materials and workmanship are up to standard and where the builder has properly complied with the specifications, it appears that some sections of the Bill could possibly be better operated by the Minister's Department because, as far as we know, they appear to have endless resources of technical staff.  When one recalls the number of minor alterations made in house-planning and development proposals submitted for their consideration, they must have very great resources.  But at this stage the effect of the Bill must be viewed in relation to whether or not there will be any increase in housing activity, whether or not local authorities will be enabled to deal with the increasing demand for housing in their area.</P>
    <P>It is very useful indeed to introduce a Bill that codifies something like 50 previous Bills.  It would be very nice to shout from the house-tops: &ldquo;The results of this Bill will be to cure all the ills as far as housing is concerned.&rdquo; What effect is this Bill having on the hold-up of local authority tenders for housing development, for housing construction, for planning, for acquisition?</P>
    <P>I understand that the Bill is being taken in conjunction with a motion put down by certain members of this House.  At this particular stage and at this time, I do not want my approach to be purely negative and to say that nothing has been done.  Something has been done in recent years.  It would be remarkable if a Government who have been in office, in their last period, since 1957 were not able to do something between 1957 and 1966 with <Col N="326" /> regard to the housing situation, particularly a Government who had some years of previous experience and certainly had no need to learn any of the techniques.  We will pay the Minister and his Department and his Government the credit that they have nothing to learn in regard to the technique of delay: they are past masters of the art.</P>

      <P>In other circumstances, the Minister responsible for housing would be crawling around this House, hiding his face, at the very thought of the tremendous number of people who, at this present time, are in need of housing, the tremendous number of people who are only too anxious to sink their savings and to incur liabilities so as to provide themselves with homes, even though they have to pay 7½ per cent for the money to do so. Yet, this Minister comes gaily in here and tells us, in his quiet voice&mdash;he is normally quiet when he speaks&mdash;that problems are arising due to the shortage of money.  There was no problem due to any shortage of money this time last year&mdash;no problem at all. There was no problem up to the middle of the year.  Possibly the Minister is not responsible for the situation. It may be that he is only a junior Minister in the Cabinet but he has been there long enough and his colleagues have been long enough in ministerial office to have a fairly good idea of how the winds of finance were blowing. Even if they were blowing in a slanting fashion in another country, they have been blowing fair in some countries but this was a secret they managed to keep closely guarded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will give this Government credit for knowing that the Irish public can be gulled because they have been <Col N="327" /> gulled by this Fianna Fáil Government on a number of occasions.  Less than 12 months ago, the gullible Irish public were satisfied that the housing drive was going full steam ahead, that there would be no delay, that thousands of flats would spring up almost like mushrooms in north Dublin and that in other parts of the city, houses would spring up and people would buy their houses and there would be no difficulty in regard to approval from the Department or anything else. That was the situation.  In the autumn, the hard facts of life started to come home to the very same people and in the middle of this winter the situation has been very grim for many families.</P>
    <P>Up to this moment, I am not aware that the Minister has announced any change in the situation or has given any comfort.  He has provided many ways by which local authorities can give away money they have not got. He has provided many ways under the Bill by which local authorities can lend money and grant money they have not got.  What is the Minister and what are the Government doing to implement the proposals to deal with a serious housing situation?  That is a secret they are keeping close to themselves at this particular time.</P>
    <P>The Minister failed to give any great comfort to those who are anxious to provide their own dwellings by agreeing to increase the State subsidy.  However, by precept and example, he was very active in advising the same people that he was careful to remove no powers from the city and county managers in relation to the exercise of their authority to impose higher rents on the tenants in their estates.  Let nobody inside or outside this House relieve the Minister of the prime responsibility for that situation.  The Minister has made it quite plain, not only in discussions with representatives of local authorities but else-where and in public.  Some city managers and county managers may be nice polite gentlemen.  Some of them may be prepared to go some part of the way with local authorities, but there is one thing for which they are <Col N="328" /> known, that is, that they follow very closely the line of policy laid down by the Minister for Local Government.  If the Minister indicates by circular or otherwise that the gentlemen who sit in the seats of power in local authorities should impose increased rents on tenants, that is the way those gentlemen will operate and that is the way they are operating.  I want to make it quite plain, and I feel the public should know, that in this respect the Minister cannot relieve himself of responsibility for this type of thing happening, whether in urban or rural areas.</P>
    <P>When the Minister is replying to the debate, I hope he will indicate that there is some gleam of light in the darkness.  It is too much to hope that we can possibly convince him.  The Minister, having set his mind completely against giving greater assistance to persons purchasing their own homes and against continuing State assistance, where such applies, in cases where local authorities are prepared to introduce tenant purchase schemes for existing tenants, it is too much to hope that the line drawn as to the level of supplementary grants will be removed or, at least, put on a realistic basis.  I suppose it is too much to ask that those who contribute so heavily through rates to housing, health, social welfare and all other charges should not be treated inequitably as they are under this Bill.  It is too much to hope that the Minister will at this stage change his mind.  All we can do is to ask the Minister at this stage whether he can at least announce an easement in the position as regards sanction for schemes submitted and lying on his table, in some cases for months.</P>
    <P>I have been as critical as anyone in this House, possibly more critical, of one of the Minister's predecessors.  I can recall a time when, if there was a delay in sanctioning a scheme for the development of a site for housing or for the building of houses or the provision of money for various local authorities for loans for house purchase, the Minister and his colleagues would remind one of a pack of dogs in full cry.  I was as critical, possibly <Col N="329" /> more critical, as many Deputies of one of the Minister's predecessors who was in difficult circumstances at the time. I do not see the pack of dogs after this Minister.  The Minister's backbenchers are very mute.  In another place I even had the experience of some of the Minister's backbenchers saying it was a shame and that it was unfair, in a particular local authority of which they and I happen to be members, to refer to the fact that schemes to the extent of over £1½ million were lying on the table of the Minister, that there was no indication that sanction was forthcoming, that men were liable to be put out of employment and major housing schemes liable to be upset.  I heard some of the Minister's backbenchers in that local authority expressing shame and horror.  Of course, that was another day and another time.</P>
    <P>I must to some extent admire the Minister and his colleagues for their ability.  I have not seen very much evidence of the type of publicity that was aroused by the speculative builders in other years.  One may see a little protest here or there, and an inquiry. The speculative builders may be all good supporters of the Minister.  For some good reason that I do not know, they are very quiet.  I do not see them making public outcry.  I have not seen much evidence of statements being made at dinners to the effect that the whole building industry was falling down and unemployment was facing everybody.  I give the Minister credit for the way in which he handles his publicity so that he has managed to keep this type of pressure off himself and his Department.  I should like to know the secret; I think we should all like to know the secret.</P>
    <P>Every Deputy would like to be able to say to the Minister for Local Government that he is doing a good job of work.  Irrespective of the Party to which a Minister for Local Government belonged, every Deputy would be very happy if he were able to say that sanctions were coming through and the house-building programme was going ahead.</P>
    <P>The difficulty at the present time is that Deputies, including Deputies of <Col N="330" /> the Minister's Party, no matter how they may endeavour to apologise or to explain the situation in their own local authorities and act the part of petty statesmen, are worried about the situation, very, very worried, because they know, and the Minister knows and everybody knows that when building activity slows down to a particular point, you just do not turn on the tap and have it go full steam ahead again. If acquisition programmes are not timed&mdash;most of them have to be timed and planned five to six years ahead&mdash; and if development plans cannot be carried out to some set timetable, the result is that housing is held up.</P>
    <P>May I make a last brief comment on the general question of housing? Mention was made in the course of the debate of the question of the cubic capacity of rooms.  The regulations have been operating to deter medical officers in many cases from putting families early on a priority list.  Might I press the Minister to consider whether, in fact, with all the advice he has from the consultants, the town planners and the people who estimate the need for housing at 40,000 by 1975, local authority dwellings are not substandard from the point of view of the actual size of the rooms?  Families in our community are on the large side.  Efforts have been made over the years to improve the educational standards and the social standards of our people, but houses, certainly those built for tenancy purposes, have not improved because they are, in my opinion, much too restricted in scope. The rooms are too small to permit of normal family development and normal family life.  Boys and girls attending school from these houses are not getting a reasonable opportunity to study at home.  I know there is a good deal of comment now on the subject of homework and the need for it, but the fact remains that, if there is homework involved, these children are prevented from doing it to the best of their ability because of the limited scope of the houses in which they live.</P>
    <P>The size of local authority houses throughout the country needs to be reconsidered.  Everyone in this House and everyone in local authorities is <Col N="331" /> aware, as I am aware, that one of the major factors involved, particularly in tenancy houses, is the ultimate cost. If we are going to develop properly, and if our families are to be given adequate opportunity of developing as families within their own homes, and with reasonable opportunities for following their own pursuits within those homes, then I would suggest to the Minister that he take an early opportunity of looking at houses generally, and not merely measuring them by the slide rule of the architect.  Architects are very fine people, but most architects are very fortunate because they live in reasonably sized dwellings. I suggest to the Minister that he send his architect and the technical officers of his Department, and the officers of local authorities, to live in these four- and five-roomed houses for about six months.  I do not mind laying a small shade of odds that they will go back to the Department and immediately start to revise their ideas of what constitutes adequate accommodation for a growing family.</P>
    <P>There are a number of useful sections in the Bill.  The Minister failed to hearken to some of the major arguments made in the course of the debate, but it is only fair to say that he was at all times courteous and painstaking in dealing with points raised during this very prolonged and very complicated debate.  The Minister is entitled to be paid that compliment. We disagreed with him violently on many occasions but, on the Second Stage and on Committee Stage, he went to great trouble to deal with the various points raised.</P>

      <P>The Bill has had a long, long passage through the House.  It has been very fully debated by many speakers in all its different stages.  For that I am very glad because it proves something that really should not need to be proved: it proves that everybody in this House, without exception, is equally anxious to see housing progress as quickly as possible.  Every public representative is all too well aware of those who need houses.  It seems to me, therefore, little use accusing the Minister or the Government of <Col N="332" /> deliberately slowing housing progress because that would be surely a sign of insanity.  I do not mind what Party the Minister belongs to or what Government are in office, the Government or the Minister who would deliberately slow housing, if it were possible to go ahead with it, would not be long in office.</P>

      <P>Nobody is complacent about the progress in building, least of all the Minister, and he has the widest knowledge of the magnitude of the problem.  Nobody is satisfied.  I can speak for some councils with which I am connected.  In the city of Cork, we have been making strenuous efforts to build houses to house those who have been very badly off for houses for years past.  Only this year did the question of the availability of money arise; but we were never able, even when the question of money never arose, to complete a fraction of the houses we wanted.  The corporation were never satisfied with the number of houses built.  There were two reasons for that: one was a complete lack of sites for development; there was no land within the city for that purpose until recently but, much more important than that, there was the lack of skilled labour.  Those who address themselves to this problem should regard the lack of skilled labour as a matter of priority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most of the delays in our housing programme in Cork are attributed by our architects and officials to the fact that there is not enough skilled labour to do the job.  We could, of course, offer incentives as private builders do in the case of insurance offices, factories and other things, but that would be a very dangerous precedent. Are we to start competing with the man who wants a factory built in a hurry or a firm requiring a block of offices?  Where will it stop?  The root of all this trouble, in my opinion, goes back a good many years, to the years in which trades were closed and people could not take up the occupation they desired to take up and the occupations for which perhaps they were peculiarly <Col N="333" /> suitable.  Things have changed but, even so, the problem is not as easy of solution as some might think.  Indeed, if building is to progress at the rate we would all desire the problem will be with us for a good many years to come.  When I speak of a shortage of housing in Cork, I mean all housing but particularly local authority housing.  We have not the same freedom in chasing wages and salaries as outsiders have but it is as well to remember that in each year for the past five or six years in Cork, more houses have been built than in the previous year and last year was an all-time record from the point of view of SDA houses and houses built by private developers.</P>

      <P>This business of chasing tradesmen and building houses at all costs meant that the houses built were not up to the required standard and unfortunately many people who will be paying off debts on their houses over the next 25 to 30 years are living in houses which, I can say, from my personal observation and from expert advice, will hardly be there in 30 years' time.  Because of the scarcity of builders, these people were prepared to take what they would not have taken otherwise.  We now have the extraordinary position in Cork city of <Col N="334" /> builders going back on work they had completed 12 months and two years ago, repairing doors, windows, walls and making good various other defects. The unfortunate buyers of these houses may see some little consolation in the way things are going now.</P>
      <P>This Bill is to be welcomed.  It is a great advance on previous legislation. Of course it does not satisfy everybody. A previous speaker made a rather extraordinary remark, that every Deputy would like to come into the House and congratulate the Minister on the way he was doing his work.  I find that very hard to believe and I am in the House a fair share of times.  To find Deputy L'Estrange coming in to congratulate the Minister&mdash;that would be some day.</P>
      <P>On the question of reconstruction grants, these grants provide a wonderful service.  They enable houses to be maintained and save the building of new houses.  However, I hope something will be done about having to send up to Dublin for an inspector every time a house is built locally in Cork city.  We have engineers and architects being paid big salaries and I cannot understand why they should not be able to do what the departmental inspector does, inspect the house and pass it locally, if it is satisfactory.  That would certainly shortcircuit many of the delays experienced at present.</P>
      <P>Finally, let me say that in spite of the remark of a previous speaker who thinks that some Parties fool all the people all the time, generally speaking, the reason there is no outcry, as there might have been in the past, is that people realise&mdash;and Deputies opposite should have more regard for the intelligence of the Irish people&mdash;that those in charge will do the job, whatever the circumstances, and if they are bad, they will do better than any alternative that can be put before the people at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a very lengthy and useful discussion on this Bill.  The discussion has gone on for several months and I want to assure the House that it is not my intention to <Col N="335" /> delay too long in saying what I have to say here tonight.  In discussing any Housing Bill, all of us must agree that even in this year 1966, there is still an acute housing problem.  I agree with my colleague from Cork, Deputy Healy, that any Minister who brings in legislation to help to solve that problem will get good support and credit from all sides of the House.  I am somewhat disappointed in the Bill in so far as when this measure was first mentioned&mdash;I think it was some months ago that the Minister made it known to the House that he intended to introduce it&mdash;many people were hopeful that the financial inducements in the Bill would help them to solve their housing difficulties, which unfortunately they still have.</P>
      <P>The provision of grants has been mentioned by many Deputies, but it is no harm to repeat it.  Under this Bill the grant for a five-roomed house, fully serviced, is £300, and it has been £300 for some years back.  The Minister should have raised that figure and given many people who are anxious to provide their own houses some kind of financial inducement to do so.  The grant for reconstruction is still £140 for a five-roomed house.  This is an anomaly I could never figure out.  The person who reconstructs his house, irrespective of income or valuation, will now, and did before, get a £140 grant from the Department of Local Government and also qualifies for a £140 grant from his local authority, provided he spends £420 or more on the reconstruction.  Here is the case of a man getting £280 for spending £420, whereas the man who spends £3,000 can only get £300 in grants.  I cannot see that one bears any reasonable relationship to the other.  The figure of £140 for reconstruction should have been raised considerably.  I agree that the reconstruction grants serve as a useful inducement to many people to reconstruct their houses and make them habitable and comfortable for their wives and families where they could not otherwise do so.  The Minister should again consider increasing the grants in the two cases I have mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="336" /> In regard to housing in Cork, we in the western committee, in the southern committee and in the northern committee, of which I am a member, of Cork County Council, have at the moment many complaints against the Minister and his Department.  As we are discussing motion No. 5 on the Order Paper in conjunction with the Fifth Stage of the Bill, I think I am entitled to refer to the serious consequences of the current restriction on finance available for housing.  I am speaking now only for the northern committee of Cork County Council. There are some contractors in North Cork who three or four months ago signed contracts with Cork County Council for the building of houses and who have not yet got sanction for the money to proceed with the work.</P>
    <P>I know of one small contractor who signed a contract with Cork County Council last October for the building of two village-type houses. This contractor was in a small way and, because of getting these two houses to build, he let another job go, the building of a private house.  Now he finds he still cannot go ahead with the work.  This is an unfortunate state of affairs.  Many of the big contractors in North County Cork had to lay off staff which is now disorganised because the council or the Government could not provide the wherewithal to proceed with housing they had contracted for.  It is unfortunate in that it will be hard for those contractors to reorganise their staffs.  The Minister should tell the House the reason behind this.</P>
    <P>There is another problem in that regard, and only as late as last night representatives of the northern committee of Cork County Council met representatives of Fermoy Urban Council to try to resolve a mutual problem we have in regard to a shortage of houses in the Fermoy urban area and council area contiguous to it.  This urban council have a grave housing dilemma.  When I say that this is an urban area, where one penny in the £ on the rates produces only £45, you can appreciate the difficulty. It is a good thing that members of the council and the urban council <Col N="337" /> should meet their respective managers and try to resolve this problem jointly. It is an example that could well be followed by other urban councils and county councils.</P>
    <P>Finally, I want to say that members of Cork County Council which, for the benefit of members here, is the largest local authority in Ireland, would have a worthwhile contribution to make to any discussion on any Housing Bill.  Here I want to issue&mdash; I am glad Deputy Corry has arrived&mdash; an emphatic protest against the Minister's refusal to meet a deputation of those people to discuss this housing problem and the shortage of money for house building.  Not only is it a refusal but it is a persistent refusal over the past two months.  The Minister has treated the members of Cork County Council most shabbily, and on their behalf, as one privileged to be a member of the council and of this Assembly, I want to tell the Minister we disapprove entirely of his action towards us.</P>
    <P>Discussion on this Bill in the House will help the Minister, or any future Minister framing housing legislation, to keep in mind the points that were so usefully and plainly put by Members on this side.  It appears to me that it was only Opposition Members who contributed to any extent to this debate.</P>

      <P>It was nothing of the kind.  Those are people who are finding employment here today where there was no employment previously, people who are encouraged through employment to marry and settle down with their families in this country.  Unfortunately, the housing drive did not keep pace with this development.  I never heard a more scathing indictment than that which I heard from Deputy O'Connell tonight in regard to <Col N="338" /> Dublin Corporation.  The joke was that he was suggesting the Minister should do the work that I have always maintained and believed should be done by the local authority concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>We are sick of that kind of excuse.  The Deputy wound up by assuring the House that Dublin Corporation had no proper plan for housing.  I take it the people of the city of Dublin elected the members of Dublin Corporation.  I am sure it was not yesterday or last year that this situation arose, that the land should have been prepared.  What were they doing?</P>
      <P>Then we had Deputy Larkin following immediately.  He waited until Deputy O'Connell had gone out to tell us the faults of the Minister in regard to housing.  He spoke of the delays in connection with grants and so on, but I seem to recollect coming in here when there was another Minister for Local Government present from the same county as the present Minister, Deputy P. O'Donnell, and he read out&mdash;and it is on the records of the House&mdash;the statement of his inspector who went down to examine the site of a scheme of houses in Ballinacurra, Midleton. The inspector reported that the scheme should be rejected because there was no water supply.  Two years afterwards the same inspector rambled down and again inspected the same site and found a watermain that had been running there for 25 years on the road beside the site.  We were able to go ahead with our housing scheme on that site.  I suppose that inspector has since been promoted for good work and I would almost say he is now the principal architect&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That was the trouble we found ourselves in.  Unfortunately, when the Department changed hands in 1956, a trained team was taken over, a Department trained in slowing up things.  It was a few years before that state of affairs was corrected&mdash;you cannot put an old dog off his path. They are still on the same job.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill which, in my opinion, will bring improvements in the future conduct of housing policy. It has removed a fair share of anomalies but not all of them.  I have repeatedly drawn attention to an anomaly which I had hoped to see dealt with in this Bill.  It has not been dealt with: it is the difference between the Housing of the Workingclasses Act and the Labourers Act in regard to the continuing subsidy on housing.  In the rural areas a purchase scheme can be brought in for houses.  Advantage can be taken of the continuing subsidy and reductions made on that account in the weekly purchase annuities.</P>
      <P>I gave instances here on a previous occasion of two schemes, one on each side of a road in Cobh town.  In one scheme you had 24 houses put up by the county council and in the other you had 70 houses put up by Cobh Urban Council.  Nothing divided them but the road.  The men living in those houses were in the same employment, each drawing the same wages or salaries.  The houses were built in the same year and for the county council houses a rent of 11/- a week plus rates was put on and under our purchase scheme that was reduced by 2/ a week to 9/- a week.  The rent proposed by the Department of Local Government for the purchase of the urban council houses across the road was 32/- a week.  That was the proposal sent down by the Department of Local Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not seen that anomaly <Col N="340" /> wiped out in this Bill.  I have waited patiently, thinking that my friends in the Labour Party beside me, who are so interested in labour, would do something about it, but they did not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>And I would do the same with any other hero who was put in with me.  But this is one of the anomalies that, in my opinion, the Bill should have dealt with.  The Bill has a lot of good points and has removed a lot of inequalities, but that is one inequality with which it has not dealt.  It is wrong that you could have two men living, one on each side of the road, one who can purchase his house at a reduced rent over a number of years and the other who, if he wants to purchase his house, has his annuity trebled.  I have given instances of this and, if anybody doubts it, I am prepared to bring in details of the schemes prepared and sanctioned by the Department of Local Government and I will read them out here.  I know <Col N="341" /> that you have difficulties and hold-ups in Departments.  I have not been here for so many years without learning that.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Local Government, in the Cabinet, should take steps to remove this anomaly, that it takes four times as long to take a site from one Department of State and transfer it to another, than it does to make a compulsory order and take a site from a private individual.  That is a scandal. It took three and a half years to take a site from the Department of Lands and transfer it to the Housing Committee of Cork County Council. People had first of all to face a housing survey and have their rights to houses examined.  They were living in condemned houses and some of them were living with their in-laws, which in most cases is not a happy position to be in.  Yet you had two Departments of State smiling at each other for three and a half years before the site was handed over.  The tenders for that site have been with the Department of Local Government awaiting sanction for the past four months.</P>

I have no sympathy with local authorities as regards housing in the past because housing was the job of the local authority and not of the Minister.  If, as Deputy Larkin said, there were cases where the manager interfered unduly, well, there is a cure for that in the Mangerial (Amendment) Act.  It is a rather drastic cure, but it is a cure, and I would have no hesitation about using it. Thank God, I never had occasion to use it in regard to any of the managers we had.</P>

      <P>The crux in regard to housing centres around smooth working as between a local authority and a Department.  I might say this in passing. Like Deputy Barry, I, too, consider that the local authority for the largest county in the Republic are justly entitled to have an interview with the Minister for Local Government or any other Minister in this State we want to inteview at any time we wish on matters concerning our local authority. I felt rather small when I read a letter from the secretary of our county council stating that the Minister could not receive us and when I opened the <i>Cork Examiner</i> the following morning I saw he had received the Lord Mayor, Deputy Healy, and a few more of the boys.  Apparently the Minister for Local Government forgets he is a country boy and he is falling into the fruits of the city.  I would be sorry to think that of him.</P>

      <P>As I said, this Bill has effected a large number of improvements. I was rather amused to hear both Deputy Jones and Deputy Fitzpatrick complaining about the grants given for new houses and for the reconstruction of houses.  We all know that County Limerick is one of the richest counties in the State.  Everything has flowed in there and all the rest of it but if you build a new house in County Limerick you will get only <Col N="343" /> 50 per cent of the local government grant from the local authority in Limerick.  Still, Deputy Jones wants the ceiling raised in relation to State grants. I do not think he should look for an increase in grants from the State until his own local authority have done their duty.</P>

You are allowed to increase the grant or give 100 per cent, the same as the State grant in the building of new houses and in reconstruction grants. The local authority have that power. Whether they exercise it or not is another matter.  We had the admission from the other apostle, who was looking for the increased grants, that they had cut it out altogether and gave no grant at all in 1964.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I can tell the Deputy that in one town alone Cork County Council have stepped in, taken over an area in that town and built over 200 houses because the burden on the ratepayers of the urban area would be too heavy if it were not done that way.  That is the town of Cobh. It is the same in Midleton and they have done the same in Youghal.  In each of those three towns, the county council has stepped in and built around the town.  I suppose if they are <Col N="346" /> wise men, like Deputy Healy, they will be looking for space in the urban area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Healy has gone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>However, you have that kind of trouble to face, but it is a question of the county council building them because the urban area has not the finance to do it, and no hope of having the finance.  Again, you have the anomaly I mentioned a while ago here of two men going into each house.  The one thing I want to see in this country is every man the owner of his own house.  A scheme was brought in here by us, I think way back in 1932, 1933 or 1934, of cottages for the ordinary labourers.  The policy laid out was that the labourer in his cottage would be as secure as the farmer on his farm.  I want to see the same thing apply, if it could, to every local authority house.  It is blocked by one thing, and one thing only, that is, the anomaly I alluded to here&mdash;the difference between the Labourers Act and the Housing of the Working Classes Act, the difference being that when you purchase a house in an urban area, the Minister immediately steps in and the subsidy ceases there.  If, for example, all the local authority houses owned by the urban council in Cobh were to be purchased tomorrow, the State would gain something around £2,000 a year in subsidy alone.  That is the reason why it is not in that Act.  Those are the facts; they are bitter facts, but they are there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the way I look on this Bill.  I look on it as a Bill that does a certain amount of good but, while that anomaly is there, the wish and the intention of the principle put forward by the Fianna Fáil Party away back in 1933 is still unrealised, to make every worker as safe in his own house as the farmer on his farm. That was the policy.  There was a special inquiry set up to examine it 30 odd years ago.  But that is there still.  Thank God for it; the ordinary worker can take advantage of it.  The people who cannot take advantage of it, however, are the people in the urban area whose houses were built under a different Act and who are paying the price accordingly.</P>
      <P>I am more than keenly interested in housing.  I say this much: there may be a hold-up at present&mdash;there is none of us blind&mdash;but I say frankly to the Minister that the money being given&mdash;wherever it is being found&mdash;in grants for luxury hotels would be far better spent in helping out the present housing crisis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe and know that is so.  I would suggest to the Minister that there is money being spent on more unnecessary things than on housing the people.  Let us, in God's name, put our hands together, prepare our ground and be ready when the finance becomes available to go right ahead and carry out the schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>We survived your crisis and we will survive this one.  It was not just once you ran away but twice, and each time you were broke. Deputy L'Estrange has been knocking <Col N="348" /> at that door as long as I can remember. I saw his face nearly 20 years ago.  He crawled in here the last time at the expense of a far better man than he will ever be.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to hold up the House any further.  I have given my views on the position as I see it.  I have given them honestly and aboveboard and I am giving them tonight to this Minister for Local Government in the same way as I would give them if there were an Opposition Minister sitting here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McLaughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not delay the House very long with what I have to say but I should like to take this opportunity of letting the Minister know the urgency and necessity for speeding up the housing programme throughout my constituency.  I am continually going to the Department of Local Government asking to have the payment of grants speeded up.  Very often I find out, when I go back time and again, and sometimes when I lose contact with my constituents, that even then, after months these grants have not been paid, often for the simple reason that some small little defect had not been rectified and the inspector was very slow to come out.  The main cause of the delay is in getting the inspector to come out.  I blame the Department for that because I am very sure that an inspector could easily cover quite a lot of ground if he had the OK to go out and do the job.  What about the small farmer or the townsman anxiously awaiting payment?  The contractor is anxious to get his money as quickly as possible, and so is the builder's provider who, perhaps, has had to make deliveries in the most out of the way places.  All those people are affected by the delays and I ask the Minister to do everything possible to speed up these payments.</P>
      <P>In my constituency, as the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary know, there are a great many small farmers and we have record emigration figures. The result is many old people are left.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="349" /> There are numerous large families and there is a third group, those who are financially badly off.  We, as county councillors, have to deal with applications under section 5 of the Housing Act since it was brought into operation in Leitrim two years ago.  I particularly ask the Minister to give more attention to the problems arising under that section.  In Leitrim we have got off to a slow start because the money did not come in.  I hope that from 1st April next there will be a big improvement. There are large families, some of eight to 13 children, living in houses which are not habitable.  Unless something is done to improve their conditions, the children will be going into hospital with chest complaints, possibly tuberculosis, and the cure will be much more expensive than prevention. Neither the Minister nor the Parliamentary Secretary can have any idea of the number of applications awaiting attention in the council chamber in my county at the moment. There has not been any increase in these reconstruction grants since their introduction and the figures of £200 for a three-roomed house, £240 for a four-roomed house and £280 for the reconstruction of a five-roomed house are absolutely inadequate.</P>
    <P>Another big problem in my area is the qualification about public services. I know a young man, married with five children.  Public water is at least a mile away and it has been impossible to get a supply by boring.  Some easement should be given in the case of applications such as that.  The regulations should permit a roof tank, or some other such water supply system, to qualify for reconstruction grants under section 5.  Throughout the constituency, there are numerous vacant county council cottages.  They are vested cottages and have been idle during the past four or five years on the outskirts of Sligo and Manorhamilton. People are anxious to get into these houses and I suggest that in the vesting of cottages, there should be some clause to enable the council to possess the cottages automatically if they are vacant for a certain period.  I understand that after the expiry of three years vacant cottages <Col N="350" /> now revert to the council but I suggest the term should not be so long.  It is tragic to see so many cottages vacant throughout the country and so many people living in shacks at the same time.  All the cottages could be taken over by useful tenants if the clause I suggest were there.</P>
    <P>Recently, eight houses were erected in Sligo, and there were more than 80 applicants for those eight houses in a town where there is a population of more than 15,000.  There is bound to be a high marriage rate in such a big centre.  Therefore, I submit that building eight houses is not in keeping with the needs in such centres.  I visit Sligo once a week at least, and I meet many people who describe to me the desperate conditions in which some people are living.  Some families have to cook, wash and sleep in one room.  Such housing conditions are a sure way of driving people out of the country.  I have heard of a man with five daughters who came back from England, got employment here but had to leave again because he could not get a house.</P>

      <P>This Bill was promised a number of years ago. Indeed there were great expectations among the majority of the people of the country.  With a great flourish, it was introduced at a press conference by the Minister.  We know now after studying it that the mountain was in labour for a long time and that it has brought forth only a mouse.  Under the present Government during the past five years house-building has slowly ground to a halt.  Those of us who serve on local authorities know that at the present time it is impossible to get either grants or loans. From every county in Ireland, there is a cry for money but the money is not available, but when the Minister is questioned here he has not the courage to tell the truth.  He dodges the question.</P>
