      <P>Last night I mentioned the fact that I would like to refer briefly to some points which I feel should be mentioned when this Estimate appears before the House.  I began last night before the House adjourned with the question of television reception in Connemara.  This matter has been raised before but it still has not been rectified and I would like to refer to it again.  It is hard on those people when you consider we had a football team in the All-Ireland this year and a large part of the county could not follow the fortunes of the favourite team because they could not get reception.  This is rather a difficult and awkward situation for public representatives and the sooner the position is rectified the sooner every one of us will be happy about it.</P>
      <P>There is one other thing in relation to television to which I would like to refer.  The West is always placed in a most unfavourable light, and this also applies to Radio Éireann on the broadcasting side, in the weather forecast. We know the prevailing winds come from the west, but we do not have to have day after day this sad-faced forecaster telling us about imminent rain from the west, which we never see to the extent they would like or wish upon us.</P>
      <P>We are living in a part of the country which is very much dependent on the attraction of tourists to the area and in which the question of weather is an important factor, and we feel that this type of mention which we are constantly getting on our television and radio sets is detrimental in its own way to the great work done there to promote the tourist industry.  We are prepared to accept the weather God sends us but not the weather Radio Éireann and Telefís Éireann wish to send us.  They are frequently wrong in this and should be a bit more careful. It might be a good shot to say there is rain in the west if they believe there is never anything else there.  If they came down and visited us more often and saw the beautiful sunshine we get, they might treat us more kindly in their sometimes wholly incorrect forecasts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last night mention was made about long-haired individuals appearing on <Col N="2133" /> television screens and some people said that sheep shears could be used to make them more presentable looking. I could never agree with that outlook, that we should present only what we think is acceptable to the majority. I think we should in our television service go out of our way to serve all sections of the community of all ages.  The producers understand that and are doing quite a good job, and I do not see any objection to providing the type of entertainment which younger people expect to see on television. I compliment them on what they are doing in that regard.</P>
    <P>I would like to criticise one aspect which one notices from time to time of the news broadcasts.  Producers do not seem to show a terrible lot of respect for people who have recently, shall we say, suffered a loss in their family, by showing films and pictures of people in their hour of grief.  It is not very kind, certainly not very Irish, to project some poor lady in her grief into every home in the country at a time when this lady's, or any other person's privacy should be respected.  I am referring in particular to the pictures of the funeral of Sister O'Sullivan in respect of that family. I just wish to mention it but not to speak too much or say any more about it.  I would ask them to be a little more selective and to show a little more respect for people and their privacy.</P>
    <P>The question of the Irish language on television is something that interests me very much, indeed, agus ag labhairt faoi sin ba mhaith liom chomhgáir-deachas a dhéanamh le lucht RTE as ucht an méid atá á dhéanamh aca chun an Ghaeilge a chur ar aghaidh. Tig liom a rá gur tháinig feabhas mór ar an obair a bhí á dhéanamh aca ó tháinig Eoin Ó Súilleabháin&mdash;fear as mo chontae féin&mdash;go dtí an seirbhís.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom rud amháin a mholadh do lucht stiúrtha na gcláranna i nGaeilge&mdash;deis a thúirt do na daoine a d'fhoghlaim an Ghaeilge ar scoil dul ar roint de na cláranna atá á gcur amach aca.  Molaim é sin toisc gur insna scoileanna a d'fhoghlaim an chuid is mó de na daoine seo a gcuid Gaeilge.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2134" /> Dá ndéanfaí é sin, do bhainfidís níos mó taithnimh as na cláracha.  Nuair a chloiseann said daoine a bhfuil an Ghaeilge aca ó dhúchas agus an blas atá aca feictear dóibh nach féidir leo féin Gaeilge den tsaghas sin a labhairt choíche.  Cuireann sin díomá ortha. Nílim ag caint faoi Ghaeilge Chonamara amháin ach Gaeilge Chiarraí agus Gaeilge Dhún na nGall chomh maith.  Dá mbainfí níos mó úsáid as na daoine seo a bhfuil Gaeilge aca a d'fhoghlamaíodar ar scoil, tá mé cinnte go mbeadh an-dul chun cinn ar fad maidir le leathnú úsáid na teanga.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom traoslú le gach duine a bhfuil baint aige leis na cláracha seo i nGaeilge, go mór mhór leo siúd a bhfuil baint aca leis na drámaí.  Bhain mé féin an-tairbhe as an obair íontach a dheineadar le goirid i léiriú &ldquo;Cúirt an Mheán-Oíche&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Late Late show which was a rather popular programme, televised when most people in the country were free, on Saturday night, to sit back in anticipation of enjoying the programme, of late I think they have lost the originality and the appeal to the people which they had in the beginning.  If they want advice from us here, I would advise them to think twice about the way they are presenting the programme at the moment.  We see too many foreigners on this programme, people of whom we have never heard before and never will hear again.  They are introduced with great accolade and blowing of trumpets.  We ask ourselves: &ldquo;Who is this man we have never heard of or seen before?&rdquo; and the further the programme goes the better we know that we could not possibly have heard of him before. They seem to make stars overnight of some people just to present them on the programme.</P>
    <P>We have plenty of good Irish characters all over the country whom the people could enjoy on this programme. We are inclined to forget about the native talent when it comes to presenting entertaining programmes on the television.  I would make the suggestion to those involved in producing the Late Late Show that they should use more of the Irish talent <Col N="2135" /> and character that we have in the country instead of bringing in those tin-pot film stars who are only spending a week here and did not know where Ireland was a week before they came.  By playing up this kind of thing, I do not think it will do much for our image or self-confidence.</P>
    <P>I would like to comment on the staff in the GPO and sub-post offices in my own county.  It can be safely said now that any letter posted in County Galway will be delivered by the next day.  That applies to the whole of West Galway anyway, Galway city and Connemara, except the Islands, of course.  That is a great step forward. It is a wonderful service and I think compliments are due to the staffs and the Department officials who have worked so hard to bring this about.</P>
    <P>On the question of van deliveries, it is only a question of time until the complete postal service will be motorised, certainly in my constituency.  We often complain about the slowness of telephones and other things and it is nice to be able to compliment the Department when you see a job being well done.</P>
    <P>A special word of thanks is due to the staff in the same GPO and sub-post offices who were involved on a certain day when two young men rowed across the Atlantic and the whole press of the world seemed to descend upon us in Galway.  I know, from personal account, of the willingness of the officials in the General Post Office and sub-post offices involved in Galway to co-operate in what was an emergency.  We had 40 or 50 pressmen, all trying to get on three lines to the Aran Islands.  We had men who stayed up all day and all night to try to help out as best they could, and I understand that it was of no financial gain to the people in the sub-post offices who provided this excellent service to those men when they descended upon us.  It is largely thanks to the work of the post office officials that it was said, very shortly afterwards, that if anybody wants to cross the Atlantic and to get publicity out of it the best place <Col N="2136" /> he could land is Galway because everybody seems to co-operate in times of emergency.  When a thing like this suddenly descends, it is difficult to be on your toes but on that occasion the post office staff provided an excellent service.</P>
    <P>There is one matter I would like to raise.  It relates to the staff on the engineering side of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  It is something with which, I think, the Minister himself would have some sympathy. It is the question of a young boy who is taken in as a trainee technician and who does not pass the examination which is necessary at the end of the first year.  As a trainee technician, he might get a second chance but if he fails at the end of the second year, he is out completely.  There are lower grades and I think it should be possible for the Department to accept these trainee technicians who have not passed in the examination and to bring them in under the installer grade.  It seems rather a waste of time and energy which the senior staffs have put into the training of these young men.</P>
    <P>When they do not reach the required standards in that grade, I think it is a pity if the service is to lose them, having invested time and energy in them.  The proper thing to do seems to me to be to bring them in at the installer level.  I make this suggestion to the Minister and I think he has a certain sympathy with it.  It is time something was done about it.  A young man who spends one or two years at this is in a very awkward position if he does not succeed in his examination. He is out in the street again, whereas he is more than fit for employment in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs as an installer with the experience and training he has got in his efforts to become a trainee teachnician.</P>
    <P>I would also like to compliment the Sports Department of Telefís Éireann. It must be one of the finest sports reporting departments in any television service in the world.  They certainly go out of their way if there is something on to give the people in the <Col N="2137" /> country an opportunity of seeing it. There is great credit due to them. There is no need for me to mention any names.  I would suggest that when they are covering sports in which the ordinary staff are not very well up, it might be an idea if they were to bring in people from organisations to do the commentary for them.  I refer in particular to commentaries on the Irish Swimming Championships in Mosney this year where a man was put on as a commentator who had not any great knowledge of swimming, who did not know the swimmers and who did not really understand what the whole thing was about.  There are in the Swimming Association very many able commentators who would have been able to put that across and they would not have wasted so many tapes, which unfortunately happened because of wrong names and the person concerned not understanding the situation in that sport.  Telefís Éireann are inclined to confine the commentaries to the few people they have in the service rather than bring in temporary people who have a greater knowledge and make use of that knowledge to put the image across.</P>
    <P>Last night, and indeed for the length of time this Estimate has been before the House, most of the Opposition speakers spent their time criticising the action of a certain Minister and tried to imply that the television service and the radio broadcasting service were completely dominated and run by the Fianna Fáil Government.  Anybody who would believe that would be very naive indeed because it is evident to most people and indeed it was most evident on the occasion this was raised here in the House, when the Minister for Education intervened from the storm that descended upon him from the front benches of the Fine Gael Party that Fine Gael were looking on Telefís Éireann as their little empire. The editor of the <i>Irish Times</i> was not far wrong in his editorial this morning where he more or less hints at something on the same lines.  The reason the front benches of Fine Gael were so terribly worried&mdash;we saw Deputy Cosgrave get very hot under the collar about it&mdash;was that they were afraid the <Col N="2138" /> grip they had on Telefís Éireann was slipping out of their hands.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate has gone on for a few days now and the main emphasis seems to be on television.  In these circumstances, I believe the main functions of the Department are lost completely in the debate.  I want to draw the Minister's attention to a few of the problems confronting the people of my constituency.  I have taken matters up with him recently in connection with the erection of telephone kiosks in some of the villages in mid-Cork. I have tabled Parliamentary Questions in that respect over the past year and a half and have received the same reply with monotonous regularity. I believe, in view of the fact that we have now a large number of applicants awaiting the installation of private telephones, this is a system which could give good service, particularly to the people in the rural villages of this country.  I should like to ask the Minister in relation to local post offices where a public telephone is available to the people, at what time at night is that service finished as far as the people are concerned?  There seems to be a misunderstanding in this regard because, in remote areas, it may happen that people are looking for a doctor or a veterinary surgeon late at night and there is no telephone available apart from the public kiosk which could be a long distance away.  The erection of those kiosks is something the Minister could examine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next matter I want to condemn in the strongest manner possible is the number of people on the waiting list for a number of years for the installation of a private telephone in their homes.  The Department have the deplorable system that, when they feel it is time to instal the telephone, the person in question is approached and a sum of money is demanded from him.  Even though he pays the sum in question by cheque to the Department, and the cheque is cashed, it is possible that that person will wait as long as six months before the telephone is installed.  I condemn that because I believe, once the money is demanded and paid, the person concerned should <Col N="2139" /> at least be given an indication when the work will commence on the installation of that telephone.  We have a huge waiting list and progress is rather slow.  That is why I suggested to the Minister, at the outset, that the erection of telephone kiosks could provide a very useful service for those people, particularly those who have been waiting for a long time.  I feel this is not a good system and is something which should be discontinued immediately.</P>
    <P>We have had a discussion here for the past few days on Telefís Éireann. I believe that no matter what Minister sits opposite, this service will never be perfected.  It is impossible to suit all the people and I believe, further, that what may suit one section of the people may not suit another.  By and large Telefís Éireann is doing a good job.  I should like to draw the Minister's attention to one programme put on recently known as &ldquo;Discovery&rdquo;.  In the preparation of this programme, they visited the town of Kinsale in my constituency where industries there were filmed, reported on and shown to viewers.  It was rather amazing that in this town&mdash;where there are three industries, two of which are German, and one native&mdash;which never received one penny of State aid of any kind and employing 38 males receiving a large wage&mdash;this was completely omitted from that programme. I do not blame the Minister but I believe this caused quite a lot of uneasiness and bitterness in the town of Kinsale.  The industry I referred to was Henry Good and Sons, millers and supermarkets who employ 38 men.  It is regrettable that this should have happened, that foreign industries who came into Kinsale and were helped to erect their factories and install their machinery with State aid were included in the programme while the oldest industry in Kinsale was omitted.  That should not happen.  I do not know whether it was an oversight on the part of the people concerned, but it caused a lot of uneasiness in this town.</P>
    <P>I have already drawn the Minister's attention to Farnanes in County Cork where television reception is so bad <Col N="2140" /> at times that people have to switch off their sets.  Deputy Molloy also referred to this in relation to Connemara.  I am sure the Minister and everyone in the House will agree that there is nothing more annoying or more aggravating when you are interested in a programme than the reception being so bad that you have to switch off your set.  It is incumbent on the Minister or RTE to rectify this immediately. Television can be a great source of entertainment particularly in the country, with news and all forms of entertainment brought into the houses of people who are not in a position to avail of the entertainments in the towns and villages.</P>
    <P>Television provides an essential service, so far as entertainment is concerned for the people in rural Ireland. These people have to pay for their licences and they have to pay through taxation for the provision of this service. When it is not provided, I believe this money is collected under false pretences.  This should be rectified immediately.  I have taken it up with the Minister already and I have not heard of any progress being made.  If the Minister makes inquiries, he will find that what I am saying will be borne out by the people in that locality. It is disgraceful.  Several complaints have been made to me and to other Deputies from mid-Cork, that these people will refuse to pay their television licences in the future.</P>
    <P>As I said, regardless of what Minister is sitting over there, this service will never be perfect.  It has been suggested that there are programmes early in the night which are not suitable for children.  Some programmes can be of great educational value to schoolgoing children, but there should be some dividing line between programmes presented for the benefit of children, education-wise or otherwise, and programmes presented for the entertainment of adults.  We are all aware that what Deputy Corry described as &ldquo;sloppy stuff&rdquo; appears on television from time to time and is not suitable for schoolgoing children.  Of course it can be said that there is always the off-switch, and that the parents can tell <Col N="2141" /> the children that a programme is not suitable and they should not watch it, but very often the children and parents are in the same room with the television set, and it is rather difficult, particularly in the case of children aged eight, nine, ten and 11, to prevent them from watching certain programmes.  I put this to the Minister in the form of a suggestion and I think it would be worth his while having a look at it.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Molloy, I should like to compliment the people responsible for the presentation of sporting programmes. They are very well done and a majority of the people look forward to them and are pleased with them.</P>
    <P>Deputies on this side of the House dealt very adequately with interference by members of the Government in the presentation of certain programmes.  I believe that a Minister, the same as anyone else, has the right and the privilege to protest, but when we reach the stage where a Minister of State interferes with the presentation of a programme and tries to manipulate that programme for his personal advantage, or his Government's advantage, that is a sorrowful state of affairs. It should not happen, and it has been condemned by a large number of people inside and outside the House. I hope it will not occur again, and I hope the Minister will explain to the House what happened on that occasion.</P>
    <P>I want to return again to sub-post offices and postmen generally, and I want the Minister to make a ruling on this.  There was a case recently where a postman who was actively engaged with a political Party was severely reprimanded by his postmaster.  I should like to know from the Minister can these postmen take part in politics and associate themselves actively with a political Party?  I was amazed to find that in one place a postman was severely reprimanded for taking an active part in politics, while in another part of my constituency, another postman who was actively associated with a different political Party got promotion. If the Minister doubts the validity of my statement, I can supply him with <Col N="2142" /> the names of the people concerned, and with the name of the postmaster who issued the reprimand.  It may be that there is a distinction so far as status is concerned, but I should like the Minister to tell me what the position is so far as postmen who take part in politics are concerned.  Can they be actively associated with any political Party?  I believe that postmen, the same as anyone else, have a right to give vent to their political feelings regardless of what political Party they may belong to.</P>
    <P>I hope that the points I have brought to the Minister's attention will at least be considered.  This has given me an opportunity of which I am glad to avail of drawing the Minister's attention to those problems.  There are many as far as the postal service is concerned but they are mostly trivial and can be dealt with at local level rather than taking the time of the House to bring them to the Minister's attention here.  It is my experience in general that the delivery services provided by the Post Office are quite good.  I have no complaints in that direction.  Good services are provided for the people. In this respect I should like to pay a particular tribute to postmen, particularly in rural areas, who carry out their duties in all kinds of weather, delivering letters and parcels to remote districts. I should, however, like to add to that a reminder that many of those men, particularly the unestablished section, are very poorly paid for the very hard work they do in difficult circumstances.  I hope the Minister will see to it that they are better paid for the valuable service they render.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall open my remarks by paying a tribute to the Minister for the magnificent work and the many improvements he has carried out during the past year.  Last year the postal service in my part of the city was hopeless.  The first post arrived at 10 a.m. when most people had left for their businesses and therefore a whole day elapsed before they got their post. There has been a tremendous improvement in this and in connection with it, I should like to express appreciation of the postmen, a most efficient and <Col N="2143" /> hardworking body of men who do everything possible to facilitate the people.</P>
      <P>I cannot agree with the attitude of the Department on the question of the installation of public telephone kiosks in the city.  I have it on record from the Department that they will not provide a public telephone kiosk unless there is a prospect that it will pay its way.  I wish to emphasise that the availability of a telephone in a public place can be the means of saving a life in an emergency and why should it be suggested that we should put a cash value on a human life?  Even if the public kiosk service is to be run at a deficit, we should provide it adequately and I earnestly ask the Minister to review the Department's policy on this matter.  If a good public phone service is provided, the public will appreciate it.  Practically every Deputy receives letters asking him to make representations to have telephone kiosks installed in his area.  Invariably he gets the answer &ldquo;No; it would be uneconomic, and we shall not provide it.&rdquo;  I feel sure the loss on a single kiosk would not be very great.  It certainly would not outweigh the risk that a single life might be lost for lack of a telephone in times of emergency. That should be our criterion.</P>
      <P>To get back to the work of the Department in general, there is hardly a more successful organisation in the State set-up.  The service provided by the Post Office is the oldest we have in the public sphere and it continues to be an efficient one.  When one enters the realm of the television service, however, one must be critical about certain matters even if one can praise others.  We have heard much criticism during the debate of the Minister making representations to the television Authority about some programme. The Minister has a perfect right to do so as has any Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Opposition have been bleating about this matter.  They are very naïve if they think they can put it across publicly that the Labour Party and the Fine Gael Party do not put pressure on Radio Telefís Éireann.  They may not <Col N="2144" /> do it publicly but everyone knows they have various contacts through which they can make representations.  I do not know if they are listened to but they make representations at all times, and who can blame them for doing so if they think they are not getting a fair crack of the whip?  Telefís Éireann is the most powerfull medium of communication in the country and any Party in power will be suspect and there will be criticisms that the service is not impartial.  However, as the standard of our appreciation increases, we shall realise more and more the good work Radio Telefís Éireann are trying to do.</P>
    <P>There is one aspect of television broadcasting in this country which perturbs many people.  It is the accent on alcohol advertising.  There are numerous advertisements which give the picture to our youth that they are not with it unless they are seen in a public house with glasses of beer or whiskey in their hands.  That is a totally wrong impression to give to our youth.  I am glad to say that here we have the largest proportion of non-drinkers in the world.  Many of these slick advertisements try to sell foreign drinks and young people are shown on the screen sitting in pubs.  Now they have invaded even the sports pavilions, though we all know that in a sports pavilion after a match, none of the players changing from togs drinks anything stronger than water.  There may be some drinking in the bar afterwards.  I suggest that the Minister should urge the Authority strongly to change their attitude in this respect.  It is doing untold harm to our youth.  Perhaps these advertisements bring in a lot of money but it is a high price to pay for a monster.</P>
    <P>There are also advertisements about medicinal cure-alls which are nothing but rubbish.  We realise Telefís Éireann must get money from advertisements but surely they must have some sense of proportion?  I suggest there should be some censorship of these advertisements because the whole idea of the people who sponsor them is to make money, and if this is done at the expense of the physical or spiritual <Col N="2145" /> welfare of our people, they do not care a whit.  Their idea is to make money and they do not care very much how they do it.  Another branch of television advertising is in respect of detergents. It is nauseating to have to listen to some of them, prepared in England for audiences in Leeds or Durham or somewhere else.  A great number of the products so advertised are fake.  Many of the people subjected to this barrage go out to shop and will not buy a detergent which is not in the so-called popular line.</P>
    <P>If we are to have an intelligent service which represents our thinking and what we believe should be our outlook, we have got to take a very hard look at these matters.  It would be much better if we increased taxation in some way and were able to forgo those advertisements.  I am not in the least a prude about those things but our young people are looking at those advertisements every night and some of them go beyond the bounds of good taste.</P>
    <P>Some time ago a newspaper mentioned that advertisements on television should be reviewed and certain ones taken off.  Despite this, they are going on as merrily as ever and as scandalously as ever.  Many years ago when parents were rearing their families, they always tried to keep them on the straight and narrow path by refusing to allow them to go to certain types of amusements.  That day has gone now and we have certain people shown on Telefís Éireann as celebrities.</P>
    <P>Not long ago on a Saturday night a person was brought on from across the Channel.  She was hailed as being what youth should be.  I never heard of that person before and I am sure plenty viewers never heard of her. That person was brought on and was feted on the show.  The following week this person was involved in a most scandalous case in London.  This must have been known to the people in Ireland who put on that show.  We criticise our young people today but what can we expect from them when our national broadcasting service <Col N="2146" /> brings such a nonentity over here whose only claim to fame is notoriety?</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Authority have a grave duty when bringing a television service into the homes of our people.  They must ensure that such a service will not do untold harm to our young people.  For years we have tried to build up a nation of which we could be proud but then we come along and provide the gravest influence for our young people it is possible to have.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies mentioned the sports coverage on Telefís Éireann.  I admit that generally it is very good indeed but I consider that certain sports are not being given a fair crack of the whip.  I do not consider that Association Football is being given any kind of fair showing.  Another sport, which is mainly for a minority of people, but which is a good manly sport, rowing, is seldom shown.  Despite the fact that we have about 20 regattas throughout the season one seldom sees rowing shown on Telefís Éireann.  I do not see why we cater only for the majority.</P>
    <P>Now, more than ever, it is necessary that we show to the youth of the country what sport can really be and what it can do for them.  I have noticed that while Telefís Éireann are quite content to accept the BBC commentator on horseracing in England, if there is show jumping on in England, we have to send a sports commentator over, whose continued references to Royalty present is absolutely nauseating.  People want to see the horse jumping.  They do not want to see the VIPs present.  It is the horses they are interested in.  If Telefís Éireann accept a BBC commentator when horseracing is shown, it is unreasonable to see why we should send a team over there when show jumping is on.</P>
    <P>When I was going to school, I remember there was always somebody in class who used Anglo-Saxon words to shock the rest of us.  I referred to this matter before and because I did so, a political commentator seemed to think I was suffering from <Col N="2147" /> some kind of frustration.  I certainly was not suffering from any kind of frustration.  It is more likely this commentator was.  It is deplorable in times when we are trying to improve our youth that we have this obsession with James Joyce on Telefís Éireann and this use of Anglo-Saxon words. Parents have to correct their children when they use such words.</P>
    <P>Deputy Molloy mentioned the long-haired people who appear on Telefís Éireann.  I presume he was talking about the male long-haired people. Those people should have a label put on them when they appear on Telefís Éireann so that we can identify their sex.  This would help things a lot.  I consider Telefís Éireann should get away from the arty clique and put on people who matter, ordinary down to earth people.  The vast majority of our people are down to earth.</P>
    <P>It may sound strange from a city man when I say that the programmes which cater for agriculture are tremendously popular with city people.  It is probably the fault of our educational system that people in the city do not know anything about agriculture.  The programmes which deal in a dramatic way with the agricultural scene are appreciated very much by city people and more of those programmes should be put on.  I am also told that the serial play, &ldquo;Tolka Row&rdquo;, which is essentially a Dublin play, is tremendously popular in the rural parts of the country.  Telefís Éireann, in this aspect, is trying to strike a balance.  Despite this, we still have to take a much more critical view of television than we have been taking up to the present.  We are inclined to sit back and say that it is a new station.  We know it is a new station but we should ensure that the finest programmes are put on.  I would ask the Minister to speak with the Authority about the matters I have referred to.</P>
    <P>The Authority have been much maligned by the Opposition who say they are supporters of Fianna Fáil.  I do not know if they are, but if there were another Government sitting here, probably others would say that the <Col N="2148" /> Authority were supporters of that Party.  This is human nature and this thing will go on all the time.  We will never have a perfect television service. We are inclined to blame its imperfections on the fact that we are not given everything we want.</P>
    <P>The news service given by Telefís Éireann is very good but as one Labour representative mentioned, when the news is given in Irish, why must the announcer speak so fast?  I have diligently tried to follow the Irish news every night but I have found it almost impossible.  It seems that if they do not get finished by 11 o'clock or 11.30 they face the crack of doom.  They could take things much more slowly. There are a great number of people who can follow everything said through Irish but there are also many people who want to follow the news in Irish but just cannot do so because of the speed at which those people speak. In conclusion, I would again commend the Minister on the work he has done during the year and ask him to examine the points I have made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a debate which draws forth annually congratulations and criticisms in varying degrees but I hope that my first criticism will not be regarded by the Minister as an effort to do him out of a job.  This is a Department which I believe could well be amalgamated with another and thus reduce the administrative cost as well as the Ministerial cost.  I have always held the view that, now that Radio Telefís Éireann is under the control, if it is, of an independent Authority, there is nothing much left to the Post Office except the sale of stamps and the provision and organisation of telephones, plus the sending of telegrams, and all that is something I think which largely falls under the heading of commerce and could, therefore, well be amalgamated with CIE and the various other State bodies, all to be run together under a heading like &ldquo;Telecommunications&rdquo; or just simply &ldquo;Communications&rdquo;.  I have no desire that the present Minister should be deprived of a job; I am quite sure he would be retained under the new order I advocate and lesser people might <Col N="2149" /> then be relegated to a position in which great demand would not be made upon the wrong exercise of functions.</P>
      <P>It is good to know that Deputy Molloy finds the sub-post offices of Galway and Connemara in such wonderful working order.  I suppose it is no harm for a Deputy to pay a compliment to this little network, of no mean importance in his constituency, but the fact is, of course, that what he has described as obtaining in Galway is equally true of the whole country.  Nowadays in very few places has one to wait more than the following morning for a letter posted in reasonably good time the day before anywhere else.  The courtesy extended, not just from time to time, but invariably, by subpostmasters and subpostmistresses is well known. That is particularly true in cases of emergency.  They cope successfully with the publicity requirements of people who row across the Atlantic and, more important still, whenever there is an occasion of sadness, or an emergency involving sickness or accident, these people rally round in a most marvellous way and bring into play all the services at their disposal with quite wonderful efficiency.  If there is a complaint about any individual person or any individual office, the fact is that kind of person would be difficult anywhere else too.  That is true of all human relations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The subpostmasters, subpostmistresses, postmen, linesmen and all others involved provide an excellent service.  The only criticism would appear to be that which was referred to by Deputy Creed a short time ago &mdash;the slowness of providing telephones and, more particularly, the fact that the Department accepts the money, a great deal of money in certain cases, and then fails for months to provide the service for which that money was intended.  I know that kind of thing may happen in other businesses, but I doubt that the delay would be as long.  It is wrong that the delay should be so great or that the money should be accepted at a time when it must be well known to the particular branch <Col N="2150" /> of the Department that the service cannot be provided.  Some provision should be made, particularly when they ask for money for so many years in advance, to ensure that the cheque will not be cashed until reasonably near the time when the service can be provided.</P>
    <P>I know of some isolated instances in this connection.  The people concerned are growing more and more annoyed as each day passes.  There may be difficulty in the provision of equipment. There may be&mdash;I am sure there are&mdash; financial difficulties.  There may be shortage of staff.  There may be more calls being made upon the minimum staff but, all in all, I think it is something in which half-way measures could be employed.  Let me say at once that I deplore the present practice&mdash;it has been in operation now for some little time&mdash;under which so many years in advance of the rental is demanded before a telephone service will be offered.  I do not think the telephone is on a par with hire purchase because, as far as I know, one never owns one's telephone.  One simply rents it for ever and ever.  It is there.  There is one certain way of being deprived of it and that is not to pay one's bill at the right time.</P>
    <P>Some years ago a question was asked here about the average delay by the exchange on dialling 10 for trunk calls.  The answer given at the time by the then incumbent of the office, Deputy Hilliard, was that it was an average of 11 seconds.  Personally, I have spent 11 minutes, and more, waiting for the exchange to answer. Is that due to shortage of staff?  Is it due to the fact that the staff cannot get around to the calls?  Is it due to the fact that there are not enough people to deal with them?  Or is it due to some kind of slow-up deliberately planned inside?  That view has been put to me from time to time; I have been told it is a deliberate slow-up on the inside.  I find it very difficult to accept that because, when I eventually get through to either a supervisor or an operator, I meet with nothing but the greatest courtesy and help. <Col N="2151" /> The delay in between is what I should like to have explained because there is certainly no indication from the other end of any impatience, irritation or discourtesy, and these would be the normal consequences of deliberate delay.</P>
    <P>One thing that is very irritating to the subscriber is that, when one is going through the almost coronary process of waiting for an answer to a call, and one asks to whom one is speaking, the male or female operator immediately says: &ldquo;We are not allowed to give names.&rdquo; I do not know what the regulation is governing that but it would seem to me that, where there is a case of genuine complaint on the part of a member of the public, it should be possible for him or her, as the case may be, to direct that complaint, to be examined on its merits, against a particular official. Now, this is not very prevalent by any means but I should like to know what the regulation is, why it is there and why somebody is protected at the other end of the telephone line.</P>
    <P>As I have said, there is very little in the Post Office proper, as we know it at the moment, except stamps, telephones, and that.  There would appear to be very little complaint, as I have said, in relation to these and there appears to be very little necessity for what I describe as the preponderance of Ministerial direction in dealing with a commercial enterprise of that kind. The Post Office could easily be amalgamated with another Department.</P>
    <P>In connection with Radio Telefís Éireann, I welcome the improvement not alone in the extent of the programmes provided but also in the quality.  It is a pity, I think, that the visual side has tended to turn our attention away from sound.  Many excellent sound programmes are lost in our anxiety not alone to hear but to see.  That is all I have to say about the sound part of broadcasting, but it is appropriate to make some mention here of the public concern centred round the cessation of the services of the distinguished musical director, Mr. Tibor Paul.  I am not musical and I <Col N="2152" /> would not therefore be regarded as as sensitive as those who are so blessed with the gift of discerning and appreciating a variety of sound, as my distinguished colleague, Deputy Dockrell, is blessed.  He is a master not alone of sound but of the five-finger exercise as well.  Surely it should have been possible for the Authority, in determining the manner and the time this distinguished musician's services would end, to have been more tactful and more sensitive and not to have given notice when the man was actually about to go on stage, as it were, to conduct a very important musical event in the RDS?  Even a civil bill officer would have more discretion.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister will be able to tell us something more about that when he is concluding.  I hope he will, and I hope he will be able to reassure the public and allay their concern about this whole matter.  Indeed, on a very murky democratic horizon that obtains in this respect, I am very happy to say that the only bright light that appeared in the course of this whole thing was the very simple, very honest and very brave expression of opinion by Mrs. Aiken, the wife of the Minister for External Affairs.  It is a healthy sign but it is to be deplored that it was the only healthy sign there was.  It would be a good thing if other Ministerial wives were equally honest and equally brave and thus influence their husbands in the Front Bench of this Government.</P>
    <P>Now we move on to what is probably the real matter of controversy in these times, that is, Telefís Éireann itself.  I listened with some amusement, with some dismay and with more than a little curiosity to both Deputy Molloy and Deputy Moore deploring certain things that, in their view, are calculated to corrupt the youth of this country.  Deputy Molloy does not like the idea of tin-pot actresses being put on the Late Late Show.  Were it not for the fact that I did not want to interrupt him, I would have loved to have asked for a definition of &ldquo;tin-pot actress&rdquo;.  It has many charming and not so charming possibilities on investigation, especially on a Late Late Show.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>For the time being. Well, the box office regulates the lives, both public and private, of actresses, tin-pot or otherwise.  In any event, I have no intention of engaging with the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs on the relative merits of actresses, tin-pot or otherwise.  We had Deputy Moore complaining about some actress being brought on to the Late Late Show and held out as a model for young people who later was involved in some scandal in London and that it was an awful thing entirely that this should have happened, that Radio Telefís Éireann should have known she was likely to be so embroiled before they asked her on.  He did not tell us anything about her and we did not know anything about her&mdash;a pity&mdash;and accordingly I cannot say anything more about this.</P>
      <P>However, if we are to be subjected to the process of having to screen everybody before he or she is brought on to Telefís Éireann, somebody who happens to be in Dublin, who is altogether blameless in the view of people in Telefís Éireann, and who is asked to appear, well, God knows their task is difficult enough selecting people to come on and make the show enjoyable, as I would say it is, by and large, every Saturday night, without that.  Sometimes I think the great grievance probably is that the same people come on the show for too long, the same panel at any rate, that there should be a greater variety.  I find myself in agreement with Deputy Molloy that possibly a more extended use could be made of local talent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Moore made an attack on television advertisements.  Well, we cannot have it both ways.  We collect <Col N="2154" /> a large amount of revenue from the sales of tobacco and drink and what is needed in this country is not the power-assisted brakes being put on everything but to tell people how to drink and enjoy it and to know when to stop.  That would be better than putting on a brake that may fail at any given time, with disastrous results. A little and frequently is probably the better idea than complete cessation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moore is also disturbed about advertising of detergents.  Is it not a refinement of the black doctor at the country fair selling cures for headaches?  Deputy Moore says it is all rubbish.  If these people are prepared to pay Radio Telefís Éireann their advertising prices, and if a certain number of gullible people believe in buying these harmless things, there is no great harm done to anybody and Telefís Éireann is the richer.  We cannot be putting our heads in the sand about these matters.  We have to face up to the fact that we are a drink-producing country, that we produce the best beer in the world and the best whiskey, and why cannot we advertise them even to our own people who must be expected to consume them if we expect people outside to take our exports from us?</P>
    <P>There are a number of programmes to which I should like to refer, one of which is the Irish programme &ldquo;Iarphroinn&rdquo; which I think is a decided success.  It is very good and people are brought on who are competent and interesting and who discuss the subject facilely and in a brand of Irish that is extremely easy to understand.  So far it has been a great success and I hope the producers will continue in the same manner.</P>
    <P>I have to return now to Deputy Moore who spoke on James Joyce and deplored the use of Anglo-Saxon words.  I do not know why there is this terrible fear of Anglo-Saxon words.  If the Deputy cares to have a look through some of the old Irish poetry and some of the medieval Irish writings, and even some of the modern Irish writings, he will find words that James Joyce would probably have been glad to use.  Let us get away from this <Col N="2155" /> nonsense and hypocrisy that we are the great people of the earth and that Anglo-Saxon influence and Anglo-Saxon words might corrupt us in some ways.  We are a very human people, a very human part of a very human Celtic race, with all their tendencies and susceptibilities.  As somebody said recently, and I think it summed up our whole moral attitude: &ldquo;For a fairly drunken country, is drink not a great stigma?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The big talking point of the moment is Telefís Éireann and interference by Ministers and people in high places and the counter-allegations that former Ministers and Deputies in Opposition have their own particular contacts in Telefís Éireann.  I can speak on this subject as one who has been in the Telefís Éireann building once, who has appeared on television once and who has never interfered or asked anybody in Telefís Éireann to do anything for me or do anything against anybody else.  It is a very natural thing to have a contact, and equally natural to use the contact, but it is a most improper thing to abuse that contact, not only for one's own advantage but particularly for the detriment of one's adversary at any time.</P>
    <P>A controversy such as this is not a good thing for an infant institution like Telefís Éireann.  If I may say by way of aside, I think at this stage, the station's greatest difficulty, and one which it must try to overcome as soon as possible, is the fact that in the public mind in ever-increasing volume and with, apparently, increasing validity as each day passes, it is the subject of suspicion, suspicion arising from the allegations and counter-allegations of interfering hands from without, from other allegations that there are ready, receiving hands within and suspicion, finally, throughout the whole country that Telefís Éireann has become the nest of small sets or cliques of near-politicals, some intellectuals and of many more pseudo-intellectuals, and that all of them are in a close and confined group which has become in itself already a little vested interest into the realms of which no outsider dare poke his nose.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2156" /> I hope I have given a fair assessment of what the public think in this regard at present.  The people are thinking in an atmosphere of suspicion of the kind to which I refer and if that suspicion is allowed to grow and get a grip, it will do the service no good.  It will destroy any, if not all of the advantages it has for the viewing population because it will not be accepted as giving a proper, forthright view either in feature programmes or in news presentation.</P>
    <P>Section 18 of the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960 says:</P>
    <P>It shall be the duty of the Authority to secure that, when it broadcasts any information, news or feature which relates to matters of public controversy, or is the subject of current public debate, the information, news or feature is presented objectively and impartially, without any expression of the Authority's own views.</P>
    <P>It is equally true that the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs has authority to intervene in writing with the Authority when he, in his carefully considered exercise of discretion, thinks fit, but nobody else has that right.  We all have the right, as Deputy Creed said, to ring up and complain and make our point but we have no right to tell anybody in Telefís Éireann, whether reporter, technician or operator at any level, or executive or administrator, to take off one programme and substitute another, to change the order of programmes or suppress any news.</P>
    <P>There seems no doubt that very recently the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries has been in touch with RTE with a view to having his own point of view on the retention of young cattle by farmers to a later time given prominence over an NFA statement. That is putting it at its mildest.  I am not concerned in this debate or at this time with the merits of the dispute between the Minister and the farmers. We are concerned with freedom of expression on Telefís Éireann and we feel that freedom should certainly be no less than that, not alone enjoyed but diligently exercised, by the NUJ in the newspapers.  It is equally clear that <Col N="2157" /> the NUJ took exception to this interference by the Minister and that after careful deliberation, they sought an interview with the Taoiseach and with the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and that both requests were refused.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many discussions involving that Minister at the moment but, according to my information, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs refused, according to a report in the <i>Irish Times</i> on Wednesday, 26th October, 1966, to receive a deputation from the NUJ to discuss this interference with RTE and he refused.  I think I should be permitted to say that a refusal of this kind&mdash;I am saying this in a general way, without reference to any particular Minister&mdash;to receive a properly organised deputation should be deplored, and that some people refer to it as arrogance, but there are other words which could be applied to it probably more so.</P>
      <P>This matter has received considerable criticism both in the daily Press and in other publications.  There is a very interesting and a very strong expression of opinion in this regard in Ireland's <i>Catholic Standard</i> of October 7th, 1966, and I quote:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Telefís Éireann allowed itself to <Col N="2158" /> be influenced by this interference to the extent of omitting the NFA statement from one of its news broadcasts.  The National Union of Journalists protested, quite properly. The Director General of Telefís Éireann admits that there was an error of judgment on their part.</P>
    <P>Then it goes on to say:</P>
    <P>We have expressed most vigorously the necessity for the complete independence of the television and radio news services because they are so readily open to Government pressures.  We believe that the vigilance of the journalists in the TE news department was necessary and courageous on this occasion.</P>
    <P>I need hardly say that I endorse that view completely, and it is a very good follow-up of a former occasion when the Press Gallery of this House had to take a similar stand with regard to what they saw, what they heard, what they wrote and what their papers printed.</P>
    <P>The article continues:</P>
    <P>The public must view with some concern Mr. Haughey's approaches to Telefís Éireann and are unlikely to accept with complete confidence the assurances of the TE Director, Mr. Kevin McCourt, given during the address to the Dublin Chamber of Commerce on Monday.</P>
    <P>It is not necessary for anybody to lay down the principle which has operated all down the years from the very beginning of newspapers and from the very beginning of the development of media of this kind, that there must be freedom of expression, unless, of course, that freedom of expression offends against public morality or against some aspect of the statutory provisions in relation to criminal libel or the like.  Freedom of expression is a very important thing not alone for the individual, not alone for groups, but particularly for those media of communication that are to be regarded, until the contrary is proved to the hilt, as responsible, informed and informing, and I regard our newspapers at national and local level as having those qualities.</P>
    <P>Is it too much to expect that <Col N="2159" /> Radio Telefís Éireann, as a more powerful medium of communication with a more influencing effect on more and more people, should conform with these simple principles enshrined in the freedom of expression which the Press has enjoyed down the years? I do not think the Taoiseach has any right, in spite of his exalted position as Leader of the Government, to state an improper principle here, contrary to the provision of the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960, which laid down the principle that the Authority, subject to intervention by a discreet Minister properly exercising his rights, has not alone the right but the duty to give an impartial and objective presentation of news.  I do not accept that the Taoiseach or any other person has the right to say that the Government have an overall responsibility for this matter and that the Government, through any one of its members, can interfere at any time with the working of a station such as this or, indeed, with the working of any State body.</P>
    <P>We hear from time to time the Minister for Transport and Power answering question after question with the invariable phrase that he has no function in the matter.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs has one function and he must exercise it in writing in relation to this Authority, and that is all.  The Taoiseach has none, never had any and should not have any, and certainly should not have spoken in such a manner as to make the House and the country believe that somewhere within the framework of the Broadcasting Authority Act, he has some kind of queer power that nobody else can find in the legislation.</P>
    <P>The people cannot be expected to respect institutions, cannot be expected to respond to exhortations about the preservation of democracy in other spheres, as the Taoiseach exhorted them yesterday, if one of the instruments of democracy, Telefís Éireann, is to be exposed to intervention by the Taoiseach, by his Government as a whole or by individual Ministers with his backing and approval.  I say to this <Col N="2160" /> Government and to the Taoiseach: &ldquo;Take your hands off this medium. Stay with the medium over which you exercise control, your national press, the <i>Irish Press,</i> with the <i>Sunday Press</i> and the <i>Evening Press</i>.  That is your paper and give as much publicity as you want to give to all of your occasions, all of your propaganda in that paper.  But do not use the people's money that was used to set up Telefís Éireann for the benefit of one Party or for the benefit of one person as was evidenced in the Presidential election of last May.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I wonder how many times the President of this country appeared on television in the month of May in 1965, 1964 or in 1963 whereas he was appearing once, twice, three and four times a day during the month of May, 1966, and where he was given a back door piece of publicity in a Presidential campaign. I do not think that is evidence of lack of interference either.  The Radio Éireann Authority said they decided not to cover the Presidential election campaign.  They should have clamped down on everybody, but, of course, the answer is that the President would have to get publicity any way.  An interesting comparison would be the number of times there were appearances in the month of May in the years prior to 1965.  Of course, it is very difficult to divorce this from the feeling that exists in the country that all of this publicity for the Presidential election campaign was being afforded, not to an independent Presidential candidate but to the titular head of the Fianna Fáil Party who has never removed himself from that position, even right up to the present time.</P>
    <P>That is all I have to say on the question of interference in regard to this medium of mass communication. This is an infant station doing very well.  In my one and only visit there, I could not help being impressed by, not alone the courtesy and the helpfulness, but the quiet efficiency of every person there in the execution of the job allotted to him.  There, I felt, was a dedicated little band of men anxious to give to the Irish public the best possible service that they, in their <Col N="2161" /> knowledge and experience, could give. Do not interfere with them.  Leave them alone.  Let them progress from what people are inclined, not alone to concede, but to assert, will always be an imperfect station.  I do not subscribe to that view.  It is imperfect now.  Its imperfection has been growing less.  The only remaining real imperfection is the interference of the Fianna Fáil Party in an effort to monopolise that station as their sole medium of expression.</P>

      <P>At the commencement of the debate, I gave a very comprehensive statement which, I regret to say, obviously, was not studied very closely by the Deputies who have spoken.  My statement covered the ground pretty well and factually in relation to the working of all sections of my Department.  I do not believe that those Deputies who referred to the Department as being of little importance could possibly have studied the report.  In that respect, the first speaker for the Opposition, Deputy Dockrell, covered the ground very well and, by his own lights, very reasonably.  He suggested that the Fine Gael policy in relation to telephones&mdash;he also suggested that the postal services should also be examined&mdash;was that the Department should be handed over to some semi-State body on account of its being such a huge undertaking.  The last speaker, Deputy Lindsay, for the same Party, suggested that the Department was going so well and was of such little importance, actually only selling stamps, that it should be amalgamated with some other Department.  I take it, then, that Fine Gael have no policy with regard to my Department, nor would I expect them to be able easily to state what their intentions are.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take Deputy Dockrell's word that they have made some decision in that respect.</P>
      <P>I was rather disappointed that Deputies did not pay tribute to the postal services because most of the Deputies who spoke are people who have had occasion in one way or another to examine the services offered by other countries.  All of us have been abroad time and again and the postal service is one of the things we are sure to rub up against immediately we go to any other country.  I can safely say that the postal services in this country compare favourably with those of any country in the world and are better than most.</P>
      <P>One has an occasional complaint about delay in the delivery of a letter or parcel and on investigation, in most cases, it is found that the letter or parcel has not been properly addressed. Nevertheless, it is a complaint and the public gets one side of the complaint only.  We receive compliments also. Somebody wrote to me recently paying tribute because he had posted a letter to a relative in Sandycove at 12 noon and the letter had been delivered before 4 p.m. the same day.  That is quite good by any standards.  I take it that these are not isolated cases.  The service goes well.</P>
      <P>As to those people who talk about the Department's relative unimportance, we do not vote in this House £20 million odd and expend it on over 18,000 people and a lot of stores and equipment and we have not been investing State money in the service to the extent of millions and millions over the past number of years just to pass it over lightly and say that we are prepared to throw it to any other concern that would be prepared to run it.  The people who make that suggestion either do not know what is involved or have not taken the trouble, or perhaps have not had the opportunity, to examine it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The State has a huge amount of money invested in the telephone service.  This is the important factor: those people who talk about handing over the running of the service to some other body, corporation or outside authority, do not make any attempt to <Col N="2163" /> explain how that would improve the service.  Supposing we did hand over to a State-sponsored organisation similar to the other State bodies, we would still have to give them money to run the service; they would still have to get the necessary capital.  If anyone is prepared to allow me to increase charges to the extent where they would provide all the capital necessary to give an immediate service in the case of, say, telephone installations, then I would be very happy to come into the House with proposals for the necessary increases.</P>
    <P>The Post Office is run as a commercial concern, although its revenue is handed over to the Exchequer in the ordinary way, but we do keep commercial accounts and, by and large, the service is run on commercial lines and, one year with another, is expected to pay its way.  The increased demand on the telephone side is the matter which causes the most complaint and, indeed, frequently provides material for journalists when they are short of other copy.  That does not apply exclusively to this country.  People who sympathise with me occasionally send me magazines and newspapers from various countries carrying articles attacking their telephone system, the lack of courtesy of manual operators and the failure of the automatic system to respond when overloaded.  These are of some consolation to me but do not in any way take away from the fact that I appreciate effort must be made to continue to improve the system.</P>
    <P>In the past five years we spent £23½ million on telephones as compared with £7¾ million in the previous five years.  That is a substantial increase but it is not nearly enough to meet the decided acceleration we would like to have in the whole organisation of the telephone system. As should be mentioned on every occasion possible, this is not a question of money alone.  The human element and the facilities for the training of personnel come into it very much.  Four years of training are <Col N="2164" /> required before the average telephone technician is of much use.  The number being trained each year is increasing as rapidly as training facilities permit.</P>
    <P>There are other factors.  The acquisition of sites for buildings, particularly exchanges, the laying of cables and so on all necessitate contracts, the delivery of equipment, the provision of wayleaves are things which no corporate body, whether State-sponsored or private, can overcome any quicker than our engineering section at present.  We have examined this carefully because we are not opposed to any change in the system which would improve the rate of growth at present without putting an undue burden on the public who have to pay.  These are all inter-related considerations. We have endeavoured to keep the charges as low as possible consistent with the provision of capital to meet the cost of expanding the system.</P>
    <P>The question may be asked why somebody had not the foresight ten years ago to make provision for long-term planning.  I could visualise what the position would be if the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs walked into this House ten years ago and asked for £50 million to make provision for long-term planning for the development of the telephone system.  Installations in those days would be comparatively small, whereas in the year under review, although we installed 13,500 telephones we reduced the waiting list by only a comparatively small number because the applications come rolling in every day.  This is progressive.  Every time we instal a few telephones it means more applications come in. When your brothers or your cousins have a telephone, you want to have one as well.</P>
    <P>It is true we have a priority list and that priority must be given to such categories as the medical profession, clerics, Deputies, manufacturing industry and so forth, where we take into account the employment factor.  But generally we do not like to have the squads working on development moved <Col N="2165" /> around from Billy to Jack.  There should be as little interference as possible if we are to proceed in a methodical and organised way to clear up the backlog.  This year I was perhaps unfortunate in that we tackled all the old outstanding applications. Here again people very seldom know what is involved.  Most of these old applications were cases where the subscriber was a considerable distance from the exchange.  Very often in the country it necessitated the erection of miles of telephone lines costing a huge amount of money and taking up a tremendous amount of time.  We concentrated on clearing as many of these as possible in the past year and have done a considerable number.  We are now dealing with 1965-66.  When the figures for 1966-67 are available, they will not be as impressive numerically as I would like because they will include a large number of these difficult routes.  That is not to say, however, we did not deal with as many as possible on the priority list, the people anxious to get a telephone quickly in order to carry on their business, many of whom can hardly carry on at all without a telephone.</P>
    <P>In Dublin city we have many problems.  Some areas are poorly supplied with cabling and we must necessarily have delays until we have the cabling necessary for us to provide connection.  This very often applies to new housing schemes.  Now, however, the engineers are endeavouring to ensure that in all new schemes ducts are laid in the course of the erection of the scheme which enables them to put in the wires eventually, thus facilitating the installation of telephones.  We have reached the stage now where a telephone in a new house is just as essential as electricity or a bathroom.  Ideally when housing estates are erected, provision should be made at the same time for connection with the telephone system.  This would enable us to expedite the installation of telephones in the future.</P>
    <P>The telephone system has come under unfavourable comment and will continue to do so.  No matter how well our engineers do their work, there will always be criticism of the system.  We <Col N="2166" /> do not deny that some of this is justified. There are few of us who have not from time to time lost our patience and our temper with the telephone.  If we get 60 calls easily and have trouble with one, that is the one call we remember for the rest of the year and about which we write letters.  I get letters of complaint which always exaggerate to some degree.  They say &ldquo;My telephone never works.&rdquo; I ring up and find that it does work.  At the same time, I know they are experiencing some difficulty.  While we have had many complaints, it is remarkable the amount of tolerance there is and the huge number of people who appreciate they are dealing with a system not easily remedied and with which they must exercise as much patience as possible.  My greatest delight would be if during my time in the Department we should reach the stage where the installation of telephones would be carried out as soon as possible after application.  I say that because there must necessarily be some little delay.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal with the points made by different speakers before moving on to deal with other sections of the Department.  Many of the problems referred to were of common concern and, following my general remarks on the telephone service, I shall now deal only with the individual items raised.  Deputy Dockrell referred to temporary male night telephonists and said he would like to see a system whereby they would be established and the temporary aspect done away with.  Deputy James Tully referred to the same point.  The male night telephonists have an opportunity to compete for established positions if they have three years' service.  The Post Office Workers' Union have asked for certain changes in the conditions and these are being examined at the present time.  Indeed, this is something about which I am concerned, too.  I should like to see in these positions people who would regard the work as a career, who would be fully interested in it, who would not look on it as merely something passing and who would be prepared to give the fullest possible co-operation. That is the type of thing I should like to move towards and I <Col N="2167" /> hope we shall be able to accomplish it.</P>
    <P>In that respect, I should not pass on without referring to Deputy James Tully's comments on some of the buildings being gloomy and not as bright and attractive as they should be.  He did not actually say they were not in good order.  We have a scheme whereby decorations are carried out at regular intervals, interior and exterior.  These should suffice to ensure that buildings are kept up to a reasonable standard.  However, I shall have a look again at some of the buildings referred to to see to what extent there may be any truth in the statements made.  Nobody made any serious statement about this but all sections of the Department are concerned with giving the best possible conditions and continually keep improving them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think all the new buildings conform to the best modern standards.  Whether they are post offices or exchanges, I think they are a credit to the designers and to the contractors.  Any person who has had the pleasure of seeing some of these buildings&mdash;we open them pretty frequently throughout the country&mdash;will have to agree that they are up to the highest possible standard.</P>
      <P>Deputy James Tully referred to the new sorting office and complained that it is not fitted with a dust extractor. It is very difficult to know to what extreme one should go with a new building in order to have it absolutely perfect.  I have inspected this building, which is not yet ready for occupation but will be early in the new year, and I think it is as fine a job as could be carried out to give every amenity to the personnel working in it.</P>

      <P>The building is absolutely dust-free.  It has tiling, floor covering, polished floors&mdash;everything to ensure that dust will not be present. The only thing that is likely to cause dust in the building is the mailbags which come and go and special machinery has been installed for the purpose of extracting the dust from the bags so that they, too, will be free from dust.  After that, I think we have met the position fairly well.  In fact, I think we can regard it as the best sorting office of its type in Europe.  It will have cost £1 million, when occupied.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave details in my opening statement and I do not intend to elaborate further on it.  Before departing from the postal services, in deference to those who made reference to our stamps&mdash;a few people referred to stamps&mdash;I want to say that, by and large, our stamps are being received with general approval throughout the world.  I now have ready for submission to the Government a new series of permanent stamps which will be issued next year.  These designs, the House will notice, will have moved gradually, if not entirely&mdash;I do not want to get out of my depth here&mdash; towards modern art.  We have a very good stamp design committee who make these selections, who go into the matter very carefully and finally submit their selected designs to me and, in turn, I submit them to the Government. We have got these now and I <Col N="2169" /> propose to show not merely the designs selected as permanent issues for next year but to put on display the entire submissions by the various artists who competed for these designs.  I think There were nine or eleven artists in all. There were quite a few submissions, anyhow, and they will be most interesting. The stamps design committee have already made their selections.</P>
      <P>It is not always possible to meet demands for commemorative stamps. There is a limit to the distance one can go in this respect.  People frequently come up with new suggestions about centenary issues and suggestions that certain events are worthy of commemoration by a stamp.  These suggestions are all considered but, here again, some priorities have to be given and we can take on only a limited number each year.  As Deputies are aware, the current year has been one of the peak years for commemorative issues and, there again, I think the people were generally pleased with the designs.</P>
      <P>Before passing on from the general working of the Department, and telephones in particular, I should like to say that our efforts towards automatic working is something we try to keep going simultaneous with the meeting of applications for ordinary installations. When complaints are made about the rate of progress in the installation of telephones, the people making the complaints&mdash;I would hardly expect them to&mdash;seldom appreciate what is involved. If we were dealing with the installation of telephones alone, that would not be too difficult a task with the personnel available to us but there is the necessity to lay new cables simultaneously with the expansion of existing exchanges and switchboards, with the installation of new ones and with the bringing in of automatic working.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a huge amount of money involved here and I think a huge amount of trained personnel is necessary as well.  In my opening speech, I think those few lines which refer to the numbers employed on maintenance work alone is a fairly impressive account and is worthy of repetition now.  It said that when it is remembered that there are over 160,000 <Col N="2170" /> exchange lines, 1,100 exchanges, 10,000 trunk circuits and 1,300 kiosks, a fair idea can be obtained of the scale of the maintenance job to be done.  These are the things which are constantly in the picture for maintenance and the maintenance of that huge variety of installations and fittings is in itself sufficient to absorb a fairly large staff, apart from new work altogether.</P>
    <P>I want to run over some of the items raised by Deputy James Tully, many of which correspond with those raised by Deputy Dockrell.  The central sorting office I have already dealt with. With regard to the cleaning and upkeep of buildings, Deputy James Tully made a sweeping attack on the way these are maintained.  I find there is no shortage of trained staff and the efficient standard of cleaning has not been reduced.  The buildings are painted internally and externally at intervals and a great deal has been done in recent times to provide new and reconstructed buildings of a high quality for the Post Office.  Other projects are at various stages.  One has to accept that the same standard of cleanliness is not always evident in all places although the same effort applies to those places.  I suppose one could apply that to an ordinary dwelling as well but we are ensuring that adequate provision is made for proper cleanliness and, indeed, complaints on this are few and far between.</P>
    <P>Somebody questioned the suggestion made by me in my opening statement about the door-to-door service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It was I.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy James Tully made the suggestion that motorisation would provide something less than door-to-door service. In a statement recently, when opening an exchange in Portarlington, I made a reference to the idea of the mailbox at the end of the avenue.  This would not be an innovation by any means.  It is something which is in operation in many countries.  This would drastically reduce the cost of delivery and it would take a considerable amount of mileage and time off the postman's work.  It would facilibo <Col N="2171" /> tate the motorisation service which we are working towards for some years.  As you know, the intention is to have motorisation brought in to the maximum extent possible, ultimately, and if we get the co-operation of the people in providing mail-boxes at the end of the avenue, it will help our van drivers.  They could drop in the mail from the van and then we could cover a very big area, giving a much better service and possibly in many cases a much earlier service than at present for less cost.</P>
      <P>That section of the Post Office which is constantly dealing with better methods is examining what economies can be effected in the improvement of the delivery system.  They will ultimately be able to provide me with more definite figures as to possibilities in this respect.  At the same time, it is just a suggestion and is one of the many things that most other countries have been examining.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the objections is that the postman in most areas becomes part of the social life of the area.  He brings the news, and sometimes waits until the letter is read, but those are not things that come within the scope of his contract with the Post Office.  Human nature being what it is, he is often looked on as the ombudsman of the area.  On the motorisation of the service, this would cease anyhow.  With the introduction of motorisation it might be possible to introduce mailboxes by the road easily. In the few places where I experienced that type of service, nobody had any complaint and it worked quite well.  I saw it in rural areas in New Jersey and the people liked it.</P>

      <P>The contract is placed.  When we place a contract, the money is available.  We work within what we have to spend and there is no question of getting money anywhere. The provision of improved conditions for the Kilmallock exchange is at present being examined.  With regard to Cahirciveen, the Department is aware that the construction is quite poor for some time past.  They have been trying to secure alternative accommodation but so far without success.  You may take it that the Department is making every effort to have it reconstructed as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the postman's uniform, Deputy James Tully raised the question of the quality, style and fitting of the uniforms.  This is already dealt with in my brief and I may read it when I come to it later on.  I should say that only recently we had representatives of the trade union having a look at the proposed new styles of uniforms with a view to getting their opinion and we had a few model postmen wearing them and they all looked nice but we found difficulty in agreeing as to which would be the most suitable. Suitability and attractiveness are two different things and we are trying to combine both.  But there again unlike the Garda we have no standard measurements for men in the postal service.  We have no particular chest measurements and height.  One must <Col N="2173" /> deal with every sort of man.  There is quite a variety of sizes in uniforms. Someone suggested to me recently that there were only two sizes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">

      <P>Deputy P. Byrne referred to the early closing for posting of parcels and bulky packages. We try to move with the times like every other organisation and give the people we employ the best conditions we can compatible with the requirements of the public.  In the matter of posting, I have a note which says that business houses generally are able to organise their postings so that parcels and bulky packages are posted well before the hours of closing of the Post Office and in Dublin facilities for posting packets are available up to 11 p.m. at the GPO.  Those are mainly the points raised by Deputy James Tully and other Deputies and <Col N="2174" /> I do not think it necessary to go into them any further.</P>
      <P>Deputy James Tully raised the old hare about a man who was notified of his qualification and later found to be not suitable.  I do not think I can add anything to the volumes that have already been put on record about that case.

      <P>The erection of kiosks was another matter raised.  One must draw a line between what is a social service and what is economically justifiable.  If we were quite up to date with the essential things we must do, we could be a bit more liberal with regard to the erection of kiosks, even in places where they would not show a return but one could <Col N="2175" /> not possibly budget on such an improvement. One must be very circumspect. Personally, I always look on them as we looked on the water fountains on the streets long ago. When a water scheme came to a village or town, the most important thing was to have fountains on the street. Nowadays they are hardly necessary, except in rare cases, because everybody connects with the public supply and thereby has water laid on to his premises.  Few people have to go out to the street to carry in water.  The same applies here.  Sometimes we have kiosks erected in new housing schemes and eventually find that practically every householder becomes a subscriber and the use being made of the kiosk is very little.</P>
      <P>Then we have demands for kiosks in rather remote places in rural Ireland. The case is always made that if somebody is looking for a priest or doctor in the middle of the night, they have no way of contacting them.  Finally, a telephone is installed in some of these and it is found that the revenue during the year is very small.  One must set certain economic standards which would justify the erection of these kiosks.  Each year we have a programme and we erect a fairly substantial number.  One cannot be entirely influenced by the social amenity aspect.  I do not think there were many other points raised on the postal side.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The Deputy referred to the ten hour waiting period which is required and I must say I am very grateful.  He confused me because I thought he was dealing with something else, but he cleared it up in a letter to me afterwards and pointed out that he was dealing with the ten hours in relation to drivers.  As far as it is possible to enforce this regulation within the service, we can enforce it but when people come on and we cannot find what they were doing before they came on, and our jurisdiction does not extend beyond that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The Deputy made the remark that overtime should not be essential.  Human nature being what it is, no matter how well paid a person is, and I think this has been proven in every country, he will look for overtime to get the extra money. This, I suppose, is a failing of human nature.</P>

      <P>I shall certainly look into it to see if there is any substance in the complaint made by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>Deputy P. Byrne referred to the connection of telephones in certain areas. When people refer to particular areas, it is hardly necessary to go into them individually because there is a definite reason in each case.  I have had representations from the Deputy time and again and some of the cases about which he complained have since been dealt with.  Here again it was a question of clearing up some of the cabling in the area.  The question of providing a kiosk was referred to, too, but if the Deputy will communicate with me personally, I will look into the matter rather than deal with it here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was about to say that concludes the matter but there were a few other points raised which in fact overshadowed the whole debate.  The question of the £20 million odd which we are voting for the Department was, in almost all cases, relegated to the background and what should be a comparatively trivial matter was brought up as the over-riding feature of the discussion.  I want to say something about this.  I have already, through replies to Parliamentary questions, dealt with some of <Col N="2177" /> the controversy raised over what responsibility the Government should or should not have over Telefís Éireann.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as I am concerned, it will continue to do that.  It is keeping quite a number of people in good employment.  It is not an essential service in this country; it is an amenity and one which provides a good deal of entertainment for a great many people.  It is in charge of the Radio Telefís Éireann Authority, about which some Deputies passed sneering remarks.  I do not care what their politics are or what the politics of each man may be.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Most people in this country have some politics but I venture to give this assurance, that it does not in any way preclude them from carrying out their work conscientiously and well.  For a trivial amount of money, they give a great deal of their time to doing a good job <Col N="2178" /> and are not concerned with being influenced by anything, other than a desire to give a good service.  I am satisfied with that.  I think tribute should be paid to them and anybody who is intimately associated with their working could not say anything else.</P>
      <P>Now, to deal with some of the references made, some people referred to a matter which I had already explained in this House in answer to Parliamentary questions, that is, the resignation of the former Chairman, Mr. Eamonn Andrews.  I have nothing to add to what I have already said about that resignation.  I was very sorry to see him go; I liked him, considered him an estimable chairman who was doing a difficult job well.  It was a personal decision&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="StephenCoughlan" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>The pressure group got at him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and not due to any pressure exercised by anybody. He made the decision of his own free will and intimated that he did not wish to continue when his term of contract expired.  Mind you, when he was appointed&mdash;like many of the things said in this House, looking over the records &mdash;the remarks about him were not so complimentary at all.  There were beautiful remarks passed about him when he went but he was accused of being a lot of things by innuendo, which was the foulest of all, when first appointed.  I found him good; I was sorry he went, and to get a suitable Chairman for Telefís Éireann is not an easy matter.  You need to get a strong man because this is a case of where the tail would very quickly try to wag the dog.  As far as I am concerned, that will not happen.  I cannot be accused in this House, above all other Ministers, of having anything but a fair outlook on anything in my Department for which I am responsible. I have given the least possible trouble to Telefís Éireann, indeed to the extent that sometimes some people might think I am soft, but I am anything but; I have no intention of allowing it to become a Frankenstein in this country.  It is going in the right direction; if it keeps going in the right direction, then everybody will be <Col N="2179" /> happy and there will be no need for complaint.</P>
      <P>There was a furore here because a Minister rang up Telefís Éireann and complained about the presentation of a piece of news.  He had a perfect right to do that.  He is only one of many who have done it and I will not aggravate the position much further by making reference to it.  As one Deputy &mdash;I think, Deputy Lindsay&mdash;said: &ldquo;People here have contacts; it is natural and it is only natural to use them&rdquo;.  He went on to say that they should not abuse them.  Section 18 (1) of the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960 lays down certain things which Telefís Éireann must abide by.  It is the guideline for presentation of programmes, if you like.  I will repeat it here for the record:</P>
      <P>It shall be the duty of the Authority to secure that, when it broadcasts any information, news or feature which relates to matters of public controversy or is the subject of current public debate, the information, news or feature is presented objectively and impartially and without any expression of the Authority's own views.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Barrett referred to this as the &ldquo;immovable body&rdquo; and that it ran completely contrary to section 31.  It is under that section I could easily have recourse to invoking section 31.  The two are very much related.  Subsection (1) gives me authority, an authority which I have never used; Section 31 gives the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs certain authority to interfere.  Who is the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs?  It does not just mean that Joe Brennan alone uses his sole judgement as to what should or should not be put on Telefís Éireann.</P>

      <P>My Secretary got in touch with the Director General <Col N="2182" /> and asked for a report, and he was told that a man who was invited to appear on &ldquo;The Late Late Show&rdquo; had announced that he was bringing some people with him called &ldquo;Bunny Girls&rdquo;. My secretary was told he could rest assured that Telefís Éireann had made no such arrangement.  That was done immediately after the report appeared in the evening papers&mdash;on a Thursday, I think.  There were all sorts of protests from the &ldquo;holier than thou&rdquo; people and from people who were actuated by the best motives.  I am using this as an example of the procedure which must be adopted under section 31 of the Act.  The Minister does not sit back until something serious has happened.  I would immediately make inquiries, or have inquiries made, and I would convey to the Director General and the Authority, through the Chairman, that the Government were perturbed about a certain production.  I might have to invoke the terms of section 31, and if he is a wise Director General, or they are a wise Authority, it will be changed.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture disagreed with the presentation of a news item on one occasion recently, and he phoned some people in Montrose and told them that, and as a result, I understand, a change was made.  This was a very important matter.  Two things were being presented in a way &mdash;through a genuine mistake&mdash;in which the whole context of the item of news was changed.  The Minister did not ask to have this taken off.  He merely complained as you would, and as perhaps many of you have.  When it was examined, they agreed that to put a statement from an outside source immediately in juxtaposition to the Minister's statement could completely nullify the Minister's meaning.</P>

      <P>In the course of this debate, people have shed many tears for democracy and high standards, and principles, as if we were all in a monastery, to build up an effect in order to magnify something which was hardly discernible.  We seem to have reached the stage where democracy has taken on a new meaning, where the Government must do something because of pressure by pressure groups.  If that is your definition of democracy, it is not ours.</P>
      <P>Democracy must be guarded against pressure groups trying to jockey the Government into a position they do not want to get into.  If the Government were to be put into that position by pressure groups, they would quickly be accused by everyone, and by the man in the street of being weak, of being unfit to be the Government, and of not protecting the highest ideals of democracy.  It seems that democracy is very like the Encyclical <i>Rerum Novarum</i>.  Everyone seemed to be able to find something to suit himself in that Encyclical whether he was an employer or a labourer.  If a Government allow themselves to be pushed by people who are putting on an act, then that Government would be better to get out and put it on record that they went out on that principle.</P>

      <P>I am not courting publicity through any journalists in this country.  Every section has its place and should keep to it.  I was blamed for not seeing the NUJ.  My responsibility does not extend to the staff at Montrose.  We have a body there, responsible, capable and competent to deal with them.  This matter got into print and accusations were made.  There was reference to a letter by Deputy Smith when he resigned as Minister for Agriculture.  The matters dealt with were so insignificant that it was obvious the people concerned had to scrape the bottom of the barrel to find something that looked like an accusation.</P>
      <P>My experience has been that there has been no unnecessary interference with these people.  Nobody there, from the Director General down to the junior man on the staff, can accuse any Minister of interfering with him in any unreasonable way.  That is not to say that I shall not exercise my powers under the Act, but I shall never become Frankenstein.

That is the way to ruin democratic process.  It is a dangerous approach.  One thing that can be said about the Authority in their conduct of the media, sound and television, is that they have given an impartial service all the way.

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not talking about waves of emotion.  I shall now deal briefly with another matter. Ordinarily, I should not make any reference to the notification given to Mr. Tibor Paul because it is not part of my duty: it is entirely within the competence of the Radio Telefís Éireann Authority.  I might have passed it over, as I should, but for some reason or other, it has become so much a part of public controversy that I could not let it pass without some reference to it, particularly because a good deal of adverse publicity has been given to it&mdash;all on one side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me say I appreciate as much as anybody the work Mr. Tibor Paul has done during the past six years.  I appreciate that he did a lot for the advancement of music in this country; that is why we maintain a symphony orchestra at all at a cost in the region of £200,000.  We maintain it as something towards which musical effort should be directed, as a stimulant for musical effort.  I am not too sure that we have provided sufficient facilities in this field to bring our people up to the required standard.  There is a void <Col N="2187" /> somewhere which should be filled and which probably will be filled.</P>
    <P>I should like to speak as dispassionately as possible about this matter, lest I be compelled by the type of publicity it already has got to say some things which ordinarily I would not feel like saying.  Until this happened, I found nothing but the highest regard for the man concerned, with, as any human being must experience, a share of criticism too.  That is human. He has been here six years and I think we looked after him well.  Looking at the records, I thought we looked after him very well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="StephenCoughlan" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>We did a very good job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>He was not on a continuous contract during that time. This contract had been changed time and again.  He came in September, 1961 and the first contract which was due to run up to April, 1963, was replaced by one from April 1962 to March, 1964, and was followed by others from April, 1964 to March, 1966, and April, 1966 to 31st July, 1967.  Then I read in the paper one day that he was dismissed with a two lines notice in a letter which was handed to him just as he was about to go on to the platform for a concert in the RDS.  Then follows the surge of publicity.  Some people who are completely immersed in the world of music and who could be expected to appreciate the artistic sensitivity of artists said that we were virtually a lot of barbarians.  The words &ldquo;medical murder&rdquo; and &ldquo;ruthless dismissal&rdquo; were used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When those things began to appear, although it was outside the scope of my responsibility, I felt I had to make some inquiries as to what happened. I was amazed to find that the &ldquo;two-line letter of dismissal&rdquo; consisted of two pages and 45 lines and I think, in fairness, it should have been published. It was not a dismissal; it was notice of the termination of a contract which ends in July next in its present form. This letter offered different terms.  It proposed to divorce the directorship from the conductorship which I personally agree with.  I consider this is <Col N="2188" /> wise.  This letter made a fairly generous offer for a continued renewal of contract on a conductorship basis for the gentleman in question for two concert periods.  The rate was to be £2,000 per concert period.  I do not think I should read the letter.  I have a copy of it here.  I would like to refute some of the allegations that have been made.</P>

      <P>The contract being offered would ensure a reasonably good contract for this conductor in the two concert periods in 1967-68 and 1968-69.  This, together with other plans for the future of the Symphony Orchestra, would tend to ensure fairly definite progress, but with all the accusations that have been made and the manner in which this has been approached by this gentleman, I question whether he is now suited to be retained in any capacity.  If we take a man in here, and he does a good job, and we treat him well over six years at least, we have the right to terminate his contract.  The question of whether ten months' notice was sufficient or whether it should have been 12 months does not really enter into it.  This man's contract was renewed on a number of occasions on the same procedure as has been adopted here. It is not correct to say that a two-line letter was sent to him or that it came as a bombshell.  It was actually a sequel to discussions and correspondence which had already taken place.  It has also been said it was intolerable that his contract was not renewed on the same basis as before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the public are entitled to <Col N="2189" /> know that and I am very sorry that this thing exploded in the way it did with one party not in a position to defend themselves.  Indeed, I may say, I would have expected it to have been handled entirely in another way.  The fact that it has been handled in the way it has been must necessarily give those in a position of responsibility second thoughts as to whether this man is suitable to be retained at all.</P>
    <P>The question has been raised about losing a trip to America for the Symphony Orchestra.  Deputy Dockrell gave particulars of the engagement, what was being paid and all that.  This is described as a prestige tour.  I am sure one must go easy here when you do not belong to that peculiar echelon of artists who suffer from this sensitivity. This concert might have had some prestige.</P>

      <P>This concert tour might have had some prestige.  It would cost us £12,000.  That would not be a lot if it had any great prestige. I am sure it would have prestige for the artists and perhaps it is a pity it is not taking place, but I question the amount of prestige which the orchestra would have with a foreign conductor and a high percentage of the players non-nationals playing classical music in America.  If it were an orchestra completely composed of Irish people, they would probably say: &ldquo;They have sufficient culture over there to maintain this outfit&rdquo;.  The real purpose of the Symphony Orchestra is to encourage Irish artists to maintain the highest possible standard in the music world and to give encouragement to Irish composers and arrangers.  We should simultaneously establish training facilities to enable Irish artists to maintain that standard.</P>

      <P>I was going to finish without saying any more.  I doubt if the Deputy was listening when I said that this letter was a sequel to discussions which had taken place already.  I understand the man himself expressed the desire to have the particulars before the end of the week. It is quite common practice, when a communication goes out from Montrose, to send it by messenger.  That is how the letter in question was sent.  I do not know at what time it was delivered but it was sent out early in the day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having undertaken to make reference to this matter.  I should like now to review some of the statements made.  Some people have said that this gentleman found a musical wilderness here when he arrived in the country. That is not fair to the great conductors who preceded him and who did a magnificent job of work.  When this gentleman arrived here, we already had the Light Orchestra, the String Quartet and the Radio Eireann Choir.  We also had the Symphony Orchestra.  It is not fair to write down the work of these conductors, some of whom have since gone to the top in the music world.  It <Col N="2191" /> is not true to say that this gentleman arrived to find a musical wilderness here.  I am not now to be taken, when I make these statement, as in any degree denigrating his efforts or his work.  I am sure he was highly appreciated by many.</P>

      <P>If the Minister did, the reply eluded me.  If, under section 31 (2) the Minister gives a written direction to the Authority directing them to give a declaration by the Minister for Agriculture and if, under section 31 (1) the Minister at the same time directs them to refrain from publishing any answer from the NFA, the Authority, under section 18, would have a duty to say to <Col N="2194" /> the Minister: &ldquo;That is not impartial.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Suppose the Minister tells the Authority that they must publish what the Minister for Agriculture said but must not publish any replies and the Authority says: &ldquo;Go to blazes.  We must do this under section 18&rdquo;, what is the Minister's answer?  Does the Minister say: &ldquo;I am the boss&rdquo; or does he say to the Authority: &ldquo;You are the boss under section 18 and publication should be given&rdquo;?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it be correct to say that all those who are found not to have stamped employees' cards are not prosecuted?  Is there not some arrangement by which people who fail to stamp insurance cards can pay by instalments the arrears due, in which case no proceedings are taken? Is the Minister aware that that practice has resulted very often in people who are due benefit being deprived of it because the cards were not stamped as they should have been?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  It is often arranged that the arrears can be paid by instalments, but that does not affect whether a person will be prosecuted or not. The arrears are due to the Department, but the prosecution is in respect of a breach of the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that because the arrears are collected over a period of, perhaps, years, this may leave without benefit the people who have paid for their insurance over a period sometimes as long as 30 years?  Would the Minister not consider in such cases giving the people the benefit to which they would be entitled if their cards were stamped properly?  It is not their fault.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Department would ever make an arrangement for the collection of arrears which did not involve an initial payment which would put the person concerned immediately into benefit. However, in many cases it is a practical question of getting the money. There would not be much point in insisting on immediate payment if it was not possible to get it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>

    <P>11.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if, having regard to the loss incurred by social welfare contributors when an employer fails to stamp their cards and absconds, he will arrange for such contributors to be afforded the same protection as they receive under the PAYE system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>If an employer fails to pay employment contributions in <Col N="2206" /> respect of an employee and absconds there is no power under the Social Welfare Acts and Regulations to credit the employee with the unpaid contributions but in certain circumstances he may be allowed, if he so wishes, to pay them himself in order to safeguard his right to benefit.  I regret that it has not been found feasible to issue receipts for insurance cards to individual employees each year.  However, as a safeguard against the possibility of an employer failing to stamp an employee's card at the proper time he is now required to present the card for the inspection and signature of the employee within four weeks of the expiration of the period of currency of the card.  This gives every employee the opportunity of seeing that his card is being duly stamped.  If it is not, he may bring the matter to the notice of my Department which will then take immediate steps to investigate the complaint and recover any arrears of contributions due.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister indicating it is not practical or possible to afford the same facilities to such people as is afforded under PAYE?  If one Department can do it, why can another not do it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not impossible, but the belief of my Department is that it would not be feasible, without undue expense, to give annual receipts to each individual employee.  However, I am having the matter re-examined.  Of course, that would still give only an annual check to the employee but, in the meantime, each employer is now required, within four weeks of the expiration of the contribution year, to produce to the employee his insurance card for inspection and to obtain the employee's signature on it.  Each employee's signature must be on the card when it is returned to my Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>

      <P>This is a matter which has been submitted to the Minister by the Dublin Council of Trade Unions. Furthermore, it is not a question of giving an annual receipt but of giving a weekly indication that the deductions have been made.

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Gaeltacht (Mr. Faulkner) (for the Minister for Lands)</NameTxt>
      <P>A sub stantial portion of the Palmer estate at Kenure Park, Rush, County Dublin was allotted to local applicants in April last year and the Land Commission have no responsibility for any flooding which may have since occurred on these lands.</P>
      <P>Such information as is available to the Land Commission is to the effect that some disruption of the drainage system on the estate may have resulted from clearance of growing timber and scrub undertaken by a number of allottees on their allotments.  It is a matter for the parties concerned to co-operate in a drainage scheme and it would be open to them to seek assistance under the Land Project in carrying out any such scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that the flooding complained of occurred as a result of scrub clearance carried out by the Land Commission in the process of division, that drains were seriously interfered with?  Surely it is not right or reasonable that the total responsibility for settling this problem should be left on <Col N="2208" /> the shoulders of the small farmers themselves?  Is the Parliamentary Secretary further aware that in at least one instance, that of a man who has 5½ acres under winter greens, the crop is threatened with destruction by flooding for the third year in succession?  In the light of these facts, will the Parliamentary Secretary take immediate steps to ensure that the estate will be left in proper condition?  It might represent a very big problem for the farmers were they to have to do it themselves out of their own resources but represents a very minor matter for the Department of Lands and, indeed, it is part of their duty to leave an estate in a proper condition, once they have divided it.  Would the Parliamentary Secretary not have this matter dealt with urgently because it concerns the livelihood of small farmers in the Rush area who are, as everybody knows, the best and most productive farmers in the country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the first part of the Deputy's supplementary question, I do not accept that the Land Commission is responsible.  In fact the scrub clearance was carried out by the allottees themselves with assistance from the Land Project Section of the Department of Agriculture and the position is that even now some of the parties concerned have made application to the Department of Agriculture for assistance under the Land Project. It would appear from the information I have that there are eight parties concerned and that the eight would need to participate in a drainage scheme. Already, five of these parties have applied for assistance.  I think the best way out of this difficulty would be if the other three also applied and operated a drainage scheme under the Land Project.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>What I do say is that unless the eight applied, the job <Col N="2209" /> would not be a good one.  If the work were carried out by five of the allottees, it would not be as effective as if they all applied and carried out the total job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that it was so obvious that this scrub clearance was essential before the land could be productive, does the Parliamentary Secretary consider that it was reasonable for the Land Commission to allot it in this state and not take responsibility for the job that needed to be done on it?  Is it fair now to put the cost on the backs of these very small farmers?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries if he is aware that the United Kingdom's average price for fat cattle on 16th October was 164s 2d per cwt; and that on 19th October the average price on the Dublin Market, as worked out by the Central Statistics Office, was 122s 3d per cwt; and, if so, if he will give the reason for this difference.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Haughey) Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The United Kingdom estimated average price of 164/2d per cwt. liveweight for fat cattle, inclusive of guarantee payment, for the week ended 16th October covers considerable variations between prices in different parts of the UK.  For example, while the average for Scotland was 178/2d per cwt the average for Northern Ireland was 144/11d per cwt.  Moreover, the United Kingdom prices quoted relate only to cattle of a standard eligible for guarantee payments under the Fatstock Guarantee Scheme.  The average price of 124/6d per cwt liveweight at Dublin Cattle Market in the same week relates to fat cattle of all qualities and types. Further factors affecting the difference between the Irish price and the average price in the United Kingdom are transport and other export costs from here to British markets and the fact that in periods of heavy supplies and weak demand, imports are affected more than home production.</P>

      <P>In the past, the only difference between the two prices was from 17/- to 20/-.  Yet, with the present prices, with the subsidy you are paying, the exporter could buy beef and could get £2 2s 2d per cwt on a 12 cwt beast, plus the subsidy you are giving.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given the full reason.  The Dublin cattle market price relates to fat cattle of all sorts, irrespective of quality and type.  The British guaranteed average price quoted relates exclusively to cattle of a certain standard <Col N="2215" /> and quality which qualify for the guaranteed payment.  Inside Britain there is a bigger variation between what is paid for certain types of cattle in different areas and the guaranteed price than there is between us and Great Britain.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is all wrong.  I have discussed this closely and in great detail with officials of the British Ministry of Agriculture.  It is a complex situation and not too easy to understand.  I want to make this point to the Deputy, if he is interested to know the real situation.  There is a greater difference between the top and the bottom prices in the United Kingdom than there is between our average and the United Kingdom.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

      <P>The standard of quality that qualifies for the guaranteed payments scheme.  It includes as components top quality Aberdeen-Angus beef in Scotland, which commands the highest price, and also barley-fed beef. These are the ones that give this high price in Great Britain whereas our local cattle market price is an average of all types.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries the reason why, under the warble fly eradication scheme, certificates of treatment will not be issued to farmers unless the treatment has been carried out by artificial insemination operators; and why certificates will not be issued if the treatment is carried out by a veterinary practitioner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is not correct in his assumption.  A number of veterinary practitioners are participating in the scheme and certificates of treatment issued by them are acceptable in the same way as those issued by the artificial insemination stations.</P>
      <P>The participation in the scheme of the entire body of veterinary practitioners would have been welcomed but as this was not forthcoming the existing arrangement was the only feasible means of securing the necessary total coverage of the national herd.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware that certain farmers have been informed by his Department that unless the treatment to which I refer is carried out by the people attached to the AI stations the appropriate certificate will not be issued?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>What happened is this.  We devised a scheme on a national basis and we relied mainly on the AI stations to do the job for us on a country-wide basis.  We said to the veterinary profession &ldquo;Please come into this scheme.&rdquo;  We wanted every vet to come in and help us. This would have had a tremendous effect.  However, one of the governing bodies of the veterinary profession decided they would not participate as a profession.  Individual vets in different parts of the country did come in on the scheme and they issue certificates in the normal way.  But where a vet is not participating he cannot issue a certificate.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries the number of claims which have been made to date for loss of animals directly attributable to treatment for warble fly eradication; the number of such claims which have been accepted; and the number of such claims which have been refused (a) because the herdowner had not consulted a veterinary surgeon within 24 hours of the treatment and followed his advice, and (b) for any other reason.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The total number of claims for loss of animals received since the compensation fund was set up under the warble fly eradication scheme in 1965 was 748.  So far 338 have been accepted, 102 refused, and the remaining 308 are still under investigation. I should add that about half of those under investigation have arisen from the current campaign and have only recently been received.</P>
      <P>No claim has been refused solely because of the herdowner's failure to consult a veterinary surgeon within 24 hours.</P>

    <P>(1)  the organo-phosphorus drugs used in warble fly treatment are eliminated from the animal's system within 6-8 hours of application and <Col N="2223" /> any side effects should be apparent well within 24 hours;</P>
    <P>(2)  early treatment will normally lead to complete recovery,</P>
    <P>(3)  a most liberal attitude has been adopted by my Department in the interpretation of this condition and, where the involvement of the drugs, is confirmed on investigation, no claim is rejected on the grounds that veterinary assistance was not procured within the 24 hour limit.</P>

      <P>It would be very difficult to make any sort of reliable estimates under heads (1) and (2) but the loss through condemnations has been roughly estimated at not less than £400,000 per annum.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister have a review of this matter, when sending out his circular to the secondary schools concerned?  While I am glad that History and Geography have been uplifted from 300 to 400 marks, when the circular goes out, I should like it to be pointed out to the secondary schools and the students concerned that there are certain subjects carrying lower marks than others.  In other words, they are not really optional. If a candidate gets 100 per cent in a subject carrying 300 marks and if another candidate gets 75 per cent in a subject carrying 400 marks one will get 300 marks on the 75 percentage whereas the other student will get only 300 marks on a 100 percentage.  To my mind, these four subjects are not <Col N="2230" /> really optional.  It should be pointed out in the circular that they are not optional and that a candidate will take them at his or her own risk. Furthermore, in view of the fact that the present Minister and his predecessor are tied to the comprehensive system of training and in view of the Minister's statement that there will be free education for all&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Title>Rent Restrictions (Amendment) Bill, 1966: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following amendment:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;Dáil Éireann declines to give a Second Reading to the Bill on the grounds that it is not appropriate to do so until the Government provide an adequate number of houses to deal with the present acute housing shortage and thus enable the Rent Restrictions code to be revised in a manner equitable to houseowners and occupying tenants&rdquo;.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Deputy M.J. O'Higgins.)</P>
    <Col N="2240" />
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. B. Lenihan) Brian (Snr.) Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>We had a discussion which largely dealt with the amendment put down by Deputy M.J. O'Higgins which seeks to indicate that it was not appropriate that this Bill should be passed by Dáil Éireann unless the Government provide an adequate number of houses to deal with what is alleged to be the present housing shortage.  In my view, the amendment on which the discussion took place is really a separate issue altogether to the issue contained in the Bill.  The Bill itself is a very complex one and it is one on which I hope we will have a very fruitful Committee Stage discussion.</P>
      <P>In the main, the purpose of the Bill is to do precisely what the amendment seeks to indicate the Government are not doing.  The main purpose of Government policy in the housing field is, of course, to increase the stock of houses on the one hand and preserve the existing stock of houses on the other hand.  It is the function of the Minister for Local Government to deal with the first situation&mdash;the question of increasing the stock of houses. Government expenditure in this direction has been rising in recent years and ample grant and loan facilities are available through the State and the local authorities to facilitate this work. The Minister for Local Government dealt with this aspect of Government administration in a very comprehensive manner some weeks ago when replying to the debate on his Estimate. That is the particular responsibility of the Minister for Local Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my capacity as Minister for Justice, I am bringing in this Rent Restrictions (Amendment) Bill which is designed to deal with the other side of the problem.  It is the problem of the Minister for Local Government to ensure that we increase the stock of houses and devise the incentives by grant and loan to facilitate such an increase and to ensure that we have better housing conditions, and better facilities and amenities in accordance with the needs of the present day.  It is my function to ensure that the rent restrictions code which has been with us now for a number of years does not <Col N="2241" /> operate in such a way as to be a disincentive in regard to the preservation of existing stocks of houses.  It is for that reason that this Bill has been introduced and, in effect, it is a further step in dismantling the restrictive aspects of the rent restrictions code which, if this measure were not introduced, would operate to encourage the growing disrepair of houses to the detriment of existing stocks of such houses.</P>
    <P>The number of controlled dwellings which come within the provisions of the rent restrictions code come to about 14 per cent of the total stock of houses in the community.  It is the purpose of the Bill to ensure that landlords of these controlled dwellings, the dwellings which will continue to be controlled, will be enabled to keep these dwellings in a proper state of repair so as to ensure their preservation.  This makes commonsense.  For that reason I feel that the amendment which has been put down is not really relevant to the particular purpose of the Bill.  It deals with one aspect of the situation, the Bill itself is concerned with another. Let me emphasise that the Bill seeks to alleviate housing conditions.  It is only commonsense that if we allow the existing stocks of controlled premises to degenerate into a state of disrepair so that they cannot be used for housing, the people living in these houses will add to the problem in another respect in that they will increase the demand for new houses.</P>
    <P>This Bill, then, is in accordance with the pattern of Government policy in regard to housing since it seeks to ensure that landlords will be in a position to keep these controlled dwellings in a proper state of repair. The increase of 15 per cent in the basic rent is a very reasonable increase when one considers the rise in reconstruction costs and repair costs. In the past six years the rise in labour costs has been of the order of 29 per cent and when one considers the additional labour cost involved in small repairs on individual houses the percentage rise would be even higher than 29 per cent.  I think we are doing the right thing to ensure that landlords <Col N="2242" /> are in a position to carry out the repair and maintenance necessary. The Bill also proposes to allow landlords an increase in the rent amounting to 10 per cent of the expenditure in any year in excess of one-fifth of the basic rent where that expenditure is incurred in repairs or maintenance. Both of these factors are necessary to ensure that, as far as controlled dwellings are concerned, landlords will, in future, be in a position to keep them in proper repair and so ensure the preservation of housing accommodation for the tenants concerned.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides for an increased degree of decontrol in two circumstances.  Firstly, when the landlord gets vacant possession the premises will pass out of the category of controlled premises, and in to the category of premises protected by the Landlord and Tenant Act, 1931.  We have also reduced the valuation rate of the controlled premises down to £40 in the case of Dublin and £30 for the rest of the country.  This measure has the effect of bringing the higher valuation property outside control. It will mean extra living accommodation because a large number of these high valuation controlled houses in excess of £40 in Dublin and £30 elsewhere are under-occupied at present because of the effects of rent control.  On decontrol they can be easily adjusted to flats and such-like accommodation.  The purpose of decontrolling these high valuation houses is to ensure that the development work can take place whereby extra living accommodation in the form of flats can be provided.  The thinking behind the Bill is to ensure that we make the best possible use of existing housing reserves.  I hope that we will have a constructive Committee Stage discussion to ensure that we do full justice to both sides of this particular matter. It is really a question of balance between landlord and tenant; to ensure on the one hand that the landlord is in a position to preserve and maintain the houses which he or she owns and on the other hand to ensure that, in the process of doing that&mdash;by giving <Col N="2243" /> the landlord extra rent by way of a lawful addition&mdash;no injustice is done to the tenant concerned.</P>
    <P>It is important to remember that in this type of case you can have poor landlords as well as poor tenants.  That is why we have a provision here allowing for the small landlord with not more than six houses of a total valuation not in excess of £60.  Such a landlord may be in poor circumstances and may have a tenant who is much better off than himself.  In such a case he can go into court and seek a rent which is fair to both parties.  This new provision in the Bill is designed to do justice to this category, which is often ignored in this particular type of discussion because the emotion tends to be on the side of the tenant.  But there are many cases which have come to my notice of poor landlords and we are allowing them for the first time to go into court and prove in court if an injustice has been done by reason of the level of rent which the particular tenant may be paying him or her.  This new provision, designed to do justice to the poor landlord will however continue the protection of the tenant since the court will have to have regard to the necessity for avoiding hardship to the tenant as well as the landlord.</P>
    <P>I do not think there was anything else mentioned in the course of the debate; the discussion was largely devoted to the amending motion.  As was stated by Deputy O'Higgins, very rightly, the Bill is largely a technical one and the main discussion will be on Committee Stage.  I hope that the discussion will serve to ensure that justice is done on both sides and that, from the legal point of view, the Bill will, when it becomes law, operate in the interest of both landlord and tenant and that it can be interpreted in a fair and equitable manner by the courts.</P>
    <P>I would, therefore, ask the House to give the Bill a Second Reading.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That a sum not exceeding £7,631,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1967, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Transport and Power, including certain services administered by <Col N="2245" /> that Office, and for payment of sundry Grants-in-Aid.</P>
    <P>The principal increases in 1966-67 are in the provisions for Salaries, Wages and Allowances £189,995 (Subhead A); Post Office Services £32,350 (B.2); Grant-in-Aid for Tourism under Tourist Traffic Acts £309,000 (Subheads F.1 and F.3); Constructional works at Airports £100,000 (G.2) and Rural Electrification £103,200 (O). Small increases in other Subheads amount to £31,350 bringing the total increases to £765,895.</P>
    <P>The increase in the provision for salaries, wages and allowances is due to authorised salary increases and normal incremental progression.  The increase in the provision for post office services is due mainly to increases in salaries and wages, offset by a reduction of £12,000 in respect of the deficit on the operation of Shannon Airport Post Office.</P>
    <P>The principal decreases in 1966-67 are in the provisions for Córas Iompair Éireann Redundancy Compensation £44,000 (D.2); Resort Development £90,000 (F.2); Radio Equipment £211,500 (J); Grant-in-Aid for the Shannon Free Airport Development Co. Ltd. £80,000 (K.1); Shannon Free Airport Development Co. Ltd.&mdash; Housing Subsidies and Grants £25,000 (K.2) and Expenses in connection with international organisations £38,820 (M). Small decreases in other Subheads amount to £21,900 bringing the total decreases to £511,220.  To this amount must be added the increase of £232,775 in Appropriations-in-Aid which is equivalent to a decrease in the net grant and brings the total decrease to £743,995.</P>
    <P>The decrease in the provision for radio equipment is due to the fact that no major equipment falls to be paid for during the financial year as was the case in 1965-66 when a provision of £180,000 was made in the surveillance radar for Dublin Airport. Ireland's contribution to Eurocontrol has been reduced this year and this accounts mainly for the decrease in the provision for expenses in connection with international organisations.</P>
    <P>The increase in Appropriations-in-Aid <Col N="2246" /> is due mainly to increased estimated receipts from the passenger service charge at airports, £125,000, increases in landing fees and communication charges at Shannon Airport, £40,000 and £24,000 respectively, and to an increase in the surplus on Dublin Airport management account, £60,000.</P>
    <P>On the basis of actual increases and decreases as stated above, namely £765,895 increase and £743,995 decrease, the net increase in the Vote as compared with 1965-66 provision is £21,900.</P>
    <P>The year ended 31st March, 1966, was a disappointing one for CIE and the position so far this year is discouraging. The CIE Report and Accounts for 1965-66 were circulated to Members of both Houses during the recess and Deputies will be aware that the Board's deficit in that year was £2.229 million, that is £754,000 more than the deficit in 1964-65 and £229,000 more than the Board's annual subsidy of £2 million.  The greatest single factor in this increase in the Board's deficit was the net loss of £440,000 occasioned by the two-week bus dispute in June, 1965 coupled with a further net loss of £10,000 on two other strikes during the year.  Other factors which contributed to the increased deficit were increases in rates of pay and improvements in conditions of service amounting to £357,000 in 1965-66; higher social insurance contributions; increased maintenance costs and increased interest charges.</P>
    <P>If there had been no strikes the company's earnings would still have been affected adversely by Northern Ireland railway closures and by some poor periods of weather, offset by certain increases of freight traffic, more long distance passengers, the steadying effect of reduced cattle freight charges on diminishing traffic and satisfactory hotel business.  There were considerable savings from operating economies while earnings from road freight, tours and bus private hire increased.  To show the effect of strike losses, if there had been no strike in 1965-66 the additional revenue would have been of the order of £780,000.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2247" /> As Deputies are aware, I have spoken on many occasions in recent times of the difficulties facing CIE. The Transport Act, 1964, provides for payment of an annual subsidy of £2 million to the Board up to and including the year 1968-69.  The amount of the subsidy is subject to review after that date but not before it.  Salary and wage increases and improvements in conditions of service granted since and including the ninth round have increased CIE salary and wages cost by £3.7 million per annum or nearly 30 per cent taking 1963/64 as the base year.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other claims outstanding and if all these were granted in full CIE costs would rise by almost another £2 million per annum representing a total increase of 47 per cent on the Board's 1963-64 salary and wages costs.  Some of these claims are liable to escalate throughout the system and, if conceded generally, would cost a further £4 million per annum bringing the total percentage increase on the base year up to 73 per cent.  Increases of this magnitude are, of course, completely out of the question if public transport in this country is not to be priced out of existence.  The only way that further increases in salaries and wages can be recovered is by increasing fares and rates and there is, as Deputies know, a limit to the increases that the traffic will bear.</P>
    <P>Strikes have naturally affected CIE traffic because of the element of uncertainity. I have requested the Board to intensify its efforts to gain new traffic, to increase productivity and secure economies.  The Board should be ready to cut expenditure drastically if its financial situation makes this necessary.</P>
    <P>It would be best to be absolutely frank with regard to the position of CIE.  In no circumstances will the subsidy, equivalent to 4d tax per gallon of petrol, be increased.  If private enterprise was lacking, if total transport by road was inadequate, I would not hesitate to examine the position and ask the Government for more financial aid.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2248" /> On the contrary, CIE is going to have to compete more fiercely with private transport in the future where annual investment has been at the £30 million level.</P>
    <P>The frank truth is that all over Europe, even in State enterprises, capacity to pay comes into the picture. CIE can only pay wages and salaries, (a) which compare generally with those paid elsewhere in relation to national income per head, and (b) which compare with the average paid in comparable employment here.  The recent decisions of the Labour Court make it clear that there is no abnormally low salary and wage structure in CIE.  The total amount of money lost in wages arising from the 1963, 1965 and 1966 strikes in CIE was £685,000.</P>
    <P>I have asked the Minister for Labour to note these facts and to note that in every recent strike the numbers of staff taking the initiative were a small proportion of those actually out on strike.  Indeed cross picketing in an essential industry has effects on the public far beyond the normal.</P>
    <P>While the Dáil was in recess, the Fine Gael Party called for a public inquiry into the management and operation of CIE.  I see no need for such an inquiry.  The working of public transport in the State was very thoroughly investigated by the Committee of Inquiry into Internal Transport, known as the Beddy Committee, which reported in 1957.  Two other studies on transport were published by the Economic Research Institute.</P>
    <P>A most comprehensive investigation by CIE took place in 1963, the results of which are set out in the Pacemaker Report, copies of which are in the Library of this House.  The Transport Act, 1964, was drafted in the light of the information available from these reports and other studies, and that Act was accepted by this House as determining future public transport policy subject to review in 1969.  The £2 million annual subvention to CIE is not a subsidy to support an inefficient enterprise; it is the amount required to keep open a railway that cannot possibly pay, having no transit traffic, no heavy ore traffic, with one of the <Col N="2249" /> longest tracks per 1,000 population in Europe and carrying only seven per cent of the travelling public and 17 per cent of freight.  The railway is the only large sector of the system losing money. The remainder, consisting of the road freight, road passenger services and Ostlanna Iompair Éireann yield a surplus after contributing to overheads. The CIE profit is reinvested in hotel development.</P>
    <P>The problems of CIE do not derive from deficiencies in management or organisational structure.  Since 1958 the Board has carried out a most comprehensive programme of re-organisation and rehabilitation of the undertaking.  But for this, I am quite satisfied that the Board's losses would be double what they are now.</P>
    <P>Since 1958 almost every aspect of CIE administration has been investigated by management consultants with the aid of the company's executives. More than 60 major assignments have been undertaken covering such diverse activities as: management accounting; work study in workshops and freight depots; operating costing; market research; vehicle fleet sizes; production planning and control; stock control; and management reorganisation.  To illustrate, by one example, the effect of such measures, I would mention that productivity per head of staff in the CIE railway system increased by about 26 per cent between 1958 and 1964. This figure is somewhat better than the average&mdash;25 per cent&mdash;for seven West European railway companies, including CIE for the same period.</P>
    <P>The Board embarked upon an intensive selling campaign and drive for new business and since 1958 package deal contracts to the value of over £900,000 per annum have been negotiated.  The system of area management introduced by the Board in 1961 has proved immensely successful.</P>
    <P>Other measures taken by CIE to attract custom and to sell its services have been dieselisation and the provision of new road and rail vehicles. Passenger facilities at stations and staff amenities have been improved immensely by the Board.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2250" /> The mechanisation of the handling of freight has helped considerably to speed up and reduce the costs of the Board's freight delivery service.  85 per cent of freight traffic is now delivered within 24 hours.  There has been a marked increase in the Board's freight traffic since 1958.  Total freight traffic has jumped by 54.5 per cent from 4,400,000 tons in 1958-59 to 6,800,000 tons in 1965-66.  Overall, there has been a slight increase in CIE total passenger traffic, road and rail, in spite of a huge increase in private car numbers.</P>
    <P>Recent reorganisation work should be mentioned.  I encouraged CIE to engage in market research to ascertain how best the wishes of the general public may be met in the matter of the provision of bus services.  CIE, having improved provincial city bus services using modern methods, are pressing on with the far more complicated problem in Dublin but they cannot beat congestion at peak hours.</P>
    <P>The Board have now carried out origin and destination surveys on the Dublin city bus and rail passenger services, as a major task of analysis. Altogether almost 250,000 passengers were interviewed by CIE in the course of the surveys.  This represents about one in three of all bus passengers in Dublin city and about 80 per cent of Dublin suburban rail passengers. The information collected is now being processed.  For the purpose of analysing the information and applying the results to improve the city services, CIE have engaged Professor Schaechterle, who is traffic consultant to the Dublin Corporation.</P>
    <P>I should add that bunching of buses continues and will progressively worsen unless drastic steps are taken by Dublin Corporation.  This poses fearful financial problems.  To provide 40 per cent of car owners in Leeds with a freely circulating system and adequate parking would cost £90 million.  Most transport authorities believe that where there is one car to three people&mdash;the Dublin figure is seven&mdash;circulation will only be possible if most of these people take public transport.</P>
    <P>At the moment at morning peak hours 40,000 people using 26,700 cars <Col N="2251" /> drive into the city, this being 34 per cent of the 120,000 total passenger movement.  51 per cent travel by bus. A far higher proportion of bus travellers sit going to work than in most European countries with higher incomes per head than this country.</P>
    <P>The profit on the city bus services when measured against the railway loss is very small and the arguments about cross-subsidisation are not of any significance.</P>
    <P>I have also encouraged the Board to introduce express bus services wherever possible and I am glad to be able to tell the House that this year CIE had a total of 13 such services in operation. The majority of the express bus services introduced by CIE have proved successful and the Board have under consideration the introduction of further express or limited stop services.</P>
    <P>The road freight organisation was fundamentally altered during the year and operations are now based on 16 depots, each depot manager having full responsibility for all road freight activities at his depot.  Credit for the improved results in road freight working can be largely attributed to this re-organisation.</P>
    <P>A tribute is due to the retired Chairman, Dr. Andrews and to the staff of CIE for the reorganisation campaign. Some time ago I suggested to CIE that an independent examination of human relations in the bus service might be instituted.  Later, on the initiative of CIE, a joint investigation into the management-worker relationship in the bus section of the company was undertaken by the Tavistock Institute of Human Relations.  The Institute's final report was received earlier this year and is at present being studied by the trade unions and CIE.</P>
    <P>For the huge majority of the staff, existing procedures for joint consultation operate successfully.  Apart from this, I have informed the Minister for Labour, who is now responsible for industrial relations including those of State-sponsored bodies, that the negotiation procedures in CIE if subjected <Col N="2252" /> to any examination will show that in recent cases the Labour Court has upheld the recommendations of CIE in the majority of cases.  I understand that the Board of CIE would await with confidence any examination by him of negotiation procedures.</P>
    <P>I have suggested to the Minister for Labour that if there could be one representative organisation acting on behalf of the staff, with a system of arbitration to avoid strikes, CIE could consider regularly improving service conditions and fringe benefits over a period of a few years.  This would be based on the ability of CIE customers to pay the rates and fares, on a reasonably based estimate of the CIE position in relation to the national economy and on traffic increases that might be secured if strike action were abandoned.</P>
    <P>CIE would of course continue to follow the general pattern of basic wage increases.  I have indeed asked the Chairman to consider approaching ICTU and suggesting a long term agreement along these lines at which the future financial position of CIE would be discussed.  I am certain that the Board would make a fair appraisal of the CIE position up to say 1971-72 and in return for a contractual agreement covering fringe benefits and all conditions except the basic wage increase, would take an optimistic attitude since CIE would stand to gain considerable revenue once there was an assurance that no major strike would take place.  I am certain that such an agreement would have the wholehearted support of the people.</P>
    <P>Of course the rampant inflation that has taken place nullifies the benefit of wage increases but the NIEC's recommendations have not been respected any more than the perpetual warnings of the Government since 1962.</P>
    <P>I do not want to speak further about the Fine Gael proposal because I cannot believe that the public inquiry they propose would include in its terms of reference all the inner methods of working involving human relations.  I might add in conclusion that my last detailed statement on the causes of and solution for the CIE <Col N="2253" /> industrial dispute problem published on 31st August received no detailed or noteworthy criticism whatever from any organisation.</P>
    <P>The provision of £238,000 for grants for harbour improvement works covers works in progress or works expected to commence shortly.  Works at Galway and Wicklow are practically completed while the scope of works required at Arklow and Drogheda is at present being determined by hydraulic model investigations which are being financed by State grants.  The principal current improvement scheme is at Foynes where facilities are being provided for the export of ore concentrates.  A State grant of £100,000 has been made available towards financing the scheme, the total cost of which is estimated at £400,000.</P>
    <P>The Report of the Working Group which I set up to investigate the possibility of accelerating the movement of goods through ports and which was published in August, 1965, contains many recommendations to eliminate the excessive delays which were found to occur in the clearance of goods, especially through Dublin Port. Interests concerned furnished observations on the Report and the question of the further steps necessary to implement the recommendations is being considered in the light of those observations.  As a first step towards achieving a more expeditious clearance of goods, a Guidance Manual prepared under the direction of the Group for the information of importers on clearance formalities has already been put on sale.  An informal interdepartmental working party, including a representative of Córas Tráchtála, is undertaking examination of the question of simplification and standardisation of consignment documentation.  This is a complicated matter involving many interests and examination may be protracted.</P>
    <P>It is my earnest hope that negotiations for increased productivity at Dublin docks will prove fruitful and that, in return for decasualisation of labour, it will be possible to lower most costs of cargo handling.</P>
    <P>All over the European continent the larger harbours are drawing a greater <Col N="2254" /> share of the world sea traffic because ships are getting larger, road networks are improving and surface State transport companies now make package deals for carrying goods by rail and even by road.</P>
    <P>The smaller harbour authorities will only survive by selling their services successfully.  There will be no further capital grants for harbours of this type unless the result will be fully productive and will not divert traffic from one harbour to another.  Grants have been provided for the restoration and modernisation of the great majority of the harbours east and west.  Some harbours have shown increases in traffic, some traffics have stabilised and others are declining.</P>
    <P>The construction of first-class arterial roads to the West, the reorganisation of CIE and rapid transit unit load traffic all provide heavy competition with the smaller harbours. Co-operative purchase of bulk raw materials could add to harbour traffic in the West but this is difficult to bring about.</P>
    <P>The B &amp; I Company was purchased in March, 1965, with effect from 1st January, 1965.  The company had a loss of £87,752 in the year ended 31st December, 1965, as compared with a profit of £57,184 in 1964, despite an increase in freight rates by the previous Board in March, 1965.  This increase had been effected to meet estimates of the additional costs which would arise when wage negotiations with the seamen and British dockers would be completed.  In fact, the actual costs of the increases in wages turned out to be much higher than had been estimated with the result that the receipts from the increased freight rates fell substantially short of the amount required.</P>
    <P>Whilst the company had greater productivity and better working in some areas of its operations, it was not possible to absorb the increases in costs.  These increases were further aggravated by increased overheads and a decline in income from cattle exports. As Deputies are aware, the company, <Col N="2255" /> in these circumstances, increased its freight rates again in March of this year.  On my instructions, the most sympathetic treatment possible is given to exports being carried at exceptional rates.  Due, however, to the rapidly changing pattern of the cross-Channel trade from conventional to unit load transport, carryings of conventional goods in the year 1965 showed a decrease of 14 per cent as compared with 1964, with a resultant fall in earnings.</P>
    <P>Indeed, the experience of the cross-Channel trade in recent years shows that increased freight rates do not necessarily lead to profitability.  The main hope of restoring profitability and of maintaining rates at their existing level or reducing them, lies in the direction of a lowering of costs.  This can only be achieved by more efficient methods of transport such as unit load services, rationalisation of services in co-operation with other operators and the more economic and efficient use of ships, equipment and stores.  Scope for reducing costs lies in greater productivity in terminal operations, which constitute about 40 per cent of total costs in the trade and a solution to the problem of relating shipping capacity to traffic at peak periods.</P>
    <P>When the company was acquired, I gave the new Board directives for their guidance on the following lines:</P>
    <P>(1)  an analysis of the cross-Channel merchandise freight market;</P>
    <P>(2)  the same examination in relation to livestock and a critical analysis of the cycles in cattle exports;</P>
    <P>(3)  an analysis of the present-day traffic and its content related to method of packing, use of unit loads, the available cargo space, the frequencies of sailings, onward road and rail services and destinations;</P>
    <P>(4)  the evaluation of efficiency and productivity in regard to all the above elements of study;</P>
    <P>(5)  the examination of the passenger traffic facilities in respect of tourists and Irish people coming on family visits;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2256" /> (6)  the examination of the sales organisation;</P>
    <P>(7)  those elements having been examined, the company would base its conclusions and decisions on the following general principles:</P>
    <P>(i)  the provision of the most economical, efficient service to advance the trade of the country.</P>
    <P>(ii)  the assessment of commercial viability.</P>
    <P>(iii)  the continuation and further development of the best possible communications and relations with the staff at all levels in order that growth of productivity may be fully understood and linked with conditions of employment and monetary reward.</P>
    <P>In this connection, it must be borne in mind that the company having been a subsidiary of a large group, had been largely controlled by the parent company.  In its first year the new Board addressed itself primarily to the reorganisation of the management of the company.  It has now largely completed this task and has set up modern financial planning and control systems as well as a planning and development department to assess the possibilities of future growth and development.  One of the company's objectives is a 48 hour or less &ldquo;groupage&rdquo; service between Dublin and all major points in Britain.  Such a service was recently introduced by the company between Dublin and Manchester to serve the north-east of England.</P>
    <P>At present, the company owns eight ships and operates a varying number of others, usually about six on charter. It has 1,200 employees of whom 360 are seagoing.  The company's unit load services are expanding rapidly, the increase in 1965 being 50 per cent.  To cater for the increased business and to gain experience for the planning of its own ships, two modern unit load vessels were recently taken on charter. The company's own conventional vessels are not, of course, suitable for the unit load trade.  The company cannot possibly consider building new ships until the full implications of unit load traffic growth have been examined.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2257" /> Shipping freight rates continued to improve in 1965, the average index figure being 126.5 for the year as against 112 for 1964 and 109 for 1963 (base, 1960=100).  The improvement was fairly well maintained for the first four months of 1966 but since then there has been a sharp decline, the index figures for July and August being 107.8 and 108 as against 130.6 and 128.1 respectively in the corresponding months of 1965.  Whilst there is a general hope that freight rates may revive in the winter months, the forecasting of the movements in rates&mdash; always hazardous in the case of shipping&mdash;is particularly so at present in view of the slower rate of growth in world trade and the various restrictive financial and other measures at present being taken throughout the world.</P>
    <P>In the year ended 31st March, 1966, there was a marked improvement in the financial out-turn of Irish Shipping Ltd., a net profit having been made for the first time for many years, of £58,404, as against a net loss of £315,000 in the previous year.  Were it not for the losses incurred in the operation of the two large tankers, now disposed of, there would have been an appreciable net profit, after providing for full depreciation of the fleet.  Deputies will have seen from the Company's accounts for 1965-66, which have already been presented, that against a capital investment by the State, of £11.4 million, the Company's net assets amounted to £10.7 million, giving rise to a debit balance on profit and loss account of £0.7 million.  This debit balance was due to a capital loss of £1.4 million mainly attributable to the sales of the two tankers.  The total number of persons employed by the company is 760 ashore and afloat.</P>
    <P>The long period of post-Suez depression in freight rates resulted in considerable losses but the Board has made strenuous efforts in the last two years to restore the company to profitability. Measures to improve management and operational efficiency have been taken where feasible, but such measures in themselves cannot restore profitability if vessels which are not economic and are unlikely to be, are <Col N="2258" /> retained.  As I have mentioned on previous occasions, Irish Shipping Limited cannot be directly compared with other shipping companies which are primarily concerned with maximising profitability.  Most of these companies who pay salaries and wages on a North European basis derive part of their profits from wharfage, road transport services or non-shipping activities. The primary aim of Irish Shipping Ltd. is strategic&mdash;to have enough suitable ships to service our essential needs in a national emergency.  Economic viability, however, I regard as essential and our aim must be to have a fleet constituted so as to be able to operate profitably.</P>
    <P>I indicated last year that, in order to maintain the dry cargo tonnage at a level to meet our strategic requirements and to improve the profitability of the company's operations, it was decided to acquire a dry cargo bulk carrier of 34,000 tons dead weight.  Deputies were pleased, I am sure, to learn that the order for the vessel was placed, in face of worldwide competition, with the Verolme Cork Dockyard, for delivery in October, 1967.</P>
    <P>The future profitability of the company is dependent upon the level of freight rates.  It is to be hoped that the recent disimprovement in freight rates will be reversed and I am confident that, if freight rates revive, the steps which I have described will lead to a resumption of profit making of significant proportions by the company, particularly when all the uneconomic vessels have been disposed of and the new bulk carrier has been put into service.</P>
    <P>When the present Chairman of Irish Shipping was appointed, I asked him in consultation with the Board to overhaul the whole of the company's administrative, commercial and accountancy practices.  The company engaged management consultants and work study experts to review various aspects of their operations and advise on methods to effect greater efficiency. As a result of these investigations the company strengthened and reorganised its management structure and introduced <Col N="2259" /> new improved methods of budget control, stores management and working procedures.</P>
    <P>Rising costs in Aer Lingus, which resulted in a reduced operating surplus, £52,000 in 1964-65, together with a slowing up in traffic growth particularly on British provincial routes, resulted in the company sustaining an operating loss of £64,000 in 1965-66, even though cross-Channel fares increased by approximately 10 per cent.  The late delivery of four BAC One-Eleven aircraft, the last of which was not available for service until after the 1965 peak traffic period, retarded development of the company's Continental traffic.</P>
    <P>The company substituted Viscounts for Friendship aircraft on the cross-Channel provincial routes in 1966 and plan to introduce jet aircraft on the London route in 1968.  Two Boeing 737 aircraft have been ordered for this route for delivery in 1968 and 1969.</P>
    <P>During 1965, Aer Lingus carried 1,052,000 passengers, an increase of about 6 per cent over the previous year.  Freight carried by the company during the year amounted to almost 17,500 metric tons, an increase of about 13 per cent.  During the first six months of 1966 passenger traffic increased by 14 per cent and freight traffic by 32 per cent.  Aer Lingus maintained its services on all routes during the year 1965.</P>
    <P>The company continues to operate with one of the highest load factors of European air carriers.</P>
    <P>Our transatlantic airline, Aerlinte, continues to operate with spectacular success.  During 1965, Aerlinte's passenger traffic rose by 14 per cent to 144,000, while freight increased by almost 75 per cent to 3,000 metric tons. In the first six months of 1966 passenger traffic increased by 13 per cent and freight traffic by 44 per cent.  Once again, the airline had one of the highest load factors of all operators on the North Atlantic route in both directions.</P>
    <P>A new Aerlinte service between Shannon, Montreal and Chicago was inaugurated in May, 1966.  In the year <Col N="2260" /> ended 31st March, 1966, the company achieved an operating profit of £1,079,000 which was £103,000 lower than for 1964-65.  Although revenue earned in 1965-66 increased by 18 per cent on 1964-65, expenditure went up by 23 per cent.  The effect of the acquisition of Boeing aircraft between 1965 and 1967 will be to double the company's transatlantic capacity.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies object to the use of the term &ldquo;operating profit&rdquo; when applied to the air companies because the cost of remunerating capital is not included in the calculation.  Therefore, the position will be set out factually:</P>
    <P>1.  The operating profit of the two air companies for 1965-66 was £1,015,000. The total issued capital held by the Minister for Finance is £13,610,044. On the basis of this capital being equity a 6 per cent dividend would amount to £816,000;</P>
    <P>2.  All the capital for new aircraft, buildings and ancillaries is now being found by the companies and remunerated from profits, depreciation and other reserves.  The capital expenditure committed under this head is £5.7 million.</P>
    <P>The companies were directed to expand at the early stages at a pace which precluded remuneration of capital.  I should make it clear that because of the transatlantic route being relatively a shorter haul than that of the intercontinental carriers and the British European routes being extremely short haul, it will take the whole of the resources of the air companies to expand in the years to come. I trust that the staff duly understand that there is no fat whatever in the companies' operations.  That productivity is increasing steadily on the basis of number of employees per ton mile of revenue is true, but every penny will be required if the companies are to continue their splendid record of progress.</P>
    <P>Under the Air Companies Act, 1966, Aer Rianta ceased to be a holding company for Aer Lingus and Aerlinte, and its investment in Irish and Intercontinental Hotels Ltd. was transferred to Aerlinte.  These changes, which limit <Col N="2261" /> the functions of Aer Rianta to the management of Dublin Airport on my behalf, have resulted in the issued share capital of the company being reduced to £51,269.  All of the capital, except for directors' shares, is held by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>The Shannon Free Airport Development Company's finances are provided from the Exchequer by way of (i) grant-in-aid to meet running expenses and grants to industries, (ii) grant-in-aid to meet housing subsidy and grants, (iii) share capital for the construction of factories and (iv) repayable advances for the provision of housing and community services.</P>
    <P>The allocation of grant-in-aid to meet running expenses and grants to industries&mdash;Subhead K1&mdash;is arrived at after taking account of receipts from the company's revenue earning activities, mostly rents from factories and houses.  The provision for 1966-67 is £350,000 or £80,000 less than for 1965-66, this allocation being the amount necessary to enable the company to operate at its present level of activity.  Up to 31st March, 1966, the total amount paid to the company by way of grant-in-aid amounted to £2,035,000.</P>
    <P>Grant-in-aid is also payable for housing subsidy and grants&mdash;Subhead K2.  The amount of subsidy payable for each dwelling is the amount by which the economic rent exceeds the rent charged after taking into account grants equivalent to those payable under the Housing (Loans and Grants) Act, 1962.  The total amount paid by way of subsidy to 31st March, 1966, was £89,000 and the provision for 1966-67 is £45,000.  Housing grants equivalent to those available to private persons and public utility societies under the Housing Acts are also payable to the company.  The total amount paid to 31st March, 1966, was £104,340 but only a token provision is made for 1966-67 as the grants in respect of a scheme of 125 houses at present being undertaken by the company will not become payable until 1967-68 on completion of the scheme.</P>
    <P>The allocation for 1966-67 of share capital for factory and warehousing <Col N="2262" /> construction and repayable advances for housing and community services is £850,000.  This compares with £1,100,000 provided in the Second Programme and £850,000 paid in 1965-66.</P>
    <P>The total amount paid to the company by way of share capital and repayable advances to 31st March, 1966, was £6,151,000.</P>
    <P>At 31st March, 1966, there were 16 manufacturing and 12 commercial firms operating at Shannon, employing 3,163 persons of whom 1,699 were men.  Five new firms were established during 1965-66 and two firms ceased operations. 908,000 square feet of factory, warehousing and office space were completed or under construction compared with 850,000 square feet at 31st March, 1965.</P>
    <P>Twenty-six houses were completed by the company during 1965-66, bringing the total number of dwellings completed at 31st March, 1966, to 137 flats and 318 houses.  A contract for a further 125 houses was placed by the company in December, 1965.  A new comprehensive school has been opened.  The resident population in the housing estate at 31st March, 1966, was 1,447.</P>
    <P>The Shannon Free Airport Development Company Ltd. (Amendment) Act, 1965, raised the statutory limits on State investment in the company to £12 million made up of £6 million share capital, £3 million repayable advances and £3 million grant-in-aid. At 31st March, 1966, the total payment to the company from the Exchequer amounted to £8.3 million.  The justification for the increase in the statutory limits can best be judged by the continued progress of the company as evidenced by its achievement at the end of 1965-66, particularly as regards the increase in employment to over 3,000 persons.</P>
    <P>I have told the Board of SFADCO that the general policy it should pursue should be as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  to seek industries and services likely to increase air freight at Shannon. Containerised surface transport has provided intensive competition while at the same time air freight rates are being rationalised and modified by successive decisions at IATA <Col N="2263" /> conferences, while aircraft ton mile costs will no doubt be reduced as the years go by.</P>
    <P>(2)  to plan ahead for a total population of 6,000 persons in the community of Shannon and to provide the necessary ancillary services to meet this need;</P>
    <P>(3)  to maintain a satisfactory proportion of male employees while recognising that employment for females is an extremely important factor in rural economics;</P>
    <P>(4)  to co-ordinate with Bord Fáilte and the carriers at Shannon in making Shannon the natural gateway for tourist traffic to the West of Ireland and to make it clear that this is permanent national policy.  In saying this I should again make it clear that the local Regional Tourist Board carries a very heavy share of responsibility for the implementation of this possibility. In relation to the tourist expenditure in the area, the membership of the Board and its income are still grossly inadequate.</P>
    <P>Bunratty Castle was opened to the public in May, 1960, and from the outset it was clear that, while it contributed substantially to the tourist influx into the area, its potential as a tourist attraction could be exploited to a much greater extent.  With this in mind, I asked the Shannon Free Airport Development Company to organise mediaeval feasts and pageants at the Castle.  The Mediaeval Tour, comprising a one-day scenic tour of County Clare with a mediaeval banquet at Bunrattv as its climax, was organised by the Company with the co-operation of CIE and commenced in 1963.  The tour has proved to be an outstanding success in attracting tourists, most of whom are Americans.  During the 1965 tourist season 32,000 people attended the Banquet and of these 14,700 took the Tour.  In addition there were 34,000 visitors to the Castle during the season. The Folk Park at Bunratty has enhanced the value of the Mediaeval Tour as a major tourist attraction.</P>
    <P>Dunguaire Castle, situated on the shore of Kinvara Bay, County Galway, <Col N="2264" /> was chosen as the focal point of a new tour, since the full capacity of Bunratty Castle had been reached.  In July, 1965, the company was authorised to conclude an agreement with the owner of the Castle for the leasing of the Castle to allow the company to develop it as a tourist amenity.  The tour, promoted by the company with the co-operation of CIE, commenced on 1st April, 1966, and includes a tour of the Galway Bay area culminating in an artistic entertainment at Dunguaire.  Up to 31st May, 1966, more than 1,500 people attended the banquet of whom nearly 900 took the Galway Bay tour.  The company's target for the 1967 tourist season for the Tour is 8,000 passengers.</P>
    <P>All sectors of traffic at Dublin Airport continued to increase in 1965. Passenger traffic rose by 6 per cent to 1,344,000, while freight rose by 8 per cent to 27,200 metric tons.  In the first six months of 1966 passenger traffic rose by 15 per cent and freight by 35 per cent.  Services are operated to and from the airport by eight foreign operators.  Horse-ferry services continued at the airport as did the activity in connection with the carriage of meat from Dublin to points on the Continent.</P>
    <P>The continuing increase in the volume of both passenger and freight traffic at Dublin Airport has necessitated the preparation of a long term integrated development plan for the airport.  The plan is sufficiently flexible to take account of changes in trends and techniques into the 1980's.  It is intended, subject to the necessary finance being available, to construct, in the near future, a new cargo terminal as well as a new flight victualling and cabin service building.  Two pier buildings have already been erected and are now being linked by a new building.</P>
    <P>The total capital expenditure on Dublin Airport up to 31st March, 1966, amounted to about £4,440,000.  For the year ended 31st March, 1966, total revenue at the airport was £825,000 and expenditure was £603,000, the operating surplus, therefore, being £222,000.  No allowance is, however, <Col N="2265" /> made for depreciation and interest on capital expenditure amounting to about £379,000.  The overall deficit on the airport in 1965-66 was, therefore, about £157,000.</P>
    <P>The total number of passengers at Shannon Airport in 1965 increased by 12 per cent to 427,000.  Terminal traffic has been increasing steadily for some years but the drop in transit traffic had, until 1964, been so great as to cause the total traffic to decrease each year.  In 1965, terminal traffic increased by 20 per cent while transit traffic remained steady.  Freight traffic at the airport amounted to 19,000 metric tons, an increase of 20 per cent over the 1964 total.  Terminal freight increased by 34 per cent to 5,700 metric tons.  One thousand three hundred and forty-six metric tons of this freight represented traffic to and from the Industrial Estate, an increase of 54 per cent on 1964.  In the first six months of 1966, terminal passenger traffic increased by 21 per cent and transit traffic by 11 per cent, while terminal freight increased by 20 per cent, Industrial Estate freight by 34 per cent and transit freight dropped by 17 per cent.</P>
    <P>The increase in terminal passenger traffic will necessitate considerable expansion of existing passenger handling accommodation and facilities, including the provision of a new passenger arrivals building and the reconstruction and adaptation of the existing buildings.  In addition to Aerlinte, scheduled transatlantic services were operated to Shannon by five foreign air lines.  A new service between Dublin and Shannon, to provide connecting services for non-Irish transatlantic operators at Shannon, commenced in April, 1966.</P>
    <P>The Aer Lingus services between Shannon and London, Manchester and Paris continued to operate in 1966; British European Airways also operated, as in 1965, on the Shannon-London route.  The turnover of the Sales and Catering Service at the airport for the year ended 31st January, 1966 amounted to £1,900,000, an increase of 15 per cent over the figure for the previous year and the highest cash figure yet recorded.  This satisfactory <Col N="2266" /> outcome is due in part to the 12 per cent increase in Shannon passenger traffic in 1965.  Sales will be affected by the new American Government restrictions on duty-free imports.</P>
    <P>The total capital expenditure on Shannon Airport up to 31st March, 1966, amounted to about £5,930,000. For the year ended 31st March, 1966, the operating surplus was £228,000. Including depreciation and interest on capital expenditure amounting to about £520,000, there was an overall deficit of £292,000.</P>
    <P>All sectors of traffic at Cork Airport continued to increase.  The number of passengers rose in 1965 by 20 per cent to 135,000, while freight increased by 20 per cent to 1,550 metric tons.  In the first six months of 1966, passenger traffic increased by 13 per cent and freight traffic by 63 per cent.  The 20 per cent rate of growth since 1962, which is expected to be maintained, will necessitate additional passenger handling facilities and in addition to extensions now under way a long-term plan of development is being prepared. The total capital expenditure on Cork Airport up to 31st March, 1966 amounted to about £1,430,000.  For the year ended 31st March, 1966, the overall deficit on the airport was about £213,000.</P>
    <P>In the case of the three airports, if the accounts are relieved of air navigation services charges, in keeping with procedures in other countries including Great Britain, the overall deficit of £663,000 shown in the accounts for 1965-66 becomes an overall surplus of £220,000.  Comparisons of cost per aircraft movement are difficult to make but our studies do not suggest that there is any excessive expenditure whatever.</P>
    <P>There was some criticism of the increase in the passenger service charge at our airports from 7/6d to 10/- from 1st April, 1966.  Most of the criticism was on the ground that the corresponding charge at British airports had been abolished some time ago.  In fact British passengers are paying higher fares to offset increased landing charges substituted for passenger charges.  The increased charge at Irish airports is <Col N="2267" /> still lower than the level at many other European airports.</P>
    <P>The provision for tourism takes the form of three grants-in-aid to Bord Fáilte Éireann under Subheads F.1, F.2 and F.3 of the Vote for my Department. I am proposing that the provision under Subhead F.1 for this year should be £1,911,000.  This is Bord Fáilte's main grant-in-aid and from it they are required to meet the cost of overseas publicity and advertising, including the operation of overseas offices, and a wide range of special activities such as improvement works at minor resorts and at places of historic or other special interest, the provision of amenities in angling areas, the provision of road signs, the development of special attractions of a sporting or cultural character, assistance to hotel staff training schemes, the payment of interest grants on loans raised for accommodation and resort development and promotional work in connection with festivals and international conferences.</P>
    <P>The Tourist Traffic Act, 1961, authorised the payment to Bord Fáilte with effect from 1st April, 1961, of amounts not exceeding in the aggregate £5 million for the financing of these activities.  The amount voted last year brought the total amount provided since 1st April, 1961, above the statutory limit of £5 million but the Tourist Traffic Act, 1966, removed this restrriction.</P>
    <P>The provision under this subhead shows an increase of £64,000 over the amount voted last year.  It is necessary to maintain expenditure at this level in view of the important place occupied by tourism in the national economy.  Though the rate of increase in our earnings from tourism over the past few years has been at the level required for the attainment of the Second Programme target&mdash;a doubling of 1960 tourist revenue at constant money value by 1970&mdash;competition in international tourism is becoming much keener and as the base for calculation of the annual increase gets larger, it is becoming progressively more difficult to maintain this rate of increase.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2268" /> The provision of £260,000 for resort development swells the total expenditure to £1.25 million since the inauguration of the scheme.  The level of expenditure is now £3.25 million as a result of recent legislation.  Many basic development works, such as access roads, parks and recreationary services have been completed.  The accommodation grants will total £500,000 compared with £255,000 last year. The statutory limit of expenditure has been raised to £3 million by the Tourist Traffic Act 1966, £1½ million having been spent to aid private investors in adding an average of 700 registered bedrooms each year to the total stock of registered accommodation.  The Bord Fáilte accommodation target has been stepped up to 2,000 rooms per year of which 1,200 are in hotels and the rest in other premises.  Bord Fáilte are actively promoting more hotel investment for which 20 per cent cash grants are available.</P>
    <P>A particular problem which has been impeding progress has been the shortage of credit.  A number of promising projects have been postponed or abandoned because the promoters were unable to raise the necessary capital and this has caused me considerable concern.  The problem goes beyond the present world restriction of credit since both here and in other countries, medium term loans suitable for hotels, are not being offered due to causes that are likely to persist.  I am endeavouring to ensure that adequate credit will be made available for hotel expansion and that in the allocation of credit, tourism will receive the priority due to it as an export-intensive industry and as an industry giving directly or indirectly employment equivalent to 160,000 jobs.</P>
    <P>The total provision for tourism this year, at £2.67 million, is quite substantial but is justified by the return to the economy as shown by the considerable growth which has already resulted from the increased investment of the past few years.</P>
    <P>The total income from tourism and travel amounted to £78.2 million in 1965, an increase of £10.2 million on the 1964 figure of £68 million.  The <Col N="2269" /> volume of tourist income is, therefore, &ldquo;on target&rdquo; in relation to the Second Programme for Economic Expansion and in the remaining five years of this decade an annual increase of £6.9 per cent is required if the 1970 target is to be achieved.</P>
    <P>One of the most important aspects of the infrastructure of tourism is the adequacy of transport services.  A serious deficiency in this field up to recently was the lack of drive-on car ferry services from Britain.  I should like to record again the fact that as and from 1960, I accelerated the campaign to interest the executives of the Midland and Western Regional Boards of British Railways in co-operation with Bord Fáilte and CIE, using every possible means to interest them in Irish tourism, culminating with the establishment of close personal association with Dr. Beeching.  At the same time, the British Railway shipping administration and the two regions came under the direction of extremely active and go-ahead personalities.</P>
    <P>The introduction of the new ferry service to Dún Laoghaire in 1965 was a most welcome outcome of all this pressure.  In addition, the vessels serving the Fishguard-Rosslare route were modified for drive-on drive-off operations and access was greatly faciliated by the construction of a new road at Rosslare.  My confidence in the market for these services has been fully justified by the results.  The first year of operation of the new services saw a sharp increase in the number of cars carried into Ireland.  Over 46,000 were carried in by sea and air, an increase of 53 per cent over the 1964 figure. The indications are that a further expansion of car ferry capacity will be necessary in the near future.  The new terminal now under construction at Dún Laoghaire has been designed to cope with an expanded service.</P>
    <P>From 1963 onwards it was clear to me that sufficient funds should be made available to Bord Fáilte to extend the scope of their organisation in order to include marketing surveys based on the latest technical methods of ascertaining tourist motivations, tourist requirements&mdash;accommodation, <Col N="2270" /> pricing, duration of stay and including independent research by an agency to establish the value of Bord Fáilte services, the attitude of travel agents abroad to Irish tourism and the reaction of their clients.</P>
    <P>At the same time, it was necessary to prepare a full statement of development requirements and finally a very detailed market appraisal of priorities in promoting the different types of holiday from the general motorist to those interested in fishing, golf, monuments, etc.  These surveys are proceeding but in addition to giving Bord Fáilte a specific plan of development, they are used for regular contact with all the Irish agencies responsible for handling tourist traffic.</P>
    <P>One of the matters to which I gave particular attention on assuming responsibility for tourism was stimulation of increased local and regional effort. Following discussions with Bord Fáilte and other tourism interests, a scheme was formulated for the establishment of eight regional tourism organisations. These new companies, which are representative of the local authorities as well as tourism and general business interests, have gone about their task in a vigorous way and now enjoy widespread support from the public and the industry.  There is evidence today of an excellent spirit of self-help and local initiative in the field of tourism and this growth in local activity, spearheaded by the regional companies, is one of the most encouraging features of our present tourist structure.</P>
    <P>The regional companies in their first year in full operation established a countrywide network of 70 tourist information offices and, by keeping in contact with hoteliers and supplementary accommodation, they were able to spread surplus bookings to premises with spare capacity.  These offices dealt with 800,000 varied enquiries and found accommodation for 93,000 people in 1965.  Though the operation of the tourist information offices has been the major preoccupation of the regional organisations, they are also engaged in other important activities such as the preparation of a regional guide and the collection of names for consideration by Bord Fáilte for inclusion  <Col N="2271" /> in their lists of supplementary accommodation.</P>
    <P>In addition, each regional organisation is engaged in compiling detailed information on the tourism resources of its area, in co-operation with Bord Fáilte and the planning authorities, as the first step in the preparation of a tourism plan.  The directors of the regional organisations are to be congratulated on the whole success to date. The problem of financing Regional Tourist Boards when they have fully developed their organisation and resources arises for consideration.  There is a case for transferring part or all of the resort development administration to these bodies at some later stage, grants being provided by Bord Fáilte in return for local financing.</P>
    <P>At the present time the rates have increased to the point that any step to raise the maximum poundage rate that can be struck for tourism from the present level of 1d in the £1 for county councils and 3d in the £1 for corporations, urban district councils and town commissioners, would not be received with enthusiasm.  It should be stated that an examination of the position in seven counties enjoying a significant tourist trade shows that not one of them is contributing at the maximum rate.  Two of them have voted tourist contributions of 90 per cent or more of the maximum possible, but the remainder have voted smaller contributions which in the case of two of the counties amount to only 50 per cent of the permissible limit.</P>
    <P>But I would fail in my duty if I did not state that for example in the southern region, which comprises Counties Kerry and Cork, the total tourist income for a recent year was £6 million.  The total tourist contribution by all the local authorities in the area for this year is £7,316, compared with an aggregate of over £4 million collected in rates in 1965-66. The tourist income in fact is equivalent to a year and a halfs total rates. I pose the question: Is this a sufficient contribution bearing in mind that in no other tourist country would the <Col N="2272" /> national tourist office be expected to invest heavily in the local tourist infrastructure beyond its present commitments?</P>
    <P>The further development of the tourist industry depends to a very great extent on the provision of additional accommodation and the promotion of traffic outside the peak season.  The stage has been reached in which some hotels are operating to the limit of their capacity at the peak of the season and in which other services are working under extreme pressure during that period.  The accommodation situation remains under constant review and recently I gave authority to Bord Fáilte to make grants to smaller guest houses which provide a minimum of five guest bedrooms and to assist small hoteliers by providing grants towards the cost of surveys of their premises.</P>
    <P>There is a growing demand for inclusive charge holidays and a more widespread packaging of all types of holidays is required if Ireland is to compete with other countries in the tourist market.  In an effort to encourage the provision of all-in holidays, Bord Fáilte held seminars in 11 centres this year, to explain the requirements to hoteliers, festival organisers, car renters and other tourist interests.</P>
    <P>With a view to encouraging people to take their holidays earlier in the year, the Government have decided that with effect from 1967 the movable Whit Monday holiday will be replaced by a fixed holiday on the first Monday in June in accordance with one of the recommendations of the Commission of Inquiry into Public Holidays and Bank Holidays.  As already announced, the August Bank Holiday will continue unchanged until we have an opportunity of assessing what effect the British change has on the pattern of tourist traffic to this country.</P>
    <P>There is still a vast amount of miscellaneous activity to be fostered if tourism is to grow and flourish.  The following are some examples:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2273" /> 1.  The growth of farmhouse and guesthouse accommodation.</P>
    <P>2.  The provision of properly equipped caravan parks.</P>
    <P>3.  The use of schools for student accommodation in some areas.</P>
    <P>4.  The extension of the season by local and regional publicity found to be so successful in the case of the Killarney Co-ordinating Committee and other such bodies.</P>
    <P>5.  Far more indoor entertainment and beach facilities for young people at many seaside resorts.</P>
    <P>6.  The further development of sea angling facilities, a local angling committee plus the provision of boats.</P>
    <P>7.  The provision of Irish entertainment and the maintenance of a high standard of performance in certain rural areas.</P>
    <P>8.  Entertainment of the type given at Bunratty Castle but varying in type at various suitable centres throughout the country.</P>
    <P>9.  The signposting of local scenic roads exemplified by the Kerry Ring road.</P>
    <P>10.  The improvement of amenities and information services related to the major group of national monuments. A co-ordinating committee established by the Office of Public Works on which my Department is represented is working out a programme for this.</P>
    <P>11.  The establishment of one or more folk villages both for the sake of preserving our own heritage and to attract tourists.</P>
    <P>12.  Some constructive thinking about the standards applied to the letting of private houses in certain areas.</P>
    <P>At the beginning of the year, Bord Fáilte estimated that there would be an income of £85 million from tourism in 1966.  As a result of the seamen's strike, the Board now estimates that there will be a reduction of about five per cent in the total number of visitors this year, but this will be offset in some degree by increases in receipts of Irish transport companies. <Col N="2274" /> While an increase in tourist income over that for 1965 can be expected, it is unlikely that the original estimate of £85 million will be attained.</P>
    <P>Despite the disturbance of traffic resulting from the seamen's strike this year, our progress towards the doubling of tourist income over the decade between 1960 and 1970 remains reasonably satisfactory.  However, there are still a number of problems to be faced. Increased competition from other countries will make it more difficult to achieve the required rate of expansion. The increased number of tourists has increased the revenue but has also put a greater strain on our resources and shown that they are not fully adequate.  The 1970 target can be achieved only by continued investment in expanding travel facilities, accommodation and recreational facilities and by the co-operation of every sector of the tourist industry in overcoming these obstacles.</P>
    <P>I am glad to tell the House that the promotional and administrative arrangements for co-operation between Bord Fáilte and the Northern Irish Tourist Board are proceedings satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>The demand for electricity continues to increase.  During the year 1965-66 the total output at 3,546 million units was nearly 10 per cent higher than in the previous year.  The rate of growth in demand for electricity reflects the progress in the economic development of the country and the improvements in the living standards of our people, but some portion of the increase was inflationary in character. The peak demand on the ESB last winter was 815 mw; the previous winter's peak was 755 mw.  Generation from native sources in 1965-66 was almost 56 per cent of total output.</P>
    <P>The Board's long term programme of generating plant is related to an average annual increase in demand of nine per cent as envisaged in the Second Programme for Economic Expansion and which compares with the European average increase rate of about seven per cent.  Between now and <Col N="2275" /> 1970 the Board's plans provide for two new oil fired stations, each having two 60 mw units, at Great Island, County Wexford, and Tarbert, County Kerry. In 1970-71 the first of two 120 mw sets will be commissioned at the new Pigeon House &ldquo;B&rdquo; station and the second will be commissioned in the following year.  The implementation of these plans, together with 100 mw already commissioned since 31st March, will bring the Board's total installed capacity to 1,649.5 mw by 1971-72, as compared with 1,069.5 mw at 31st March, 1966.</P>
    <P>The Board has again had to incur substantial expenditure on the strengthening of the distribution system to meet increasing local peak loads.</P>
    <P>There has been some slowing down in the post-development work on rural electrification due to the need to augment and strengthen the network supplying existing customers and to the need to conserve capital finance.  Nevertheless, almost 10,000 new rural customers were connected during the year bringing the total to 321,000.  This represents 83.5 per cent of rural premises.  The amount voted this year for repayment of the subsidy advanced from the Central Fund for rural electrification is £627,700.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Non-stamping of Social Welfare Cards.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I addressed the following question to the Minister for Social Welfare:</P>
      <P>To ask the Minister for Social Welfare the number of employees that have been denied social welfare benefits because of their employers' failure to stamp their cards in the years 1964 and 1965, and during the past nine months.</P>
      <P>In reply, the Minister said that statistics were not available which would enable the information sought to be given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This strikes me as rather peculiar and indicates one-sideness on the part <Col N="2276" /> of the Minister's Department because the Minister was in a position in relation to a previous question to indicate the number of prosecutions that had been taken against employers who had failed to stamp their employees' cards. There is a clear indication that the Minister's Department are not concerned or have not the means to ensure that workers will be safeguarded to the extent that, by having their cards stamped, in respect of which money is deducted from their wages, they will benefit eventually.</P>
    <P>There have been a number of cases of failure on the part of employers to stamp cards.  Having regard to the number of such cases, one would imagine that the Department and, in particular, the Minister, would have done something positive to avoid such happenings.  It is extremely unfair to expect a worker to know whether or not the employer is stamping cards. There is a great deal of trust involved. The worker has no access to the employer's records.  However, there are in the Minister's Department a number of inspectors&mdash;I am inclined to think not too many&mdash;whose duty it is to make spot checks for the purpose of ensuring that cards are stamped.</P>
    <P>I have come across a case of a clothing factory in Marlboro Street, Dublin.  The factory operated for three years.  During the course of those three years, complaint was made about the employer's failure to stamp cards. Notice was drawn to this when members of the staff left and drew their cards.  The matter was reported to the Department and, in consequence, there were a number of inspections of the factory.  Eventually a summons was issued against the employer but almost 12 months elapsed before the employer was brought to court.  When the case was called, the employer had gone to Canada.  The workers were left high and dry and were unable to obtain benefit because their cards had not been stamped.</P>
    <P>That such cases could occur indicates the injustice and one-sideness in connection with this whole scheme of things.  They are not isolated cases <Col N="2277" /> The Dublin Council of Trade Unions have entered into correspondence with the Minister about this matter, urging him to adopt ways and means of ensuring that this practice is discontinued. It is beyond my comprehension as to why the Minister cannot evolve a system which would ensure that employers will not get the opportunity to avoid paying their share of the stamp and, in addition, deduct the employee's share from his wages and not stamp the cards.  When the employer fails to stamp the cards and eventually goes away, it means that the employee has lost the money paid by way of contribution and is denied benefit.</P>
    <P>It is an extraordinary state of affairs that, on the other hand, the employee is obliged to conform to the PAYE system, in respect of which deductions are made from his wages and, if the employer absconds, the worker is not held responsible.  For some unknown reason, the Department of Social Welfare continues to hold the worker responsible for the stamping of cards.  This is a matter that is crying out for attention.  I can not understand why there is not sufficient liaison between Departments so that one Department would show the other the right thing to do.  Maybe it is because it is working class people who are involved, people who have to pay these contributions as a form of insurance in order that they will benefit should they become unemployed, as compared with moneyed persons who do not have to contribute to social insurance.</P>
    <P>The amazing thing about the factory to which I have referred is that although the factory inspector has made periodic checks over three years, the last check he made was 12 months before the employer was prosecuted and at that time the employer was found not to be stamping cards. Almost 12 months elapsed without anything being done and then the employer left the country and the workers were left holding the baby. Representations have been made to the Department about this and the <Col N="2278" /> answer given is that the workers have a right to appeal against the decision not to pay the social welfare benefit, that they can appeal within 21 days but that the Department cannot be sure that it will do any good, that they cannot do anything about it, that there would be no real point in making such an appeal.  This clearly indicates that the powers that be&mdash;I assume, the Minister&mdash;have decided that nothing can or will be done in the matter.</P>
    <P>During the course of the supplementaries today, I thought I heard the Minister say he would like to have information in connection with matters of this kind.  If that is all that is required, we can give him plenty of it.  But I see little point in giving the Minister information about the happenings I have described unless something positive is done about them.  If the Minister is not at present in the position to do anything about them, he should spare no time in arranging to do something about them.  As I said, it appears to be a simple matter.</P>
    <P>In his reply today, the Minister referred to an annual certificate being given to a person.  What I am concerned about is the weekly return. Any man or woman in employment has no say in whether or not money should be deducted from his or her wages for PAYE or social welfare contributions.  The law is there: it must be taken from their wages. Surely, when we have reached that stage, the workers concerned should, in the case of social welfare, be afforded some protection?  Instead they are told: &ldquo;Your man has gone to Canada.  If you hear about him, come back and let us know and we will do something about it&rdquo;.  This was told to 12 young girls working in the clothing factory in Marlboro Street.  It appears that one of them is expected to go down to Shannon, another to Dún Laoghaire and another to the North Wall to keep a watch on this fellow's movements.  This is quite ridiculous.</P>
    <P>This matter has been the subject <Col N="2279" /> of representation by the Dublin Council of Trade Unions to the Minister. All that is being sought is security for working men and women, an assurance that when money is deducted from their wages, it will be taken care of and that they will not be left wondering whether they are working for a bad employer or a decent employer so far as this is concerned. Unfortunately, I have not got at present the number of Department inspectors who have to go round and make an inspection of each premises with a view to ensuring that social welfare cards are stamped. However, I think I am safe in saying they are few in number.  I am positive one could count them, if not on one hand, then certainly on two.  If we take into consideration the number of places of employment there are, even in Dublin, let alone the whole country, we realise how this system cannot operate properly.  In view of the many duties such inspectors have to carry out, apart from inspecting such premises, surely this is a matter crying out for attention?</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to indicate if he has any real intention of putting an end to this low, mean, despicable practice on the part of some employers who, in consequence of what they do, leave unfortunate working class people holding the bag.</P>
    <Speaker pid="StephenCoughlan" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to add my experience to that expressed by my colleague, Deputy Mullen, in regard to the manner in which the Department treats employer and employee.  The Minister said today that he had no statistics in regard to the number of prosecutions.  If he had a grip of his Department or had any concern for the workers, it would have been a simple matter for him to contact the Department of Justice.  There he would have got all the statistics he wanted concerning the number of prosecutions over a period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I reported to the alleged Department of Social Welfare 12 months ago a case in which eight workers on a <Col N="2280" /> sewerage scheme in County Limerick were deprived of benefit because their employer failed to stamp their cards. Some months previously that employer was prosecuted and fined £5 for not stamping the cards of those eight men, six of whom were married.  That was practically two years ago.  Since then these people have been deprived of their benefit while that man is still continuing his work as a building contractor in another county.  I made representations to the Minister on many occasions in regard to this case and got no satisfaction.  Now most of these unfortunate people are drawing home assistance from Limerick Health Authority.  That comes out of the rate-payers' pockets and not out of the Department's.</P>
    <P>We in the Labour Party fail to understand the inhuman attitude of the Minister in the manner in which he pursues this regulation.  Why should these unfortunate men be deprived of benefit to which they have duly contributed? Deductions made week after week are fraudulently put aside to the employer's benefit.  Then these workers are deprived of their social welfare benefit.  That is the case we are making. Within the past month or six weeks, I reported another case to the Minister where the employer failed to stamp a card.  The answer I got back was that the employee concerned had the right of prosecution.  In 1966, in holy, Catholic Ireland, is this what we have to put up with because of the inhuman approach by the Minister?  Of course, inhumanity comes easily to him.</P>
    <P>This matter concerns me gravely.  I bring unfortunate people down to the home assistance officer week in and week out begging and craving for £1 or 30/- to keep their bones together because of delays by you and your Department.  The responsibility for this rests on your shoulders.  We are going to keep pursuing this until the Minister takes a human approach and treats Irish people as they should be treated and not like dogs.</P>

      <P>The non-stamping of cards by employers is looked upon as a very serious offence by my Department and <Col N="2281" /> by myself.  In such cases, it is the practice to prosecute the defaulting employer for breaking the law in this regard and to sue him for the arrears of contributions due because only the contributions are, in fact, due to my Department.  In the case of an insured person who loses benefit because of the default of the employer to stamp the card, that is, under the law, a debt due by the employer to the person concerned.</P>
      <P>My Department notifies people who have lost benefit in this respect that, if a person is not in a position to sure for the loss of benefit, the Department will consider suing for him and, in fact, a number of such cases are taken each year.  For instance, there are approximately 8,000 disability benefit cases which have either to be refused or in which a reduced rate of benefit is payable because of an insufficient number of stamps being credited to the person concerned.  The vast majority of these are of course just because of the fact that, for one reason or another, the person was not entitled to have the requisite number of stamps. We receive, out of these 8,000 cases which are so refused, approximately 150 complaints that the cards should have been stamped by the employers but were not.  These people are all entitled to their rights in this respect. In fact, only about 30 of them come back to us.  The others deal with the matter themselves in some way with their employers.</P>
      <P>In cases of people who are unable to take proceedings themselves, my Department is prepared to do it and we do recover an amount of benefit for people in this respect each year.  As regards the employers who default, they are prosecuted by the Department. I certainly consider it a matter of urgency that this should be done as soon as possible and I am satisfied that this is in fact the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is, of course, as the Deputy who made the statement knows, completely untrue to say that I stated here today that I was not in a position to state the number of cases in which prosecutions take place.  In fact, I gave that information <Col N="2282" /> to the House already today.  Every possible step is taken to see that the arrears of contributions are paid and every possible assistance is given by my Department to people to recover any benefit they have lost.  I cannot see that there is very much more that can be done in the matter.  We maintain an inspection staff for the purpose of ensuring that the law is complied with by employers and a number of prosecutions take place each year.  It may be that the courts do not deal as severely with these offences as they should but I can hardly be held responsible for that.</P>
    <P>With regard to this question of the issuing of receipts, I am sure most reasonable people will see that it would be impracticable to issue receipts to approximately 700,000 people every week in respect of these insurance stamps, as has been requested here and, in fact, it would be a fairly considerable annual administrative expense to do it.  As a result of the representations, to which Deputy Mullen referred, by the Dublin Council of Trade Unions, and as I stated here today, a new arrangement has been come to with regard to the surrendering of these cards, whereby, before the employees' cards are surrendered at the end of the contribution year, the employer is now required to obtain the signature of each employee on the card so that now, at least, it is ensured that each employee will know at the end of the contribution year whether or not his card has been stamped.  Of course, employees are entitled at present to inspect their cards not more frequently than once a month to ensure that they are stamped. I appreciate that employees generally just would not do that and that it would not be very popular with the employers if they demanded it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a completely different thing from PAYE.  These benefits provided under the Social Insurance Acts can be paid only provided certain contribution conditions are fulfilled.  As I say, the insured person who is deprived of benefit because of a defaulting employer has this redress against the employer.  Unfortunately, as in the case of anybody who has to take action against an individual for something to which he is entitled, if the person concerned absconds, there is nothing he can do about it.  That is the same with regard to any other type of debt.</P>

      <P>The only thing I think it might be possible to do is to extend this new idea of requiring the employer to get the employee's signature on the insurance card.  The requirement now is that this must be done before the card is surrendered.  I am considering whether it would be possible to insist that that signature would be obtained, say, once every quarter so that the employee would know, even before the end of the year, whether or not the employer was stamping his card regularly.  I think that should meet the situation.  Any employee, then, who was not asked to sign his card at the end of each quarter would have reason to believe that the employer was not fulfilling his obligations under the law in this respect and could report the matter to my Department when action would be taken as speedily as possible.</P>
