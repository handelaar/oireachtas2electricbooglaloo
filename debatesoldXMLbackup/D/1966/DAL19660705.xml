      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power if he is aware that Northern Ireland cattle were being shipped from the North Wall, Dublin on B &amp; I boats during the recent shipping strike while cattle from this part of the country were left in the port; and if he can explain why this was done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>The allocation of shipping space on the company's vessels is the responsibility of the Board of the B &amp; I Company.  I have, however, had inquiries made of the company and I am advised that, as cattle space during the British seamen's strike was at a premium, they exercised great care in allocating space amongst the cattle shippers.  The company also did everything possible to ensure that no cattle were shipped which could be alleged to have been diverted traffic.  Cattle were accepted only from regular shippers.  It is possible that some of the cattle exported by such shippers originated in Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power if he has made an assessment of the effect on the country's tourist earnings of the British seamen's strike; and how far such earnings will fail short of those originally estimated for this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by Bord Fáilte that it is estimated that up to the end of the British shipping strike the loss to this country's tourist earnings by reason of the strike was between £1.5m. and £2m.  It will not be possible, however, to evaluate the full extent of the loss for some time for the reasons that some people who had planned holidays here between July and September may have cancelled them whilst others who could not come here because of the strike may come later in the season.</P>
      <P>Earnings from tourism of £85m. will be required this year to maintain the average increase which would achieve the industry's target for 1970 under the Second Programme for Economic Expansion.</P>

      <P>The Bord Fáilte offices abroad provide a full tourist information service for intending visitors to Ireland, including information about Irish hotels.  The Official Guide to hotels, guesthouses, holiday camps and hostels is given on request at these offices.  A hotel reservation service is provided for North American and Continental travel agents at the Bord Fáilte offices.  Aer Lingus also operate a full hotel reservation service in their North American and Continental offices.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Dr. Hillery) (for the Minister for Finance)</NameTxt>
      <P>The review of the organisation and systems of the Civil Service with a view to modernisation and the achievement of the highest efficiency is a continuous process.  As I said in reply to the Deputy's question on 10th March, 1966, specially trained staff are constantly examining new possibilities of improvement.  Since then, there have been notable developments in the field of automatic data processing. Computers will soon make their appearance in the Central Statistics Office, the Land Commission and <Col N="1768" /> the Department of Defence.  The present computer installation in the Revenue Commissioners' Office will be replaced next year by one immensely more powerful.</P>
      <P>If the Deputy has in mind the group, referred to in my March statement, to be set up to review the organisation and functioning of the Civil Service at the administrative level, steps are being taken to assemble that group.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of officers experienced in the general field referred to in the question is being augmented as successive officers serve tours of duty in the appropriate sections of the Departments directly concerned.</P>
      <P>In addition, training courses operated by my Department for new entrants to the public service include lectures on such groups and organisations as the European Economic Community, the European Free Trade Association, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development.  Facilities are provided also for the attendance of officials at classes and courses in the principal European languages.</P>
      <P>No additional schemes are at present contemplated but the matter is being kept under review.</P>

      <P>Could the Minister say if it is contemplated in the near future to do anything extra about our people in the diplomatic service towards enabling <Col N="1769" /> them to get a greater appreciation of commercial realities?  Is the Minister aware that a feeling has grown up in recent years that our embassies do not appear to have up to date information about current commercial developments?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>

      <P>The front of the building was very shabby and in view of the number of distinguished guests visiting the Castle in connection with the recent Presidential inauguration it was decided to improve its appearance by a minimal amount of redecoration.

      <P>I propose, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 15, 16, 17 and 18 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These four questions relate to the exercise by Dublin Corporation of powers conferred on them under section 45 of the Dublin Corporation <Col N="1777" /> Act, 1890.  A copy of this Act, and in particular section 45 thereof may, I am informed, be inspected in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    <P>I understand from Dublin Corporation that the position in regard to the closing of this Row is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Representations were made by a firm who stated that they were the fee simple owners of all the property on both sides of Dorset Row and that as the Row was no longer used by the general public they wished to make formal application to have the Row abandoned.</P>
    <P>The matter was brought before An Coisde Sráideanna at its meeting on 5th May, 1964, who recommended that the application be granted.  Notices under section 45 were served on the interested parties on 31st December, 1964, by the Law Agent.  The notices were served on the managing director of the firm who are the people on whom notice has to be served under the statute.  In addition, a copy of the notice was posted on a conspicuous part of Dorset Row on the same date, with plan attached.  No objections were received within the statutory period and on the 16th March, 1966, an Order was made by the Assistant City Manager declaring Dorset Row closed in accordance with the provisions of section 45 of the Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the case that, in accordance with this Dublin Corporation Act, 1890, representations were made to the City Surveyor by the very firm that wanted the roadway closed and that, after these representations were made, notification to the owners of the soil adjoining this roadway was sent directly to the firm concerned, to the people who wanted the thoroughfare closed down?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not all of it. As the Deputy would have heard, as I read it out, that is only part of the story.  There was the notice by the Law Agent which was served on the managing director.  A copy of the notice was posted on a conspicuous part of Dorset Row which would have been seen if people were using Dorset Row. No objections were received within the period, and the order was made only on 16th March of this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>People who were in the habit of using this thoroughfare up to one month ago were astonished to see that a private firm had this road closed down.  As this has given rise to a great deal of unease in the area, and as the action taken under this remote Act of 1890 of closing down a public thoroughfare does not meet with approval in the area, would the Minister reconsider opening the position?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister arrange with Dublin Corporation that they will at least make some public statement in regard to their housing programme?  Many people have been misled within the past week or two by newspaper reports that gave a totally different impression in regard to the housing programme of Dublin Corporation and believed there was a possibility in the near future of obtaining a house, even people without children.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know how I would be able to arrange for the publication of this sort of accurate information. I presume the newspapers' source of information is the City Hall, whether through officials or councillors, I cannot say, and if these reports prove to be inaccurate, I do not think it is any reflection on the newspaper reporters.  Furthermore, I would be surprised if the councillors of the Corporation did not make the people whom they represent fully aware of what is going on.</P>

However, I would say that the suggestion should commend itself to the members of the Dublin Corporation, of whom I believe there are 45.  They might consider this at some of their meetings, and if they feel there is cause for concern in this regard, they should <Col N="1781" /> take steps to have accurate publication for the benefit of the public.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy has in mind a fingerpost sign similar to an informative direction sign as authorised under section 95 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961.  If such a sign, while <Col N="1783" /> indicating the way to a hotel or the like, in fact facilitates the public by indicating, particularly in a remote area, the direction to take, there is no objection to a local authority permitting the use of their signpost for the erection of the sign.  If the sign amounts merely to an advertising sign, it would be wrong for the local authority to allow its attachment to a signpost erected for traffic signs.  Apart from whether a local authority signpost is used or not permission must be obtained under the Road Traffic Act, 1961, and the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963.</P>

      <P>It is not correct to say that Mayo County Council were informed that no money was available for construction of the bridge referred to.  It was originally the council's intention to finance this work which is located on a county road with the aid of their annual county road improvement grant; this is the normal means employed by county councils to finance the construction of bridges on county roads.  The council subsequently decided to seek a loan for the purpose.  They were advised by my Department on 12th May last that there was no immediate prospect of loan accommodation for the work, and that an indication could not then be given as to when such accommodation might be expected.  They were invited to consider adopting their original proposal for financing the work, to enable it to be put in hands at an early date, and I understand that they recently decided to do so.</P>

As I stated in my reply to a question from the Deputy on 6th May, 1965, statistics which would show the number of old age pensioners in receipt of public assistance are not compiled regularly but special returns obtained in November, 1964, showed that some 2,600 (or 2.3 per cent) non-contributory old age pensioners were in receipt of public assistance.</P>

The claimant appealed on 14th February, against the decision of the pension committee awarding her a pension at the rate of 42/6d from 6th November, 1965.  An appeals officer decided on 4th April that she was entitled to a pension of 42/6d a week from 6th November increased to 47/6d from 30th December.  The delay was due to faulty handling of the case in the Department and it is hoped that new arrangements which have been made will ensure that similar delays will not occur in future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 66, 67, 68 and 69 together.</P>
      <P>At the outset I wish to say that the necessity for seeking medical opinion promptly on the occurrence of suspicious symptoms or signs has always been stressed by those concerned with the treatment of cancer.  Unfortunately, there is frequently a reluctance to act on this advice.  The Irish Cancer Society has engaged in valuable publicity in efforts to bring home to the public the advantages of early advice and treatment. My Department has endeavoured by various measures to discourage young people, particularly, from taking up cigarette smoking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My attention has been drawn to the statements attributed to Professor Urbach in regard to the incidence of skin cancer.  Until the proposed survey in this country has been completed it would I think be premature for me to make any firm statements about the incidence of skin cancer here.  I may say, however, that I have no scientific evidence which would establish that, in relation to Irish conditions, any particular amount of exposure to sunlight would cause skin cancer.  The survey in question is being carried out with substantial financial assistance from the Irish Cancer Society, out of funds raised from the public.  The balance of cost <Col N="1805" /> will be borne by the Galway County Council subject to recoupment from the Vote of my Department.</P>
    <P>The subject of cancer publicity presents many problems and it is most difficult to maintain balance as well as effectiveness in view of the propensity to public unease on this subject.  I am satisfied that the Irish Cancer Society already exercise great care in the preparation of publicity material for distribution to the public and I do not consider it necessary to make an approach to them in the matter.</P>
    <P>I am sure that Deputies will not have overlooked, in reference to recent press reports, the valuable publicity which was given at the same time to the extent to which skin cancer can be successfully treated, if taken in time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is aware of the irrational fear which exists, a fear similar to that which existed in relation to tuberculosis years ago?  Is the Minister satisfied that the methods adopted at the present time to educate the people into seeking medical advice early, in their own interests, are satisfactory?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I could never be completely satisfied but, in reply to the Deputy, all I can say is that there has been a great improvement&mdash;I think the Deputy will agree with me&mdash;in the publicity given to this unfortunate disease among our people.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health the number of ambulances in the Republic fitted with radio telephones; the counties that have such vehicles; and what action he intends to take to ensure that all ambulances are fitted with radio telephones.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Dublin, Cork and Dún Laoghaire Fire Brigades provide an accident ambulance service in their respective areas and their ambulances are fitted with radio-telephone equipment.  An ambulance based on Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, by arrangement with the Dublin Health Authority is also radio controlled.  In all other areas health authorities were requested by me on the 20th January last to take early steps to equip their ambulances with radio-telephones. They were informed on 26th February that expenditure on such equipment would be recouped to them from the Exchequer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must admit to some disappointment that with this encouragement health authorities have not made more rapid progress in having the necessary equipment installed.  I am communicating <Col N="1807" /> with health authorities forthwith to ensure that effective action is taken by them as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <P>An extraordinary situation has arisen as a result of this. If a tenant who has had the cottage vested in him wishes to sell portion of the plot to somebody to build a house, he is called upon to pay back to the local authority part of the purchase money.  I have the case of a man who bought a site for £200 from such a tenant.  The tenant was told by the local authority that they would require £180 of that to be paid to them.  I do not think this was the intention of the Bill.  Certainly, it was not the intention of the House.  The Minister might look at it to see if, by regulation or otherwise, he could prevent this sort of stupid thing happening.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The local authorities say they are acting on instructions they got by circular from the Minister. They say they must do this because it is laid down in the Bill.  The result is it has completely defeated the purposes of the Bill.  It means that it will be almost impossible to sell a cottage to anybody and impossible to sell portion of a site for building a house, all as a result of this stupid interpretation being put on it by some officials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am anxious that the Minister would avail of this opportunity to clarify the situation.  It was I who discussed this matter with Deputy Tully and brought this particular instance to his notice I should like to go into it in more detail.  The holder of a vested cottage had a daughter who got married and became eligible therefore for rehousing by Louth County Council. They were in a very bad way for a house.  We had the practice there of giving a half-acre plot with a cottage. We know now that is too big since the workman would not have time to cultivate it.  This man suggested he would give to his son-in-law half of his half-acre plot on which they would have a cottage erected for them by the county council.  There was no question of a money consideration passing at all. <Col N="1816" /> When the request came to the county council, they found the site suitable but informed the holder of the vested cottage that he must repay £183.  I asked the county manager if he was bound to do this by the law or by a regulation of the Minister and he informed me that the council were bound.</P>
      <P>I also had the case of a man who purchased a house in the Drogheda Corporation area for £4,800.  It was then found that £800 was owing on that house by the previous occupier.  Before the Corporation would consent to the transfer, they demanded the full capital sum of £800 from this man. He bought the house in good faith and now it is going to cost him another £800 or else there will have to be some sort of rethinking on the deal.  I know this is a time of financial stringency but it would help us if the Minister would clarify whether this is a decision of the local authority or whether there is an instruction from him or a regulation whereby the county manager must seek the repayment of any money paid on the transfer of a plot or a house. The Minister will realise that in making this request, I am not being in the least critical of himself or his Department, but it is of the utmost importance that it be clarified now.</P>

      <P>Whatever has to be done will be done by way of instructions. As far as the number in the household is concerned, this is one of the things we would all wish to accommodate, the problem of sub-division in regard to these large cottage plots where members of a household would be getting married and setting up a family.  No consideration of money need enter into a case such as this.  It does not apply to members of the household.  It is only where there is a profit or a consideration being obtained for the part of the plot that is being sold.  As I see it at the moment &mdash;and I am by no means inflexible about this&mdash;if somebody has a cottage plot, is purchasing a cottage and purchasing it on very good terms, and he has only, say, five years of the 35-year period paid when he decides to sell, I cannot see any question of injustice in the proportion of the money received being related to the proportion of the annuity paid.  In other words, if he had five years paid, he would get one-seventh of the price, and six-sevenths of it would go to the people who would own six-sevenths of the property.  If only part of the annuity is paid, then it seems just&mdash;although as I say, I am not inflexible about this&mdash;that the proportion of the annuity not paid should go to the public authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister not agree that, if somebody sells a plot for £200 and he has only one-tenth of the annuity paid, if he is told that of that £200 he will get £20 and the council will get £180, he will not complete the deal?  He would hold that his half acre of garden would be worth a lot more to him than £20. Does the Minister not agree that from that angle it is a rather foolish sort of arrangement, because it means that in every case these deals will just fall through?</P>

      <P>Take the case of the man who has only just commenced to purchase, and has paid say a year out of 40 years.  What does he own of that <Col N="1818" /> place?  If somebody wants to buy that, why should that man be entitled to get more than the proportion paid?  The Deputy makes the point that if this is all he will get, he will not be prepared to sell and, therefore, we will not have the facility of that additional site. That could arise, but what I am thinking of is that the plot might be required not for houses but for other commercial purposes of a very lucrative nature.  In that case the value would have no relationship to the value of the cottage and the plot.  Perhaps this site would be worth more than the whole thing originally cost.  Again, is there any reason why the local housing authority should not get a fair proportion of what is gained by virtue of part of their property being sold which they provided at public expense, money which they can put back into the housing account for the provision of housing and other such amenities in the future? That is the thought behind this matter, and it is not a question of trying to get money out of people unjustly or where it is not due.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> When the Minister says a cottage is vested for only a year and only one-fortieth of the annuity has been paid, he takes the view that the tenant-purchaser has little or nothing to sell.  All the tenant-purchaser is selling is his interest in the cottage, subject to the annuity. Surely the purchaser of the cottage which has only been vested for one year will have to continue to pay the annuity for 39 years?  Therefore, the council are not at any loss and I find it difficult to see why any of the money should be paid to the council.  All the tenant-purchaser who has the cottage vested in him for one year is selling is his interest, subject to the annuity which must be paid for 39 years.</P>

      <P>It is a good thing that this opportunity of discussing this matter has arisen and the Minister should consider clearing up this situation once and for all.  There is considerable confusion in the way in which this whole matter is operated. The Minister says that in the case of a family transaction there need be no redemption but I had a case where the local authority put a valuation on the divided portion and insisted on an annuity being put on the divided portion.  They asked the father to pay for the portion being handed over and the father had not a penny in his pocket.  I fought the matter for some time but the council decided that they would still have to get this and that then they would hand it back and the whole transaction was unnecessary. The council could have taken one-third <Col N="1821" /> of the valuation, built the house and given it to the son-in-law.</P>
      <P>The Minister is insisting that a certain portion of the selling price be returned to the county council.  He believes that is reasonable, and it may be so, but you will find the case where it is not reasonable and not desirable.  I am aware of cases where, if people were at liberty to sell the cottage and retain the money obtained for it, they would be able to buy an SDA house and put down the money obtained for the cottage as a deposit for such a house.  If this money or portion of it is taken by the council, these people will not have sufficient money to pay the deposit and so cannot leave the cottage.  If they had the money to pay the deposit on the house, they could leave the cottage which would then be available for somebody else.  The Minister should consider the matter very carefully before he insists that this money is retained by the local authority.  Individual cases need individual consideration.  The matter has now to go to the county council and then back to the applicant.  Such a procedure makes the sale almost impossible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course this is the law since last year and for that reason this matter was gently treated during the marathon passage of this Bill through the House.  At that time a number of us were pressing the Minister to make the regulations but the regulations which have been made do not bear out what the Minister tells us today.  It may be that in the first flush of making the regulations, the Department decided to make them pretty severe and they are much more severe than the Minister realises.  We are now considering amendments from the Seanad and no matter what we do, the Bill will become law, but, because of the fact that the Minister has to name a date for the coming into operation of the Bill itself, it means that some of this can be delayed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of the selling of vested plots, where the cottage and the plot are being sold, there is an option as to whether the annuity may be redeemed but where portion of the plot is being sold as a site, such option <Col N="1822" /> does not exist.  That portion of the site which is to be built on must have the annuity sub-divided and that annuity must be redeemed.  In this way the regulations made by the Minister are going to be all-important. When this matter was going through the House, some of us thought these provisions would be a protection against houses getting into the hands of people who should not get them, but now it appears that it will operate in having more and more vested houses locked up because the tenants would prefer to have them that way and visit them occasionally and to retain ownership rather than give them away.</P>
    <P>Under the counter dealings may also be introduced.  The people may sell the plot for a nominal sum and make a deal for a further figure which would be kept from the council.  The Minister may say that a valuation can be taken by the council but that is being done in the other way at the moment. The council waits to see what is the biggest price offered and then they say that is the valuation.  The thing is becoming too confused.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> What we are dealing with now is section 98.  We are having a very useful discussion, notwithstanding the fact that we may not be on the right section. Am I correct in thinking that it is not obligatory on a housing authority to order that portion of the sale price of a vested cottage be paid to the local authority?  I think that is the meaning of subsection (5) of section 98, which says:</P>

      <P>We are in order now. I take it that this amendment means that it is obligatory on the local authority to demand repayment of the outstanding portion of the annuity.  The Minister has been good enough to clarify for us that it is also in the Bill that there shall be a choice open to the local authority either to demand the repayment of all the outstanding portion of the annuity or one-third of it.  I should like to get two clarifications here.  First of all, is this an executive function of the county manager to decide as between the demand for one-third of that portion of the annuity outstanding and the whole, or is it a decision properly to be taken by the local authority itself?  Secondly, I would ask, what subsection of what section of this Bill provides for the manner of dealing with it described by the Minister?  I just want to get the thing down on the ground once <Col N="1824" /> and for all.  It is very necessary that we should start the discussion on that basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I think I would be in order now in referring to subsection (5) of section 98 because Seanad amendment No. 17 seems to substitute the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; for the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; in the first line of that subsection.  I certainly think that, at worst, the local authority and the Minister should have a discretion to say in certain cases that the owner of a vested cottage should be able to sell that cottage and retain the money for himself because, as has been said here earlier in this debate, very many people who occupy what we know as labourers' cottages wish to change from those cottages to a better type of house and provide themselves with these houses with the assistance of loans under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act.</P>
      <P>If a person has a labourer's cottage and is not allowed to sell it or, if allowed to sell it, is not allowed to retain the purchase price, he will not be in a position to build the other house.  If he is allowed to sell the labourer's cottage and build himself a house with the assistance of a loan under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act, he is, in fact, relieving the housing authority of building another house because somebody for whom, in the ordinary course of events, the local authority would be liable to provide a house will move into the labourer's cottage.  That is what in practice happens.  There will be all sorts of injustices arising unless this particular section is operated in a very sympathetic way.  Maybe I am wrong in this&mdash;I hope I am and that the Minister will tell me there are no grounds for my fear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many people who bought labourers' cottages in the last number of years, when there was no such restriction as this, at £300, £400, and £500.  If these people sell these cottages now, will they have to hand over some of the purchase price to the local authority and suffer a loss? There are people who have purchased labourers' cottages and have added rooms to them at considerable expense. <Col N="1825" /> I had such a query within the past few days.  Will these people now have to put up with the expense of adding a room to the house and, if they want to sell the cottage, will they have to hand over to the local authority part of the purchase price which has been enhanced by the addition of the room? I should like, for the benefit of owners of these vested cottages and others, if the Minister would kindly clear the air now because there seems to be quite an amount of confusion as to what exactly is the position and what the position will be when this section 98 becomes law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The first thing I should say, probably, is in regard to instructions sent out by way of circular or otherwise to the local authorities.  The practice that may have been brought to the notice of Deputies of sending them to and fro like a shuttlecock is not at all the intention but, for our own information, we have sought and have been getting, in the odd cases that have arisen, cases sent up to us to see how they are working.  This is how they are coming to us at the moment.  Once we get the pattern established and amended to some degree and running on a fairly even keel, there will not be this necessity, nor is there any legal requirement on local authorities to send them up.  We merely ask them to do so for our information so that we may see from operation in the various counties how the matter is being approached by the local authority and the manager.</P>
      <P>As to the matter mentioned on amendment No. 17, as to whether or not the decision is executive or reserved, it is an executive function.  As to where it derives from, it really derives in a negative way: since it is not stated in any part of our law that it is a reserved function, it follows that it is an executive function.</P>

The present situation is that, if it is an inter-family transaction, whether money passes between the members of the family or not, we are not concerned; no amount of that is demanded other than the repayment of the annuity as apportioned in respect of the part of the plot that is being alienated from the original and this, as Deputies know from experience, will be a very nominal figure indeed.</P>

      <P>It could.  The intention at the moment, and the method of operation, is to include a member of the household, not necessarily of the family.  There is no need to get down to definitions of blood relations.  Let us put it as &ldquo;a member of the household&rdquo;. We may have to change that again but after a great deal of thought <Col N="1827" /> about the matter, this is what we have come up with.</P>
      <P>Regarding sales to others than members of the household, there would again be an apportionment, a division, as it were, of the annuity and, as to the amount in respect of the plot to be alienated, there will then be a decision by the local authority, the county manager, if you like, in furtherance of his instruction by circular and regulation from my Department that the amount to be paid will be arrived at in relation to market value and will be related to the proportion of the annuity already paid.  If there is added value, reconstruction of rooms or improvements made, all of that added value would go to the vested owner of the cottage.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I should like the Minister to deal with another aspect of subsection (5) of this section.  I am interested from the practical point of view.  I am glad the Minister has said that where a room is added by the vested tenant, if he sells the cottage, on the basis of valuation he will not be expected to hand over any of the purchase money attributable to the additional rooms.  I should, however, like the Minister to deal with a particular type of case.  Suppose that three or four years ago, or even one year ago, a person bought a vested cottage for £500.  After the coming into operation of this Act, he decides to sell the cottage and gets, say, £550 or £600 for it.  What proportion of the purchase money, if any, will he be obliged to hand over to the local authority?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know the Minister will tell me &ldquo;such amount as may be approved by the Minister&rdquo;, but I am asking him, in making these rules and regulations, to put in some clause whereby a man who has actually paid out £300, £400 or £500 or any given sum to purchase a cottage before the law was changed, will not be obliged to be <Col N="1828" /> at a loss as a result of the coming into operation of this Act.  Unless I misunderstand the section, a person might well suffer a loss, and a comparatively large one, if he had bought the house as many people do for £500 &mdash;a common figure to give for a labourer's cottage&mdash;a short time ago. I would protest in the strongest terms if that man had to hand over any of the purchase money which would involve him in a net loss on the transaction. I would ask the Minister to deal with that aspect of the matter now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole intention is that nobody should be expected to make a loss.  If somebody paid £500 two or three years ago and then wants to sell the cottage under new laws and regulations, we must look at it then. If it is established that, in fact, in his efforts to sell he cannot get a better price than he paid for it or can only get less, which is quite possible, if he has made an effort, there will not be anything in this for the council.</P>

If somebody bought a cottage before the passing of the Labourers Act for £500 and after the passing of the Act, proposes to sell it for £500, what is the position?  There has been no redemption and the annuity is still being paid. Will the Minister say whether or not portion of that £500 will be paid to the council?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make a more serious statement.  I admit there is a certain amount of justification for the local authorities, who represent the ratepayers, getting back the one-third subsidy they have been paying on those cottages but I have repeatedly appealed to the Minister in connection with urban areas.  I find the most extraordinary position has arisen now in which in the town of Cobh, under some new regulation, the purchase price of the houses has been increased in one case from £397, the purchase scheme <Col N="1830" /> price, to £975, and in another from £163 to £480.  In a third lot, the increase is from £151 to £780 and from £348 to £730.</P>
      <P>I drew attention before to this anomaly between the Labourers Act and the Housing of the Working Classes Act.  At that time, the difference in the rents, due to the withdrawal of subsidy, was the difference between the two lots of houses built in the one year on both sides of the road.  One lot was let at 11/- per week plus rates.  The county council let those houses be purchased at 9/- per week.  However, in the other area, due to withdrawal of subsidy, they went to 32/- a week.  Now, under this new arrangement, instead of 32/- a week, it will be 38/6d.</P>

      <P>I beg the Chair's pardon. The increases in this section, on purchase, arise.  I am pointing out to the Minister an increase of from £300 odd to £900.  I am talking about one lot of houses on one side of a road which are purchased at 9/- a week annuity while the houses on the other side of the road will cost 38/6d a week.  I consider that any Housing Act that enshrines that principle should be done away with, and that is putting it blunt enough.</P>

      <P>The first thing I should say is that it is to meet some objections raised by Deputies and Senators.  It is similar in many respects to amendments tabled by many Labour Deputies on the Committee and Report Stages in the Dáil.  The result of this <Col N="1833" /> amendment, if agreed to, will be that housing authorities will not statutorily be restricted in determining whether or not a house is in good structural condition to have regard only to matters which affect or are likely to affect the stability of the structure.

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not think it rather peculiar that specific instructions are laid down in the Housing Acts as to the condition in which a house must be before it can be declared habitable?  A local authority cottage which has been vested need only be in good structural condition.  It is peculiar that an exception is made in this case.  Our amendments in this House and in the Seanad were designed to ensure that the house would at least be habitable. Under the regulations in this Bill, a house need not be habitable.  A round tower in this country is in good structural condition but nobody would say it is habitable.  I think it is foolish that &ldquo;good sanitary condition&rdquo; was not included in the specification.</P>

As a lawyer, I expressed my complete agreement with the points they put forward and accordingly I agreed to an amendment which will ensure that the approval of the Houses of the Oireachtas will have to be obtained before any regulations made pursuant to the paragraphs mentioned can be put into effect.

I can only point out to the House that the desirability of making this amendment to the Insurance Act was obvious, and indeed the insurance companies for many years had been asking us to make this amendment, and as there is no likelihood of any comprehensive or other Insurance Act coming up in the foreseeable future, we accordingly took the precaution of making this amendment now so that the provision would be brought up to date.</P>
      <P>However, arising from that, the Senators felt that the Long Title should contain a reference specifically to the Insurance Act, 1936, and I agreed in the circumstances that this seemed a reasonable course to adopt so that the practitioner reading the Long Title would immediately be made aware that in addition to providing for credit unions, the Insurance Act, 1936, was being amended in a specific way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>This section sets out the class of persons who will be accountable for the tax because of their dealings in taxable goods. Broadly, these are wholesalers and manufacturers, other than those in a small way of business, and large retailers who make their purchases on a wholesale basis.  Provision is made for treating as an accountable person a manufacturer who, although making exempted goods, uses in their manufacture taxable materials.  For instance, a manufacturer making foods that are packaged&mdash;food is not subject to the tax&mdash;would be accountable in relation to the cellophane containers or packages.  Provision is also made for tax free sales between accountable persons, that is, wholesalers and manufacturers, since these will have to account for tax afterwards on their sales to non-accountable persons.  If they sell to retailers, they have to account at that point for the tax, but, in dealings between manufacturers and wholesalers, they can deal as between themselves without being liable for tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that a person can be both a wholesaler accountable under section 3 and a retailer accountable for the ordinary turnover tax at the same time, and that means, therefore, that some people&mdash;quite a substantial number, in my view&mdash;will have to keep double sets of registers.  Is that not very unnecessary administrative expense on them?  I appreciate it is not administrative expense on the Revenue Commissioners, because they will get someone else to do the work for them, but it does seem to me that this will mean a great deal of unnecessary duplication of effort.  I am sorry the Minister for Education has been brought in on the details of this tax because, I can appreciate that, as a member of the Government, he will have given it his general blessing, but he cannot be expected to know all the details.  I presume the Minister for Finance is in the Seanad.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>As I see it, these people will have to run two separate registers, and parallel, side by side, two sets of numbers, two separate queries in each case as to whether there is turnover tax number or wholesale tax number.  Surely it should be possible to marry the two?  Personally, I think it would have been better to scrap the turnover tax and the wholesale tax and substitute an added value tax, as is done in more modern countries, rather than have the two, one on top of the other.  This section will mean considerable confusion and there is need for clarification and clarification of the need for this double register.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I merely want to explain the position.  We are all aware that one of the principal reasons for objection by RGDATA to the turnover tax was the fact that the retailer was made accountable.  The explanation given at the time was that, if the tax were put on at manufacturer or wholesale level, it would accumulate and have a greater effect ultimately than the turnover tax of 6d in the £1. There are a number of retailers who sell both wholesale and retail.  They buy in large quantities and sell wholesale to shopkeepers next door, perhaps. As Deputy Sweetman has pointed out, these are small wholesalers and, as such, they keep records.  They have to keep a record, first of all, of their own retail sales.  Then they must keep a record of goods withdrawn from stock for their own personal use.  They must keep a record (1) of sales to registered customers, that is, registered for turnover tax purposes, and (2) a record of sales to unregistered customers. This may seem very simple but, in actual practice, it is not so easy at all.  On top of that, under this new system, these retailers who buy large quantities of goods will have to be registered again, as will large wholesalers and manufacturers.  It means a separate set of books and yet another breakdown because, under this wholesale tax, certain goods are exempt.  I do not expect the Minister for Education to explain this since it will come up at a later stage again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1843" /> This tax should be imposed at manufacturer or importer level.  All manufacturers have a suggested wholesale price.  An article that may retail at 12/- may wholesale at 9/- and have a manufacturer's price of 7/6.  The section should have made it a manufacturer's tax or at point of import.  I do not know whether fruit is included in this or not.  A box of fruit, when imported, has an imported price.  It also has a retail price.  On the price at which the importer sells it, it will go into the retail shop.  It is on that the tax is placed.  The wholesaler and retailer are already registered in regard to tax.  The importer or the manufacturer is the person who should be asked to collect this tax.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>To deal with the point raised by Deputy Nolan first, if we had such a system, it is undoubtedly true the effect of the tax on the retail price would be very much greater, without any increased revenue to the State.  The processes under which the goods would go would involve a marking up at each stage which would incorporate the tax added at the manufacturer's level with a mark-up on that and so on along the line.</P>
      <P>In regard to the point made by Deputy Sweetman, it is true there will be a number of people who will be registered as wholesalers for this purpose and as retailers for the purpose of the turnover tax.  But in very many of these cases they have already to keep records of goods exempt from the turnover tax.  These will correspond very largely to the records they have to keep under this Bill.  Therefore, in practice, there may not be all that much extra work involved for them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister made a point about five per cent at the point of import and argued it would be 7½ per cent at the point of retail.  If a manufacturer manufactures an article, he knows what the wholesale price will be.  He has suggested wholesale and retail prices.  As the Bill says, the five per cent tax will be on the wholesale price.  Five per cent of 9/- is approximately 10½d.  It does not matter whether the importer or manufacturer collects that or not.  Why can the manufacturer not collect the five per cent on the wholesale price of 9/- just as the wholesaler can collect it on the 9/-, or the retailer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>In order to make this kind of scheme work, firstly one would have to ensure that there were at least recommended prices for all goods, which there are not, and secondly, one would have to ensure that these recommended prices were the ones being charged.  Again, one could not ensure this without a most elaborate system, and even that would not ensure it. Experience has shown that to operate in the way suggested by Deputy Nolan would in fact create many more problems than it would solve.  I am afraid I could not go along with this argument. Although I appreciate the objectives he is trying to achieve, I do not think it would be achieved by the method he is suggesting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am still fogged. At the beginning of section 3, we have:</P>
      <P>The person accountable for and liable to pay wholesale tax shall be the seller of goods,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1845" /> The seller of goods is not necessarily the same as the person who sells by wholesale.  The seller of goods in section 3 can well mean both the wholesaler and the retailer.  I do not see where this section provides that the tax shall be charged, and only charged, at what I shall call the point of first return, if the Minister understands what I mean by that.  I could understand the subsection if it read:</P>
    <P>The person accountable for and liable to pay wholesale tax shall be the person who sells goods by wholesale as defined in line 25 on page 2.</P>
    <P>The numbering is out, I am afraid. But I do not understand subsection (1) of section 3 as it stands.</P>
    <P>May I quote this example?  Under paragraph (b), if the manufacturer does not sell taxable goods in excess of £150, then, as far as I can gather, the liability for the tax is intended to go on to the next person and it is not intended there will be any liability to it. In the turnover tax, there is liability. If in the example the Minister gave the manufacturer were making a food product and also making a package to put it in and the value of the sales of the package were not more than £150 per month, then he does not pay wholesale tax on the package.  But he sells the food by wholesale to a retailer and the retailer sells the food, plus the package it is in.  The contents of the package are exempt; the package is not.  Does that mean the retailer, because he is the person of first return under this section, has to charge the wholesale tax on the outside of the package, although the inside of the package is free?  As the section is framed, it seems to me that is the extraordinary result of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the first point raised by Deputy Sweetman, I could not see exactly where it was either.  He says it is provided in the subsection that the person accountable shall be the seller of the goods.  Then it goes on to say: &ldquo;Provided that the following persons shall not be accountable,&rdquo; and in paragraph (a): &ldquo;Sellers who are not engaged in selling by <Col N="1846" /> wholesale.&rdquo;  They are retailers and are not liable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

      <P>In the case where a retailer is registered for the purpose of this tax, that is, where a retailer is registered due to the fact that at times he buys from a manufacturer at wholesale prices, who is responsible for paying the tax in this case?  He is perhaps a retailer who has a couple of shops in other towns and one month he buys at the wholesale rate from the manufacturer, but the following month, he is unable to buy the same amount to qualify for best terms, and he buys as an ordinary retailer.  Who is liable for the payment of the tax?</P>

      <P>There is a later provision in the Bill which provides for a <Col N="1847" /> situation like this where he is being taxed on the basis of his retail sales. Provision is made to assess on the basis of those retail sales what is the current wholesale price, and it is on that basis that he pays the tax. Deputy Sweetman raised the point about the manufacturer who is selling food, which is not liable to tax, in a cellophane wrapper.  If he purchases from one of these small wholesalers we mentioned, tax is not paid at that point because he is purchasing from one of these small wholesalers who are exempt.  If he is purchasing and selling in bulk, then tax will be payable on the wrapping, but if he buys from one of those small exempt wholesalers, there is no tax payable.</P>

If the polythene bag goes on through the whole course of trade, it could cover a materially large distribution of goods.  Are we to have a situation at a later stage in the cycle of trade that we have to break up how much of that is the cost of the goods, how much the cost of the cellophane and how much the cost of pasting the label on the cellophane?</P>

The position, as I see it, is that if the sticky label were made by a small manufacturer whose turnover of sticky labels was not more than £1,500 a year, then every one of those packages at some stage of their trade cycle would require segregation on the basis of how much is the value of the food, which is not liable, how much is the value of the package, which presumably would be supplied by a registered person because it would be a large sum, and how much would be supplied by the small trader.  Is that what the section means?</P>

      <P>It is going to be fun when the Minister has to prosecute himself as Minister for Education for having paid these moneys.  Apart from that, it seems clear now that the exemption in sub-paragraph (3) of section (b) of section 5 should have been so drawn as to include another class.  I am not getting my information from clients of mine, I was arguing the matter with somebody on the other side this morning.  As I was arguing on the other side of the table, I was unable to ask them how much they were relying on the cascading of the tax and on the add-back of the five per cent tax all down the way.</P>
      <P>They are concerned in the building industry, for whom I do no business and for whom the Minister has never professionally done any business, and whose names I do not want to mention but whose names I will give to the Minister privately if he wishes.  They are the people able adequately to judge. It seems appalling that we are adding, as a result of deliberate Government action, four per cent to the cost of housing.  I know that cement is exempt under the turnover tax and possibly it is exempt also here but it is because there are substantial exempted materials that the amount added is not five per cent plus the add-back but four per cent.  I hope the Minister for Finance will realise that to increase the cost of the housing of the people is something that should not be done and that an exemption order should be made under paragraph 3 of the last subsection of this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In exactly the same way, I think this is going to have the effect of starting a chain of inflation in relation to the building and construction industry which is going to be thrown back on our people as happened in 1963.  I was appalled to discover that one of the effects of that inflation has <Col N="1851" /> been that the education of the children in the area in which I happen to live has been made considerably more expensive.  I am glad the Minister for Education is sitting in for the Minister for Finance.  He will be able to appreciate this from his point of view, just as the Minister for Finance must deal with the general inflationary spiral. The inflation in regard to bus fares means that the expenses of children travelling from Kill to Naas have been doubled in the past month.  The Minister would be the first to admit that this is very bad indeed.</P>
    <P>I am afraid we are going to have a similar chain of inflation in regard to the building of houses, if articles for house building are not included in the exemption.  I had a question down to the Minister for Finance today, Question No. 6, but in whatever way the machinations of these things work, I must have missed the usher because I have not yet got the reply to my question.  There must be a very considerable part of the money that is being created, the £5 million in a full year that is being taken which must be raised on articles that will be used in the building and construction industry when it is estimated that a four per cent increase will arise in houses as a result of these.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>When Deputy Sweetman talked about cascading, I presume he did not mean this in the technical sense in which it is used in reference to taxes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true that some increase may result in the cost of building as a result of this tax but the best information available to me does not suggest that it will be anything like <Col N="1852" /> four per cent.  As regards the question of exemptions, as the Deputy has mentioned, the basic materials of the building industry are already exempt from turnover tax and correspondingly will be exempt from the wholesale tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>They are sand, gravel, lime, cement, tar, structural steel and aluminium.  The question of any further exemptions will, of course, arise when the Minister for Finance comes to make the necessary orders on foot of this Bill.  I do not want to give any impression or any suggestion of a commitment that he would do so but even if he were to do so, he could only do so after detailed consultation with the trade interests concerned, and I cannot, therefore, at this stage, suggest or indicate anything beyond the exemption which already exists on foot of the exemption from turnover tax.</P>
      <P>I might also say that I think Deputy Sweetman knows probably better than anybody in this House that the increases in costs which have occurred in recent years have been largely due to factors other than the turnover tax and that the amount of increase due to turnover tax is quite a small portion of the increases which have taken place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>On that, may I just say to the Minister for Education that the estimate given to me this morning was a three to four per cent on labour &mdash;I checked it again; I thought it was four&mdash;and a three to four per cent wholesale tax, making a total, therefore, of between six and eight per cent increase in the cost of building. The £1 a week was estimated to be exactly the same as the cost that was estimated to be the increase due to wholesale tax.  The estimate the Minister has in relation to the wholesale tax for the full year is £5 million.  I understand that means, at five per cent, that it is on moneys received from the sale of goods of £100 million. How much of that £100 million does the Minister estimate, then, is coming out of the building and construction <Col N="1853" /> industry?  I am sure that that must be in his brief somewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I have not got that figure here, but as I say, the best estimate available to me is that, at most, the increase would be two per cent and not four as stated by the Deputy and that it may not even be two per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I want to know the position of a retailer who buys at best terms.  For the purposes of the turnover tax, in the case of a retailer who is not doing a business in excess of £832, it is optional; he can register or not.  In the case of the new wholesale tax, will the retailer who buys at best terms from the manufacturer be obliged to register?

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, categorisation <Col N="1854" /> is not optional for the retailer in question.  I think the Deputy used the phrase &ldquo;who buys at best terms&rdquo;?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill does not use that phrase.  What it says is:</P>
      <P>A person who makes, for the purposes of a business of selling by retail carried on by him, purchases of taxable goods which in value and character are such as in the ordinary course of trade are met by wholesale merchants.</P>
      <P>He would be deemed to fit into this category by the Revenue Commissioners, not by his own option.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I mean. Therefore, quite a number of retailers will have to register for the purposes of this wholesale tax?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

    <Speaker pid="ThomasNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>The limit is not defined in the section.  The Finance Act, 1963 did define what the turnover would have to be.  Any retailer who does business in excess of £832 must register but under that figure the retailer had an option.  If he did not wish to register for the purposes of the turnover tax, he could opt out.  In this case a retailer who buys on best terms similar to the wholesaler must register?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Since certain types of goods are excluded from this tax how is it proposed to know what is included by these large department <Col N="1857" /> stores under the included items and what is excluded under the excluded items?  How will the Revenue people know how much exempt goods are being sold by a department store and how much included goods?  As I understand it, I think the biggest argument against the 2½ per cent not excluding food and other essential items that should have been excluded, was that we could not possibly know in a mixed store how much of one item was sold and how much of another. How are you going to do it now?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The basic difference between this tax and the turnover tax is that the turnover tax is applied at ordinary retail level while this tax is applied at wholesale level.  Therefore, the people accounting for this tax are generally people in a fairly large way of business and they are required to keep accounts which are subject to inspection by the Revenue Commissioners but one could not apply that to very small shops.  That is why the argument was made in regard to the turnover tax that they could not segregate but in the case of people like this, you can segregate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not like to dispute the Minister's point of view but that is not so.  I do not like mentioning names but in any of the big stores in Dublin where they are selling exempted goods and non-exempted goods, it will not be possible.  Anybody who has any experience of the turnover tax knows it will not be possible to find out how much was exempt and how much was not exempt.  You will be depending on the people involved and taking them on trust.  You would need a bigger staff than you have for the turnover tax.  It will depend on trust, will it not?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>No; I am afraid the Revenue Commissioners would not be prepared to leave it on the basis of depending on trust.  Their accountancy can be checked against purchases.  It is true that if somebody sets out to defraud the Revenue, not just in this field but in any field, and if he has sufficient ingenuity, normally he will succeed for a time but most people <Col N="1858" /> know that if they do this, eventually they will be caught.  This is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners who would, I think, conduct spot checks and perhaps act on information they might receive about such practices, as indeed applies to other forms of taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps, as we agreed earlier, we might leave this to the next stage of the Bill.  The Deputy may take it that the experience of the Revenue Commissioners is that in administering taxes such as this, it is possible to find loopholes but the Revenue Commissioners usually catch up with these people who avail of loopholes, remembering that the method of administration of tax is very similar to and modelled on that already in operation in respect of the turnover tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister speaks of the present tax with great confidence which I do not share.  I think it is open to abuse but the proposed tax is open to such abuse that I do not think it will require any ingenuity to avoid tax. It will be absolutely impossible to administer. What baffles me is why this tax was not put on at the source, on the manufacturers, because there at least there is only a limited number of manufacturers.  Why go halfway up the ladder where it is impossible to distinguish. If you tax the manufacturer, and, if the goods are imported, tax them at the customs, you have only two sources to deal with, but under the proposed system, Singer would have nothing on what this would be open to by way of abuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I dealt with the suggestion that it should be levied at the manufacturing or import level earlier when it was mentioned by Deputy Nolan.  The main reason it is done is <Col N="1859" /> that it would involve a very much greater increase in the retail price system because of the mark-up that would take place down along the line. If somebody is sufficiently ingenious and is desirous of defrauding the Revenue, he will find a way to do it. The Revenue Commissioners, however, have been long enough at this job to be able to catch up on them eventually. The Deputy says this is particularly easy when one is dealing with very large people.  Such people are also more vulnerable in many ways, perhaps, than small traders to inspection and very much more likely to suffer in the event of being detected in such defrauding.  The total number to be registered as accountable persons for this tax is not expected to exceed 4,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>If A is a country retailer in the town of Naas, he will probably, in addition to doing his retail business, do a little wholesale business, supplying, if you like, hucksters' shops round the way.  He buys his supplies from wholesaler B.  Has he got to break down his purchases from B so that he can say: &ldquo;I sell 90 per cent of my goods otherwise than by way of wholesale and I sell ten per cent of my goods wholesale.  Therefore my wholesaler pays tax on 90 per cent and I pay tax on the ten per cent&rdquo;?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>May I come back again to building and construction? I confess I am not happy about this but we shall have other opportunities when we have it in operation for a while.  We have the figure of £100 million, and £36 million of the £100 million in the year are durable household goods.  I do not know how that would compare with the percentage of total building and construction but it is a substantial percentage.  As a result of this tax imposed by the Government, there will be a percentage increase of some magnitude in the cost of housing.  That is difficult enough in relation to a private person but when you take it in relation to local authority building, it is obvious that it will start a spiral all over again because every local authority has a social duty in relation to the housing of the people in its area.  Now the Government say it will cost more.  It will start exactly the same type of spiral as the turnover tax started in 1963, in consequence of which we shall get a far worse situation than we <Col N="1861" /> would have got if the Minister for Finance had dealt with this on the value added basis rather than on a flat basis.</P>

Secondly, how will this operate <Col N="1869" /> in the case of a wholesaler who has instituted proceedings before 30th September but who does not get paid in the proceedings until after 1st October?

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>No; you pay in October for the goods you have delivered in September.  Your returns for October are made up of the moneys for the goods you deliver in September. You pay that tax in respect of October on 15th November.  You have charged without the tax or else the wholesaler charges in the tax for every invoice after 1st September.  They could not do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  What I am saying is that we were discussing the question of people paying on foot of contract and the provision to allow us to add it on on all payments after 1st October. The wholesaler may say to a retailer: <Col N="1873" />&ldquo;Pay me before 1st October and you do not have to pay the tax, or pay after that and you will have to pay the tax.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the point.  If the wholesaler normally gives one month's credit for the goods supplied during September, unless the man is fortunate enough to have the cash ready to pay during the period in September up to the 30th, he has to pay tax on that amount when it is paid in October, even though those goods will have been retailed during September and the tax will not be collected. He will buy goods during September, retail them during September and, if he is lucky, sell them.  They will not include any five per cent turnover tax on the retail price.  Yet if he goes to pay for them on 1st, 2nd or 3rd October, he has to pay five per cent tax.  Who is going to pay it, the retailer or the wholesaler?  The Government are going to collect tax from 1st October on goods sold during September and neither the wholesaler nor the retailer will have got this five per cent. Somebody will be out of pocket.  The Minister is evading the issue if he cannot see that.</P>

      <P>However, the point about this is that in order to define the imported goods subject to this tax in terms which can be dealt with at customs level&mdash;because that is where they will be dealt with&mdash;we must define them in terms of the Brussels nomenclature.  It will not be sufficient to talk about food, drink, and so on. It is, therefore, the intention of the Minister, at a later stage, to formulate exact definitions and to have them promulgated by ministerial order provided for by section 11 (2), and this it is intended will be done in good time before the tax comes into operation. So far as similar definitions are desirable for the purpose of the internal tax, appropriate orders will be made at the same time under section 3 (5) of the Bill.  It is also intended to ensure, as far as possible, that the effect of these definitions will be that the same goods will be liable for tax, whether imported or produced in this country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>A Money Resolution is normally required for the annual Finance Bill because that Bill provides for specific charges on the public revenue.  In this year's Bill, there were three such charges and the Money Resolution provides specifically for each of these charges.  There is no provision for specific charges on the public revenue in the present Bill.  The only charges that will arise are the ordinary expenses of administration and it is not necessary or usual to cover these charges by a Money Resolution. In fact when the turnover tax was introduced in the Finance Bill of 1963 the Money Resolution which accompanied the Bill provided for certain specific charges, for instance, the normal charges for the Capital Services Redemption Account, but it did not make provision for the charges which were involved in administering the turnover tax.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>There is very little I can say except to point out to the House that the provisions for the making of orders as regards exemptions from this tax will mean in practice that the Minister will have consultations with the various trading interests concerned before he makes the orders.  Experience shows that very often what Deputies might consider should be exempted might turn out, when consultations take place with the trade, to be a bad idea, that one is <Col N="1879" /> doing more harm than good.  Circumstances differ in different trades, as to how they operate their trade and how exemptions can best be applied, and the Minister will have these consultations before such orders are made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

People know very well that if we could tax caviare and mink coats, we would be only too willing to do so.  Deputy Sweetman has had considerable experience as Minister for Finance and he knows very well that there are substantial difficulties involved.  I do not begrudge him his short moment of glory but I do not think it will last very long.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I refer at this last moment to the fact that mink coats and such articles are being exempted from this tax and that we are now making provision for a tax from which non-essential and luxury goods are to be exempted?  The reason for not exempting essential articles such as clothing and foodstuffs from the turnover tax was that it would not be parcticable to do so.  These essentials of life are now taxed and the mother who is trying to bring up a family has to pay a tax on the clothing and food she buys for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now we can bring in a tax which does exempt some items, non-essential and luxury goods, such items as mink coats and mink hats.  These are items on which people should pay tax.  It would have been a far better idea if the turnover tax had been put on as this tax is being put on so that we could have exempted from it the necessaries of life.  At this stage I think the Government should reconsider the <Col N="1880" /> whole matter and bring in a tax of, say, 7½ per cent on luxury and unnecessary items and do away with the turnover tax on the necessaries of life. If the Minister was in as close touch with the people as he would have us believe and if the country was as prosperous as he would like us to believe, that is what he should do.  The turnover tax should be done away with and a tax put on luxury and non-essential items.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to enable a sum not exceeding £450,000 to be withdrawn from the funds of suitors and applied towards the cost of rebuilding the Abbey Theatre and the Cork Opera House.</P>
      <P>The funds of suitors are the cash and securities belonging to suitors and other persons which have been transferred to or paid into or deposited with the High Court.  These funds arise from many sources.  They include statutory deposits made by insurance companies, banks, trade unions, auctioneers and house agents, moneys lodged by defendants in certain types of actions, funds of wards of court, trustee funds and moneys lodged in administration suits.  Part of the funds is represented by unclaimed dividends and balances which have been accumulating over a long period. These are known as dormant funds and may be defined more precisely as balances in accounts which have not been active for 15 years or more.  The funds of suitors are under the control of the High Court, and subject to that control, are managed by, and stand in the name of, the Accountant of the Courts of Justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The total liability of the Accountant in respect of funds of suitors on 30th <Col N="1881" /> April, 1966, was £17,640,000, of which dormant funds amounted to £998,000. Assets held by the Accountant, consisting of cash and securities, amounted to £16,812,000.  The difference between the amount of the liabilities and the amount of the assets on hand, £828,000, represents the aggregate of the moneys which have been withdrawn from the funds of suitors over the past 200 years under the authority of various Acts of the Parliament of Ireland, the Parliament of the United Kingdom and the Oireachtas.  All these Acts indemnified suitors for any loss which they might sustain by reason of the withdrawals, and these indemnities are backed by the Central Fund.  Another way of saying this is that portion of the funds of suitors amounting to £828,000 is not represented by cash or securities held by the Accountant but simply by the liability of the Central Fund to indemnify suitors against any loss.</P>
    <P>Moneys withdrawn from the funds of suitors under Acts passed prior to the establishment of the Oireachtas were applied for such purposes as building and improving the Courts of Justice and enlarging the Law Library. Withdrawals from the funds were authorised by the Oireachtas in 1959 and again in 1963.  The funds of Suitors Act, 1959, enabled a total of £323,000 to be withdrawn for three purposes, namely, to provide assistance towards the rebuilding of the Abbey Theatre, to finance the repair and renovation of the buildings of the Society of King's Inns and to provide for the creation of a fund for the maintenance of the Society's Library.  The Funds of Suitors Act, 1963, authorised the release of a sum of £50,000 to help finance the rebuilding of the Cork Opera House.</P>
    <P>The sums withdrawn to date from the funds of suitors, amounting, as I have said, to £828,000, have virtually exhausted the dormant funds. Depreciation in the value of dormant securities has accounted for a further reduction of £95,000, so that the balance of dormant funds remaining is now only £75,000.  Accordingly, the bulk of the withdrawal of £450,000 proposed in this Bill will be made not <Col N="1882" /> against the dormant balances but against the current funds standing to the credit of suitors in accounts less than 15 years old.  Deputies will, how ever, appreciate that, from the practical standpoint, all funds vested in the Accountant of the Courts of Justice, whether dormant or otherwise, have the same standing; the so called dormant funds are distinguished from the others merely for accounting convenience.  The fact that the dormant balances will be overdrawn is of no practical significance, as the indemnity to be provided by the Minister for Finance under section 3 of the Bill will afford complete protection to suitors in respect of moneys withdrawn from the funds held by the Accountant.</P>
    <P>The money to be withdrawn under the Bill will actually be taken from the sizeable cash balance which is maintained by the Accountant in a current account in the Bank of Ireland. This cash balance amounts at the present time to £860,000 and is constantly growing.  Apart altogether from the fact that suitors will enjoy a complete indemnity, I am fully satisfied that the sum of £450,000 may safely be withdrawn from this cash balance.</P>
    <P>As I have mentioned, part of the funds of suitors has already been applied to meeting the cost of rebuilding the Abbey Theatre and the Cork Opera House.  Under the Funds of Suitors Act, 1959, £250,000 was allocated for the Abbey, and under the last Act, passed in 1963, £50,000 was advanced for the Opera House. Estimates of cost for the two projects, furnished when these Acts were being prepared, indicated that the amounts in question would be sufficient to enable the projects to be completed. However, events proved otherwise, making necessary the further payments provided for in this Bill.</P>
    <P>In the case of the Abbey, the estimated cost of rebuilding was put at £235,000 in 1959, with a further £20,000 for professional fees and an unspecified sum for furniture other than seating.  It was accordingly considered that an allocation of £250,000 from the funds of suitors would suffice <Col N="1883" /> for the purpose.  However, rising costs since 1959 have rendered that estimate obsolete.  The successful tender, accepted in June, 1962, was for £310,000 for the Abbey and the &ldquo;shell&rdquo; of the Peacock Theatre, with an additional £34,000 for fees.  The cost of the work is now put at £555,200 to which must be added £95,000 for the Peacock.  These sums include professional fees; and the figure for the Peacock covers the full equipment of this theatre.  This gives a total cost of £650,000, leaving a gap of £400,000 over and above what has already been made available. Allowing a small margin for contingencies, section 2 (3) of the Bill provides for a further withdrawal from the funds of suitors of not more than £415,000 for this purpose.</P>
    <P>The increases in the cost of the Abbey and Peacock Theatres, though substantial, are inescapable.  They are due to increases in the cost of wages and materials, the effects of the building strike of 1964, changes in plans involving the installation of additional stage equipment, extra dressingroom accommodation and an increase in the height of the stage tower, special reinforcement work on the basement and additional work on adjoining property.</P>
    <P>The Abbey authorities have no funds which might be used to meet the increased costs.  The sum of £30,000 received in insurance following the fire which destroyed the old Abbey has long since been eaten up by current deficits.  The directors of the Abbey are, however, prepared to arrange a public appeal for funds to help meet the cost of the Peacock Theatre, although they are not very hopeful that this will bring in any substantial amount.  Section 2 (4) of the Bill provides that any sums raised in this way by the Abbey authorities will be paid into the Capital Fund, while section 2 (5) provides that the Minister for Finance shall repay to the funds of suitors any sums paid to the Capital Fund which are not required for the purposes of the section.</P>
    <P>The £250,000 made available under the Funds of Suitors Act, 1959, had been spent by July, 1965, and as any <Col N="1884" /> further withdrawal from the funds would involve fresh legislation, it was decided that a Supplementary Estimate should be taken on the Vote for Miscellaneous Expenses to ensure that the work in progress might continue. On 21st July, 1965, the Dáil agreed to a Supplementary Estimate on this Vote in which a sum of £255,010 was included for this purpose.  Approximately £185,000 has been issued to the Abbey from this provision.  The Bill now before the House provides in section 2 (3) that this money will be refunded to the Exchequer.  The rest of the money allocated under the Bill will be available to meet the balance of the cost of the project.</P>
    <P>In the case of the Cork Opera House, the estimated cost of rebuilding was put at £200,000 in 1963, and it was on the basis of this estimate that the Funds of Suitors Act, 1963, provided for the allocation of a sum of £50,000 to supplement the moneys which had been raised from other sources for the project.  As in the case of the Abbey, increases in costs occurred and the final cost of completion amounted to approximately £235,000.  This left the Opera House Company to find a sum of £35,000.  The directors were compelled to approach the Government for further aid.  They felt there was little hope that a further appeal to the public would raise any significant sum, as £82,000 had already been subscribed from private sources.  Again, as in the case of the Abbey, a further withdrawal from the funds of suitors would involve fresh legislation.  Consequently, as the project was then nearing completion&mdash;the new Opera House was, in fact, opened on 31st October, 1965&mdash; and final bills were expected shortly, it was decided to take a Supplementary Estimate on the Vote for Miscellaneous Expenses.  This was approved by the Dáil on 28th October, 1965, on the understanding that legislation to authorise a further withdrawal from the funds of suitors would be introduced and that any payment from the Vote would be recouped.  In fact, a total of £11,514 has been issued under this provision and this amount will be refunded to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The rebuilding of the Abbey Theatre <Col N="1885" /> and the rebuilding of the Cork Opera House are enterprises of national concern. It has been recognised that projects of this nature cannot in modern conditions be undertaken successfully without the patronage of the wealthy or of the State or local authorities. There is no doubt but that this is a most desirable form of public investment since it will provide suitable entertainment for our own people, provide employment for native artists and at the same time, constitute an atraction for tourists.  The material needs of our citizens have been provided for increasingly in recent years and it is only right that the State should also help in the provision of these centres of entertainment in our two main cities.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, may I once more draw the attention of the House to the fact that, as in the case of previous withdrawals from the funds of suitors, the Bill affords complete indemnity to suitors against any loss they might otherwise sustain as a result of the enactment of the proposed legislation.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Bill to the House and ask that it be given a Second Reading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposal to provide additional funds to complete the restoration of the Abbey Theatre and the work of rebuilding the Cork Opera House follows the introduction of a measure in 1959 whereby the sums in the funds of suitors account of the court were made available for these purposes.  It seemed to us that the method of providing finance for these two projects was an appropriate one, in so far as it avoided a direct draw on the Exchequer for purposes which normally might have to compete with other claims for State expenditure and which in the normal way might not secure ready approval or which, certainly, would have to compete on an unequal basis for the sums available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the same time, the world-wide reputation which the Abbey Theatre had and which everyone hopes will continue under the new Abbey is a valuable asset.  The Abbey is valuable, <Col N="1886" /> not only from the point of view of providing entertainment for our own people and visitors but also for the purpose of providing employment for Irish artists and the consequential employment involved in theatre work. The same, to a lesser extent, can be said in the case of the Cork Opera House.</P>
    <P>The method adopted of financing this proposal involves no direct State expenditure and has enabled the funds, some of which were dormant, to be used for this purpose while at the same time, in the event of claimants entitled to draw on the funds making and succeeding in substantiating their claims, the Minister for Finance, under the Act, guarantees to make good any deficiency that might arise in the funds for a short period, or in the event of a temporary inability of the sums available to the fund, to meet the actual claims.</P>
    <P>In those circumstances, I want to refer to another similar use which was made of the funds available when the 1959 Act was passed.  I do so because, normally, the type of expenditure involved might not be regarded as being directly the responsibility of the State and, in circumstances of a shortage of money for a variety of necessary projects, particularly building projects, might not be regarded as one which could legitimately be considered and certainly would be regarded as a project that would compete for the funds available only on a very unreal basis, as being one that would be unlikely to justify public expenditure, certainly in the sphere in which some of the activities are carried on.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, the expenditure which was covered by the matter which I propose to mention, to a very considerable extent provides a service that is of a very special character and which could be regarded as relieving either the State or the universities of an obligation in that regard.  The particular expenditure to which I refer was undertaken by the Benchers of the King's Inns in respect of the building known as the King's Inns, in Henrietta Street.  As Deputies may be aware, the King's Inns is a very old building and <Col N="1887" /> provides for the education of students who wish to become barristers and, in addition, provides library facilities of a special kind.  The library is one of the best legal libraries in the world, possibly the only exclusively legal library in this country.  For that reason, it is necessary that the building should be in a proper state of repair.  The buildings themselves are of well-known architectural distinction and have long been regarded as examples which have attracted and still attract tourists and visitors.</P>
    <P>Some years ago the presence of dry rot was discovered in the buildings and steps were taken to eradicate it. Considerable expenditure was incurred in carrying out repairs and necessary restoration.  Under the 1959 Act, it was decided that £70,000 would be made available out of the funds of suitors, of which I understand the greater portion was to be applied to recouping and defraying the expenditure incurred, or about to be incurred, on the renovation and repair of the buildings in the King's Inns and the balance to the creation of a capital endowment fund.</P>
    <P>Subsequent to the passing of the Act and the granting of this sum, further dry not was discovered and this had to be eradicated.  Meantime, building costs increased substantially over those prevailing when the original estimate was made.  I understand the total expenditure between 1956 and 1965 on renovation, repair and decoration of the buildings, including the library, amounted to something over £93,000.  The position, therefore, is that moneys which were made available have proved inadequate to cover the work carried out and at the same time provide the capital endowment fund established under it.</P>
    <P>If the Society, the Benchers of the King's Inns, are to fulfil their functions, educational and otherwise, and maintain these buildings which have a world-wide reputation, it is necessary to recoup the capital fund of the society.  Otherwise, it would be impossible for them to discharge their liability in respect of repairs or even to continue, even allowing for an <Col N="1888" /> increase in students' fees.  The increase necessary would be entirely inordinate and excessive.  Therefore, I urge the Minister and the Government to consider sympathetically the possibility of introducing an amendment at a later stage of the Bill to allow the further sum of approximately £50,000 which would be necessary.</P>
    <P>In a measure of this kind, an amendment by a private Deputy would not be in order, nor would I propose normally an expenditure of this sort, but for the manner in which it is proposed to finance it.  It would merely mean a further indent on the total sum in the funds of suitors account. As was mentioned by the Minister in his speech, the income from that fund is normally sufficient to meet in full the claims made on it.  In fact the general experience is that over a period the fund builds up, that claims are not made or do not mature or in some cases are rejected.  For whatever reason the income of the Account has over the years normally exceeded the claims made on it and the provision in this Bill is merely one for the purpose of ensuring that in the event of circumstances altering, and for a particular period the draw on the fund being in excess of income, the difference would be made good by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Minister and the Government should sympathetically consider the expenditure involved and the work that has been carried out. Certain Deputies were invited to see the work last year.  It was not certain then what the extra costs involved would be but those of us who had an opportunity of seeing the work appreciated the efforts that were made as well as the character and quality of the work undertaken.  The general attitude of the Benchers was one of ensuring that the facilities available there would continue to be available to all who require them, and at the same time, that the buildings would be maintained in a proper state of repair.  I should be glad, therefore, if the Minister would consider this matter between now and Committee Stage with a view to enabling the work to be completed, while at the <Col N="1889" /> same time allowing the Benchers sufficient funds to enable them to continue to have the Endowment Fund for the purposes for which it was established.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>We are all very glad to have reached the stage when the Abbey will be restored in full to the nation.  I am sure we are all very conscious of the tremendous prestige that accrued to the country from the beginning through the efforts of the small and dedicated group who founded the Abbey Theatre so many years ago and who promoted the drama at every possible opportunity, since before the turn of the century, it may be said.  This Bill which provides money for the completion of the new Abbey will meet with the approval of the entire House.  One can also express the hope that in the years ahead, the new Abbey Theatre will bring to Irish drama fame and glory as great as the old Abbey did in its day and that it will evoke, promote and encourage the genius of playwrights such as the great ones of the past who carried the name of Ireland in this sphere with honour literally to every stage in every country of the world.</P>
      <P>In discussing this Bill, we should take the opportunity of going a little further and examining the position relating to the funds of suitors.  It is very interesting to find the Minister revealing that the amount in the possession, as it were legally, of the Accountant of the High Court as at 30th April this year, was over £17½ million, which is the accumulation, as we know, of what could loosely be described as unclaimed moneys in court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.  However, the point is that funds are here.  This is a manner in which funds can be provided for proposals such as the Abbey Theatre and, as Deputy Cosgrave has instanced, for the improvement and maintenance of the King's Inns and for the Cork Opera House.  I want to suggest that this particular avenue of finance should be explored in another way to see how far it can be utilised to benefit not just the Abbey Theatre but the theatre generally in this country. It was my intention to move an amendment to the Bill in order to secure a discussion on this on Committee Stage.  I have just been informed by the Chair that my two amendments have been ruled out of order. They involved a proposal to allocate an additional £25,000 from the funds of suitors for the assistance of certain Irish theatrical productions.  I tried to get the Minister's mind working along those lines.  If these funds are used for the Abbey Theatre, beneficially and quite correctly, and in so far as they were used in other directions, nobody can find any fault with that.  This Bill seemed to provide an opportunity for the Members of this House to say to the Minister that something should be done for the Irish theatre on a wider scale through the means of these funds.</P>

      <P>I have no wish to dispute the ruling of the Chair.  However, if that was so in my case, it was certainly so in the case of Deputy Cosgrave.  I ask only for treatment similar to that accorded to Deputy Cosgrave who, rightly, in my view, made a plea in respect of what might be done with portion of the funds of suitors in so far as the King's Inns are concerned.  If he was allowed to do that, why should I not be allowed to take the line I want to take, namely, to suggest to the Minister that the funds of suitors should be devoted to an extension of what he is actually doing in the Bill?</P>

      <P>I do not propose to go outside the rules of order in this matter: I do not want to.  However, I want to avail of the opportunity to try to induce the Minister&mdash;who, I am certain, is as interested in the promotion of the theatre as is anybody in this House&mdash;to think of what could <Col N="1892" /> be done in so far as assistance for that very important section of the theatre which exists outside the Abbey Theatre is concerned.  Because of the difficulty of maintaining theatres by reason of expense, we have had many instances over the years of such enterprises falling by the wayside for lack of financial aid.  We have the example of the Gaiety Theatre which happily is still with us but whose future is not at all assured.  It is uncertain what will happen to it.  There are many excellent theatrical companies which, because we are a small nation, very often find it impossible to make an economic success of their activities and are forced to wind them up.  In this instance, it seems to me that there is an obligation on the Government to do what they can to help, to encourage and to keep alive the arts in so far as the theatre is concerned.</P>
      <P>We have considerable funds available from the Shaw Bequest which are devoted to the National Gallery. I do not think we shall ever be sufficiently grateful to Shaw not alone for the moneys which are benefiting us in the artistic sense, in the shape of wonderful pictures which we have been able to buy, but also in the sense of future revenue that will come from his works.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>That is just by the way.  The point I am trying to make is that we have great theatrical figures in this country.  I think it can be said that we can present ourselves with this bouquet: some would consider it slightly malodorous but, nonetheless, I think we deserve to give it to ourselves. We are a nation not only <Col N="1893" /> interested in the drama but a pretty dramatic nation, too.  We have artistes of very considerable talent at every level.  It is one of our assets.  When Irish people interested in the theatre go abroad wherever they take up the theatre they shine and, in the main, they get their training here.  We have actors and actresses in our society who are amongst the very best in the world.  I do not need to mention their names.  They will spring to the mind of any person in this House or of any person who reads the papers at all.</P>
      <P>We have often seen how difficult it is for these actors and actresses and for theatrical enterprises to keep going in Ireland.  I am sure that many of us have felt&mdash;certainly I have&mdash;that it would be a very sound national investment if we could take whatever steps are open to us to ensure continuity of employment, continuity of production, and security in their work for these people.  It boils down invariably to a question of money and that is why I raise the matter here.  It appears to me that if the Minister is so minded, and I see every reason why he should be, he could employ the Funds of Suitors Bill at least to initiate a fund, perhaps a nominal fund of something in the nature of £25,000 or £30,000, to be administered by a body such as the Arts Council which would come to the aid of theatrical groups or, say, the Dublin Theatre Festival Committee, or people such as Equity which represents over 2,000 personnel in this very important industry, at times when such aid would be called for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not necessary for me to dilate upon the importance of this branch&mdash; perhaps it might be argued or claimed that this was the most important branch&mdash;of dramatic endeavour, the section which has nothing whatever to do with the Abbey.  It is not necessary for me to draw attention to the great tourist potential that lies herein.  It can be said that the average tourist feels that the Irish theatre is something he must visit in order to see people like MacLiammoir, people with names which are internationally famous, and others as well, both actors and actresses.  We should try to take some <Col N="1894" /> steps as a beginning to provide help for those people who have been working hard to maintain dramatic effort outside the Abbey.</P>
    <P>I must emphasise that I am not criticising the provision of money for the Abbey Theatre.  It is an excellent thing that it has been provided, but other countries, small countries, in Europe have seen it as their duty and as a good national investment to provide money annually to do what I am suggesting should be done here.  Countries such as France, Germany and Great Britain provide subsidies from their Exchequers which vary from £2 million to £7 million annually to aid the theatre.  We could not think in terms of such amounts but nonetheless it shows in a general way what we should be thinking of.  In Holland, a small country, there is a theatre maintained by the State in practically every town exceeding 80,000 inhabitants.  In Iceland, where there are 200,000 people, the national theatre is supported with an annual grant of £50,000.  These people are not sentimentalists who love to revel in the theatre for its own sake. They are hardheaded people who know that this side of artistic activity constitutes a tremendous attraction for those who like to take their holidays abroad.</P>
    <P>The Minister could give us some hope that these interests who have been struggling so hard to keep the drama alive will be helped.  We have an obligation to these people who have done so much for the good name of Ireland.  I would have no other opportunity of raising this matter and that is why I am raising it now.  There is no reason why the Funds of Suitors should continue to be devoted only to those matters with which we have been concerned heretofore.  It is very important that the King's Inns should be looked after properly and likewise the Abbey, and I will go so far as to include that darling of Deputy Corry's, the Cork Opera House, which should undoubtedly be looked after also, but there is no reason why drama outside the Abbey should not be catered for.  I would ask the Minister to let us know if he will <Col N="1895" /> consider my suggestions, that is, to look at the fund to see if some of its money could be made available, at least as a start, to provide, say, £25,000 or £30,000 to a body like the Arts Council or some similar body with responsibility to afford help to drama groups which operate outside the Abbey Theatre.  It is a simple request and it is something that must be done at some time.  The Minister could carve a niche for himself in history if he were the first to set down that this, which is inevitable in any event, should be done.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I agree with the proposal to assist the restoration of the Abbey Theatre and the Cork Opera House, both of which were destroyed by fire some years ago. It is a very worthy object that money should be made available from public funds to assist in this excellent work. I suppose in this age of credit squeeze and shortage of money, it is fortunate that there is a precedent for falling back on the funds of suitors to provide the necessary money because if that precedent was not there, I could see see great difficulty in aiding these very worthy objects.  Having said that, I should like to take this opportunity to make a point about the accumulations of unclaimed funds in the Accountant's Office in the High Court.  I was not here for the Minister's speech but I gather that over the years the liability of the Accountant in respect of this fund is £17½ million and that at present there is to the credit of the fund some £800,000.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> That leads me to believe that over a very long number of years something in excess of £16 million belonging to suitors has remained unclaimed and has been utilised under various Acts of Parliament for one purpose or another.  I think an effort should be made from time to time to trace these suitors and make them aware of the fact that there is money standing to their credit in court, money which <Col N="1896" /> they can claim, if they establish their right to it.  I do not suggest we should go back 100 years or 200 years looking for people who have long since departed this world, but I should like to put a question to the Minister: what steps are taken from time to time to bring to the notice of those who are wards of court and to whose credit money has been lodged in court that that money is there at their disposal if they claim it?</P>
      <P>I am told that a notice appears in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> from time to time.  I do not think the Minister would suggest that that is a serious way of trying to bring to the notice of people their rights.  I suggest there is an onus on the State to make a serious effort every so often by publications in the national newspapers and, particularly, in the provincial newspapers, to the effect that named persons or their representatives should communicate with the accountant of the High Court when they may hear something to their advantage.  I believe many people do not claim this money lying to their credit through ignorance.  Perhaps the money was lodged when they were children of tender years; perhaps the firms of solicitors who had charge have gone out of existence; perhaps there is nobody now to draw their attention to the matter.  I think there is an onus on the State, which, through the instrumentality of the High Court, is the custodian or trustee of these funds, to take steps to locate these people and point out their rights to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other point I should like to raise&mdash;I raised this matter in the Seanad when a similar Bill was going through some years ago&mdash;is that suitors suffer loss from time to time because the money lodged in court to their credit is invested, without reference to them, in national loans or other apparently gilt-edged securities; when these people come to withdraw the money, they find the securities have fallen in value and that the £1,000 is worth only £600 or £700.  Some fund should be established out of these unclaimed moneys through which to indemnify these people against loss.  I appreciate that if suitors turn up in the years to come, the State will be liable. But that is not enough.  An effort <Col N="1897" /> should be made to trace the suitors and suitors should be indemnified against any loss by a possible fall in the securities in which the moneys are invested for them.</P>

I appreciate that side of the picture, but I suggest that if we have money of this type, then we should pass legislation to use it for one purpose just as well as another.  I spent yesterday at a local authority meeting at which we were endeavouring to find money to build houses.  On today's Order Paper, there were 15 questions from Dublin Deputies about housing. The only Dublin Deputy who has spoken in this debate so far is looking for more money for the theatre. The question is which is the more essential?  Should we use this money for the comfort and wellbeing of our people by providing houses for them or should we use it for amusement? There is a bit of drama, I suggest, in two cities having lost two theatres through fire.  There is a bit of drama, too, in trying to find money, of which there is great need in this country today, for essential purposes.</P>

      <P>Deputy Corry should come out from under his reaper and binder and find out what this Bill is all about.  Some of us would be more convinced by his sentiments if we did not realise their commercial appeal for his constituents and were we not also aware that he remained notably silent when the Government and Party to which he belonged were drafting fresh taxation to place on the backs of the taxpayers.  He had little to do with independent votes at that time, nor did he worry very much about where the money should go.  It is in extraordinarily bad taste that he <Col N="1899" /> should come in here from his cornfield looking for votes in a matter which it has been agreed should be kept apart from Party politics.  I suggest he should look at matters of this kind more carefully and not consider every one as an opportunity for getting up here seeking votes.  If he wishes to be so independent, then he should change his Party and become a real independent instead of being a sham independent in the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
      <P>It is good that the money from this source is being used for a pretty worthwhile purpose.  Dublin at the moment is rapidly becoming an artistic wasteland. Already two theatres are under the hammer.  The Gaiety is in a state of suspense and nobody appears to be worried.  The Olympia is under a similar interdict.  It is a good thing to see two theatres saved by this measure, although it is a small thing we are doing for the theatre generally.  It is the view of our Party that we should look after the leisure time of our people as well as we can.  The Taoiseach some years ago referred to these objectives and said there are things besides economic development which a responsible Government trying to look after their people must consider. One of these things is the theatre.  We should strive as hard as possible to have a living theatre in this country. It is a great tragedy that the theatre here which, even on a material basis, is such an attraction for tourists from abroad, is not flourishing, and that Dublin, which was once a world capital of theatre, is today rapidly becoming a small provincial centre in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We cannot expect the new Abbey Theatre to reclaim its lost glory if it is seen to be an isolated instance in theatre.  We can only have a live Abbey Theatre when it is seen to be part of the living theatre here.  The one danger in getting this money from the funds of suitors in a way in which we do not have to cross Party lines is that we may find ourselves patting ourselves on the back and saying: &ldquo;What a great thing we are doing&rdquo;. We may feel we are spending it well by spending it on the Abbey Theatre, <Col N="1900" /> but we must look on this matter in the way Deputy Dunne mentioned.  We must give our people an appreciation of the theatre as something covering the whole country.  We are helping here only two urban centres, Dublin and Cork.  In Dublin, there are many more theatres falling into disuse.  We cannot hope to have Irish actors on Irish television, unless we have sufficient theatres in Dublin to keep the actors in employment.  Actors, like everybody else, must live and have employment at decent wages and, as far as possible, security of employment. They do not have that in Dublin at present.  An increasing number of our best actors have to go to Britain. This is rapidly turning Dublin into an artistic wasteland, Dublin which at one time could hold its head high as a world capital of theatre and as the birthplace of so many world famous dramatists in years past.</P>
    <P>I hope the new Abbey Theatre will get away from the pot-boiler kitchen comedy on which it has been existing for so long.  As in the early days of the theatre, they should attempt to translate life in Ireland in its present transition about them and bring it before us on the stage.  I would like to see them attempting to get school children on subsidised theatre trips far more often than in the past to ensure that the future generations would not lose touch, as they have in other countries, with the living theatre. It is a sad truth&mdash;and I think Deputy Corry bore it out eloquently&mdash;that we are increasingly becoming a nation of philistines, people who see no other point in life than the crackle of green pound notes.  This country's significance in the world today becomes much smaller the day it is measured purely in those terms.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter.  We might consider turning the Taibhdhearc into a bilingual professional theatre.  By doing this, we would be bringing help for the theatre to another part of the country.  Other countries have done a lot for the theatre.  Our local authorities could do far more for the theatre and the arts than they are doing.  Our Party are very happy to see the money <Col N="1901" /> used in this way.  That money comes from an area in which there may have been misery in the past.  At least, it is being put to some good use.  We should bear in mind that we are doing very little for the theatre, that we should be doing far more.  We should not get the idea that by giving this little bit of money for two particular theatres, we can wash our hands of our obligations in this regard.  It is a real tragedy that, on the one hand, theatres are closing down, old-established theatres like the Gaiety to which MacLiammoir referred as &ldquo;this ghost-laden area&rdquo;, when speaking on the subject in Dublin last year, and, on the other hand, we have people tramping around the country looking for money for a John F. Kennedy Memorial Concert Hall, when the greatest monument John F. Kennedy, who had a real appreciation of the arts and leisure, would desire, would be a live theatre in Dublin and not a concert hall on the outskirts of Dublin to be used on very rare occasions. We would be building a more healthy, living memorial to a great man if we scrapped that concert hall plan and used the money to save one of the theatres under order of execution in Dublin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceEDockrell" hpid="Mr. M.E. Dockrell Mr. M.E. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I must rise to my feet if for no other reason than to defend the Kennedy Concert Hall from the attack made on it by Deputy O'Leary, but I might say that was not alone what made me speak on this subject.  It is particularly suitable that this money should be used for artistic purposes, and I am glad to see this Bill will empower the Government to hand over some of the money for an artistic purpose.  Far from agreeing with the previous speaker who attacked the concert hall idea, I think that what is to be done for the Abbey Theatre in this Bill could very well be done also for the Kennedy Concert Hall. Unfortunately, we seem to have reached a stage in connection with that project that, owing to the financial difficulties at the moment, it is not going forward with the speed with which we would like it to advance. It would be very appropriate to use <Col N="1902" /> some of the funds available under this Bill for getting ahead with that scheme.</P>
      <P>I would remind any Deputy who may think that the concert hall was not one of the most suitable ways of commemorating that great President of the United States, a man who we like to think was Irish, that he was one of the most artistic people who ever occupied that high office in the United States or, indeed, one of the most artistic men who ever became President of any country.  He, with his wide knowledge and love of the arts, did not confine himself to the dramatic arts, the musical arts or the visual arts; he took an interest in all of the arts.  I am sure he would be glad to see the funds under this Bill being used in a way which would encourage the dramatic arts.  It happens that on the advice of the Arts Council, the Government decided to set up this memorial which is to take the form of a concert hall.</P>
      <P>I would remind the House that, happily, in this day and age, people of all ages, of all income groups, attend concerts in very large numbers, and that, far from a concert hall being something which would cater for only a few people, it would cater for very large audiences.  Furthermore, the concert hall would not be confined to music.  There are other purposes to which it could usefully be put.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this city we lack a suitable place for international conferences.  We are rapidly expanding our hotel room accommodation.  We can now house many more and are increasingly adding to our capacity in that respect.  We can now provide suitable accommodation for large-scale conferences for which a few years ago we had not hotels.  We are now in a much better position in that regard, but we have not got a suitable venue for conferences.  That is one of the purposes to which the concert hall could be put.  It has not in any way been abandoned, but at the present moment there is this financial difficulty which seems to be slowing it down.  I would suggest to the Minister that some of the money could be used to make a real start on that project. I, as well as other memebers of the all-Party Committee feel we would like <Col N="1903" /> to see some more concrete evidence of a movement in connection with this national memorial, because that is what it is, to the late John F. Kennedy.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to go into the question as to how far some of the moneys in the Courts of Justice could be used for this very fine purpose, notwithstanding what any Deputy might feel about the dramatic art.  I know that the Labour Party, as a majority, feel that the concert hall is a very worthy memorial to John F. Kennedy, and I am sure Deputy O'Leary, in his enthusiasm for the dramatic art, inadvertently gave a kick to the musical art.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to refer to it very briefly.  Deputy O'Leary referred to Dublin as an artistic wasteland. Were it not for the action of Dublin Corporation, two theatres, the Gaiety and the Olympia, would have disappeared already.  When a proposal came before the Corporation for the demolition of these buildings, the Corporation held up the plans and second thoughts were had by their purchasers. The thought behind that was not only to delay action but to preserve two of the oldest theatres in the city.  I hope that both will be saved.  If they <Col N="1904" /> are not, it will not be the fault of Dublin Corporation.</P>
      <P>Even though the Government provide this money it will go to barren use unless the people support the Abbey much more than they have been doing.  It has frequently been a depressing experience to go there and see so many empty seats.  While I know that a new theatre will attract people for a while, the future of the Abbey will not be secured by a piece of legislation.</P>
      <P>I am all for the building of the Kennedy Memorial Hall.  It suits my own purpose because the site on which it is to be built is the site of some derelict houses.  This being so, the memorial to the late President Kennedy will be built on sound foundations because of the fact that a new hall will arise on the site of bad houses.  That will be a true memorial to President Kennedy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill has been welcomed by all Parties, principally for the reason that the money is to be spent on preserving the theatre in this country to some extent.  An effort is being made in this proposal, and in the proposal for the new concert hall, to do something that the Irish people are not doing and have not been doing for some time.  It is a regrettable fact that the theatre, as a living entity, has been gradually disappearing, not just from our capital city alone but from our other cities.  Apart from the efforts of many voluntary workers to keep the theatre and music alive in assembly halls and basement theatres, we have been neglectful of our Irish heritage in this regard.</P>
      <P>This nation had been known for centuries as one which has sent its missionaries abroad for the conversion of Europe and other countries.  We have also sent writers and actors abroad and they have been an example to the rest of the world.  We have produced some of the finest poets, playwrights and actors, but to go to any theatre in this country now, especially the Abbey, one would think one was in a city where the people had no knowledge, no appreciation and no regard for the arts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1905" /> It is true to say that we will require, if we continue to develop, something in addition to the material things of life. When the economic situation was many times worse than it is at present, and nobody suggests that for many thousands of our people the economic situation is other than bad, you had active and live support for the theatre all over the country.  I hope that when this money has been spent for this purpose and when these buildings have been completed, the policy of those running them will be such as will attract and give new life to those who are interested in the arts, that this policy will contribute in some way to the education of our young people in the arts.</P>
    <P>Many of our local cinemas have gone out of existence, perhaps due to the attraction of a little game called bingo.  Many rural theatres would also be empty, were it not for the attraction of that game of bingo.  Nobody can claim that for the past dozen years or so, the Abbey Theatre has attracted a live interest and the fault, to some extent, must lie on the shoulders of those responsible for the selection of the plays presented.  Dublin may become an artistic wilderness because the country is developing into an artistic wilderness.  Dublin is not cut off from the remainder of the country by an eight foot or a ten foot wall.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that the Gaiety and the Olympia, even though they catered for different tastes, have been in danger of being closed down.  I do not know if the Minister has any power to do so under this Bill but the question of assistance to these two theatres should be seriously considered.  One theatre in Dublin and one opera house in Cork will not be sufficient to recreate interest in dramatic art or a love of music.  Mention has been made of subsidisation and it is a happy matter that on this occasion the State is not having to impose taxation to provide this money.  However, there is practically no European country that does not subsidise drama, opera and music very substantially.</P>
    <P>The various festivals held here from time to time attract interest and bring in many tourists.  With a live theatre, <Col N="1906" /> further interest could be engendered in people from Britain, the Continent and the United States.  Writers and dramatists need to address themselves to an audience.  The greatest poetry is not of any great value if it is not read and appreciated.  The greatest dramatist must have a stage.  The most wonderful musician must have a place where he can be listened to. Otherwise, his talents will be largely wasted.</P>
    <P>The Bill has been supported generally. It should not be sufficient merely to complete the payment of money due in respect of the Abbey and the Cork Opera House.  We should go on from there to think seriously in this House of further development.  When the situation becomes a bit easier, even if it were necessary to provide money from public funds, we should think of assisting the development of the arts and music.</P>
    <P>The building of a concert hall, which has been approved by the House, has been temporarily shelved.  It is true, as Deputy Dockrell has said, that the era of international conferences dawned many years ago.  The number of such conferences is multiplying year by year. The number of delegates and friends of delegates who travel to various centres is increasing.  The attendance of delegates at international conferences, festivals of music and so on brings very substantial economic benefits to the area concerned.  It is not without reason that in many European and Asian cities, governments are prepared to spend very substantial amounts of money in providing facilities for international conferences of one kind or another.  They may do it for purposes of prestige but they also have in mind the possibility of attracting tourists and visitors and thus strengthening their economies.</P>
    <P>It is true to say that in Dublin and throughout the country the theatre has been in a bad way for a long time.  It is also true that outstanding actors, dramatists and writers feel that there is little opportunity for them in their own country and there is very little opportunity for those who are interested in artistic professions and who would develop in due course to <Col N="1907" /> become outstanding in the various branches.  The use of this money for the development of the arts and music will help and, therefore, I should like to add my support to the support which has already been expressed by many Deputies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to express complete agreement with the point made by Deputy O'Leary on this question of the Kennedy Concert Hall.  I have expressed on a previous occasion the view that the fund for this memorial should be closed and that the money should be utilised towards the creation of John F. Kennedy acting scholarships.  There are in this country very many amateur acting societies.  For instance, there is the Amateur Drama Council of Ireland and the Amateur Drama League.  The moneys now in the Kennedy Concert Hall Fund should be utilised towards the granting of a scholarship from time to time to the best acting personnel in amateur dramatic groups.  I know the Government and the Arts Council have their own views on this matter, that they wish to create a John F. Kennedy Concert Hall.  I do not agree with this view.  I believe the idea of a concert hall should be scrapped.  In my view, there is not sufficient Government subvention towards the arts generally.  If this fund were utilised towards the subvention of amateur dramatics and the encouragement of the creation of an actors' studio of some description in Dublin, where there is none, we would have better professional artistes. We have a great tradition in our country.  We have a tradition of O'Casey, of AE&mdash;George Russell&mdash; Yeats and many others.  But this great tradition of say 30 to 40 years ago has not been maintained.  The impetus has not been kept up, except in some isolated instances.</P>
      <P>I am a lover of the Abbey Theatre traditions even in its present situation, and I look forward to the next fortnight when we can get into the new Abbey for the first time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1908" /> There was one point made by the Leader of the Opposition which would indicate that he and I have been briefed by the same group.  I refer to the provision of more money for the maintenance of the King's Inns Library. The King's Inns Library, as the House is aware, is situated at Henrietta Street.  My own experience, apart from any other consideration, is that it is a first-class library, of great historic value.  The real problem at the moment is the prevalence of dry rot.  I would appeal to the Minister to give more money&mdash;the sum involved is small: £20,000 or £30,000&mdash;for the purpose of the containment of this dry rot and other related matters.  We know what dry not can do to wood but it can be said to affect books just as badly.  I should like to add my voice to that of the Leader of the Opposition in this connection.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with what Deputy Corry said.  I am inclined to think that he is somewhat of a philistine.  We should get the situation into perspective. This is not a matter for taxation. The public are not being asked to provide this money.  This is the point Deputy Corry missed.  This money is coming from the fund of suitors and has nothing to do with the taxpayer one way or the other.  Another very important matter is that if claimants look for money from the fund, the Minister for Finance has agreed to guarantee payment, so the taxpayer is not at a loss.</P>

      <P>I have no pretensions in that respect.  I have simply come in here to pilot through what might be described as a machinery measure to enable these funds to be transferred for the completion of the Cork Opera House and the Abbey Theatre and to deal with commitments already entered into in respect of the construction of these buildings. However, as the debate has ranged widely, I think certain of the matters raised should be dealt with by me.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cosgrave and Deputy Andrews raised the question of providing additional money for the King's Inns Library.  Under a previous Funds of Suitors Act, funds were supplied for this purpose and it is a bit late in the day now for me to agree to a further allocation of £50,000 in this direction, sympathetic as I might be towards the preservation of that library which is certainly one of the finest libraries in the country in some of the finest surroundings.  However much I might be disposed to allocate funds, it is a bit late in the day as regards this legislation and I think it should be another day's work.  It is a bit late in regard to the progress made with this piece of legislation.</P>

      <P>We may have to take certain steps in regard to that building and have a look at the whole scope of legal education and also consider if we are going to devote moneys from the funds of suitors for this purpose because I think the public at large should have some means of access to and use of the King's Inns Library.  I feel that these matters should be gone into in depth before considering any other commitments, particularly when this allocation is sought at so late a stage.  We have been reasonably generous in this respect under a previous Funds of Suitors Act&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There is the additional fact that due to the attention which we have given to these funds in recent years, they have been pretty well depleted.  It is not a bottomless barrel and the £860,000 now there in cash funds from which we are drawing is a current fund in respect of which liabilities may have to be met. It is not what is called a dormant fund, by which I mean one on which there have been no claims for 15 years or more.  The main fund is a current fund in respect of which liabilities have to be met but of course in respect of which also further funds accrue each day.</P>
      <P>As regards Deputy Dockrell's query about using these funds for the Kennedy Memorial Hall, that is completely out.  Because of the large capital involved, the Memorial Hall will have to be financed from another source and any further raids on the Funds of Suitors will have to be of a marginal nature.</P>

      <P>Deputies O'Leary and Dockrell, Deputy Larkin and other Deputies ranged abroad over the cultural position generally in the country in regard to the encouragement of arts and the importance of helping arts in every respect.  While that is very desirable I am certain that in the case of the new Abbey Theatre, with its new premises, particularly having regard to the new shareholders recently appointed and the enlargement of the articles of association of the society administering the theatre, a new approach will be made.  Indeed, evidence of this has already been forthcoming in the past 12 months, in that the new Abbey is seeking a new arts director and is obviously looking at its functions in the new theatre in what I might call a broader sense than heretofore.  I am certain we all want to see the Abbey having a broader perspective in regard to plays produced and in regard to groups invited to perform there.  Indeed they might also set their sights on making regular provincial tours which have not been an evident part of the Abbey's activities for a number of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Larkin spoke about the lack of interest in the theatre in Ireland today.  I cannot see how he thinks this is so because there has been in the past few years particularly a flowering of the dramatic art in this country particularly exemplified in the amateur drama field where we now have hundreds of flourishing dramatic societies in the country with the regional festivals and the all Ireland Drama Festival, with thousands of players participating, admittedly in an amateur capacity.  I am assured, however, that the standard of these players is equivalent to the highest professional standards.  In the years ahead, I should like to see the Abbey Theatre tapping this vast reservoir of talent which exists in the country because it cannot be gainsaid that if there is one particular <Col N="1912" /> art form at which we are very good, it is the drama.  Of all the art forms, this is the one in which we have proved ourselves best.  I hope that, by having a broader perspective so as to include offerings of drama and players of international as well as national stature, the Abbey will by recruiting players from this great reservoir of the dramatic art in our own country and by inducting them into its own atmosphere, play a more dynamic part in the growth of professional theatre in future.</P>
    <P>Deputy Larkin wondered why plays are not produced by our greatest playwrights in this country.  Probably the greatest Irish dramatist we have had in recent years resides in an Irish country town in Kerry and all his productions take place in Ireland and are produced by Irish companies.  The Dublin Theatre Festival has in the past two years put on two productions, one of which held the stage in London over a very long period and the other is now attracting top audiences in New York.  These have both come up through the Dublin Theatre Festival and captivated London two years ago and New York at the present time.</P>
    <P>I do not see anything weak in the state of the Irish theatre on this aspect of drama.  Rather do I feel that we are in for a new flowering, evident in the increasing number of amateur plays and players and higher standards of professional theatre.  I should like to see the Abbey capping all these. All the assurance I have been given is that the new Abbey Theatre is one of the finest and most modern theatres &mdash;architecturally and aesthetically speaking from the dramatists' point of view&mdash;in the world and we shall have this open shortly.</P>
    <P>All this is not strictly relevant but I am glad that Deputies Dunne, O'Leary, Larkin and Dockrell in particular ranged into this fruitful field of what might be described as a general debate on fine arts, the dramatic art in particular.  Deputy Dunne spoke of the encouragement of other forms of dramatic activity apart from the Abbey.  This is a matter which requires investigation.  The <Col N="1913" /> Arts Council is doing something of this work and Bord Fáilte made a special advance to the Dublin Theatre Festival also.  I understand that the Irish Amateur Drama Council also do this.  Probably bodies doing this sort of thing should be co-ordinated to a greater degree and the Arts Council is probably the body to do it.</P>
    <P>The particular funds we are dealing with here are funds which I feel should be used in a very sparing fashion as needs arise such as the rebuilding of the national theatre or the restoration of a prominent opera house.  The funds have been considerably depleted already.  I should like to see some other sort of permanent organisation for dealing with what Deputy Dunne has in mind, that is, the practical assistance of the theatre generally outside capital works of this nature. This is a matter which comes within the ambit of the Arts Council, largely.  Any progress in the line of country mentioned by Deputy Dunne could best be made within the ambit of the Arts Council. I have every sympathy with the point made by him and agree with his remarks very largely.</P>
    <P>I do not think any other matters arose, really, for comment by me.  I wish to emphasise again that I welcome the constructive debate we have had, which widened and went beyond the mere terms of the Bill itself.  I wish also to say that the all-Party support and interest shown by Deputies in this matter show that we are all rightly of the view that it is not by bread alone that man lives and that we realise the importance of culture and the arts generally, moving, as we are, into an age where the occupation of leisure will be so important.  These are matters which must be borne in mind to a greater degree as a wider part of our citizenry participate, and has a chance to participate, in the arts generally.</P>

We have assembled here, largely as a result of the incomparable exertions of a unique man, Professor Delargy, a great treasure of folklore.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned to wake Deputies up to the fact that we have this treasure and that, if anyone sets fire to a lump of paper some night, the whole thing may go up in flames. Would the Minister, for heaven's sake, avail of this time, either to gather the materials into the National Library or <Col N="1917" /> to get them micro-filmed so that a record will be preserved in the National Library?  If something is not done, the whole treasure may be lost. There is no means of replacing it. The people who provided it are dead and gone.  If Séamus Delargy had not interested himself in this matter over the past 35 years, all this treasure would irrevocably be lost.  The cost is trivial.</P>
      <P>Here is an eminently suitable source for which I bespeak the Minister's interest now.  I want to suggest to the House that, in our circumstances, unless we are in a strong enough financial position, which we manifestly are not, to provide fireproof storage for a variety of libraries in this house, we should follow the British Museum procedure of entrusting all its great deposits like the King's Inns Library, the Dean Swift Library and all these other great accumulations of incalculable value, to the safe keeping of the National Library, providing, if necessary, a complete annexe to this National Library which can remain, by name, Dean Swift Library or King's Inns Library but so constructed that if there is a fire catastrophe, there will be modern methods to ensure that the contents are not destroyed.  Although I believe this matter to be urgent in respect of all the libraries, there is one outstanding case which is in imminent peril and which I most earnestly exhort the Dáil to concern itself to protect, that is, the archives of the Folklore Commission.</P>

      <P>On the Final Stage, may I make one other inquiry?  I notice that provision is made for a variety of needs, notably the Abbey Theatre and the Cork Opera House, but may I draw the attention of the Minister for Justice, who is responsible for this Bill, to another matter for which this Bill does not appear to provide?  There is another inestimable treasure which we are unique in holding, that is, the treasure of the place names of Ireland.  There is assembled at present in London a great international congress of people who describe themselves by a generic term as those concerned for the preservation of place names all over the world.  The Institute of Higher Studies has taken over from a relatively small body the duty of preserving the place names of Ireland and I believe that this work is held up simply for the money to pay the men and women to go out and record place names before they are forgotten.</P>
      <P>I can best illustrate this to my colleagues, every one of whom has the same solicitude as myself in this regard, by telling them that the very townland from which my people came would have been forgotten but for the fact that when I was young, I met an old woman who knew my great grandmother.  But for that, the very existence of that place name would have vanished, the link is now so tenuous and there must be thousands of place names in Ireland which are forgotten.  My people came from Lissian but the place name of the district is another name which at the moment escapes my memory.  When you are 64, that may be overlooked. I have recorded it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I want to emphasise that the link is so tenuous that when you apply it to that one place, it begins to dawn on you that these links are <Col N="1919" /> breaking all over Ireland.  We have in London a congress of scholars drawn from all over the world to pool their common knowledge of the place names of their countries.  What we want are a few trained personnel to go out to the countryside and collect the names from the people who still know them. We have in the Institute a staff who are capable of collating and preserving them forever.  They are the very essence of the whole social history of our people.  I am drawing to the attention of the appropriate Minister, whether it is the Minister for Justice or the Minister for Finance, or whether it is the Taoiseach himself, this urgent work because it is literally true to say that every day that passes irreparable losses are occurring which nobody can repair.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Dr. Hillery)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to provide powers which will be necessary in order to implement certain provisions of the Free Trade Area Agreement with Britain relating to duty-free licensing and Rules of Origin and to provide enabling powers in connection with tariff concessions for certain goods of Northern Ireland origin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Agreement provides for the continuance at reducing rates, and for a limited period, of the ten per cent preference given under the 1938 Agreement to British goods when licences are issued for the importation of goods at a reduced rate of duty.  This was provided for in the Finance (Agreement with the United Kingdom) Act. 1938 and the relevant provision ceased <Col N="1920" /> to have effect on 1st July, 1966.  The Bill therefore gives power to issue licences in which different rates of duty may be specified for goods originating in different countries.</P>
    <P>In pursuance of the policy of closer co-operation with Northern Ireland, the Government propose to give tariff concessions on Northern Ireland goods with certain specified exceptions.  The proposal is to reduce the duty by 20 per cent on 1st July, 1966, compared with ten per cent in the case of British goods, and by ten per cent annually after that&mdash;the position to be reviewed in 1971.  The initial concessions are provided for in the Government order which has been made to fix the new rates of duty on British goods under the Trade Agreement.  However, the procedure for making such orders is unduly cumbersome for the normal administration of the concessions and the provision now proposed, which will enable me to vary them with the consent of the Minister for Finance, by a more informal process will greatly facilitate the operation of the scheme.</P>
    <P>Under present Irish rules, manufactured goods imported from Britain are regarded as being of British origin if they were manufactured there, and if a specified percentage of the cost of production was the result of work done in Britain or in Ireland.  The specified percentage is 25 per cent for most goods but in some cases it is 50 per cent or 75 per cent.</P>
    <P>As a result of discussions with Irish industry, provision was made in the Free Trade Area Agreement for certain changes in the Irish rules, in order to protect Irish industry more effectively against unfair competition from goods produced in third countries which receive insufficient processing in Britain.  The changes are to raise the specified percentage from 25 per cent to 50 per cent for footwear, paint and furniture, and, for jute goods, to lay down a rule that the goods should be fully manufactured from the raw fibre either in Britain or in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I already have power under the Finance (Agreement with the United Kingdom) Act, 1938, to make regulations prescribing the proportion of the <Col N="1921" /> value of an article which must be the result of labour within a particular country, in order that the goods may be treated as manufactured in that country.  That Act does not, however, empower me to prescribe rules of the type decided upon for jute goods, and it will be necessary to obtain new powers for this purpose.  The Bill provides, therefore, that I shall have power to make regulations prescribing the conditions which must be satisfied in any country before goods can be regarded for customs purposes as originating in that country.  The provision in the Bill is in general terms in case it should become necessary in the future, as a result of developments in international trade, to prescribe rules of origin for goods from other countries.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the favourable consideration of the Dáil.</P>

      <P>It was inevitable that, even though the Free Trade Agreement was heralded by the Government Ministers who negotiated it as a wonderful step forward and something which should be extremely palatable to all of us, in the present framework of Irish industry, it would prove a difficult pill to swallow, once the sugar coating had been removed, since the whole framework of industrial production over the years had been the establishment of industries protected behind tariff walls and designed merely as supply industries for our own people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have had occasion in this House to point to the fact, not once but several times, because of its extreme relevancy, that the first encouragement given to industrial production for export over the whole country, excluding the undeveloped areas, and the first grants for new factories were given by the inter-Party Government in 1956-57.  It was that Government who gave the concession of freedom from income tax on exports.  It was Deputy Norton, God rest him, who first introduced the Industrial Grants Act to provide grants for industries all over the country.  The Opposition at that time fought strenuously and voted against all these measures.  But that is now merely historical.  It does, <Col N="1922" /> however, point the fact that over the years the Fianna Fáil Government have adhered to the idea of a supply industry for our own people.  That philosophy and that policy are now out of date.  We have now got to face the chill wind of competition.</P>
    <P>Whilst the pill may, in the last analysis, mark a step forward into our industrial future, it is, at the same time, a pill which must be swallowed, albeit an unpleasant pill once the sugar of the ministerial statements&mdash;I do not include in that my friend, the Minister for Industry and Commerce &mdash;had dissolved away.  We must, however, face up to reality.  We have entered into a Free Trade Agreement with Britain, an agreement necessary because of the move towards liberalisation of trade in Europe, and we must accept the consequences of that action.  This Bill is merely one cog in the machine.  It is an enabling Bill to help the Minister to do certain things. Similar Bills will have to be passed over the next few years in order that free trade can be safely negotiated, or negotiated in such fashion as to entail the least interference with Irish industry and the least danger to employment in Irish industry.</P>
    <P>Let us remember we have to absorb the numbers leaving the land by placing more in industrial employment. In 1965, we had 7,000 fewer people in employment as compared with 1964, notwithstanding the fact that we had increased the numbers employed in industry by 7,000.  The numbers leaving the land stood at 14,000 and we failed to produce sufficient jobs to absorb those 14,000, despite the infamous promise of the present Taoiseach, when out of office, that Fianna Fáil would produce 100,000 new jobs.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to see that, as a result of this measure, there will be some alleviation of the pressure that would have been brought to bear upon the footwear industry, the furniture industry and the paint industry.  I asked a question last week as to the numbers employed in the footwear industry. I am particularly interested in this industry because over half the footwear operatives in the country are <Col N="1923" /> employed in my constituency.  Of 6,000 employed in the footwear industry, almost 900 were unemployed. That is not in good accord and the fact that there has been a dealing where these people are concerned, which obviously resulted from negotiation between Governments and Ministers of different States, is something I welcome.</P>
    <P>It was clear, too, that the furniture industry would be in serious trouble if it had to face the full blast of competition without some rhythm of tariff reductions.  Certain people in the industry indicated their real fears that there would be considerable unemployment. It is welcome that under this Bill there will be right through the period of dismantling tariffs a continuing advantage of ten per cent in respect of certain goods from Northern Ireland.  That is a good idea. The future of Ireland is tied North and South and, while this may be something that may aggravate some of our difficulties during the period of change, the final result will be to bring all Ireland a little closer industrially and even nationally.  That will be a good thing.</P>
    <P>There are some things that should be brought to the attention of the House.  On Thursday, 23rd June, I asked the Minister the total value of the grants approved by Foras Tionscal for industry.  The answer I got was that grants approved totalled £34.7 million and the amount paid out was £15.9 million.  By a simple sum in subtraction&mdash;the Minister need not do it; I have done it for him&mdash;a figure of £18.8 million is left.  I do not offer this as any criticism of either the Government or the Minister, but the Minister knows that the amount allocated to Foras Tionscal this year is £4 million, or £500,000 less than last year.  It seems to me that, if we have approved of £18.8 million, which we have not paid out, and our allocation this year is £4 million, and the Taoiseach has indicated there will be no supplementary allocations in present circumstances, it will be quite a few years before we adapt ourselves and before <Col N="1924" /> our new industries have got under way to such an extent as to provide sufficient jobs to replace those leaving agriculture.  At this rate of expenditure, it will take us a few years before there is any great improvement or any great impact.</P>
    <P>I know that £4 million is quite a lot of money.  There have been occasions when I have been critical of spectacular failures, but we have already approved, but not paid, £18.8 million in grants, including adaptation grants, and therefore the process looks to me like a 4½ year job.  Moreover Foras Tionscal will surely continue week by week to approve of further adaptation grants and grants for new factories.  These will be necessary if we are to compete successfully.  If one takes the rhythm of tariff reduction as against the amount of money being put into adaptation grants and the amount approved in grants for new industries, then we are not moving fast enough.  There may be hard times so far as employment and everything else is concerned before we reach the stage of adapting ourselves for the blast of competition when we have had several reductions of ten per cent in our tariffs moving towards freer trade.</P>
    <P>I asked the Minister last week how the expansion in the private sector of industry and commerce indicated that the Second Programme can be achieved this year while considerable bank credit is unavailable.  The simple fact on bank credit last year is that the amount of money available for the private sector was exactly the amount taken back in repayment from people who had got loans.  The Government took all the new money.  The indications for this year are that they are going to take £28 million compared with £31 million last year.  With the low volume of new money, it is quite possible they will take more new money than will become available and that all that will be available for the private sector is whatever somebody else gives back.</P>
    <P>Adaptation grants are at the rate of 25 per cent.  That leaves the industrialist to find 75 per cent in the shape of new capital or from profits, bank loans or loans from some other <Col N="1925" /> sources.  If you take the rhythm of our reductions and the possible expansion of our industrial effort that can take place, this means that the tide on one side is going to get out faster than it will come in on the other side. I hope we will not reach the stage in the next few years where the new jobs will not be available and when we look at the figures for jobs as distinct from the unemployment figures, we will have to record the sad fact that there will be fewer people in employment for the next three or four years than there were in each preceding year.  It is relevant at this stage to point out we had a failure last year as compared with the year before and there seems to be no reason to believe we can change our pattern spectacularly in the short term.  I am confident in the long term that the influx at certain periods of money from abroad to exploit the boys and girls we have here&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It is the employer's job to get the maximum of profit, being at the same time fair and decent to his workers.</P>

      <P>Deputy Corish knows as well as I do that that is the pattern of industrial relations.  I will return now to strict relevancy, Sir.  This Bill is consequent on the free trade negotiations. It is something we here accept.  But we must realise that in the opinion of many, we are going to have difficult times over a period of three, four or five years before the liberalisation of trade helps us to the stage of having more employment and a better standard of living.  My fear is that the Government are not making a sufficient effort, either financially or legislatively, to see to it that the tide does not go out faster on one side than it comes in on the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister comes here looking for the authorisation of the House for certain measures which will make his task easier in carrying out some of the provisions of the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  Deputy Donegan and his Party did not give him much trouble in passing the original Agreement last year and he will get as little trouble putting this enabling legislation through.  The problem he is up against, and which he realises in bringing in this measure, is that many of our tariffs protecting Irish industry over the years were built up in a very haphazard way.  They came about in piecemeal fashion over the years.  They were not built up on a conscious policy but were added to since the thirties to give us what expansion of industries we have had.  It is presumably in deference to the manner of erection of many of our tariffs that the Minister finds he <Col N="1927" /> needs flexibility in some cases in dealing with their reduction.</P>
      <P>Irish management in the past have not been too worried about making their firms efficient to the extent that the reports of the NIEC on the situation in Irish industry must leave most of us unhappy about our future under free trade.  If that is so, an Agreement which sees our tariffs reducing over the years&mdash;by and large with one or two minor exceptions&mdash;by jumps of ten per cent is indeed a very radical way of bringing Irish industry to its senses. Let us hope that this cure for the inefficiency of Irish industry will not prove mortal for the patient and that many of our people who have invested their lives in these industries and whose families depend on them will not become innocent victims of the inefficiency of Irish management presided over by an Irish Government in the years of tariff protection.</P>
      <P>We see that the Northern Ireland Government will get extra preferential treatment in this reduction because of the Government's desire for the closest possible integration.  All of us on all sides favour closer relations between all parts of this country.  However, we must be worried about one thing, that is, that British capital, which has been gaining an increasingly strong grip in this part of the country, virtually owns the North of Ireland, and that any native industry that is left there is in a very small way of business at the moment.  Most of the large concerns are under British control.  Therefore, in considering any further co-operation with Northern Ireland which would appear to lessen the evil effects of Partition on our economy, even with that laudable purpose, the Government must be wary of the complete dominance of British capital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We would hope that the procedure which the Minister envisages here which calls for a more informal process between himself and the Minister for Finance will at all times take into account the interests of Irish industry which would be affected, because there may be the habit of treating the problems of Irish industry in too cavalier a fashion, and Ministers <Col N="1928" /> may be too anxious to fulfil the grand design of their tariff reductions and not be over-worried about the problems that may occur for Irish industries, problems which, let it be said, were the chief concern of our Party in opposing this blanket measure in the first instance.  In substance, our opposition was based on the fact that a blanket elimination of tariffs would prove tremendously risky for much of Irish industry.  Nothing that has happened since the coming into effect of that Agreement has changed our attitude on that.  We are gravely concerned, with our close identity with and accurate knowledge of the circumstances of Irish industry, that the situation is extremely shaky underneath the superficial optimism engendered in official reports.  The main reason for our opposition to the blanket reduction of tariffs was our anxiety about the state of Irish industry.</P>
    <P>In regard to footwear, paint and furniture, it has been decided that the percentage would go from 25 per cent to 50 per cent.  There is reference here also&mdash;and this is extremely important for Irish industry&mdash;to unfair dumping. We pointed out in the course of the debate last year that even a temporary advancement gained by competitors in this sphere of dumping could prove extremely dangerous, and in fact fatal to a small-scale Irish industry, where as with countries with larger industries, it might prove to be an incentive to more competitiveness. However, on the small scale on which some of our industries operate, dumping could swamp them over a very short period.  It is important that no loophole is left which could damage our industry to a very large extent.</P>
    <P>There is a point in the Minister's explanatory remarks about which I am puzzled.  He said that:</P>
    <P>Under the present Irish rules, manufactured goods imported from Britain are regarded as being of British origin if they were manufactured there, and if a specified percentage of the cost of production was the result of work done in Britain or in Ireland.</P>

At least the trade unions involved should be forewarned where any difference in tariffs other than those laid down under the agreement is contemplated and, in some cases, as the Minister has done in regard to furniture, and so on, we may be able to get one or two points to keep us away from the breaking point.</P>

Myths are a very important part of our life.  We were talking just recently of the folklore institute.  This is the industrial folklore of Ireland growing in our presence, the mythology.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We have to give credit to Fianna Fáil.  They are the most fecund parents of myths, with which they are perennially pregnant, of any political Party that has ever appeared in this country or any other country in the world.  My cow recently had triplets.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>But when Fianna Fáil proceed to have myths, they have them in litters.  The boot and shoe industry existed in this country long before we had any tariffs at all.  Governeys were making boots 80 years ago, but it was the tariff policy of the Cosgrave administration of the first decade of this country's existence which brought our boot and shoe industry into other spheres of the boot and shoe industry, brought it into what is commonly called in the trade the fashion end of the trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One would imagine, to hear Deputy O'Leary, that he believed that there <Col N="1931" /> was no fertiliser industry in this country.  One of the first fertiliser industries in Europe was established in this country.  The fertiliser industry was started in this country 100 years ago.  I often wonder does a man of Deputy O'Leary's age ever realise that the Irish fertiliser industry was the first to exploit the potentialities of basic slag?  They discovered it.  They were using it, having imported the raw material from Britain, when Britain was throwing the raw material away.  Our fertiliser industry recognised the phosphate content of the raw material and exploited it for the benefit of Irish agriculture.</P>
    <P>I do not think it would be fair to Deputy O'Leary to say that he is contemptuous of the Jacob and Guinness industries.  I agree that they are two great industries and in my young days one of the methods of teaching me geography was to bring me to O'Connell Bridge so that I could watch the Jacob goods going down to the North Wall.  Has anybody else in this House had that experience? It used to be a very good way of teaching geography to children.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>They do not use hard wheat to make biscuits; they use soft wheat.  What is interesting is not of what they used to bake the biscuits or where the raw material came from, but that the produce of Irish hands and skill and genius went to every corner of the world, including Singapore.  I remember that Singapore was the name on one of the consignments going to the North Wall.  Java was another name and the whole Orient and South America were open to Irish exports.  I was never in the dilemma of a certain Prime Minister of England who said that he had lived to be over 70 years of age and had never heard of that place.  I read all of them from O'Connell Bridge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That industry was built up in conditions of complete free trade.  It developed in Dublin in competition <Col N="1932" /> with Huntley and Palmer and all the other manufacturers of Britain and the Continent, and it wiped them off the board.  I do not see that we have any reason to speak apologetically if, in the face of the competition of the whole world, and using Irish barley, we could boast that we had the biggest brewery in the world in Dublin.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Leary will agree with me that the linen industry was an important industry.  That industry grew up here long before tariffs were ever heard of.  The woollen industry existed in this country and it is true to say that in the first decade of the existence of the State, a prudent scheme of tariffs was devised to stimulate and expand production.  The fashion then was that if you were going to impose a tariff and increase the cost of something the people had to buy, there was a commission and before that tariff was imposed, careful consideration was given to the questions as to who was going to have to pay; was it going to press heavily on the poor; was it going to increase the cost of living and, if so, how much employment was it going to give; what capital was available to create the necessary expansion; and if there was an added burden, what compensatory payment was going to be made?</P>
    <P>I am not so sure now, looking back over the history of industrial development in this country, that that was not the wiser way to do it.  There would have been fewer strikes and less industrial unrest if we had consistently looked for experience in this matter, if we had based our expansion on these grounds, and if we had looked to see what impact these developments would have on the cost of living of our people. In this context, I want to direct the attention of the House, the Minister, and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Per Jacobson Foundation lecture.  I wonder if they have read the last lecture given in Washington by Roussa, who was the assistant secretary to the Treasury in the United States Government.</P>
    <P>Roussa described his experience of the vast economic expansion of the United States that has gone on through the past ten years.  He admits that <Col N="1933" /> he dreaded the tremendous expansion of wealth which followed the economic expansion and feared that it would lead to events analogous to those that shattered the world in 1929.  As this avalanche of wealth descended upon them, they found that private investments could not keep up with the rate of savings.  In order to avoid the creation of inflation, they had to stimulate the export of capital to protect their own economy from the inflation that must have ensued.</P>
    <P>He admits that this whole experience was <i>terra incognita</i> to them and to their most expert economic advisers and that as they advanced through this astonishing Golconda, they asked themselves the question: &ldquo;What is the keystone of this whole structure; what is keeping the whole thing together; what is preventing the whole thing from collapsing in a catastrophe?&rdquo; and he says the conclusion they came to and which he was concerned in the lecture to illustrate was that it was stability of prices, that the whole secret of their success was that, while wealth was growing in this unprecedented abundance, all through it the cost of living barely stirred.</P>

I think I may legitimately recall to the memory of the House that great industries existed here for which we have no reason to apologise that never knew any protection at all, that many other industries were created under the extremely moderate and controlled system of protection that obtained in this country up to 1932, and I am calling Roussa's lecture into the discussion, in the hope of persuading someone with an open mind like Deputy O'Leary rather than a convinced member of Fianna Fáil, that moderate and discriminating protection may be a very much more effective instrument in generating an enduring expansion of the economy which may provide a better livelihood for everybody&mdash;wage earner, salary earner, capitalist and farmer&mdash;than the kind of unplanned fatuous protectionism which I think has landed us in a very considerable dilemma as of the present time.</P>
      <P>I noted with admiration the moderation and restraint of Deputy O'Leary's approach to this whole problem.  I want to use rather more emphatic language. I think we are all underestimating this problem.  I acknowledge that the Government have appointed the Parliamentary Secretary to deal with labour problems and I think that was a prudent, sensible and wise thing to do.  I am glad it should be Deputy Flanagan.  I have no doubt he will give conscientious and zealous attention to that particular assignment, so long as he is responsible for it, because I think it is a very important one.  I do not anticipate this annual reduction of ten per cent in the higgledy-piggledy tariff structure we have in this country with equanimity and I make no apology at all for calling to mind again what I have said in this House not infrequently and which I was first taught by one of the most far-seeing industrial developers this country has ever known, that is, ex-Deputy Paddy McGilligan, one of the finest minds in Europe and one of the most far-seeing men ever concerned with industrial development in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I well remember when we were in Government a question arising&mdash;I <Col N="1935" /> cannot remember precisely what it was&mdash;about some problem of redundancy and I think the late Deputy Bill Norton was taking a rather rumbustious line, as was natural&mdash;he was anxious to have this matter given the closest attention.  I remember his being edified by the attitude of Deputy McGilligan, who was then, I think, Minister for Finance, who said he had learned a lesson when he put through the ESB Act.  The lesson he learned was that you have no right to go to any man of middle age and give him a silver handshake and then tell him to do the best he can for himself; you have no right to go to a man who has invested the first 35 years of his life in learning a skill and giving him a year's salary and saying: &ldquo;Now go out and root for yourself&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>His view was that if the national interest demanded that you should go to a man of middle age and say: &ldquo;Your job has become redundant&rdquo;, there are two courses open to you: one was to say to him: &ldquo;You retain your salary and your pension rights or, if you are willing, but only if you are willing, if you recoil from the idea of a life of idleness, being paid your full wages and waiting for your pension date to come, we will put at your disposal industrial training in some other analogous branch of occupation at full wages until such time as you can take up another skilled job in some other industry&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I beg of Deputies to bear in mind that we may think it a handsome thing to go to a man of 47 or 48 years of age and give him a year's salary and say: &ldquo;The national interest demands that your job should be extinguished and here is a year's salary.  We think we are treating you handsomely&rdquo;.  At first glance, it sounds handsome to give him £1,000, but, if you have two or three or four children and a wife and you are accustomed to earning £18 to £22 a week and are looking forward confidently to occupying that job until you are 65 and then getting a pension because you belong to a pension scheme, it is a desperate thing to be told when you are 47 or 48 or in <Col N="1936" /> your 50th year: &ldquo;There is £1,000 and goodbye&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I beg of the Minister for Industry and Commerce to take upon himself the duty of saying that the Government are resolved in the context of this Bill to instruct the Minister for Labour to accept as a guiding line the principle laid down by Mr. Paddy McGilligan, that is, that once a man has passed the age of 45, he is not to be thrown on the scrapheap, and a skilled man who has passed the age of 45 in permanent employment is thrown on the scrapheap if he is not offered the opportunity of training in another skilled occupation without the disruption of his whole family life. If that is accepted, then I think we can meet the other problems that arise, but do not let us underestimate those problems.</P>
    <P>I remember a man coming to me, and I can give the Minister his name &mdash;I think he is in Heaven now&mdash;who ground spices.  Oddly enough, the late Deputy Derrig was acting Minister for Industry and Commerce at the time. The present Taoiseach who was Minister for Industry and Commerce was in the Mater Hospital having his appendix out.  I remember this man coming to me upstairs.  I was not then leader of the Opposition but I was a pretty formidable critic of the Fianna Fáil Government.  He told me he had never voted for me, for Cumann na nGaedheal or Fine Gael, that he had voted Fianna Fáil since the first day he had a vote.  He always thought that Dev was wonderful.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I set up a little business,&rdquo; he told me, &ldquo;and they brought in some regulations and closed me up.  I said: &lsquo;If it is for the good of the country, very well.  Dev would not do it otherwise.&rsquo; I set up a second little business and it was doing nicely but I wasn't very long at it until they made more regulations and wiped me out again. I remember saying to myself: &lsquo;If Dev did it, it must be right&rsquo;.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I started up a third business, grinding spices, and now they have published an order this morning giving Goodalls of London an exclusive right <Col N="1937" /> to grind spices in this country.  I must go up now and nail up my doors again.&rdquo;  I was not very apt to do this in those days but I remember going to see the Fianna Fáil Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I was so shocked by the situation on this occasion that I went to the acting Minister, Deputy Derrig, as mild a man as ever cut throats or scuttled ships.  He gave the usual Civil Service answer, that he would look into the matter.  I remember raising it in this House afterwards because he did not know what to do, with Mr. Lemass in the Mater Hospital and he was shaking in his shoes in case he put a foot right or left and Lemass would eat him when he came back.</P>
    <P>In the end I raised it in the House and the exclusive licence to Goodalls was qualified in favour of those who were already engaged in spice grinding in this country.  God be good to the man for whom I did this.  When the war broke out, he rang me up and said that I could have any spices I wanted for my shop in Ballaghaderreen.  I am a long time in public life and have heard much about gratitude but I have never come across a more concrete way of showing gratitude.  To my misfortune, I was not in the wholesale spice business and I did not avail of his offer, but at least he was prepared to do something practical to show his gratitude.</P>
    <P>The point I want to make is: Let us not only concentrate on the problem involved for the redundant worker. Machinery can easily be devised to meet his case if it is done now.  It will not be easy machinery to operate but we can devise it and we can ensure that no unjust hardship is involved. But when you come to the man with his own little business, the man grinding spices, employing 15 or 20 people, living comfortably with a nice house at Glasnevin or Drumcondra and a couple of children at school and a certain standard of living who suddenly finds that the business he was encouraged to go into by the Fianna Fáil Government, by the kind of specious promise to which Deputy O'Leary referred, is now no longer favoured.</P>
    <P>He bustles off to the Department and <Col N="1938" /> asks: &ldquo;What am I to do?  It is not only my money I have invested; it is my life.  I started this little business when I was 25.  I am rising 60 now and you tell me I am not wanted in it.&rdquo; What do you say to him?  Let Deputy Corry not restrain himself unduly or he will burst.  I do not think the Deputy need worry about me.  I took the precaution of getting a State pension, just as the Deputy did.  He and I have made ample provision for ourselves.  We shall each get £1,000 a year when we retire but I am anxious to ensure that the people for whom he and I are legislating will do as well for themselves as we have done for ourselves.</P>
    <P>I am talking about the small business man who is wiped out and I know the Minister is sympathetic in this respect.  I am not suggesting he would be reckless or ruthless in this matter but many of these things can be done practically and effectively if we face them in time and do not try to improvise frantically when they come upon us.  What are we going to say to the man whose business is folding up and whose business, as may be the case in many instances, is largely made of processing, for example, the man grinding spices?  A great part of his life is invested in his business, in his stock and so is the bulk of his earnings.</P>
    <P>The market for what he is selling is destroyed.  He suddenly finds his entire substance gone because the value of his stock has depreciated in the face of competition from incoming goods and the skill by which he lives is no longer usable because nobody wants it.</P>
    <P>What I am begging the House to do is to face facts.  While it may be good economics to say you cannot have omelettes without breaking eggs, it is not good sociology and I do not think Deputies should stand idly by while a middle-aged workman is effectively thrown on the scrapheap, or a skilled man of 50 years of age is dispossesed of his business or a small business man is utterly ruined so that some economic plan is prosecuted for what the Government of the day think is the common good.</P>
    <P>There are one or two specific questions <Col N="1939" /> I want to ask the Minister.  I compliment him on his courtesy in giving us a copy of his opening observations, albeit they were brief.  I agree their complexity required the circulation of this document he was civil enough to send us.  It makes it much easier to examine this Bill when we have this draft before us in black and white.  I take it that in pursuance of our policy of co-operation with Northern Ireland we are not to expect any concession from the Government of Northern Ireland in exchange for this tariff concession we are making to them, and that this is just a gesture of goodwill.  I am all for making gestures of goodwill.  Casting our bread upon the water is a useful thing to do.  As another Minister said in another context, not by bread alone do we live.</P>
    <P>I draw the Minister's attention to the fact that in introducing this Bill he said that under the present Irish rule manufactured goods imported from Great Britain are regarded as being of British origin if they are manufactured there or if a specified percentage of the cost of production was the result of work done in Britain or in Ireland.  The specific percentage is 25 for most goods.  In some cases, it is 50 or 75 per cent.  How does that chime with the section in the Finance Act we have just passed?</P>
    <P>Under the scheme, originally initiated by the late Deputy William Norton, it was provided that there could be a remission of income tax and corporation profits tax on exports from this country, provided a certain amount of the work on the goods exported was done in Ireland and a minimum was set in that regard.  We were not entitled to bring in watches from Japan and to ship them out again to Great Britain.  You had to satisfy the Treasury and the Department of Industry and Commerce that certain work would be done upon them in Ireland if they were to qualify for this benefit.  I think&mdash;on this I cannot be certain&mdash;that, bearing in mind the terms of the Trade Agreement then existing, now superseded by the recent <Col N="1940" /> Trade Agreement, there was some obligation upon us not to give concessions except in respect of goods of Irish manufacture which were deemed to be of Irish manufacture if more than 25 per cent of the added value represented processing in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Does this proviso here in regard to goods of British origin coincide with the corresponding provision in the other direction?  If not, is it liable to give rise to query?  Is our test of British origin any more rigorous than their test of Irish origin?  I think these two things must be kept in step. I should be glad to hear from the Minister, at his convenience, whether he is satisfied that, in fact, that is being done.  I should have thought 25 per cent, as he says, for most goods approximates to the true situation. Suppose we raise the content of certain goods to 50 or 75 per cent, does this give rise to the possibility of repercussions from the other side?  Take our sewing machines.  If we bring in parts, screw them together and export to Great Britain&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us not create any unnecessary difficulties.  Suppose, some day, the British say to us: &ldquo;Show us that 50 or 75 per cent added value of Irish origin in these goods&rdquo;, where would we stand?  I gather from the text of what the Minister has said that this exclusion from the general 25 per cent rule is as the figure of 50 per cent in favour of footwear, paint and furniture.  Then he goes on to say, in relation to jute, that the goods should be fully manufactured from the raw fibre either in Great Britain or in Ireland.  He continues:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I already have power, under the Finance (Agreement with the United Kingdom) Act, 1938, to make regulations prescribing the proportion of the value of an article which must be the result of labour within a particular country, in order that the goods may be treated as manufactured in that country.  That Act does not, however, empower me to prescribe rules of the type decided <Col N="1941" /> upon for jute goods, and it will be necessary to obtain new powers for this purpose.</P>
    <P>What goods has the Minister in mind? Is he referring to jute sacks or is there some wider range?</P>

      <P>Deputy Corry and I have grown old together in this House. I hold him in such regard that I do <Col N="1942" /> not care to make the same harsh replies to him as I used to make, and I am damned if he will persuade me. I understand that relatively little jute is used in the manufacture of woven twine.  I understand that there has been a great substitution of paper.  I am coming round to something which ought to command the sympathy of Deputy Corry, that is, that, instead of trying to maintain in existence the jute sack industry, we ought to try to help the jute sack industry to turn over to the paper bag.  When I was young and starting in business, Indian meal used to come in 20-stone sacks. I remember being appalled at paying men to carry bags weighing 20-stone: I suppose there are a few people in this House who remember it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>They were jute sacks. Then the next performance was that we used to have two cwt bags and they seemed to me to be an intolerable burden to ask an ordinary man to carry about.  There did not seem to be any rhyme or reason for it as it did not help anybody.  It simply put on an ordinary labourer an insufferable burden.  Then, eventually, we got to the ten-stone jute bag.  Any hefty fellow could carry it without unreasonable strain.  All over the world, outside the most productive countries, you get units of eight-stone paper bags.  So far as I know, there is no commodity, including liquid, that cannot now be satisfactorily accommodated in a paper bag.  Is there a query in Deputy Corry's mind?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I know precisely that mentality.  I have met it in Carolina, Georgia and in every State of the Union of the United States of America where people were accustomed to <Col N="1943" /> employ slaves and thought that the bigger the buck nigger the better he was.  Whether he was educated or had human dignity or whether he was regarded as a fellow-member of the mystical body of Christ with his employer, if he could carry 20 stone on his back, he was a good buck nigger.  I never looked on my neighbours in this country in that way and I do not think we should.  I never paid any man to do a job I did not do myself&mdash;never&mdash;and I was never able to carry a 20-stone bag.  That is why I was glad to see them pass.  However, that might seem to be wandering a little far.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make this point.  We are in great danger of doing this.  You are trying to perpetuate an industry that you cannot perpetuate. The day of the jute bag is gone.  The effort to try to keep it in existence is doing no service to the young fellows going into it.  You are drawing young chaps of 17 or 18 into a dying industry.  I do not think you could do any man a greater injury than to bring him, as a young man when he is still adaptable, into a dead end.  I do not believe you will see a jute bag in any civilised country in the world ten years from today, but I sympathise with the people in Clara, or wherever they are manufacturing jute bags, because they were persuaded into this business by the Fianna Fáil Government.  You cannot go down to them and merely turn the key in the door and say: &ldquo;Goodbye men, and off with you.  You have lost your money and your job and all the years you have invested in this business.&rdquo;  The wise thing, the economic thing and the sound thing is to say: &ldquo;Look, you should be catering for the container business.  Jute bags are as dead as the dodo.  We will help you to adapt yourselves into a dynamic, expanding business which will be permanent and in which you can train young men, with the prospects that they will have a long, productive <Col N="1944" /> and rewarding life in front of them with the training you will give them.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>When I see this concession made in regard to jute, I ask myself is this in regard to the jute bag industry? If it is, I think we should think again. I would much sooner put a levy on every incoming paper sack from abroad and use the proceeds to help the domestic jute sack industry to adapt itself to the paper sack industry, than to maintain a 75 per cent tariff to keep in existence an industry I know is going to die.  That is an aspect of this situation which I must ask the Minister to examine most closely.  There were ropes made in this country long before any tariffs were put on.  How many provincial towns do we know of which have streets called Rope Walk?  There were Rope Walks in Clonmel, Youghal and Castlebar.  I suppose ropes were made in this country which serviced the ships of the British Navy three centuries ago.</P>
      <P>In the rope industry we have at Newbridge, I suppose we have as effective an industry as there is in the world, but I do not believe it is based on jute.  That is a technical question that I am not qualified to answer at present.  It is mainly sisal they use and they are now going over to the manmade textiles and fibres.  I know that when I was Minister for Agriculture, I attended a meeting of the FAO and one of the problems discussed was the fact that the Philippines had raised the price of jute so high that the market dropped.  They reduced it, but when they did, everybody turned to sisal.  I am concerned to ask is this 75 per cent provision primarily designed for the jute bag industry?  If it is, I would ask the Minister to think again and if necessary, to ask the House to give him a levy on all incoming paper sacks to help this firm to go over to the modern product.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last thing I want to say is that somewhere in this Bill there is a reference to the Free Trade Area Agreement with Great Britain.  Let us be clear on this.  This is a Trade Agreement with Great Britain but there is <Col N="1945" /> nothing free about it.  This Agreement ultimately provides that every British industrialist can trade in Ireland on the basis of absolute equality with Irish industrialists.  Is that not so?  However, it does not provide, and never has provided, and as far as I can see, never will provide, that Irish farmers can trade in Great Britain on the basis of equality with British farmers.  Therefore, let us stop calling it a Free Trade Area Agreement.  It is a Trade Agreement for what it is worth.  I am not going to investigate in detail all of its provisions now but one thing is that it is not a free trade area.</P>
    <P>All these operations orient to the day on which we will end up in the Common Market of Europe.  That day is coming as soon as the French make up their minds to admit Great Britain. We will get in that day, no sooner and no later.  When we get in, it may mean stresses and strains but we ought remember that it will be also the first step on the road to the Atlantic partnership that President Kennedy described in his speech outside Independence Hall in Philadelphia in 1963. That was designed not primarily to make us rich, not primarily to blind us with the affluent society; it was designed to make us free and keep us that way.  The first step is a United Europe and the second step is the citadel of freedom that President Kennedy then described.  I will be glad to live long enough to see the foundation stone of that citadel laid and I will be very proud that Ireland should have a part in laying it.</P>

They had employment for about 25 there and the genius in charge of the Department was ex-Deputy Patrick McGilligan.</P>

Again, out of that factory, we started Ideal Weatherproofs which is, at present, giving employment to some 700 people, but not on the basis of 20 per cent on the manufactured article and 35 per cent on the raw material necessary to make it up.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon mentioned Messrs. Guinness and the employment they give.  It is all very well to talk about these industrialists.  I know they are very generous.  They throw out money wholesale for races and dogtracks, and the Lord knows what else, but I would remind Deputy Dillon that the Irish farmer is getting from Arthur Guinness &amp; Co., the same price today for his malting barley as he got in 1948.</P>

      <P>I am explaining that we need not be afraid of imports.  Is that not plain enough?  Practically 50 per cent of the goods being produced by our industries today are for export. Why should we be in dread of competition from countries to which we are able to export and sell on their own market?  Take Youghal Carpets.  Over 50 per cent of their production is exported to Britain and sold well there. A large proportion of William Dwyer's production in Youghal is exported and sold to Britain in competition with British goods, even though the people of Dublin will not buy his socks.  We have that right along the line in each one of our industries.  We are not afraid.  We have four little processing factories at present giving employment to over 2,000 people.  We are not afraid of anyone capturing our market here because they would not be able to compete.  We have no dread of that redundancy some people here seem to be afraid of.  When I first heard of this several months ago, I went around the various industries in my constituency and consulted them.  I could find no dread in any one of them of any competition with Britain or anywhere else.</P>

      <P>We need not be afraid of any Agreement.  So far as Northern Ireland is concerned, for the past couple of years we have had the Northern Ireland fellows growing beet for us.  It comes down here and is manufactured in the Tuam factory. The sugar is sent back there again.  As a result of that, we got a market for 10,000 tons of sugar in Northern Ireland.  But, of course, this House is so taken up with theatres and opera houses that it would not bother with little things like that.  We are no more afraid of a Free Trade Agreement with Britain than we would be of going into the Common Market in the morning. We know we will be able to hold our own in any of them.  Our people today are as well trained as any body of young people in Britain or Europe.  We would not be as well able to deal with the situation if we had a few more people like Deputy Fitzpatrick who when we started training the young lads in shipbuilding, said it should be stopped and the place closed down.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>After the last two performances, it is difficult to remember what one wanted to say.  With all due respect to Deputy Dillon, when he was speaking I thought we were discussing the Industrial Training Bill, which is not before us at the moment. I was not quite sure what Deputy Corry was talking about.  I do not think he was quite clear himself.  If the future is as promising as Deputy Corry seems to think it is, the workers so well trained that they can meet competition from any quarter, then there would appear to be no need to space our tariff reductions over a period of ten years.  Deputy Corry should have convinced the Taoiseach and the Minister for Industry and Commerce that we can go into competition tomorrow.  Maybe we can but, if we do, then the country will be back in the position even Deputy Corry would not advocate of being one big ranch.  The exodus from the country would be parallel with the exodus of the Jews from Egypt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, as I understand the situation, apart from the Minister's desire to be given certain powers under this <Col N="1953" /> Bill, there are two main facets that are of interest not only to us here but to the people generally.  The Minister said:</P>
    <P>As a result of discussions with Irish industry, provision was made in the Free Trade Area Agreement for certain changes in the Irish rules... The changes are to raise the specified percentage from 25 per cent to 50 per cent for footwear, paint and furniture and, for jute goods, to lay down a rule that the goods should be fully manufactured from the raw fibre either in Britain or in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I take it the Minister is satisfied that without some added control in that regard the workers in these industries would be exposed to early redundancy and the possibility of the closing down of some units of the various industries. This might well be the situation in other industries too.  Without discussing the Free Trade Area Agreement in any depth, and without discussing the merits or demerits of that agreement, it should be recalled that spokesmen of the Labour Party repeatedly stressed their concern for the future employment of workers in Irish industry.  The Taoiseach referred to certain sections which were lagging behind in efficiency, and I think at one stage he referred to certain sections of management which were lazy and unprogressive and had not done anything at all to bring their firms up to date either on the productive or the distributive side.  However, the Minister is satisfied with his discussions with the industries concerned and we feel that we can support the proposal referred to here.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the matter is the acceleration in the annual reduction of the tariffs in the case of Northern Ireland.  Representatives of the Labour Party for many years consistently advocated a closer relationship with the six sundered counties.  On the face of it, this idea would appear to merit support but industries have been established in Northern Ireland in recent years solely with British capital.  I do not think it is any secret that Northern Ireland is considered to be almost a depressed <Col N="1954" /> area.  Unemployment there equals our own.  At the same time, fairly substantial industrial units have been established there.  While we generally welcome British and other capital coming in and bringing technical knowhow and expertise to help in the development of Irish industry, there is one matter of concern arising from the decision that on July 1st instead of a ten per cent reduction, there will be a 20 per cent reduction.  That means that within a period of three years the tariff on goods coming in from Northern Ireland will have to be reduced by 50 per cent; 20 per cent on July 1st, 30 per cent in July of next year, and in the third year goods manufactured in Northern Ireland and coming in here &mdash;some of them manufactured in very large concerns, and goods of a service nature&mdash;will because of the capital involved and to some extent, possibly, because of the industrial tradition in that corner of our country, be able to compete on more than favourable terms with the Twenty-six Counties.</P>
    <P>Therefore, this matter needs consideration and while for political, social and other reasons the gesture of goodwill should be supported, we should like some positive assurance from the Minister that the gesture of goodwill will not in the near future result in large numbers of workers at present in employment here being sent to sign on at the labour exchanges or to join the tide of emigration to Britain.  So far we have not seen any evidence that the lectures of the Taoiseach or the utilisation of adaptation grants by industry will ensure protection of our workers against this type of competition.  It is necessary again, without discussing the merits and demerits of free trade, to refer to the theory of the Taoiseach and the Minister for Industry and Commerce, expressed to the House when the Agreement was being discussed, that it would take ten years for the Agreement to become fully effective and that in the meantime Irish industry would be developed to a point where it could face competition from Britain and elsewhere on equal terms.</P>
    <P>In this debate, mention has been <Col N="1955" /> made of a number of industries, including the boot and shoe industry, the paint and furniture industry, and that they will get slightly added protection. What is the position of industries engaged in the manufacture of textiles? What is to be the position of a number of other industries excluded from this proposal?  We hope the Minister, in his reply, will deal with these in a comprehensive, detailed manner.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry, in the course of a somewhat incoherent speech, said that the young men and women of this country are fully capable of meeting all competition from Britain, Northern Ireland or elsewhere.  Nobody doubts their capacity but it is known to the Minister and the country, if not to Deputy Corry, that the training of our young people is sadly lacking.  That is so because it is only now that we have been presented with an Industrial Training Bill which introduces for the first time some form of training and retraining.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his opening statement did not say that if workers are made redundant as a result of his activities, they will be given a guarantee of re-employment, or at least a guarantee that their wage rates in alternative employment will not suffer.  The legislation we are now in the course of passing may not have this effect but if it is correct that it will require ten years to bring up our economy to a point at which we can compete equally with Britain, the training of workers and re-equipment of the various industrial undertakings will be of vital importance.  I do not wish in any way to denigrate the attempt to make a gesture of goodwill to the North.  We are all in favour of improving relationships between all Irishmen, but we must think of the economic results of any such measure as this.  One of our prime concerns is whether this legislation will affect the economic security, the employment of a number of workers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>We in Fine Gael welcome the Free Trade Agreement with Britain, negotiated late last year. Arising from that, we are, of course <Col N="1956" /> supporting this Bill.  We welcome the conversion of Fianna Fáil from the doctrine of economic isolation which Fianna Fáil held so dear at such a high economic price during a number of years.  I wish to avail of the opportunity afforded by this Bill to ask the Minister to indicate to the House what developments, if any, have transpired during the past six to eight months in regard to one of our major industries&mdash; motor car assembly&mdash;which it is generally agreed will be more adversely affected than any other industry by the free trade arrangements. The departmental working party&mdash;I forget the title under which they worked&mdash;which surveyed various industries, were particularly pessimistic and despondent in their forecasts for this highly protected industry which it is agreed will go by the board under the Free Trade Agreement.</P>
      <P>The working party commented, as far as I can recall, that the proprietors of those assembly plants did not take them into their confidence, by and large, as to any plans which they might have for adaptation or for carrying on in some other form.  This matter is very relevant to this Bill, one of the main features of which is the provision of accelerated and increased concessions for trade with Northern Ireland.  By reason of this fact it was hoped that the motor assembly industry, which employs about 10,000 people, could branch out into other light engineering fields.  Those intimately concerned have found over recent months that the manufacturing advantages arising from the vast scale upon which Northern Ireland light engineering is organised are such that Northern Ireland manufactures will hit many of our light engineering organisations very badly, particularly in the Dublin area, by reason of the proximity of the Belfast engineering works to Dublin city.  The speed of engineering is one on which the economies of large-scale organisation and large-scale manufacture can be brought to bear very considerably indeed.  Therefore, I want to draw the Minister's attention to the fact that there is great cause for concern as to the future of this industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All the points made by previous <Col N="1957" /> speakers here, Deputy Dillon in particular, relating to the Government's plans for compensation and retraining, and what have you, of the workers affected, cannot be reiterated too strongly, as far as the motor assembly and light engineering are concerned. In particular, as far as the motor assembly is concerned, the certain fact is that the proprietors will very probably lose nothing, and may well indeed gain considerably.  The livelihood of the workers involved is at risk.  The interests of the workers may not coincide with that of the proprietors. Therefore, it behoves the Minister to take a very firm stand in this matter if he considers the need is there.</P>
    <P>I mentioned that we in Fine Gael welcome the conversion of Fianna Fáil from economic isolation and we welcome the Free Trade with Britain. To my mind, a very important element of that plan has been very adversely affected by recent developments. A free trade area, if it means anything, involves the free movement of labour, of goods and of capital between the areas involved.  In the British Budget a few weeks ago, the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced that he had had discussions with financial interests in Britain and that Ireland was included in those areas in respect of which he urged voluntary restraint on British investors.  That immediately nullifies one of the major advantages of the Free Trade Area. If foreign capitalists, as British manufacturers, are not in a position to exploit the advantages offered by free trade between Britain and Ireland by coming here to set up industries, our labour case will be far worse than it is.</P>
    <P>It, therefore, behoves the Minister to tell us to what extent the whole concept has been changed by this retrograde development in Britain, and to what extent the plans of British industrialists to transfer funds here and also plants here have been rendered null and void.  The Minister will be aware of this fact.  He, of course, is not aware of the many incipient or dormant proposals which will be adversely affected.  I want to suggest to him and <Col N="1958" /> to the Government that it is very important indeed that the case should be made to Britain for removal of this restriction at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>Previous speakers referred to the ill effects which can arise from dumping by foreign manufacturers, as soon as the tariff restrictions are removed.  I seem to recall referring to this matter during a debate, or by way of a question, about six months ago. Perhaps the Minister will correct me if I am wrong.  I seem to recall asking if any anti-dumping legislation was being prepared.  I may have missed its introduction. I have been watching out for it as it is a matter in which I would be interested.  If I did not miss it, if it has not come in, it is very timely that the Minister should tell us when it will be introduced.  It is a matter which it would be very difficult indeed to legislate for in an effective and realistic sense.</P>

      <P>This Bill was not, as I said last week on the Tea Bill, introducing the concept of a free trade area, but rather as consequential legislation, which dealt with duty-free licences, the Rules of Origin and enabling powers to give concessions on Northern Ireland goods.  Nobody raised anything on the question of duty-free licences, but since the debate extended to the whole concept of a free trade area and how we may fare, I suppose it was natural that dumping, redundancy, training and retraining should be raised.  The dumping legislation is being prepared.  There have been consultations with industry.  Proposals have been received and the legislation is well on its way to being prepared now.  In the interim before it is introduced, the first cut in the tariffs will hardly necessitate the need for this anti-dumping legislation and in that interim it is intended to make use of older legislation to protect industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might tell the House that as a result of consultations, we have proposals ready.  There have been further consultations and those have caused the delay in introducing legislation. As a result of these consultations we <Col N="1959" /> have adequate proposals now to protect industry against any dumping.  The House has shown great anxiety about this matter and I can assure the House that the proposals we have would protect industry in any degree sensitive against dumping.</P>
    <P>As regards redundancy, Deputy Dillon was quite wrong when he said that the State might say that for the economic benefit of the country a man would lose his job.  Redundancy is caused by technological advances and this is not something which is due to a decision by the Government.  It is a fact of life which must be faced.  The Government are facing it by having redundancy compensation to protect people and to give them financial compensation between the time they lose <Col N="1960" /> their jobs and get other jobs.  We are making provision for training for any jobs which are available for people who either left the land or left jobs which have suddenly disappeared. There will be retraining for those people and there will be creation of mobility in labour.  We must, from what Deputy Dillon has said, all realise that a big change in the mental attitude of all of us is necessary if we are to meet the rapidly changing employment situation which is about to come.  Very rapid changes have taken place in the employment situation over the past five to six years.  Those changes will continue and accentuate.</P>

      <P>Grants for the building, improvement and extension of hotels are made by Bord Fáilte in their discretion out of the fund provided for holiday accommodation under section 2 of the Tourist Traffic Act, 1959, as amended by section 6 of the Tourist Traffic Act, 1966.  The Board are also authorised to pay interest grants on loans raised for the purpose of providing holiday accommodation in accordance with section 17 of the Tourist Traffic Act, 1952, and section 3 of the Tourist Traffic Act, 1957.</P>
      <P>Particulars of the Board's expenditure in respect of these grants are shown in their annual accounts and supplementary information is included in their annual reports.  The information sought by the Deputy, in so far as it is not included in these documents, is not available in my Department.</P>

      <P>I am not aware that the operation of the enactments referred to by the Deputy has caused hardship on any significant scale to landlords where <Col N="1810" /> there is a covenant in the lease for forfeiture in the event of the lessee's bankruptcy and where, in fact, the lessee becomes bankrupt.  The landlord may invoke his remedy for breach of covenant at any time after one year from the date of bankruptcy if the property has not been sold by then, or he may apply to the official assignee either to elect to take over the lessee's interest or to disclaim it.</P>
      <P>However, there is a committee at present engaged on the modernisation and consolidation of the entire bankruptcy law and I shall bring the matter to their notice.</P>
