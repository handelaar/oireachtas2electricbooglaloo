      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if any of the premises vacated by civil servants now accommodated in O'Connell Bridge House, Hawkins House, Stephen's Green House, Ansley House and Liberty Hall are at present unoccupied; if so, what is the cost of upkeep of these unoccupied premises; and what proposals he has for their use in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>The most of the accommodation which was vacated consequent on the occupation of the premises referred to has been fully re-occupied by other staffs or surrendered to the owners.</P>
      <P>The position in regard to the remaining premises is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No. 21 Fitzwilliam Square: These premises will be fully occupied within the next week by staff of An Foras Tionscal, who have to be moved from <Col N="614" /> No. 1 Mount Street Crescent in order to provide additional space for the Industrial Development Authority.</P>
    <P>Ship Street Barracks: Part of the accommodation has been re-occupied by staff of the Revenue Commissioners. It is intended to use the balance to re-house Garda personnel whose present premises in the Lower Yard of Dublin Castle will have to be vacated in connection with the proposed new Stamping Branch building for the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>No.3 Lower Ormond Quay: The accommodation in this building is of a very low standard.  The most suitable rooms are being temporarily occupied by the Agricultural Wages Board and Probation Officers attached to the Department of Justice.  As soon as alternative accommodation can be provided for these, the premises will be sold.</P>
    <P>Numbers 1 Hume Street and 46 St. Stephen's Green: These premises have been temporarily re-occupied in part by staff of the Land Commission and the Office of Public Works.  The structural condition and lay-out of the premises are such that nothing short of complete reconstruction would render them suitable for permanent re-occupation.  In the circumstances, it is proposed to dispose of the State's interest in the premises as soon as alternative accommodation is provided for the present occupants.</P>
    <P>No. 10 Parnell Square: A few rooms in this building which were vacated by the staff of the Revenue Commissioners' Office have not yet been re-occupied. It is expected that the balance of the building will be vacated by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs early in the New Year, and it is considered that it would be better to wait until then so that the re-allocation of the entire building can be most effectively considered.</P>
    <P>No. 1 Beresford Place: Four rooms in this building are vacant at present. The accommodation in them is substandard, but the possibility of finding some use for them is being explored.</P>
    <P>Kildare Street and Marlborough Street: A few isolated rooms in the headquarters buildings of the Departments <Col N="615" /> of Industry and Commerce in Kildare Street, and Education in Marlborough Street are at present unoccupied. Arrangements for their re-allocation are in train.</P>
    <P>It would not be possible without the expenditure of an inordinate amount of time to ascertain how much has been spent on the maintenance of the unoccupied parts of the premises in question.  It can be taken that the cost has been negligible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Government needed all this accommodation, why did they not build their own offices instead of paying exorbitant rents to somebody else, as they have paid for O'Connell Bridge House?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I doubt very much if it is a type of supplementary question to which one could give a quick supplementary answer.  This whole general question of accommodation in the Civil Service, as any sensible person would have deduced from the reply I gave, is the one of extreme complexity. To deal with the whole general question of the housing of the Civil Service by way of reply to a supplementary question is, I think, beyond reasonable bounds.</P>

      <P>On the general question of loans for cottage repairs, I would refer the Deputy to what I said in my Estimates Speech (Volume 224, Columns 58 and 59).  As regards County Westmeath, I sanctioned a treasurer loans of £20,000 in September, 1965 but I understand that the loan was refused by their bank subsequently. The council then applied for a loan from the Local Loans Fund but this was refused because it has not been the practice to make loans available from the Fund for cottage repairs.  I have no details regarding any further applications which may have been made by the council for cottage repair-loans. There is no such application before my Department at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Deputy let me finish?  Time without number over the years I have advocated that our housing stock should be maintained because, if it is not maintained as maintenance requirements fall due, the cost will become exorbitant and we will lose much of the valuable housing we already have.  Repairs and maintenance are not something which we should backlog or cut out, as local authorities are wont to do in order to save two or threepence in the £ in the estimates. The figures are cut and we now find ourselves becoming worried because our housing stock has deteriorated and is deteriorating and the amount required to carry out repairs is no longer normal repair or maintenance but is a backlog representing quite a considerable figure.  The point I have made is that it is not the practice to provide money from the Local Loans Fund since these are moneys which should be raised annually.  The job should be done annually.  It should not be an accumulation of repairs going back over 20 years.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education if his attention has been drawn to a statement reported on Monday 26th September and attributed to him regarding a survey of accommodation in the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee regional schools and the availability of grants for two prefabricated buildings; and if, having regard to the fact that the Vocational Education Committee received no prior notice of this survey or the availability of grants up to the conclusion of their meeting on 29th September, he will now state why they were not advised where the two prefabricated schools are being located; and if he will state when these two schools are being erected, and the number of extra students for whom accommodation will be provided.</P>

      <P>The provision of the prefabricated classrooms referred to in my statement of 26th September, 1966, is a matter in the first instance for the City of Dublin Vocational Educational Committee.  Officers of the committee were informed on 30th August, 1966, of the commencement of the survey and on 23rd September, 1966 of the intention to make the statement and of the readiness to make the capital allocation for the prefabricated classrooms.  The question of the sitting of the classrooms was discussed with officers of the committee on 23rd and on the 26th September, 1966.  It is for the committee, however, to formulate specific proposals in this matter for submission to the Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I know a bit about that.  I think it was a play on words, an interpretation.  My information is that on the 4th of this month the <Col N="627" /> CEO told my Department that he was asked at the committee meeting if he had any official intimation from the Department in regard to the allocation of the prefabricated structures.  He replied &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  My department was in touch with him by telephone and informed him of the official position and approval.  When we asked him why he informed the committee that he had no information about the sanction and approval, he said that he had not received a letter and because, he said, he had not got a letter, he thought that a telephone call should not be regarded as intimation. It was just a play on words.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Portleen is one of a number of one-teacher schools in the Ramelton area under Protestant management. The future provision for the education of the pupils concerned is being discussed with the appropriate Church authorities so as to ensure that the best educational facilities possible can be provided.  I hope to be in a position to put forward firm proposals following these discussions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say if it is present to his mind that in an area such as Ramelton, in Donegal, <Col N="628" /> and similar areas in North Monaghan and North Cavan, it is vitally important to discuss such proposals, not only with the appropriate ecclesiastical authorities but with the parents of the children so that they may be kept fully informed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes; what the Deputy suggests is, in fact, done.  When the Department decide to amalgamate certain schools, they write to the manager, who gives his observations and if he makes further queries, an inspector usually has a personal discussion with him on the site.  The manager always presents the proposals to the parents concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is for that reason that I asked the supplementary question. The Minister may be led to believe that there is adequate communication with the parents, once discussion has taken place with the manager.  What I am asking for is a reassurance from the Minister, especially in regard to categories of places such as Ramelton, that he will satisfy himself that there is adequate discussion, not only with the manager but with the parents of the children as well.  I can assure him that is a matter of urgent and vital importance, particularly in these areas.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>What I mean is that the Minister should see that a senior inspector of his Department will give public notice that he is going to attend in a parish or district and that he is prepared to meet the parents of the children to get their views so that these views may be fully submitted to the Minister before a final decision is made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to explain the <Col N="629" /> position.  On the other hand, I should like to explain that there are other cases when the Department notifies the Reverend Manager and when he, perhaps in the church, informs the parishioners that such amalgamation is taking place and where there is no need for discussion.  This has happened. We are quite willing in all cases to have on-the-spot discussions between the parents and a senior inspector from my Department.  In that connection, it has been found in regard to transport, for instance, that local knowledge is of inestimable value to us, in regard to routes which are to be taken and the number of children to be picked up in various areas.</P>
    </Speaker>

Will the Minister now make up his mind as to whether transport will be provided for these 12 or 14 children?</P>

    <P>That a sum not exceeding £8,581,450 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1967, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Local Government, including Grants to Local Authorities, Grants and other expenses in connection with Housing, and Miscellaneous Grants including certain Grants-in-Aid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>During my few remarks yesterday evening on the subject of housing, I mentioned some <Col N="631" /> figures which appeared to amaze the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government.  Both by facial expression and consultation with the Department he appeared to suggest that the figures I quoted regarding the construction of houses by Dublin Corporation were incorrect.  I must confess that I made a slight error when I referred to the year 1951-52 as the year in which there was the greatest production of dwellings by that particular local authority.  I must apologise to the Parliamentary Secretary if I misled him.  The correct year was the year prior to that, the year 1950-51.</P>
      <P>I mentioned those figures to remind the House that over a period of 15 years the Department of Local Government could not claim any pride of achievement, either as regards the total number of dwellings constructed by the local authority or by anybody else.  I shall now quote one or two figures from a little book.  It is the diary for Dublin Corporation for 1964.  The diary shows that in respect of 1951 2,253 cottages were completed and 226 flats and 109 dwellings reconditioned, that is, a total of 2,588 during the year 1951-52.  I mentioned that there was a decline following those years.  The decline was not just steady. There was a sharp drop and then a reasonably steady drop particularly during the term of the present Minister for Local Government.</P>
      <P>In 1958-59 there were 294 cottages and 166 flats constructed, that is a total of 460 dwellings.  In 1959-60 280 cottages and 225 flats were built, a total of 505 dwellings.  In 1960-61 there were 94 cottages and 183 flats, a total of 277 dwellings constructed.  In 1961-62 282 cottages and 110 flats were constructed, a total of 392 dwellings.  The last figure that is shown in the diary is for the year 1962-63.  During that year 372 cottages and 271 flats were constructed, that is, a total of 643 dwellings.  It would take roughly the total of all those years together to equal the number of dwellings, houses and flats, built in Dublin in the year 1950-51&mdash; 15 years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are supposed to have for a <Col N="632" /> number of years a Government who, according to their own spokesman, are a progressive Government and a Government supposed to be dealing with the problem of housing in city, town and countryside.  If you look at the records in regard to other parts of the country you will find a somewhat similar picture to what I have given for Dublin.  It is true that there are at present some improvements but that record will take a long time living down as far as the Fianna Fáil Government are concerned.  There is no use in the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary suggesting in this House that a dismal record of this nature is the responsibility of local authorities because in this connection it is well to put the position correct and clear before the House and before everybody.</P>
    <P>As far as local authorities are concerned sanction is required for the acquisition of ground, for the development of land, the laying of sewers, the issuing of tenders, the sanctioning of tenders, and the sanction of building contracts.  The sanctions in all cases come from the Department of Local Government.  The Department do not always refuse sanction.  When it suits those in office and those in power they can delay matters very considerably. They can delay matters by holding up applications by local authorities under the compulsory purchase orders.</P>
    <P>I have one particular place in mind in the city of Dublin, an area which the local authority was looking to acquire for a long time.  They needed some ground in the Wolfe Tone Street area on which to build flats.  The matter was referred to the compulsory purchase procedure.  The Department decided there must be an investigation.  Two years passed before any decision was issued by the Department on that investigation.  Consequently, the local authority did not know if they were going to get permission to go ahead. Eventually it was decided by the Minister that permission should not be given to build dwellings in that particular area.</P>
    <P>There are other cases in which compulsory purchase orders have been the subject of investigation and, again, <Col N="633" /> because of Ministerial decision, the application of the local authority has not been agreed to in full.  These matters, as I suggest, might not be quite so serious if it were purely a question of a number of houses or a number of flats or a number of sums in arithmetic, but they are serious because failure to provide dwellings for those who are constantly in need of such dwellings imposes a continuing and increasing hardship, and exposes fathers, mothers and children to continued existence in insanitary, unfit and unsuitable accommodation, and forces many hundreds of them to live in conditions, which, certainly in this country at least, should not be tolerated for any length of time.  We pride ourselves in this country&mdash;to what extent we are entitled to do so I cannot say &mdash;on being a Christian community, a community of which the family is an integral part, a most important part, a community in which the parents are expected to exercise discipline and give guidance and help in relation to their children as they grow up.</P>
    <P>I well remember some years ago in this House, and outside it, a former Minister for Health dilated at great length on the deleterious effects of providing meals for school children, that if a community were to provide hot meals for school children, this would interfere with the family as a unit, would be tantamount to bringing into our community all that the Minister says is bad in other communities in other parts of the world.  So, consequently, the Government who represent that view have surely responsibility to secure by every reasonable and proper means that families will have adequate accommodation and that we will not be faced in 1966 with the position that hundreds of families are living in circumstances where the young father lives with his parents and his wife, and maybe one or two children, has to live with her parents for a prolonged period.</P>
    <P>If the Minister and his Department consider that this is the type of family life that should be supported, I would be very much surprised to hear it. Yet, the facts are there.  We are told in the Minister's report that the total <Col N="634" /> output of local authority dwellings under his leadership for 1965-66&mdash;and remember this Government have been back in office since 1957&mdash;for the whole country was 11,000 and yet in 1951-52 the Dublin Corporation could provide more than 25 per cent of them purely as local authority dwellings.  In or around the same time private enterprise, with the assistance of such grants as were available, provided as many as, if not more than, Dublin Corporation in the area.  From 1951 we have had this situation.</P>
    <P>I do not tire of pointing these things out to the Minister and to the Department because unless they are continually reminded of the facts of the situation, they may well retire again into that slumber they appear to have been in for a long time.</P>
    <P>As I said yesterday, as far as Dublin is concerned, there were under construction at the end of September, aside from the Ballymun project, only 1,000 dwellings.  Of those, it is estimated that 278 would be handed over by approximately the end of this year, and in the years that lie immediately ahead, there is no programme to any great extent because of the activity, or inactivity, of the Department of Local Government for any great expansion of the production in that sphere.</P>
    <P>I said yesterday, and I remind the Minister again, that he repeatedly said that this project in Ballymun was to be supplemental to the local authority's programme.  It appears today that the project at Ballymun is in substitution to a great extent for this particular programme.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I might refer to another aspect of the Minister's statement.  The Minister is a very capable man, a man who can be very persuasive.  He evidently has persuaded a number of local authorities that they should introduce a differential rents scheme for existing dwellings.  But he referred to the standard of local authority houses in the course of this debate in column 51 of volume 224 of the Official Report and said:</P>
    <P>Far too many schemes have, in recent years, had to be entirely re-planned <Col N="635" /> because proposals were formulated on an over-optimistic basis in relation to available resources, and there has been a continuing tendency to submit proposals for house types which are too large or too elaborate to be economic for local authority housing.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to give us a little more information on what he means by &ldquo;too large or too elaborate&rdquo;. From my point of view, and I think from the point of view of any Deputy here, the essential purpose of a house, or any dwelling, is to provide adequate accommodation for the family living therein.  As I said yesterday, some 25 per cent of local authority houses built in Dublin in recent years are five-roomed. &ldquo;Five-roomed&rdquo; refers only to the number of rooms. They cannot, by any stretch of the imagination, be described as large. Having regard to the large families in the Dublin area, it is rather surprising that the Department is still think in terms of a superficial floor area of somewhere around 780 square feet as adequate accommodation for a growing family.</P>
    <P>If any efforts to secure the improved education of the children of this nation are made, if any efforts are being made to improve the standard of accommodation for them, surely one basic thing that is required is that these families have not only roofs over their heads, not only a number of rooms, but rooms in which they can have some degree of comfort? One can go out to the housing estates in Dublin and discover bedrooms which from wall to wall are occupied by two or three beds&mdash;four beds would not fit in any of them.  The possibility of these families living in any degree of comfort is limited by the size and inadequate nature of the dwelling.  I would therefore recommend that the Minister look at this question again of not only standard but size.  The standard of dwellings, as far as planning is concerned, may have improved in recent years.  The standard of material used and other <Col N="636" /> standards cannot be said to have kept pace with modern developments.</P>
    <P>I referred yesterday, when the Minister was having a deserved rest, to the fact that he felt he was being misrepresented on the question of rents. I repeat here today that it would be far from my desire to misrepresent him but he has indicated quite clearly and in no uncertain terms, by circular from his Department and otherwise, that, in his view, realistic rents should be enforced by the local authorities. That, of course, means by the city or county managers.  At column 58, volume 224, No. 1 of the Official Report of 27th September, 1966 the Minister said:</P>
    <P>I am, in particular, impressed by the fact that the Association of Municipal Authorities at their recent annual conference passed a motion, by a large majority, favouring the introduction of the differential rent system to all the local authority houses within the next five years.</P>
    <P>I do not know who gave any representative of Dublin Corporation authority to support a motion in these terms at the conference of the Association of Municipal Authorities.  I do not know to what extent the people who attended from the various bodies got a mandate from their respective bodies to do so, but it seems to me, without reflecting too much on that august body, that at times resolutions appear on the agenda and are passed at their annual meeting which are never discussed by the respective councils and for which the representatives have received no prior mandate.  As far as my local authority is concerned, I know no authorisation was given to any of its representatives to support a motion of that kind.  We are not entirely unimportant, having regard to the fact that there are some 20,000 corporation tenants on standard rents and a resolution of this character would mean that a policy was being adopted by elected representatives&mdash;not by the Minister or by the manager&mdash;whereby existing tenancies would have the basis upon which <Col N="637" /> their rents are calculated changed within a period of five years.  I would have very grave doubt as to whether any representative of any local authority who attended that meeting had any mandate to swallow this Departmental policy, because it is Departmental policy to apply differential rents, just as it is Departmental policy to apply increased rents.  The circulars to the managers make that quite plain.  Some of the managers have operated in accordance with the terms of these standards and have introduced increased rents, without the support of the local authorities.  That is the value the county managers are in our present system of local government.  They get certain powers which give them the right to override the expressed view of the elected representative.</P>
    <P>There is one further matter I should like to refer to.  It is the position of those families who have been prepared to consider entering into agreements to purchase homes for themselves.  As I said yesterday, much lip service is paid to these young men and women, shortly to be married, who are prepared to accept the burden of providing themselves with accommodation. In the early 50s, it was possible to obtain a dwelling for around a few thousand pounds.  It was possible to get money by way of loan or grant and we had a situation where young people would have to find no more than £100 or £150 as a deposit.  What is the picture today?  People contemplating house purchase today are faced with the problem of finding £500, £600, £700 or £800.</P>
    <P>The prices of these houses have gone up and, while the Minister talks about maintenance costs, we have never seen any great activity in his Department towards helping to keep the cost of these dwellings down.  The prices have gone up, and local authorities are entitled to make increased loans&mdash;they have even been entitled to increase the level of the supplementary grant&mdash;but have this Government given one half-penny more in hard cash to help these people?  They say they are fine citizens; they removed responsibility from the local authorities of having to provide <Col N="638" /> them with subsidised dwellings.  We are aware, of course, that to some extent people who buy their houses do get a form of subsidy by way of remission of rates or by way of State or supplementary grant from the local authority but there has been no adjustment in this to correspond with the increase in costs.  Consequently, the problem of these people is becoming increasingly difficult and all they get is a pat on the back.</P>
    <P>The Minister pats them on the back and says: &ldquo;You are a good little boy; it is a nice thing to save at tremendous sacrifice to yourself or your wife-to-be or, if you cannot save yourself, maybe get your relatives or friends to help you by making a loan of a couple of hundred pounds by way of deposit, but we do not propose to give you any more help; we will let the local authority do that.&rdquo;  Appeals have been made to lift the level at which loans have been made.  The gap between the loans payable by the local authorities and the amount required to purchase a house is very steep indeed.</P>
    <P>It is true that some of these people may apply to building societies or banks to get greater loans but, primarily, there is no additional help given as far as this Government are concerned. I am aware, of course, that at one stage it was indicated that the grant given&mdash;of £275, or whatever was the figure for these houses&mdash;was not primarily to help the people to buy their houses; it was to help the builders who were engaged in building construction.  Therefore, as it was felt that the builders engaged in building construction were now able to look after themselves, there was no justification for increasing the grant.  This is a matter to which I have adverted before and it is one which should engage the attention of the Minister.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, may I say that as a result of the Minister's circular, the City Manager in Dublin&mdash;and no doubt the managers of the various counties throughout the country&mdash;has already submitted proposals for an increase in the rents of tenants of local <Col N="639" /> authority dwellings.  There is no doubt whatsoever in my mind that these proposed increases are objectionable, that their concept is wrong, and that the intention to foist on the local authority tenants, or on the backs of the ratepayers, sums of money that would have been contributed by the Exchequer had the subsidy on house-building been continued as the increases arose in the cost of housing, is, to say the least of it, deplorable.</P>
    <P>The maximum price at which a subsidy is given is £1,650, whereas local authority houses are costing £2,700.  The result is that there is a gap of £1,000 and in the repayment of loans, the interest and everything else, either the tenant or the ratepayer will have to make up that gap.  It used to be operated on the basis of a three way system: the State, the local authority and the tenant; but the State has slipped out gradually and passed the burden over either to the tenant or the local authority.  The State is advising managers that they in turn should pass it over to the tenant. The Maximum price at which a subsidy is given on flats is £2,000.  The cost of a four-roomed flat in modern conditions is around £5,000&mdash;and for the life of me I do not know how that cost is worked out.  There is not a penny of State subsidy on the £3,000. It does not qualify for a single penny of State subsidy.  Yet we are told there is a contribution.</P>
    <P>May I recommend to the Minister that these matters should receive his attention?  When he is replying to this debate, he should enlarge somewhat on his remarks in introducing this Estimate on the cost and standard of dwellings.  He should tell us whether those remarks are to be taken at their face value and if, in fact, there is to be no improvement in the standard of of local authority dwellings in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be very brief.  I am sure that at this stage of the debate the Minister feels he should be given an opportunity to say a few words in reply.  I want to <Col N="640" /> bring to the attention of the Minister two local problems in particular which affect my constituency and that of the Minister's Parliamentary Secretary.  I would hope that in the course of his reply the Minister will deal with both these matters and endeavour to give the people concerned in Wicklow some hope and some satisfaction.</P>
      <P>The Minister will be aware that approximately 12 months ago the county of Wicklow was seriously affected by flooding which resulted from the weather we were having at that time, combined with a thaw as the aftermath of snow, and its action on some rivers in that constituency. Deputy Brennan, Deputy Everett and I were made acutely aware of these problems as they affected portions of the constituency.  At this point I want to raise with the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary the situation arising out of the flooding of the Dargle river at Little Bray.  The Parliamentary Secretary will be aware that the town of Bray was particularly hard hit as a result of the flooding.</P>
      <P>I had the experience of inspecting a number of areas which I do not think it would be an exaggeration to say were practically devastated as a result of the flooding a little short of 12 months ago.  As a result of the disaster which struck the people of Little Bray, there came into being a very active residents' association which has been in touch with the Parliamentary Secretary and the other public representatives in the area.  As I said, it is now practically 12 months since that disaster occurred there, and I think it reasonable at this stage to ask the Minister if he can indicate clearly to this House now, and to the people concerned in Bray, what steps have been taken by his Department, and what steps his Department propose to take to ensure that some permanent remedial work will be carried out to prevent a recurrence of this situation in the area of Little Bray.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that the Parliamentary Secretary has had representations made to him in this matter and that <Col N="641" /> he has been concerning himself with the problem.  What I should like to know now is whether anything definite has been done or whether there are any concrete proposals which the Department intend to implement in the near future.  We are coming now in the ordinary course of events into another period which might bring about, from a weather point of view, a recurrence of the conditions which existed 12 months ago.  It is a pity that in the 12 months which have elapsed some large scale remedial works have not already been carried out so as to prevent the danger of this flooding recurring and to allay the anxieties of the people residing in that neighbourhood.</P>
    <P>I have here &mdash; and I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary received a copy also&mdash;a copy of a report or news-letter issued by the Little Bray Residents' Association.  It deals with the outlook as the officials and members of the Association see it.  The report states:</P>
    <P>At the earliest the area can hope to be freed from the danger of flooding through the sewers in 1968.  If the projected sewerage scheme is deferred the present situation will continue indefinitely.  Given the health hazard, the extent of flooding and the fact that the Council's legal liability is involved, it is the Association's contention that the scheme, as far as concerns Little Bray, will have to be implemented without delay.</P>
    <P>It goes on :</P>
    <P>The condition of the Dargle and County Brook is very serious. Deterioration of the river bed in both cases has accelerated as a result of last year's floods, some of the breaches in the walls in the urban area are still unrepaired and the gaps at the &ldquo;slang&rdquo; are still unsealed.</P>
    <P>This is after 12 months.</P>
    <P>As early as 1964 a report by the Town Engineer pointed to the danger of flooding and to the bad state of the County Brook.  A report submitted to the Council on 8th October, 1965, by the consultants <Col N="642" /> then surveying the Dargle Valley stated &ldquo;in conclusion we would stress the urgency of carrying out remedial works as soon as possible, as the severity of flooding in the areas referred to will increase with time&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That is an extract from a report, a newsletter, prepared by the Association representing the interests of the people concerned, the people who were afflicted by the flooding and storm damage of approximately 12 months ago.  Deputies on all sides of the House no matter what constituencies they represent, particularly Deputies from some of the constituencies west of the Shannon who in their own constituencies have experienced similar problems from time to time, will feel sympathy with the plight of the residents of the Little Bray area and I think they would join with me in urging on the Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister the urgency of doing something concrete to prevent a recurrence of the type of disaster which befell these people 12 months ago.</P>
    <P>The second point I want to take up with the Minister is also a constituency one and one with which I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary is <i>au fait</i>, that is, the situation arising in Arklow in connection with the implementation of a tenant purchase scheme for the tenants of Arklow Urban Council.  The Parliamentary Secretary will be aware that there is a very active, energetic Arklow Urban Tenants' Association who have approached him, I am quite sure, and who have been in touch with me and with my colleague, Deputy Everett, regarding their desire to see a tenant purchase scheme implemented for the area.  I made representations to the Minister in the matter in the past few weeks and I understand other representations have also been made to him.  I am sorry to have to record here that so far as I have not received a reply from the Minister and I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to use his influence with his Minister to ensure that at least a reply of some sort is given to representations made in connection with this matter.</P>
    <P>The Tenants' Association informed <Col N="643" /> me that practically 350 applications have been made by people interested in taking advantage of the terms offered in a purchase scheme of 1954.  I am also informed that Arklow Urban Council decided by a large majority that the scheme should be implemented and so far as I know the position is that it is now with the Minister and the Department for decision.  I do not know if it will be feasible for the Minister to sanction the terms of the 1954 scheme but it seems to me that it is due to the urban tenants that a speedy decision should be reached by the Minister and his Department, and if they are not prepared to sanction the 1954 scheme, I suggest they should make clear to the Arklow tenants what terms they are prepared to sanction and, generally speaking, the conditions on which they are prepared to allow a purchase scheme to be implemented in the area.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Parliamentary Secretary&mdash;I am sure he knows it already &mdash;that the members and committee of the Arklow Urban Tenants' Association are people who are actively and energetically interested in this question. They are responsible people with a natural desire to own their own homes and to see their neighbours in the same position or at least have the opportunity of purchasing out their homes.  I am equally well aware that from the point of view of the Minister and that of the local authority there are very likely difficulties in the way that require to be ironed out and decisions that require to be taken regarding the price and conditions of purchase but the plea I am making to the Minister now is to regard this as a matter of urgency and to come to a decision one way or another.</P>
    <P>I think I am right&mdash;no doubt the Parliamentary Secretary or the Minister will correct me if I am wrong&mdash; that the matter is now in the lap of the Minister and that he will have the final say as to what sort of scheme will be approved.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary may be aware that I asked a Parliamentary Question about this before the Summer Recess but I accept his assurance that it is only officially with the Minister since the resolution was passed by the urban district council.  I am not trying to make the charge that the Minister has been delaying so far but I am urging that this matter concerns a great number of tenants in the town of Arklow and I think it is due to them and to the members of Arklow Urban Council that there should be no avoidable delay on the part of the Minister and his Department in coming first, to a decision on whether a tenant purchase scheme will be implemented and secondly, in regard to the terms of the scheme, whatever type of scheme he is prepared to sanction.</P>
      <P>I said at the outset that I would not take up the time of the House, that I was concerned to raise these matters which affect my constituency.  I shall not go back on what I said or make a general speech regarding the matters for which the Department of Local Government are responsible. There is just a small point I should like to mention in connection with the Minister's opening statement.  I mention it now because I raised it on the Estimate 12 months ago and possibly on a few other occasions.  It is generally in connection with the question of road safety and the steps taken by the Department in that field.  Some time ago I urged that in connection with speed limit zones the authorities should have the right to impose periodic speed limits.  I shall try to make myself clear by referring to the situation which obtains in Wicklow. It is a tourist county which, whether you go on the eastern coast road or on the western road by Poula-phouca and on through Baltinglass, during the summer months, particularly at week-ends, attracts very heavy tourist traffic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Up to some time ago it was possible to drive from Dublin to Arklow, if one went through Enniskerry, without ever passing through a limit zone, even though one stuck to the main road from Kilmacanogue. That has been remedied but there are <Col N="645" /> certain points in the county&mdash;this is true of other counties as well&mdash;which do not normally require speed limit zones but which have certain periods, for example, bank holiday week-ends and most week-ends during a fine summer, during which they need the additional safeguard and protection of temporary speed limits.</P>
    <P>As I understand the position, the present law on the subject does not allow for the imposition of what I would call periodic speed limits.  If I am right in that, I urge that the position be remedied.  It is not necessary for me to paint the picture for the Parliamentary Secretary who knows County Wicklow inside out.  He knows the routes and the roads which would benefit by having speed limits applied at least during the busy season.  I agree that during the off-season such limits might not be necessary but they are necessary during the season and that is why I should like to see the Government or the local authority, whichever is responsible&mdash;I think it is the local authority in conjunction with the Garda&mdash;being given the authority to say: &ldquo;In such and such a case, we shall impose a speed limit of 30 miles or 40 miles an hour from June to September.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I was a little alarmed by the remarks in the Minister's statement to the effect that the road markings and road signs regulations would be amended to permit further changes or variations in the markings on roads.  I am afraid that at present there is a great deal of confusion in some places because of the multiplicity of lines on the roads, whether double white lines or single white lines or double broken lines or single broken lines.  I appeal to the Minister to see to it that when this matter is being reviewed he should aim at simplicity, at some system which can be understood clearly by every motorist.</P>
    <P>This may have been remedied since I spoke on the topic previously but I have seen the situation on some roads throughout the country where it was very difficult to make out what was intended.  There may be double continuous white lines, a continuous white line, a double broken line or a single <Col N="646" /> broken line and in some cases, whether accidental or deliberate, one may find a third line, continuous or broken.  As far as I can recollect, the old system was that you had a continuous single line or a continuous broken line and the motorist knew that where the line was continuous he was not allowed to cross and where it was broken he could cross where it was safe to do so.  I urge on the Minister to aim at simplicity, at a system of road markings that can be understood readily and appreciated by all road-users.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to discuss the problems of the Dublin Deputies or to deal with their omissions. I shall try to concentrate on the positive parts of the Minister's statement and on one very important fact which the Minister made clear, that the allocations for local authority housing have gone up annually.  In 1964-65 the allocation was £6.8 million, in 1965-66 it was £9.9 million and in 1966-67 it is £11.75 million. That is a very important consideration. The second important matter is that we have now a definite target for the next ten years of from £12 million to £14 million, to be financed out of the capital resources available to the country.  We may have overdrawn on our capital resources but if so it has been done in a good cause.  We do not stand alone: we are not the only country in Western Europe to suffer similar experiences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The important thing is that the target is there now, our sights are set. This involves the preparation and the projection of short-term and long-term building programmes by local authorities and I was sorry to learn from the Minister's statement that only 36 out of 87 local authorities have sent in their programmes.  If they do not send in their programmes they may find themselves without money to finance their schemes later on.  In Athlone we have prepared ours and our figures are based on a programme covering the period 1961-1981.  Our scheme has been prepared on the basis of existing housing, allowing for houses which will be 100 years old in 1981, allowing for a one per cent wastage and taking <Col N="647" /> into consideration the normal building needed for rehousing.  We will have to build 944 houses of which the local authority will provide 644.  Then, taking into account the possible population growth, we must provide another 700 houses.  Therefore, the programme for Athlone aims at providing by 1981 1,700 houses through both private enterprise and the local authority.</P>
    <P>We have been told that only 36 out of 87 local authorities have sent in their plans.  My advice to the balance is to get on with the job.  If they do not, how can the Minister make his plans?  How can he decide what capital is needed?  How can the best utilisations of labour be made?  All these questions must be answered for the Government if they are to make a proper projection of their commitments. The Minister is concerned about costs.  If local authorities throughout the country have projections up to 1981 as we have in Athlone, capital can be allocated and accordingly local authorities will get certain reductions in costs.</P>
    <P>In the cost-cutting programme, I welcome the reference the Minister made to getting An Foras Forbartha to design a standard rural cottage.  He also referred to their activities in trying to devise standard components, which is very important.  Standard-size components, be they doors, windows or gutters, can be made in a factory and supplied to the builders. Houses can be built at a faster rate by this means.  A very good architect can provide fal-de-lals which make one house or one terrace of houses different from another, but the important thing is to cut the cost by having these components prefabricated.</P>
    <P>In urban areas we must also preplan and forecast water and sanitary needs for an increased population. Otherwise, we might find ourselves with more houses and not be able to supply them with these necessary services. In the light of this new programme, we shall have to increase the capacity of our waterworks or take some other necessary action.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="648" /> The most forward-looking part of the Minister's statement refers to the planning and programming initiated under the Local Government (Development and Planning) Act, 1963. In this connection I am very glad to see he is co-ordinating the activities of the three bodies, the National Building Agency, the National Building Advisory Council and Foras Forbartha, and, of course, of the local authorities.  It is most important that each planning authority does its job so that the area will be developed socially and industrially to its highest potential.  As far as the regional tourist boards are concerned, the local authorities are co-operating with them in mapping out amenity spots and in planning access roads to lakes.</P>
    <P>In this way Bord Fáilte can play its part in regional development.  Already Foras Forbartha have taken two regional sites and will take seven more. These are designated growth regions. The National Advisory Council will help in this regional designing, and Foras Tionscal will develop the industrial potential of various places.  If the planning authority does not do its job, if it does not fit in with the planning done by Foras Forbartha or the overall national planning, it will be left out in the cold and it will have nobody to blame but itself.</P>
    <P>These industrial estates will be the growth towns of the future.  This growth will spread to the areas surrounding them.  We must cease to be county-conscious in this House.  The region will extend maybe over two or three surrounding counties from the growth centre, whether the centre chosen be part of Roscommon, part of Longford, Athlone, Mullingar, or wherever it may be.  We must develop it to the utmost, attracting investment, employment, improving amenities, making it a good place to live in.  We must be conscious of the fact that the region is part of the country and that, consequently, the plans are not for the benefit of Westmeath, Roscommon or any other county in particular.  I must again congratulate the Minister on the forward-looking few pages, 80 and 81, which he has given us in his statement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate affords Deputies an opportunity of referring to the different aspects of local government, but it also affords us an opportunity of saying what we have to say about the innovation which took place in introducing a Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government.  I am at a loss to understand how the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary divide their duties in regard to taking care of their respective offices.  Taking into consideration the period of time we have had the luxury of a Parliamentary Secretary, we should now make up our minds whether it is a Parliamentary Secretary, we want or a Minister for Housing. The Minister's speech on this matter and indeed the situation that exists in relation to housing display the need for a Minister for Housing.  In saying that, I am not casting any reflection on the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary or commenting adversely on the ability of each of them to perform the tasks assigned to him, but I do believe the job is not being tackled in the proper fashion.</P>
      <P>There are many aspects of local government that are crying out for attention.  The situation is not new. It has been in existence for a long number of years, and it has been referred to by previous speakers, including members of my own Party. I am conscious of the situation in the Finglas area of my constituency. There is a road there called Sycamore Road which has not been taken in charge although it has been in existence for 12 years.  The people who reside there have yet to be afforded the amenities that go with the payment of rates, and they are on full rates.  This is a disgraceful situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a similar situation in regard to roads nearby.  In the Wadelai estate in Ballymun, which is within reasonable distance of the Finglas area, there are open spaces lying derelict.  The local residents are not allowed to attend to them, and Dublin Corporation are not in a position to do anything about them.  The property owners say it is not their responsibility. <Col N="650" /> Repeatedly we are told there is an Act for this and for that, but nothing is done about it.  The residents' associations in these two areas have been making representations repeatedly in regard to these estates but without success.  Ever since the houses were built in Cabra, and that is many years ago, there are still open spaces left lying idle.  We are constantly told there is no money to do anything about it.</P>
    <P>We often have the problem before us in Dublin Corporation that certain laneways need to be taken in charge.  A few years ago Dublin Corporation wanted to take laneways in charge but were told by the Law Agent: &ldquo;It cannot be done; it is not permissible&rdquo;.  Yet these laneways remain in a very bad insanitary condition.</P>
    <P>Complaint can also be made about the public lighting system.  In Dublin, the system is diabolical, particularly in the residential areas.  In many parts of my constituency there are roads and avenues on which the lights have been out for months and people are afraid to go out at night.  Some people have met with accidents due to the faulty lighting system.  In some places there have been attempts at assault owing to the lack of lighting.  When I made representations to Dublin Corporation about this matter a couple of years ago, I was told that the cause of this was vandalism and that the corporation would put in lights that would not break.  The situation remains the same.  The lighting system is bad.  It is particularly bad in the Cabra and Finglas areas.  Something should be done about it.</P>
    <P>In the final analysis, I suppose the real problem is the shortage of money. If that is so, the people should be told that the reason why they cannot have adequate lighting is the shortage of money.  If it is attributable to vandalism, we have a Garda force.  The Garda force do a fairly decent job. I am not at all satisfied that vandalism is the cause.  A colleague of mine, a Deputy of the Fianna Fáil Party, <Col N="651" /> lives on a road on which for a long time there has been no light.  I do not know why he has never complained about it.  I do not know why people want to remain in the dark.</P>
    <P>Complaint can also be made about the lack of provision of playing pitches for young people.  Quite recently a man asked me to assist him in getting the use of a handball alley situated in an old Garda barracks at the rere of Prussia Street.  He was told he could not have it as the residents would complain.  There was no complaint from the residents.  Yet, the Children are left without their handball alley. Then we talk about taking steps to ensure that our children will not turn into mods and what-have-you.</P>
    <P>I should like also to draw attention to the inadequate water supply, particularly in the Cabra area.  Last week the position was so bad that the residents of Cabra decided to stop paying their rents to Dublin Corporation.  I had been complaining on their behalf for over two years.  It is agreed that the water supply is inadequate and I was advised recently that the matter will be dealt with, possibly, when the new arrangements with regard to the Leixlip water scheme come into operation, which it is hoped will be in December next and that in the meantime the corporation, where possible, will provide water tanks for the use of the residents but they are warned that they must not drink the water from these tanks, which means, in effect, that, until December next, many people will not have a constant supply of drinking water.  It is the responsibility of the Minister for Local Government and Dublin Corporation to provide this service, if for no other reason, in the interests of public health.</P>
    <P>I should like now to say a few words about traffic regulations.  There are many outlets from the city of Dublin on most of which a 30 mile per hour speed limit operates but there are many roads within the confines of the city and leading out to the <Col N="652" /> country in long stretches upon which there is not a single sign indicating that it is a 30 mile per hour zone.  I submit that because of that there has been more than a fair share of accidents.  It must not be taken for granted that everybody is aware that there is a 30 mile per hour speed limit in certain areas.  I drew the attention of the Assistant City Manager to this matter.  He told me that every good motorist should realise that the speed limit within Dublin is 30 miles per hour.  That is not so.  For example, in Griffith Avenue, the speed limit is 40 miles an hour and that is within Dublin city.  I earnestly entreat the Minister to do something about the signposting of roads.  Perhaps, also, he will have a simplified version of traffic and road regulations produced and prevail upon Radio Telifís Éireann to publicise it?</P>
    <P>I listened to Deputy Moore adverting to the traffic position in the city of Dublin and commenting on the way in which pedestrians converage on the centre of the city.  Since the introduction of one-way streets in the principal parts of Dublin City, pedestrians in many cases have to take their lives in their hands when attempting to cross the road.  It has been suggested that the gardaí are particularly belligerent in regard to this matter. Sometimes it would appear that the gardaí are unable to see the pedestrians, or do not want to see them.  I do not know which it is.  This happens at various traffic points in the city of Dublin.  I would invite the Parliamentary Secretary to chance his arm and walk across the road, when there is no policeman on duty, from the corner of Parnell Square to Parnell Street and see how long it will take him to get across or how easy it will be to do so.  It is a very difficult exercise. The same can be said of an attempt to cross from the corner of Tara Street to the north side of Butt Bridge and from the various corners on O'Connell Street.</P>
    <P>Of course, I am unable to understand why traffic lights were erected <Col N="653" /> at the site of Nelson Pillar.  More often than not a guard has to stand out on the road to ensure that the lights do not operate.  There is a bottleneck in the Phibsboro area at Doyle's Corner.  Almost every evening around tea-time, one finds a sergeant and an inspector helping to regulate the flow of traffic.  We have learned that the Minister for Local Government has sanctioned the erection of a supermarket just around the corner. Heaven help us when that supermarket is erected.  The traffic position will be absolutely chaotic.  It seems to me that matters of this kind are not given serious consideration.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear other speakers emphasising the importance of traffic regulations.  I was wondering who exactly makes the arrangements.  Is it a matter proper to the Minister?  In part of my Dublin Corporation constituency, O'Devany Gardens, North Circular Road, I find that buses are travelling through a block of flats. The residents objected and suggested that the buses should go to the end of the North Circular Road, turn to the left and then turn back, as they always have done.  There have been a number of accidents.  Children playing on the road because they had nowhere else to play, were injured and a few months ago one child was killed.  Irrespective of representations that may be made in this matter, it would seem that CIE and the traffic regulating authority will have their way and the people will have to put up with it.</P>
    <P>I was pleased to hear some Fianna Fáil Deputies advocating the provision of public conveniences.  There is a great need for the provision of public conveniences, and not only in tourist areas.  It is very necessary that such amenities should be provided in the centre of the city and not only for the purpose of All-Ireland hurling or football finals.  They are necessary all the time.  Dublin is also a tourist centre.  We are told that in a short time the population will reach one million.  That is another reason for that type of service.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="654" /> Having regard to the possibility of the population reaching one million and having regard to the serious housing situation, we must come to the conclusion that insufficient drive is being put into solving the housing problem.  Dublin Deputies have stressed this and have stressed the importance of providing housing in the Dublin area.  There are 5,500 people on the approved waiting list in Dublin, 5,000 on the unapproved list and 3,000 on the newly-wed list. In addition, there are 2,000 people living in accommodation unfit for human habitation but who have not been so classified because the corporation have ceased to classify any house as being unfit for human habitation since 1963, when the first so-called housing emergency occurred.  From this it will be seen we have a considerable figure&mdash;15,500&mdash;to think about, not to mention the expected growth in population.</P>
    <P>What is planned in relation to housing? It is irrefutable, when you take into consideration what is being built at present and what is on the stocks, there is provision for only 7,600 houses and flats.  What are we going to do about the rest?  Has the Minister any positive intention of doing anything about the rest?  In the absence of such a positive declaration, I suggest the proper thing to do is to appoint a Minister for Housing.  There is no point in the Department officials producing targets and projections&mdash; dreams; that is all they are.  They will not satisfy the people in Dublin crying out for houses.  I am inclined to think that the people who make these targets and projections are living far removed from the circumstances at hand.  I would urge the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary to look around the city at the many houses unfit for human habitation but which, because they have not been yet described as dangerous, remain in existence.</P>
    <P>I know of a place off Charlemont Street, Keegan's Cottages, otherwise known as Masterson's Lane.  All the tenants are out of there with the exception of three families.  One man lives on his own; another man has a <Col N="655" /> wife and no children; and then there is a young man, his wife and four children.  They were told some years ago that the house was unfit for human habitation.  That was before 1963.  Then the houses fell in Fenian Street; an emergency was declared and the emergency is still on.  Those people are still living in accommodation unfit for human habitation.  The sanitary people say it; everybody who looks at it says it.  Indeed, only last week the landlord said he had no further interest in the property and had been told 12 months ago by the corporation they were taking it over.  The only conclusion I can come to is that there is no money available.  It would hardly be dereliction of duty.</P>
    <P>When thinking in terms of housing, we should bear in mind the system of allocation.  At present it is this.  A husband and wife and three children are being housed if they live in a single room or if they are living as sub-tenants in a corporation house with a total of 13 in the house.  The prospects of a change in this are not great if we take into consideration the families of four and even three and those families who unfortunately have no children.  If you have regard to the waiting list and regard to those not even on the waiting list, you must come to the conclusion that the people with families of four and three, and indeed five, have little or no hope of getting accommodation in the very near future.</P>
    <P>Many people do not realise how bad the situation is now.  The corporation are in such a bad way that, if a house is declared dangerous and there is a couple in it under the age of 50 and with no children, they will be made no offer because the corporation cannot afford to make one.  Then we have people being put out by speculators.  It is ironic to find the corporation looking for more space to build houses and flats and yet see in many parts of the city vacant sites acquired by speculators, who knock everything down and build instead flashy offices or expensive luxury flats. The situation is intolerable but there <Col N="656" /> is no denying it exists.  This is another good reason why there should be a Minister for Housing.  One does not have to exercise any great imagination to realise that some very sound houses have been demolished by speculators. They get on to a good thing and decide to cash in on the people's needs.</P>
    <P>I do not want to refer at length to the proposed rent increased in the corporation, which has caused a great deal of concern among the tenants.  In the main, the tenants are good, decent citizens.  It is not correct to assume that all of them could well afford to pay higher rents or buy their own homes.  An increase in the rent would undoubtedly bring about a demand for higher wages.  It would be a very inflationary measure.  I do not propose to weary the House with the details of the scheme, which have not as yet been approved.  Suffice it to say it requires the tenants to pay an increase of 300 per cent over five years and, in some cases, 500 per cent over five years.  Do not think for one moment that the workers are all in the one category.  I do not think the workers who live in these houses, no matter who they may be, can envisage that in five years they will get an increase in wages of 300 per cent or 500 per cent.  Already, Dublin Corporation have got their fair whack from the differential rent tenant.  For instance, in the recent £1 a week increase, one-sixth of the income is taken into consideration for rent purposes.  Obviously, they intend to do the same again.</P>
    <P>We in the Labour Party have had quite a good deal of inquiry about this matter from various associations, a number of which are non-political. They are genuinely concerned about the position and are at a loss to know whether or not the contract people entered into with Dublin Corporation has not been broken.  Various Ministers of State have urged restraint in expenditure.  There were pronouncements about the recent increase of £1 a week in wages.  The view was expressed that we should be careful not to start off looking for something <Col N="657" /> more: in other words, we should have a pause for at least two years.  Surely the same type of reasoning should be applied to corporation rents.</P>
    <P>Because of the manner in which matters have been put forward, corporation tenants find themselves concerned about the suggested purchase of their houses.  In that connection, a figure of £1,600 has been mentioned for houses built many years ago for about £500 and which undoubtedly do not provide the amenities that should go with a house calling for £1,600.  I am satisfied that there will be more about this later on and perhaps the Minister will relax the pressure which we understand he is exercising in relation to rent increases.</P>
    <P>In mentioning corporation houses and their amenities, it is only right and proper that it should be known that, down the years, Dublin Corporation have gradually reduced the amount of services by way of maintenance afforded to the tenant.  It is only in the case of very major jobs that they will come in and do something for the tenant.  I know of cases where, because of the instruction to keep down costs, many maintenance jobs have been left unattended for almost 12 months.</P>
    <P>When talking in terms of this housing problem, we cannot and must not overlook the fact that it applies to others besides people who are seeking to obtain Dublin Corporation houses or flats.  Many a young man and woman setting out to be married or who are married engage in the very laudable action of attempting to buy their own home but we find that those people are required to put down a deposit of £600 to £800.  They might as well be asked to put down a deposit of £6,000 or £8,000.  Before such people are granted a loan, care is taken to ensure that they have a sufficient income to meet the repayments on the loan and if there is not a steady income at a certain minimum level, then quite obviously we are dealing with people who are in need of housing.  Yet we have a situation in which this mad race continues. These people are going around from Billy to Jack trying to get a loan for a deposit on a house and then they must <Col N="658" /> get a loan for the remainder of the price of the house and at the same time, they are involving themselves in considerable debt in trying to furnish the house.</P>
    <P>It is true to say that a goodly number of these people, through no fault of their own, are living in abject poverty. True, there is a remission of rates over a ten year period but obviously this is not enough because when the ten years expire and they must pay full rates, the position is that their children are then just about ready to go on for further education, which is extremely costly, and, altogether, these people are really faced with a big problem.  Something will have to be done about this: whether it be by way of lending the deposit remains to be determined.  Certainly we shall have to do something to put an end to a situation where our people are being held up to ridicule and spectacle in the public eye.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister saw the <i>Evening Press</i> of Saturday, 1st October, 1966, which carried the banner headline on the front page &ldquo;Vigil in the Rain for Houses&rdquo;: &ldquo;All Night Wait in Dublin&rdquo;.  That referred to unfortunate people trying to buy their homes.  Fifty houses were available which will not be ready until 18 months' time but 150 people were looking for them.  This is only one instance of many such cases.  It says in this article that these people were waiting for two years.  It is bad enough that such an article should appear in one of our own newspapers but we read it in the English newspapers, too.  I have here a copy of <i>The People</i> of Sunday, 2nd October, 1966, in which there is a heading: &ldquo;All Night Queue to Buy a Home&rdquo;.  That is certainly wonderful propaganda for this poor old country of ours.</P>
    <P>I know that there has been much talk and complaint about it but I should like to ascertain if it is not possible for Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council to tell people who apply for loans what the actual position is and how long more they will have to wait before they can obtain a loan or a grant.  I am satisfied that every Deputy who represents <Col N="659" /> the county or the city of Dublin is inundated with that type of inquiry.  All the same, no matter what investigation one makes, the matter is left on the long finger.</P>
    <P>The time is long overdue when some advice or counsel should be afforded to intending house purchasers as there is a crying need for such a service.  I am referring now, in particular, to people who get loans from a local body.  People are so keen and anxious to get their hands on the deeds that they commit themselves to practically anything.  Few ever read what they are signing.  I am at a loss to understand why the local authority, the body which is lending the money, does not take special precautions to ensure that everything is correct.  In my experience, everything is not always correct.</P>
    <P>There is another matter in relation to housing, loans, grants and so on which affects Dublin city and county, that is, the absence of any reciprocal arrangement between the two bodies in relation to grants and loans.  A young man, a native of the city, with an address under the jurisdiction of Dublin Corporation, finds that his only chance of getting a home is by going into the county because the speculators within the city area who have the space are using it for luxury flats and mammoth office blocks.  The young man immediately discovers he cannot get the monetary assistance he would get if he were in the corporation area. This sort of thing has happened time out of number and it is time now that some solution was found to remedy the situation.</P>
    <P>With regard to the £1 per week increase for local government employees, there are at the moment some thousands of manual workers who have yet to get the £1.  It has been indicated to them that the £1 is there for them but it will be paid only from 1st June last.  That stand has been taken despite resolutions passed by numbers of local authorities, resolutions supported by Fianna Fáil councellors and, in some cases, sponsored by them, asking that the £1 be paid from an earlier date.  The County and City Managers Association, <Col N="660" /> the negotiating body with the trade unions, has stuck to the point that the £1 should be retrospective only to 1st June last in accordance with a Ministerial Order.  It has transpired that in some Departments, not many, small sections have got the increase from a date earlier than 1st June.  There is also evidence of that in the semi-State concerns.  There is no question of altering the £1 to 25/-. All that arises is the question of retrospection.  I appeal to the Minister to reconsider this matter and to sanction retrospection to 1st April last.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasOHara" hpid="Mr. O'Hara Mr. O'Hara">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>Judging by the Minister's opening speech, he seems to think he can convince this House and the country that all is well in his Department. He has certainly failed to convince me.  He has failed to convince many other Deputies, judging by the speeches made here.  He will not succeed in convincing the people in either the urban or the rural areas that everything is all right in his Department as far as money is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's Department is a Department with which a great many people have a lot of dealings.  They are very familiar with its workings. The Minister, in his speeches here and elsewhere, is trying to create the impression that all is well in his Department.  But he has failed in his endeavour.  Those who are waiting for loans and grants for new houses, for sewerage, for water supply schemes, and so on, are well aware of the position with regard to money for these projects.  It is a pity that a man of the Minister's ability should try that kind of thing on his own.  There are other Ministers who do not attempt to do that: they are honest and sincere and they say frankly the money is not there.  We had an example of that today at Question Time when the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, Deputy J. Gibbons, said he did not have money with which to go ahead with minor employment schemes.  I was very impressed by his answer.  He told the truth.  Surely, in the nation's Parliament, a Minister should be the first <Col N="661" /> to set the headline from the point of view of telling the truth?</P>
    <P>The Minister, too, here and elsewhere, has very often tried putting the blame for certain things on the local authorities.  He has tried to put all the responsibility on these bodies.  That is most unfair.  But people are well aware that he is doing that.  It is a shame he should descend to such mean tactics. To give an example, in Mayo we have planned sewerage, water, housing and various other schemes.  Like other councils, we have had to seek the assistance of technical experts, consultants, architects, and so on.  Planning has been done, perhaps not at the rate we would like, but at a pretty good pace certainly in my county.  We received certain reports from those whom we consulted.  These came before the council recently for consideration in the same way as did earlier reports over the years.  Some earlier schemes were undertaken when money was more plentiful than it is now.  In Foxford we have almost completed a sewerage scheme.  There are some odds and ends still to be cleared up.  I hope it will be possible to finish this scheme.</P>
    <P>In Mayo we committed ourselves to the figure of £62,000 odd in respect of consultants' fees.  It became known to everybody that the money was not there.  When we applied to the Department for sanction for loans for these schemes, it became known to everybody that the sanction was not forthcoming. Naturally when the consultants discovered this, they sent in their account to the county council for the work they had done up to that and the figure of £62,000 approximately, was passed by Mayo County Council to pay these fees.  This was to pay men who had done their work, who had examined the various proposals and made their reports but who could not go ahead with the schemes as the money was not available.  We were told by the County Manager and the County Secretary that that was the position.  We asked their advice but we knew ourselves what we would have to do, that we would have to pay these men for the work they had done, and we did pay them.  The proposals were sent to the <Col N="662" /> Department of Local Government but no sanction was forthcoming.  These facts are known to the Minister and to the officials of the county council and judging by the speeches I have listened to here, they are known to many other Deputies, particularly those who are members of local authorities.  Why then does the Minister come in here and try to give the idea that everything in the garden is rosy?  It is most unfair to do that.  That has been the experience of the county council and it seems to have been the experience of Deputy Mullen and others who have already spoken.</P>
    <P>We have a very high rate in County Mayo.  We always considered ourselves a progressive county and we have a rate of 82/- in the £, the highest rate in the country, certainly the highest rural rate.  Down through the years, in the interests of progress, we found it necessary to tax our people heavily in order to carry out many useful and beneficial schemes and it it true to say that many such schemes have been carried out in regard to housing, water, sewerage and so on. I would ask the Minister to bear in mind that this rate is a crippling burden on our people.</P>
    <P>In recent times the Archbishop of Tuam, speaking at a meeting of municipal authorities, pointed out that fact and suggested that something would have to be done for counties that find themselves in the same position as Mayo.  I suggest that generous assistance should be given to certain counties, particularly those in the western region, to the Minister's county, my county, and parts of Sligo and Galway. I would be happy to think that the Minister could find it possible to help these people by way of more generous grants, when money becomes available, in order to try to reduce the local rates.</P>
    <P>High rates are one of the main causes of people having to leave their smallholdings.  They know that if they build a new house or a new barn or other buildings, or add water or sewerage to their homes, they will be taxed further, and this is a deterrent to these people going ahead with such work. I know that the Minister understands <Col N="663" /> the problem because he comes from a county which in some ways is similar to my own.</P>
    <P>In County Mayo we are concerned very much about our roads, just as other counties are.  We have a very big mileage of roads and much of this mileage is over bog area where the foundations are poor.  In other instances roads are in mountain regions, such as in Achill or at Erris.  It is well known that such areas are daily becoming more popular from the tourist point of view and every year there is a noticable increase in the number of tourists going into these remote areas, some of which are served by only very poor sand roads. The Minister realises, as we all do, the importance of tourism in such areas and I would ask him to do what he can in regard to being more generous with grants to such areas.</P>
    <P>He is aware also that the minor employment schemes have closed down for the winter, that the rural improvement schemes have also closed and that employment is scarce and difficult to get.  This year many of our people who traditionally depend on county council work have had to go to England to earn some money.  If more money could be made available for the repair and maintenance of these roads, it would be of great benefit to people in these times of trial and difficulty.  I would ask the Minister to consider in particular the areas where the land is poor and where there is very little employment, areas such as the Fíor-Ghaeltacht, and to give such areas priority.</P>
    <P>We do not have the housing problem in my county that they have in Dublin, Cork or Galway, but we have been waiting for a very long time for some projects.  Last week some of the cheques were sent out&mdash;according to my information, about one-third of what would normally be sent out&mdash; and by the time the rest are sent out the sum total of the money available will have been used up.  I do not know what we are going to do.  We have no money to lend for new houses.  I would ask the Minister to consider the importance <Col N="664" /> of new houses for newlyweds, for people who want to get married, and for workers of different categories.  It is a very difficult situation when a local authority cannot get sanction for loans for housing.  Everybody will remember what happened in the case of the Westport Urban Council and also in Castlebar, and I think Ballina had a similar problem. I would ask the Minister to give special consideration to people in these areas who are trying to provide facilities for tourists for the farm type holiday and to be more generous with grants, even at the expense of better off counties.</P>
    <P>I asked a question of the Minister the other day with regard to the Achill water supply system and also the Newport water supply scheme.  I would ask him to try to give approval to these schemes because they are very important areas from the tourist point of view.  I meet those people very often in local development organisations. They are very enthusiastic about improving their houses, their hotels and amenities in order to attract tourists but there is grave anxiety in Achill at the present time that the Minister may long-finger the water scheme because of the shortage of money.</P>
    <P>The Minister should appreciate that a colossal number of tourists are attracted to Achill.  In fact, it is one of the most important tourist centres in Ireland today.  I would ask him to give priority to that area and also to consider Newport when considering Achill because it is on the way to Achill. Those areas should get priority and preference.  This is the extreme west of the country and anything in the way of tourism, afforestation or any other scheme that can help to keep the people there will be of great benefit.</P>
    <P>There is another matter which has become a hardy annual, the matter of grants which are due in the ordinary way for different purposes.  When requests for grants go in, they are often held up by the Department.  We have to go to the bank for money because of this.  Heavy interest has then to be paid and this has the effect of putting up the rates.  The local authority has to pay <Col N="665" /> interest charges when £18,000 or £20,000 has to be borrowed and it can be quite substantial on this amount of money.  This has gone on for many years, and not alone during the present Minister's time: it went on during the time of previous Ministers.  There is considerable delay in the payment of grants for roads and other purposes, with consequent serious hardship on the ratepayers of the country.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will consider the few points I have made and that in future he will have the courage and guts to come into this House, and that whether the truth is bitter or sweet, he will tell it because in the long run that is the best.  There are men sitting beside him on the front bench who certainly are not afraid to tell the truth, even when it is bitter.  The Minister would be better off if he told the truth, no matter how bad it is.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to take up Deputy O'Hara's last remark when he accused the Minister, of showing lack of courage.  The Minister, of all the Ministers in this House, who has shown the greatest courage is the Minister for Local Government.  He has overcome what was a very difficult situation and allocated the moneys that were available to him, wisely and well, and not alone maintained the figures of last year but in most cases exceeded them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one responsibility of the Minister's Department which has been referred to time and time again by many Deputies in the course of this debate and previous debates on the Estimate for Local Government.  I refer to the responsibility which the Department have for ensuring and maintaining a high degree of cleanliness and decorum on our highways and streets through the whole country.  I should like to add my plea to that of others and asked the Minister to do everything he can to promote a campaign against what I can only describe as indiscriminate dumping.  I suppose &ldquo;tragic&rdquo; is too strong a word but certainly it is a horrible reflection on the people in many parts of the country.  We often hear legitimate criticism by tourists with regard to this matter.  They have <Col N="666" /> those complaints to make especially at local level where we seem to show a toleration of ugly, unseemly or embarrassing dumps which despoil the countryside and roadways.</P>
    <P>There is one incident of this nature which infuriated other Deputies and myself from mid-Cork during the year. Representations were made to us by the people from the village of Raffeen near Monkstown.  They protested vigorously against the indiscriminate placing of a dump.  There was a horrible smell from this dump which was particularly annoying to those people.  The smell from it was inflicated on the nostrils of the poor villagers every day.  It was quite close to the roadway, which was a Sunday drive for the residents of Cork city, and which was looked on as a beautiful and scenic area.  Of course, this put an end to the day trippers and tourists, with certain loss to Monkstown and to Raffeen.  I went to see the dump and its squalor has to be seen to be believed.  Its contents range from motor car chassis to metal bottle caps and plastic containers and it is of course infested with rats.  Nothing, in my opinion, could possibly justify the locating of a dump in that area.  I would ask the Minister, if he has any powers in this matter, to have the dump removed to a more reasonable and more suitable area.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately this sort of situation does not end there.  I am in entire sympathy with the hotel proprietors, shopkeepers and numerous other people who have done everything in their power to make areas such as Bandon, Kinsale and Courtmacsherry more attractive to tourists.  Their efforts are completely hampered by the little hugs who deface and very often uglify the scenery and the amenities offered to tourists there.  The anti-litter legislation should unquestionably be enforced and I would urge the Minister to press on vigorously and earnestly with this in the present year.</P>
    <P>The rubbish disposal problem on the farm does not prove too difficult, because farmers usually use their own incinerators such as far barrels, and various other things like that, to burn their waste or they go to the trouble <Col N="667" /> of digging pits to bury it and thereby protect the health of their own families and that of the community.  The litter, rubbish and garbage problem in my constituency is pretty representative of what it is in rural Ireland.  Every year there is more and more waste to be got rid of, and there are no good solutions offered by the local authorities on how to get rid of this waste except to put up as many &ldquo;no dumping&rdquo; signs as possible.  If you put up these &ldquo;no dumping&rdquo; signs you must put up dumping signs as well.  The health authorities at national and local level will have to stir themselves to ensure that dumping facilities are made available. I think this would be a wise step to take immediately so that we will not look scared and foolish in the near future when we will have an increase in population and, therefore, a more acute problem.</P>
    <P>This is the time to tackle the problem and to try to alleviate it in some way.  I know definitely that Board Fáilte are receiving dozens, and indeed bagfuls, of letters from tourists complaining about the state of the countryside which arises from people not looking after their areas properly.  I am aware also that this problem is not easy to solve or to terminate.  My own suggestion on it would be that villages and towns should get together under the Department of Local Government and try to buy an incinerator on wheels, or something like that.  I do not know that whether that is the solution or not but it is the only one I can offer. It is very important to get something done quickly about this.</P>
    <P>In July, 1964 the Minister launched the National Institute of Physical Planning and Construction.  It is a new and promising partnership formed between in the Special Fund of the United Nations and the Irish Government. The primary role of the partnership was to carry out research and training in physical planning on the roads, traffic, building and construction.  The United Nations sent over Mr. Patrick McCarthy, a Harvard-trained city and regional planner, to take charge of the United Nations side of the project. <Col N="668" /> Four other United Nations experts came along, together with a man from Britain who was a well-known man in the setting up of the new towns programme in Britain which was started in Cumbernauld in Scotland.</P>
    <P>In my opinion, there is every need for an organisation as professionally equipped as this National Institute of Physical Planning in Ireland because Ireland is rapidly changing its pace. More and more buildings are going up and more and more things are happening generally in construction throughout the country.  I am sure every Deputy will agree with me when I say that physical planning will play an important and major role in the efficient and proper management of the change we will see in this country. The aim would be, I imagine, to initiate the development of new techniques within the framework of physical planning for the building and construction industry.  It would also involve the management of road traffic, the study of the population movement and also the location and development of housing and amenities as well as the provision of services.</P>
    <P>All these should constitute carefully assessed and scientifically developed programmes.  One aspect of the Institute's work which should have far-reaching and enriching results would be the prototype regional study of city and county planning which has been developed by the Institute.  It is hoped that through the efforts of such a plan a series of regional county and city model planning will emerge and that a supreme planning structure will be developed which will be useful in planning for the rest of the country.</P>
    <P>The most noteworthy feature of the Institute's work is the preparation of manuals on all aspects of planning&mdash; road traffic, demography, community services, and so on.  But more important still, work and research into the building regulations and all aspects of rural housing should be vigorously undertaken immediately because all these will constitute an eminently important reservoir from which to plan in the future.  This reservoir could be tapped and very useful information perhaps <Col N="669" /> got there.  All of it is an exciting and heartening development and I think the most heartening part in the whole aspect of this type of planning is the enthusiasm with which the architects and the engineers at the various conferences and seminars of this Institute greet these proposals and innovations. The time is fast arriving when haphazard and indiscriminate erection of buildings and crude planning will exist no more.</P>
    <P>I think we were very fortunate that the United Nations decided to pick Ireland as the research ground for this experiment.  I think we are probably in the unique position in that we are 50 per cent urban and 50 per cent rural. Almost everywhere else in the world mechanisation has lessened the numbers in agriculture and is causing quite a dilemma for the man employed in agriculture.  The decision that faces us now is a decision that will face many countries in their change from an agricultural economy, such as we have in Ireland, to an industrial economy. Fortunately for Ireland, this changeover will take place within the framework of the Planning Act passed in 1963.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies have already referred to the housing situation.  There is no doubt housing still remains first on our list of current social problems. There is no area, in my opinion, of Irish life which engenders more heartbreak and grief than the housing situation. I think Deputy Mullen put it well when he described some of the houses he had been through in areas in which nothing was done about re-housing these people.  That is not to say, of course, that there have not been vigorous and dramatic advances in the past six or seven years but I think we all realise that much remains to be done. Every Deputy can bring to this House instances of overcrowding and cramped living conditions but the alleviation of the problem of these poor people does not lie in the petty and derisive catcalling of some of our Opposition Deputies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney) Neil T. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>When I left off last night on this particular matter, I had said that there are at least three different types of situations that I feel have to be dealt with in regard to these unfinished estates; or three classes of problems within the overall problem which need to be looked at.  I would consider the first of these three to be developments of an amenity nature which have not been completed by the developer, even though prescribed in the original planning permission.  In so far as that particular situation is concerned, I do say that the law we have is sufficient until it is proved wanting to have these developments carried out.</P>
      <P>The second class I would mention are the amenity developments of various kinds which are obviously required for the benefit of the public who live in these estates but which were not prescribed in the original planning permission granted to the developer.  In this case, I do not believe we should, could, or that it would be desirable to amend the law so that the developer could be nailed down to do works of which he had no knowledge when doing the estate and which will now cost him money which he may not have.  Even if he has the money, he did not budget for it in his original development programme in relation to that estate and these cases must be dealt with out of the public purse.  That is the feeling I have about that second situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then there is, generally, a third group which might fall out of either the first or second group, where, again, the estate is unfinished&mdash;things missing and in such a condition that they are intolerable in so far as the public who live there are concerned.  Even if they might fall within the first category, that is, prescribed works which should have been done according to the original planning permission but have not been done, the situation now <Col N="671" /> is that the developer, or his heirs or representatives are no longer identifiable or, in other cases, even though identifiable, are no longer solvent. They may be bankrupt or the company may have gone out of existence.</P>
    <P>One way or another, we have these cases relating to the first point I made and we have the developers, or those we can recognise as carrying responsibility, but who are insolvent or bankrupt for one reason or another. We could nail them down but they cannot do the work because they have nothing with which to do it.  In that case, I cannot see that we can reasonably expect the public who are suffering as a result of this situation to be left in the present state.  Again, I think it must fall to the public purse to provide what has been omitted or neglected, for whatever the cause in the past.</P>
    <P>These three main groups are the headings under which one must look at the situation.  I feel that what I have said as to how generally the three situations must be dealt with would probably be regarded as the only reasonable way in which they can be approached.  Statements made here during the discussion so far&mdash;I do not know by whom but I gathered this from the discussions&mdash;would seem to imply, without being particularly specific about it, that, for instance, in the case of an estate not taken over, certain services were not being rendered by the local authority merely because of the technicality that the estate had not yet been taken over.  But the taking over of the estate, in my estimation, has nothing whatever to do with the effectiveness of the services which could be rendered, should be rendered and are being rendered to other citizens of this city and throughout the country by other local authorities. I may be wrong in what I have gathered, that refuse collection is being neglected or not done in some of those areas.</P>

      <P>I am glad, because my information would not bear that out, <Col N="672" /> but the inference I gathered here was that this was being made as a point. The sweeping of roads&mdash;is that being done?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>No; they are not being swept.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, they should be swept and there is no reason in the world why they cannot be swept.  From inquiries I have made, as a result of the impressions given here last night, I believe that Dublin Corporation have decided to provide a sweeping service, but do not ask me when they will implement this.  The county council do not provide this service.  I do not know whether they may have decided recently to provide it but my information is that they do not at the moment and that the corporation have decided to provide a sweeping service in these unfinished estates, pending their taking over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister say that the law requires them to do this now?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no law to prevent them doing it.</P>
      <P>The matter of bus services not being provided by CIE here in the city and county is one which, I understand, is, in fact, the case: they are not being provided with bus services in these estates which have not been taken over.  Again, there is no law preventing bus services from being provided, nor am I aware that the local authorities are in any way preventing the buses being provided, but that the decision is a matter for CIE. In fairness, though, to CIE probably I should add that CIE are concerned in regard to their public liability obligations if they run buses to private estates.  This is their decision and it is not for me to say what I think their decision should be.  But I will say this with regard to the roadways, whatever condition they may be in, if they are in a condition capable of taking a public service vehicle or bus, then the position, to my mind, is that these are rights of way which the residents of these estates enjoy and it seems peculiar to me that a public transport company does not provide a service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="673" /> They do defend themselves by saying they are afraid of their public liability obligations.  Maybe I am making a little out of what may be a real difficulty to them but quite obviously there is, to my mind, a great deal of hairspliting in a decision which leaves our public without buses in these estates, where the roads are capable of taking buses, and where all other sorts of vehicles traverse the area in the provision of other services. I think there is a lot of hairsplitting in the decision not to provide buses and that hairsplitting is obviously not being done by the local authority but by CIE.</P>
    <P>Telephone kiosks were mentioned here.  My information is that the Department of Posts and Telegraphs do not refuse to instal private phones or public telephone kiosks simply because an estate has not been taken over.  I understand that if they do not provide them, it is for other reasons, policy reasons or whatever they may be, and not merely because the estate has not been taken over.  It is necessary for them, in putting private or public telephones into an estate which has not yet been taken over, to get wayleaves for laying their lines or putting up their poles or whatever it may be.  Taking it all around, I do not imagine they encounter any great difficulty in getting wayleaves from estate owners well in advance of the take-over.  Perhaps there are some cases, but I am not aware of them.</P>
    <P>The question of rat infestation of untended dumps in these estates is one that the local authorities in the city and county will deal with if complaints are made.  That is what I am told, and I regard it as proper procedure that they should attend to these complaints if and when they are made.  Again, I am assured on this matter that if this service is not given in any case, and if it happens to be on an estate which has not been taken over, it is not because it has not been taken over. That is what I am told.  It is proper that that should be so.  The non-taking over of an estate should not in itself in any way inhibit a local authority from giving this service.  In <Col N="674" /> Dublin city on receipt of a complaint of rat infestation&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of the existence of dumps they cannot control it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>And open ditches in which stagnant water lies and which have not been properly piped by developers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>If a complaint is received that dumping constitutes a health hazard&mdash;and I think in a builtup area it usually leads to that; it may not be so at the beginning but it is not very long until it gets to that stage&mdash; whether it be in the city or the authority I am informed that the local authority are prepared to deal with it.  If dumping constitutes a health hazard, that is what hangs there.  I am told it will be remedied if a complaint is made on these grounds and if these are sustainable.</P>
      <P>Flooding is part of the matter to which Deputy Dunne referred just now &mdash;blocked drains, inadequate drains and open drains.  Flooding is caused by many things and, without doubt, flooding has occurred in some unfinished estates.  This has been stated to be due to developers interfering with the natural drainage of the area and not making any corresponding provision for a run-off of the water.  It may be true that flooding has been caused by the negligence or otherwise of developers.  What exactly is the position in these cases I am afraid I have no idea, because each case of flooding on these unfinished estates may not have been brought about by similar causes and there may be no true analogy between any two of them. Each would have to be examined on its merits to find out where liability may lie and in whose hands the remedy lies to relieve it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the information which I have received from the local authorities, I think that as of now and for the future, it is true to say that there is a tightening up in the two areas in particular in so far as the unified planning of their areas is concerned, and the insistence in so far as planning permission for <Col N="675" /> future private development is concerned that in these planning permissions there will not be any loopholes left in the condition attaching to them. As a result of this the effectiveness of the section that is complained of here and now in regard to pre-1963 planning cases will not arise in the future or if it does it will be much more clear than was the case in the past.  In some cases they were too loosely worded, or lacking in clarity, or remiss in some of the essential things that should have been dictated to be put in.  Overall, the situation would seem to be that the law is all right for the future.</P>
    <P>Deputy Clinton mentioned that there were about 30 cases of unfinished estates in the county.  I do not want in any way to dispute that figure with Deputy Clinton.  He knows his area well.  My information is that there is not anything like that number of unfinished estates in the county area, and that it is much more likely that it could be boiled down to about one-third of that figure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I got that figure yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>There may well be a difference of approach in regard to what is an unfinished estate.  Indeed, some of the cases may be more related to complaints than to reality and this may make up the difference.  I understand that ten are giving trouble and not the 30 that Deputy Clinton quoted.  Whether the number is ten, 20 or 30 does not materially alter the picture.</P>
      <P>I shall finish as I began.  In regard to the existing cases I am advised&mdash; and, indeed, I advised the House when we were passing it&mdash;that the law is adequate to follow these cases in so far as the law is capable of following cases.  The only way that the law can really be disproved is by a determination of the courts, and until it has been disproved, the law is there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The local authorities who are given power under the sections we have under discussion should invoke that law, and if they find that the interpretation of the courts does not bear out <Col N="676" /> what we passed here and subscribed to here with stated intention at the time.  I will come back to the House, and I am sure I will have the full Agreement of the House, to amend the law and bring it into conformity with what was our stated intention and is my stated intention now to deal with unfinished estates, to bring to heel developers who are negligent and who do not do what they are obliged to do under the terms of their planning permission, and to see to it that people who have gone to live in these estates do not have to continue much longer living in circumstances which are far from what they were led to believe would be the conditions in the estate when they entered into a contract to purchase a house.</P>
    <P>That is the intention of the movers of the motion and it is my intention. The local authorities can invoke the law and we do not think it right that they should fail to invoke it and plead as a reason for not doing so that their legal adviser says the law does not mean what we here in this House believe it to be.  Until it is decided whether the legal adviser there is right or we are right, we would not be correct in coming to this House to make an amendment even in conformity with our wishes.</P>
    <P>The other point is that if the local authority, even at this stage or later, failed to invoke the law specifically put there for them in the public interest, I feel it would not be proper to amend the law so as to enable aggrieved individuals or groups of aggrieved individuals to take action against the local authorities to compel them to operate the law in order that they would secure their rights.  However, if that approach is necessary, I feel it should be dealt with rather by amending the planning laws, somewhat corresponding to the section in the housing laws recently passed, so as to give the responsible Minister, acting on behalf of the aggrieved persons, the right in certain circumstances to go to a local authority or call on them to do a job.  If they did not do it, he would be empowered to do it for them and apportion the cost where it belonged. Instead of thinking in terms of amending <Col N="677" /> the law to make the local authorities invoke the present law, I think it would be better to give the power to whatever Minister is responsible rather than give a right to the public individually or collectively to take action against local authorities to compel them to invoke the law on behalf of these aggrieved people.</P>
    <P>To those who are sponsoring this measure I say that I am in no way against what they state as their intentions and wishes in regard to this Bill but first I do not see that this Bill would improve the situation and secondly, I do not believe this amendment is necessary.  Therefore, although I agree entirely with all that has been said on the matter generally, I cannot subscribe to the idea that we should in fact change the law until we have had a try at the people who should invoke the law that is there at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister's point of view that until the efficacy of the law has been disproved, we must accept that it is valid, but at the same time the sponsors of this Bill have given an opportunity to Members of the House and of local authorities to express themselves on a matter which has become almost an obsession.  It is not something new: this business has gone on for many years.  I recall that in the days of the old district councils they got round the problem by putting up notices on roadways stating : &ldquo;This is not in charge of the Pembroke Council&rdquo; or &ldquo;This is not in charge of Rathmines Council&rdquo;.  Nobody questioned that then.  The public will not accept things as easily now.  Some years ago we were so hard pressed by residents of newly-developed areas to finish the work on the estates that we decided in one or two cases to do the work ourselves.  We were then warned by the legal officer that we were doing something that was not within our rights to do and that we might possibly be surcharged for it.  We dropped it right away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is that frustrating experience where one sees something should be done by the developer that has not been done.  In the case of one estate in my own area, the developer is many <Col N="678" /> years dead and his wife has no money to carry out the work.  The corporation say the developer must do this work but there is no hope of this unfortunate woman being able to pay for the work if it were carried out. Just like the Minister, I agree that the local authority should carry out the work.  The public may have to pay for it but they have to pay for all services, and if the local council was at fault in not ensuring that an estate developer finished the estate, there is no use in perpetuating the results of their own laxity by making other generations suffer for it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Clinton, I think, mentioned the sweeping of roads.  Surely, in that case, if residents are paying rates, they could invoke the Sanitary Services Act which would force the local authority to clean up the place so as to avoid a health hazard.  As regards the Department of Posts and Telegraphs refusing to erect kiosks. I think they may refuse but not because the estate is unfinished but because the kiosk would not be an economic proposition.</P>
    <P>The Planning and Development Act was sorely needed and has taken us a great stride forward but we get back to the point as to how the local authorities use the full power of the law in order to have estates completed or have some glaring public grievances removed.  I find in this city that when you try to force an issue, you will be told by the legal advisers that, in their opinion, you are going outside your powers in what you propose to do.  No layman in the council will fight the law agent and his opinion is accepted meekly or otherwise and the person concerned says: &ldquo;I have done my part.  That is all I can do&rdquo;.  In this city we have 43 unfinished estates, small and large, and a number of these have been undeveloped for over 50 years.  One estate not very far from here was built by a developer over 50 years ago but he never finished the approach road to these houses and it is still unfinished today.</P>
    <P>When the Ground Rents Bill becomes law, it may have a great effect on this matter because very often the <Col N="679" /> developer is also the ground landlord. If he feels he will lose his right to ground ownership, he may sell out and thus make things easier, but until we reach the point when the legal advisers of the Department and the local authorities see eye to eye on these things and say: &ldquo;You can go ahead with all the force of law behind you to force developers to finish estates, whether new or old&rdquo;, I cannot see us making much progress.</P>
    <P>In Dublin Corporation this question arises very often and when the members in unison cry out to the manager to do a certain thing, he will quote the advice of the Law Agent that it cannot be done.  Although the Act is almost two years in force now, I do not think Dublin Corporation have yet prosecuted anybody for not getting planning permission.  I wonder why they are holding back since two glaring cases have been given to them.  There has been no prosecution.  The Minister might well consider sending a memorandum to local authorities on this matter informing them of the legal opinion of the Department on what they can do and cannot do.  That might strengthen the arm of the local authority and get some progress made under this excellent Act.</P>

      <P>Although I agree with quite a lot of what the proposer and seconder of this Bill have said as regards what they hope to achieve by this measure, I think that under the existing legislation the Minister should be able to go part, if not the whole of the way, in dealing with quite an amount of those troubles concerning estates.  The local authorities can deal with them to a large extent.  The reason they have been a bit slow is that the Housing Act is a particularly lengthy one which took a long time to go through the House.  It contains some very lengthy sections to a much greater extent than any other Housing Act for which the Dáil has been responsible. The result is that it is very slow to implement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>County managers, through their association, must examine the provisions <Col N="680" /> of the Act to be quite certain of their implications, particularly in relation to the town planning provisions. The interpretation of the Housing Act varies from county to county: some counties try to interpret the Minister's intentions in the Act while others endeavour to carry out the letter of the law.  County officials will have to get together to see how the Act will be implemented in the various regions. Therefore, particular local authorities have been slow in insisting on the completion of vacant sites in estates, a job which the Bill now before the House seeks to impose on them.</P>
    <P>I suggest to local authorities that in connection with the Tidy Towns Competition they should encourage people to clear up eyesores, to sow flowers and to tidy up open spaces generally.  I have seen this happen to a great extent in Newbridge, the largest town in my constituency.  Newbridge, consistently during the past few years, has been chosen first and second in its section for towns with a population of more than 5,000.</P>

      <P>I am not familiar with the position of housing estates in Dublin but in Kildare I know there has been considerable private development and efforts have been made to get local authorities to take such estates over for maintenance purposes. They have built a very nice estate in Naas and another in Athy.  Kildare County Council have been among the first in the country to develop a site for private building.  As I have said, there is power in the Housing Act to have these estates taken over by the local authorities so that they can be fitted into the general pattern of the towns in which they are located from the point of view of decoration and public services. Therefore, we should think twice before enacting this Bill.</P>
      <P>With sufficient time, the difficulties will possibly be ironed out, and if there is need, the Minister will be able to come before the House and also bring other matters that will come to light. It would be foolish to bring in a Bill at this stage when there is the possibility of remedying other flaws that may appear in a year or so.  It takes a long time to get a Bill through here, and there are many very important Bills on the stocks waiting to be introduced. It would be better to see how the present Act operates, and possibly the Minister will be able to deal with the situation under existing legislation.</P>

      <P>While I praise the motive behind this Bill and appreciate the sincerity of Deputy Dunne in starting what he believes to be the real problem of many of the residents in these developed areas, possibly he has not given sufficient thought to the adverse effect which the implementation <Col N="682" /> of such a Bill could have on future development. Legislation at all times must be given the gravest thought, and certainly retrospective legislation, which in effect this would be, is something that should be weighed more than seriously.</P>
      <P>Is it fair to penalise at this stage the enthusiasm and enterprise of people who 20 or 30 years ago pioneered to a great extent the development of housing areas in this city and throughout the country?  What was passed as adequate then would not be in today's terms considered adequate, nor would it be the concept of what it would be reasonable to demand in the future. However, if we acquiesce in Deputy Dunne's Bill, we shall find ourselves in the invidious position of penalising, as was stated here, the widow of the contractor or the developer who, at that time, was affluent and speculated his money on this praiseworthy object, developing houses for our people, and whose widow now finds herself in reduced circumstances.</P>

      <P>With so many Deputies very vocal last week and this week on the need for housing and the further development of housing, it would not be praiseworthy to bring in retrospective legislation in condemnation of the people who did so much in the past in regard to housing.  I appreciate Deputy Dunne's point of view.  I am familiar with many of the problems he has mentioned.  Be it known to him there are many Tipperary and Waterford people living in some of these developed areas in Dublin city and county who are not too pleased with the amenities offered to them at present, but there is a very easy solution for that.  First of all, if the local authorities took unto themselves the courage <Col N="683" />&mdash;and that is all they really need&mdash;to implement existing legislation, many of the defects which are now highlighted would never make the floor of this august assembly.  There is a lot of running for shelter at times on the part of local authorities, which is to be deplored, and I am sure I would have the Deputy's support in such condemnation.</P>
      <P>Developers can exploit the needs of people in regard to housing.  Very few applicants for a house on a new estate will take time off to study the small print and the addenda to the various contracts and agreement papers which they sign.  In Sutton park, for instance, when the people in occupation of the houses there discovered that the dividing walls between the various houses were not erected and that the developer had specifically eliminated any liability on him to provide such walls, each householder there had to provide the dividing wall at his own expense.  This would not have arisen had they either jointly or separately engaged a competent legal adviser to examine the documents they were signing and to explain in full detail to them the contents thereof.  The average person who takes up a legal document sees phrases like &ldquo;the party of the first part&rdquo; and by the time he has read four lines down he is completely confused and he says: &ldquo;I presume it is all right&rdquo;.  Very few take the trouble to consult proper legal authority on the subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I say, I appreciate Deputy Dunne's concern but we could be accused of hampering rather than helping future development if we accept his proposal.  Of all the sources of livelihood in the country the building industry is one of those which carry the greatest risk.  People who have been developers even ten years ago no longer have their names among the list of contractors and developers today.  This is something we cannot run away from.  At this stage it would be impossible, even with legislation, to extract money where none exists. Many of these developers have gone to the wall and it would be merely throwing good money after bad prosecuting and persecuting impecunious people.  I would ask the Deputy, therefore, <Col N="684" /> to withdraw the Bill and, in its stead, to give some thought to the fact that local authorities could be activated into more responsible action in the pursuance of their fundamental right to safeguard the interests of the people.</P>

      <P>I think it incumbent on me to praise here a developer in my constituency, the firm of Hally and Sons, who have privately built more houses in the county of Tipperary and developed more schemes than any other developer is doing at present in the building industry.  The Bill is a slight and a reflection on those engaged in the contracting business who, at no small inconvenience to themselves and at great risk to their capital, invested in housing.  The return is rather slow; the involvement of capital is immense.  Many of them with greater security, could quite easily have invested in gilt-edged securities and not have provided the amenity of a new home for another person and another family.</P>

      <P>A great deal has been said about unfinished estates, the bad condition of roadways, bus services, refuse collection, telephone kiosks, <Col N="685" /> public lighting.  All these matters have been referred to here this evening.  If there is a doubt in the mind of anyone about section 35 of the Principal Act, there is a simple way to test the matter. The matter can be tested through the courts.  In the case of certain legislation in the past, the threat that its validity would be tested in the courts has been made.  In some cases the threat was never implemented.  In the present case there is a simple scope and an ideal opportunity to test section 35 of the Principal Act.  If it is contested and found to be defective, the Minister has indicated that he is prepared to have the matter rectified in accordance with the desire of the Members of this House.</P>
      <P>At times the question of unfinished estates has been used as an excuse for the bad condition of roadways and so on.  The condition of roadways that have been taken in charge is sometimes bad.  The fact that the condition of a roadways is bad is not necessarily an indication that it has not been taken in charge.  In the case of a roadways in my constituency, Greenlea Road, Terenure, five or six developers are responsible.  This road has not been taken in charge for the past 14 years and it is still not in charge.  That is a matter of grave concerns to all the representatives of the area.</P>
      <P>It strikes me that unfinished estates have been a source of joy and pleasure to some of the representatives who now complain about them because they were able to put down questions in regard to them day after day and week after week in order to get publicity.  Unfortunately, it would seem that some of these people are now trying to cut their own throats.  I believe that this Bill was introduced for very different reasons from those expressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister has stated, there is a very simple answer to all this.  Let the movers of the Bill contest section 35 in the courts and if they do not want to do so, they have friends who could test the section and then the Minister has assured us that the matter will be remedied to the satisfaction of all.  Throughout the years there has been an amount of confusion in the <Col N="686" /> minds of local representatives who are guided by the law agent of the local authority.  In Dublin Corporation, the Law Agent's advice has been obtained on very many matters.  I am not so sure that he is always that correct. Nevertheless, we have to accept the advice he gives.</P>
    <P>There is the question of <i>cul-de-sac</i> laneways that were not in charge.  The corporation decided to develop these <i>cul-de-sac</i> laneways.  Legal action was threatened and the Law Agent indicated that we could not proceed to develop laneways which were not of general public utility.  There are very many portions of estates that have not been completed.  The law Agent's decision which terminated development was never really challenged. Now we are assured that the necessary provision exists and if that provision is challenged, as it can be challenged, we can have another look at the matter and I am quite sure that a very different picture will evolve.</P>
    <P>There seems to be some confusion in the minds of the movers of the Bill.  No doubt, they are anxious to see unfinished estates developed, just as we all are.  Now that I have listened to the Minister I will undertake to have matters on which decisions have been made in the past re-examined with a view to seeing if at this stage the Law Agent is prepared to alter previous decisions so that we can complete unfinished estates.</P>
    <P>Everybody agrees that unfinished estates are an eyesore and a grave source of inconvenience at times.  I believe that to local representatives have been in some way responsible for the position that exists at the moment and that has existed in the past.  As Deputy Moore indicated, the necessary cover is available to finish estates as the builder progresses with his development and the necessary financial backing is available to ensure that roadways will be completed.  Contractors are bounded or there is a deposit of one kind or another.</P>
    <P>Our laxity in the past may have brought about the present position. I may be held responsible for the condition of roadways that have been <Col N="687" /> developed since I entered public life about 12 years ago but some of the people concerned now were in public life before that time and must accept greater responsibility.  I am sure that the blame for some of these unfinished estates can be laid at the door of the persons in public life for the last 20 years.  Dublin Corporation have swept roadways and have collected refuse on roadways that are not in charge.  They have been doing that since I came on the council.</P>
    <P>The question of bus services is very important.  CIE are using the fact that a roadway is not in charge for the purpose of evading their responsibility to provide a service.  We know that those who plan the routes have very set ideas.  Even if all the roads not in charge were taken in charge in the morning, CIE would not run buses on them for a long time.  Services essential to an area are often denied by organisations and groups.  I am glad therefore of this opportunity to express disappointment at the failure of CIE to provide service in certain areas.  This excuse of unfinished estates is no longer valid. A fresh effort should be made to provide necessary services lacking at present.</P>
    <P>Telephone kiosks were mentioned. Kiosks were erected on roads in charge but had to be removed.  The fact therefore that a road is not in charge is no indication so far as this amenity is concerned.  There are many reasons why the Department of Posts and Telegraphs failed to respond to repeated representations from Deputy Dunne and Deputy Clinton for telephone kiosks.  Residents on roadways not taken in charge have private telephones. We must consider whether some of the matters raised merit our serious attention.</P>

There may be remote areas which never had, and probably never will have, a refuse collection.</P>

      <P>It is true that contractors failed to meet their responsibilities in the past.  There is one particular road in which five contractors were concerned.  One of them died, and the corporation have a deposit of £200 or £300.  One of the others emigrated and the remainder have gone out of business.  It would take thousands to put the roadway into proper condition. We have met our responsibilities in matters of this kind in the not too distant past.  It is a pity that this laxity was allowed to develop to the point where the roadway deteriorated.  In some cases the roadway did not deteriorate for a considerable time, until the underground material was washed away, for instance, by the diversion of a channel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In some cases it was debatable whether the contractor who constructed the roadway was responsible or <Col N="690" /> contractors carrying out adjacent development.  There have been many cases where the roadway was tested on the basis that adjacent development was responsible and not the original development which they believed was carried out to the specifications of the Department and the requirements of the local authority.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that these matters bog down the legal minds and when they get together on this, they take quite a considerable time to iron out the differences.  It is on that basis that some of the problems that exist at the moment have developed&mdash;diversion of water from other sources, insufficient or defective drainage of one kind or another and so on.</P>
    <P>I hope that we shall all take back to the respective local authorities which we represent a solution for the various problems which confront the local authorities now as a result of ineffective supervision at some time or another in the past or failure to examine comprehensively the development of the area and the adjacent development.  Future planning is most important.  It is necessary to get a comprehensive picture of the future development in an area as a whole rather than to examine piecemeal development that has been taking place throughout the country and in the cities up to quite recent times. There has been no substantial picture of the complete development and its effects.</P>
    <P>The lack of services in some areas at the moment is an indication of the bad planning that has taken place in the past.  As we all know, the Minister is endeavouring to get a comprehensive picture so that we shall have future development in such a manner as will ensure that many of the defects being complained about now by Deputies&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am quite sure that the members of the Opposition who now have such a comprehensive knowledge of all these problems will be without material for any suggestion or implication that the Minister is responsible for some omission or other.

Such questions might be asked on days when, in fact, the Deputies concerned are far removed from Dáil Éireann.  They put down questions about railways, telephone facilities and bus shelters and then they can stay out of the Dáil for a couple of days.  Their names appear in the newspapers as having asked the Minister or Ministers such questions and the impression is given that they are very concerned about the problems of their constituents.

I think now we can go back to our law agents and ask them to reconsider decisions.  It seems to be a question now of public utility and general public utility.  Laneways serve certain groups.  If the law agents reconsider decisions in the past, in due course the position can be rectified and local authorities can proceed to develop these laneways or roadways.  I have in mind development at the Long Mile Road at Drimnagh.  As a result of that, certain frontages will disappear and shopkeepers who use these frontages for loading and unloading will now have to do that at the rear of the shops.  The laneways at the rear cannot be serviced by the local authority.</P>

There is a desire on the part of many public representatives to pick out certain areas and this unfinished portion is the concern of Deputy Clinton.  I have been informed by the County Manager that the council decided they would not do any works there and now the shopkeepers will be deprived of an important service.  The result of unsatisfactory development being taken <Col N="695" /> in charge is something worse than the unfinished estate.  This portion has been for many years on charge to the local authority.  It was in a disgusting condition.  This sort of thing should be rectified.  The gimmick value of unfinished estates is now played out.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I was saying that a lot of Deputies on the Opposition side have been indulging in politics and uttering petty and derisive catcalls about the shortage of houses.  However, an honest and prudent assessment of the situation shows, and I do not think anybody can deny this, that there has been a tremendous gain in housing and the improvements over the past six or seven years have been pretty substantial.  The worst offender on the Opposition benches has been Deputy Barrett who never misses an opportunity to groan and moan about the housing situation.  I regard him as the chief Jeremiah on the opposite benches. Many of his assessments have been wilful distortions of the true facts, bloated accounts of the realities of the situation.  A lot of facts and figures are just pushed aside as if they did not exist, with a complete disregard for truth or honesty, or used deliberately as a good political hobbyhorse. However, these complaints have a habit of returning to plague the inventor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1965-66 the total number of houses completed by housing authorities and private enterprise was slightly over 11,000, which is about twice the <Col N="697" /> number provided four years ago and about 1,000 above the provisional target set out in the Second Programme for Economic Expansion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>The figures are there and Deputy Collins or Deputy Barrett may judge them.  The fact remains that this is a very suitable yardstick by which to judge the vigorous growth in housing.</P>
      <P>I should like to conclude by saying that I am very happy to be on the same side of the House as the Minister who has the interests of the poorer sections of the population so much at heart.  I feel confident that with his guidance and energy, the situation will improve and I can assure him that every assistance that can be given to him from this side of the House will be given.  The Opposition may think that their catcalling and derisive remarks will gain them a certain amount of political favour but in the long run they will only be used against them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="StephenCoughlan" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to put the case of my own constituency in this debate.  If we all look after our own end, we will eventually have a proper picture of the national situation as it exists.  There is no use fooling ourselves by juggling around with figures. Figures are made for juggling and we can use them to suit whatever case we wish to make.  In this case I must say that the Minister and his Department have been juggling deliberately with figures and deceiving the ordinary people in regard to the amounts allocated for housing.  I could bring the Minister back to 1933 and 1934 when houses were built in Limerick for something in the region of £200. The cost of that house today is in the region of £2,400 to £2,500.  I indict the Minister and his Department when they say they are giving more this year than last year.  That is all nonsense and is a deliberate deception.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As public representatives, we all are aware of the housing demands and here again the Department stands indicted because we know the dilly-dallying <Col N="698" /> and the yo-yo tactics that have been adopted by the Department when plans are sent to them for sanction. I believe that every representative here of a local authority will agree with me that our engineers and architects are just as good as, if not better than, the men employed in the Department of Local Government. Last August 12 months I had occasion to inquire about a housing plan which we had sent to the Department.  I was informed that the engineer in charge was on holidays and that it would not be touched until he returned in a month's time.  That was the position. I believe that all this sending of plans up and down from the country to the Department and back again just because there is a red line where there should be a blue line, or because something is there which should not be there, is adopted for purely delaying purposes and to hold up the efforts local authority representatives are trying to make to house their people.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, it must be agreed that the architects and engineers on the spot have a local knowledge.  They know the land and the layout of such things as water, sewerage and so on, and everything connected with the scheme, and I cannot for the life of me see why these plans have to go up and down and down and up.  It is only for one purpose, that is, to delay the housing programme which we local authorities have set before ourselves.  The fact that targets have been set was mentioned here.  Since I came into public life, I am sick of listening to this.  I have yet to see the bullseye being reached, and, indeed, we are far short of it.  This is another of the complications and of the deceitful practices of the Government in order to try to take people's minds off the urgent necessity which exists in regard to housing.</P>
    <P>Now, I want to come to the position prevailing in my county.  We have 500 applications for houses, or 480 to be exact.  In 1965, 68 houses were completed. There are 35 SDA applicants waiting months on a waiting list for their grants from the Department and nothing is being done about it.  We have water schemes held up and we <Col N="699" /> have also group schemes held up. Plans have been sent up.  The groups have been organised.  Everything has been waiting and ready but nothing has been done with regard to them.  Men have been laid off for want of money in regard to building and repairs to council houses.  That is the position with regard to the county.</P>
    <P>We have practically 1,000 applicants for housing in the city of Limerick and we have 139 houses under construction. I remember a time, and it is on record, when the present Minister for Education as a member of Limerick Corporation demanded that our target should be 400 houses a year.  We are now in the sad position that out of 1,000 people who need houses we are in the course of constructing 139 houses.  We have been sending up, time out of mind, plans, plans and more plans and they have been going back and forth.  I was on a deputation which went to the Minister and he told me that he would consider nothing until it had reached the tender stage.  He did not deceive us because we knew he was hampering it before ever reaching the tender stage.</P>
    <P>We have a situation in Limerick which is tragic in the extreme.  That is because the Minister will not sanction sub-tenants for first lettings. I have stated before&mdash;and it has been reported&mdash;that we have 18 and 20 people living in three-roomed houses.  We have four families living in the one house with six people living in one room.  We have a married couple with boys and girls 18, 19 and 20 years of age living in one room. They are all sleeping in the one room because we are not allowed to rehouse our subtenants for first lettings.</P>
    <P>This is a matter of grave importance and as far as Limerick is concerned it is a tragedy.  We have this question of sub-tenants before us at every meeting. What are people to do?  A boy and girl get married.  There is no such thing as rooms to let because when rooms are vacated, the roofs are taken off and the rooms locked up. <Col N="700" /> Those rooms cannot be re-let unless the people go in to live under conditions which would not be tolerated anywhere. Even if they go in the corporation will evict them.  Those unfortunate people, who want to get married, have no alternative but live with their inlaws. There the snowball starts.</P>
    <P>You have the first marriage.  Then the second, third and fourth marriage comes off and before we know where we are there are five and six families living in the one corporation house. If that is Christian living and if that is what the Department and the Minister for Local Government call Christian living they live in a different world than I do.  This is tragic and immoral to say the least of it.  I want to impress on the Minister that those sub-tenants must be considered on the basis of overcrowding.  We can consider them in other cases outside corporation houses on the grounds of overcrowding and we can house them and give them first lettings.  The only thing we can do now is wait for any vacancy that may occur.</P>
    <P>Very few vacancies occur.  If by chance a vacancy arises there are 50 or 60 applicants for that vacancy.  It is about time the Department gave sub-tenants the same conditions as anybody else.  They are Irish people just as we are.  They are married and bringing up young families the same as anybody else.  They are living in overcrowded conditions and they should be treated in that light.  I hope the Minister, his Parliamentary Secretary and his officials take note of what I am saying.  I have raised this on many occasions, and please God.  I will raise it next Monday night at the Corporation meeting in Limerick.</P>
    <P>The position then is this.  We have something over 300 applications from sub-tenants.  At the same time we have only 66 demolition orders on our books so that, putting one figure against the other, 66 houses to be demolished on the one hand, and 300 sub-tenants seeking accomodation on the other hand, surely to heavens it is about time now they were allowed to move into first lettings.  Those figures cannot <Col N="701" /> be denied.  There has been talk about the cost of building and that more money is being given this year than last year.</P>
    <P>Rent increases in most cases have been authorised by the Minister for Local Government.  The Minister sent us down his circular, M1/65, demanding that we increase the rents or, if not, we would not be considered for further housing loans or grants.  The gun was put to our head and the manager had to move or be removed, one or the other.  What happened?  Rents in some cases went up 200 per cent and more in my city.  Some unfortunate people who went into those houses contracted for a maximum rent based on the figures and the terms and conditions of work at the time, be it five years, ten years or even fifteen years ago.  Maximum rents were agreed by Limerick Corporation at that time.  We got the fire order from the Minister that those contracts had to be broken. Those tenants contracted for a maximum rent which now had to be broken by a fire order from the Minister. Those unfortunate people are now faced with the fact that their rents, in some cases, have increased by 200 per cent.  If you call that Local Government, if you call that progress and if you call that good living and good Government I know nothing whatever about it.  It is foreign to me.  I can understand the feelings of those people who contracted for a maximum rent. Those maximum rent tenants contracted for a figure at the time.  That has been increased on three occasions in the past couple of months by Limerick Corporation.</P>
    <P>Now, I want to come to the problem of rents.  Here, again, the Department in their intolerance and in their smug approach to the conditions under which people have to live have ordered a differential rents system.  I went to the trouble of acquainting myself with the conditions and ascertaining the differentials in the areas in which they operate.  No two figures were alike in regard to any particular house or the number of dependants in any house.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="702" /> It is only half an hour since I was looking at the differential rents system which obtains in the Parliamentary Secretary's own constituency. The information is obtainable in the Fine Gael rooms with regard to Wicklow.  Having considered and having examined all the systems that prevail I find there are no two boroughs or differential areas which agree on a figure, bearing in mind its full relation to the cost of the house and the income of the dependants living therein.  I cannot see why&mdash;all over the country prices are the same, from £2,400 to £2,500, conditions are the same, and contracts are comparable&mdash;a figure cannot be laid down that will be just and fair and equally applied in all differential rent schemes.  That is a matter on which the Department have slept&mdash;one of the many&mdash;and is one that has been avoided by the Department. It has been thrown over locally. The Department said: &ldquo;Look after your own affairs but let us do the Pontius Pilate and wash our hands of it.&rdquo;  It is the duty of the Department of Local Government to ensure that there is equity in regard to all our people. Does this prevail today?</P>
    <P>Another point I should like to put to the Minister for his consideration is this.  The Department of Local Government, in conjunction with the Department of Defence and the Department of Justice, should devise a scheme to house both the Army and Garda.  We have men, particularly in the Army, living in conditions in married quarters and, honest to God, I would not put pigs into them.  They cannot turn on the electric light.  That question was raised here time and again.  They cannot put in a TV set or an electric washer or an electric cooker.  The rain flows down all over the place.  These are dirty, filthy, stone buildings, a relic of British days.  Something should be done about a scheme of housing for the Army men.</P>
    <P>The case is similar with regard to the Garda.  There should be a scheme in the Department of Local Government in co-operation with the Department <Col N="703" /> of Justice whereby these men would be properly housed.  It obtained in the past and, while I do not want to take a leaf out of the book of John Bull, this must be said for him.  He looked after such men properly in this respect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>I heard two different <Col N="705" /> voices in the debate supporting the Government.  Deputy Crowley says he is quite happy that everything is going ahead and that the housing position is satisfactory.  I think he is the only one in the country who says that.  A different voice came from Deputy Molloy who says that the Government should employ the engineers, who are now idle in Galway due to the closing down of housing, on the surveys rather than employ surveyors.  I think Deputy Molloy when he states that these engineers have to emigrate because there is no housing going on in Galway, either private or public, was nearer to the mark than our friend Deputy F. Crowley who stated that he is satisfied with the present position.  I would ask the Minister to come out into the open and not try to create a false impression, because he is only fooling himself.  The Minister will never admit publicly that there is a real shortage of money for housing.  Indeed, when we hear him day after day at Question Time, if a question is raised about housing, he never really states that there is a real shortage of money and that that is the principal reason for the situation.  I have no doubt that if the Minister had the money, there would be no scarcity of houses but why can he not say that?  I believe that if we had a deputation of Deputies to the Minister in his office, he would come out and tell us that, and say: &ldquo;I am sorry; I just cannot do that now, but I will try to do it when I get in more funds.&rdquo; If he would only take the people into his confidence, as well as taking the Deputies into his confidence, everyone would know the position.  I do not blame the Minister for, after all, he is in an awkward position; he is in charge of a big Department where most of the money is being spent to repay loans on houses built years ago.  I do not blame him for the position he is in and for the way in which he is embarrassed here every day, when he has not enough money to spend.  Then, of course, he passes it over to the local authorities.  I heard him say here today: &ldquo;Oh, where is the local authority which did not apply for that years ago?&rdquo; I think I heard the Parliamentary Secretary say <Col N="706" /> the same thing to Deputy Pattison as to why something was not provided in Carlow.  There is not much point in trying to push it over on the public, who are doing their best to get the Government to realise the position in the country.  My honest opinion&mdash; and I believe it is the opinion of most of the people in the country&mdash;is that the responsibility for this lies with the Government.</P>
      <P>When the Government came into office in 1956, they found there were ample houses being provided at that time and they decided that housing, in itself, was non-productive.  Rather than keep on with the housing programme, they decided they would invest their money in other projects. They closed down housing, although the Taoiseach at that time, who is now President, said that his first responsibility to the public would be housing but, apparently, his voice was outweighed by the Government and he was not allowed to carry out what he stated was his aim at that time.  Within the past few years, things have developed to a terrible crisis: houses have been falling and it was only then that the Government began to move, it was only then the Minister for Local Government was able to impress the views of the people of the country on the Government and only then did the Government relax somewhat.  They relaxed in one way in that we were allowed to rehouse sub-tenants in corporation houses.  Up to that, irrespective of whether there were three, four or five families living in one house, they could not be rehoused or, if they were, this was done at a price they could not afford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had a survey of the housing position in Kilkenny recently, when the county medical officer reported that 150 families needed houses, some of whom were living in shocking conditions. Deputy Coughlan mentioned the case of a father, mother and two adult children living in one room.  Apparently the county medical officer reported that there were two married couples living in one room in Kilkenny, which is a disgrace to the country. Only within the past week, a woman with five children took possession of <Col N="707" /> a corporation house which had been condemned.  The woman was in dire circumstances looking for a house, when she saw her children wasting before her eyes.  She had her name on a list of 150 and she is not even in the first 27 to be housed.</P>
    <P>I do not think that any Party in the House would object to my suggestion that money be transferred from the Road Fund to housing to get over this present crisis.  If things go well again, then, by all means, repay that money to the Road Fund, but, at the present time, housing should be a first charge on any reasonable Government or any reasonable people.  We know the Minister cannot get money from the Government in the normal way.  I am making the suggestion that he get it from the Road Fund rather than continue with the arterial roads programme for the time being.  I would like to see the roads maintained and kept in proper condition&mdash;we do not want to see our assets go down&mdash;but a certain amount could be spared from the Road Fund to facilitate housing of the people.</P>
    <P>There is no point in the Minister for Health touring the country with a White Paper to ascertain people's opinion on it, if, at the same time, the root cause of ill-health in a great number of families is not being removed.  That is the first essential.  If we had good housing, good sanitary services, good water and good sewerage, quite a lot of the ill-health of our people would be eliminated and Ardkeen Hospital would not have to cater for many of the children for whom they cater at present.  During this very big crisis in housing, due to shortage of money&mdash;we all know there is an actual shortage of money and the Government have gone to London in an attempt to raise a loan of £5 million to relieve the position&mdash;I would suggest that money be transferred from the Road Fund to housing.</P>
    <P>One matter brought me to my feet tonight especially, that is, to voice the opinion of my local corporation on the new electoral voting system which the Minister intends bringing in.  Up to <Col N="708" /> 1938 in Kilkenny city, we had two wards, each with 12 members: 24 members in the corporation.  About that time, the system was changed and the number of members was reduced to 12.  The electoral unit was reduced to one for the whole city.  That has proved very satisfactory over the years since 1938.  I am a member of the corporation and we have practically an 80 per cent attendance at corporation meetings every month in the city.  At special meetings, we have the same.  It has proved very satisfactory because when there were 24 there were too many and some members did not bother to attend meetings.  Now it is more difficult to get elected.  When they are elected, they appreciate the position all the more and turn up to meetings when they are called.  Politics do not enter into our local affairs.</P>
    <P>All the members of the corporation are most anxious to promote the welfare of the city and the three Parties in this House can only boast of six members out of the 12 on the corporation. The other six members are elected from representatives from various organisations in the city: there are some from the chamber of commerce, the Ratepayers' Association, a few Independents and others.  All these representatives do their best and I think these organisations should be congratulated on putting up representatives of the public.  Those who come forward for election should be congratulated on taking an interest in the welfare of their native city.  After all, that is what we are anxious the people should do&mdash;work for the good of their own city and for the good of their country.  These men have the courage to come forward against the various political Parties here in the House and, as I said, six of them were elected as against six members of the political Parties in this House.  When this matter was raised, the Minister gave his word that if any council were unanimous in a decision to carry on with the present system, he would reconsider it very seriously.  I can assure the Minister that not one voice was raised in Kilkenny in favour of a change in the system.  Not a single voice was raised by a member of his own Party in support of the Minister's <Col N="709" /> proposal: they were all most anxious that the present system should be maintained.</P>
    <P>The result of that discussion went to the Minister and I understand that when it was received on the following day, his officials checked back to Kilkenny to know was this a genuine and unanimous vote, and they were told that it was the genuine and unanimous vote of Kilkenny Corporation that the present system should be maintained.  I took it for granted then that it would be maintained. After all, a man's word should be as good as his bond.  I took the Minister's word here in the House and I said that he would reconsider not changing the system.  Everyone in Kilkenny got a great shock last week. As a matter of fact, I was away for a few days and I saw in the <i>Independent</i> that the Minister intended bringing in the new system.</P>
    <P>What advantage does he hope to get from it in Kilkenny?  What advantage will it bring us in Kilkenny?  There might be an argument for it in a city like the city of Cork where there are 40 or 45 representatives on the corporation and there is a ballot paper with 80 or 90 names on it.  In Kilkenny we have the same ballot paper today as we had under the old system.  The voters in Kilkenny are acquainted with any candidate who goes forward and they know whom they are voting for. In Cork or in Limerick, there may be a case for a new system.  In Kilkenny, we do not interfere in anyone else's business.  Is this a compliment to the organisations who have the good of the country and the city at heart?  The Minister should encourage these people and all people to take an interest in public life.  There is a suggestion that we should have civic classes in the schools to teach our children civic spirit.  Now we are being told that if we do not belong to one of the big political Parties, we can no longer be members of the corporation.</P>
    <P>The Minister said there would be no change in towns with a population of under 10,000.  Our population is 10,057 &mdash;57 over the mark.  Have we not got enough trouble already in this country with borders without the Minister <Col N="710" /> bringing three borders into Kilkenny city?  The river makes one division and you would have to look at a map to see the other division.  It goes up and down and you would not know what street or what side of a street is in the different areas.  Will the Minister tell us what the Government have at the back of their minds in regard to this change? I can appreciate that there might be a reason for it in a city like Cork where there are a big number of candidates, and big voting lists, and people may get confused.  In Kilkenny, the biggest number of candidates we would have would be 24, and everyone knows the candidates.  I am sorry the Minister is not here to hear my appeal but I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary will convey my views to him.  Even at this eleventh hour, he might reconsider the matter.  When he is replying, would he give us some idea of what he had in mind when making this change?  Is it for the good of a town like Kilkenny, or is it for Party political purposes? I should hate to think it is.  We are a happy family in Kilkenny and we try to do our best.  We try to invite industries, and to build up the city to make it a bigger city than it is now.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Minister has sanctioned the Mooncoin regional water scheme, but I understand that expenditure this year will be confined to £45,000.  A very good firm in Kilkenny got the contract and I would prefer if the Minister would let that firm go ahead and get the job done. There are many farmers in the south of the county who are supplying the creameries with milk and they need water for cooling.  There is to be a bonus payment of 2d a gallon and I am sure they will be anxious to get that bonus.  This scheme has not been as long on the stocks as the scheme Deputy Dunne mentioned for County Dublin, but it has been considered for a long number of years.  It is a pity it was not carried out long ago.  Some people have provided water for themselves. The scheme would have been more economic if it had been carried out some years ago.  However, we will be glad to have it done.</P>
    <P>Members of corporations feel that the Minister put differential rents into <Col N="711" /> our heads.  It is an advantage in a city like Kilkenny to have low rents.  Some inducement must be offered to the people to stay in the country, and if we charge the same rents as are charged in Dublin, they will not have that inducement. This will also increase the cost of living and we have been asked by the Government to maintain the cost of living.  If you want to increase the cost of any material, you have to apply to the Department of Industry and Commerce for sanction.  We have to apply to the Department to bring in a differential rents scheme.  I do not think tenants who could afford to pay more would object to some small increase in their rents, an increase sufficient to cover the increase in the cost of repairs so that the houses will be maintained in proper condition.  No tenant who can afford to pay would object to that.  Similarly, if there are any old age pensioners who would suffer hardship through differential rents, they might be relieved.  But I would not agree that differential rents should be used to subsidise rates.  It is all very well when a family is reared and money flowing in but the father and mother had to go through 16 or 20 years hardship to rear that family, and when they achieve a little prosperity, we do not want the corporation to come along and rake off that prosperity in differential rents.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to convey my ideas to the Minister. He already knows my ideas on housing and the shortage of houses in Kilkenny.  My purpose in speaking was to support the Minister in getting money from the Government to relieve the housing shortage, not to embarrass him.  I want him to get a share of the money, which I feel is being wasted in other directions, directed to housing.  I also asked the Parliamentary Secretary to convey to the Minister the general views of members of the corporation from all Parties and Independents, regarding the present position of the corporation, and I would ask him not to go ahead and divide us.</P>

      <P>I was not present yesterday when some of my colleagues spoke of the North Dublin regional water scheme.  I believe great play was made with it.  The present Minister is responsible for starting that scheme which is costing about £3.5 million. About 12 miles of the scheme have been carried out and we hope to continue the work until completed.  I shall not minimise the urgency of that scheme but during the six years of inter-Party Government, they put nothing on paper and made no promise in regard to it.</P>
      <P>We are doing our best but with all the proposed development in North Dublin, especially in the Swords and Donabate areas, we find, despite the original advice we got from our technical people, that the pipe is not large enough and we are awaiting the Myles Wright Report to see what direction future developments take in North Dublin.  We have had a number of meetings at planning and general development level and have gone into the matter carefully.  We have made good progress and the only thing holding us up is not lack of money but lack of technical advice.</P>
      <P>The advice we got originally that a certain type of pipe would be suitable &mdash;they were very large pipes; I got through them myself&mdash;does not apply now because of the enormous development in North Dublin.  We must now get a further report on development plans.  We are starting to build new towns in North Dublin.  We want water very badly but we cannot go ahead with the scheme unless it will cater for all the needs created by future development.</P>
      <P>We are very concerned about this scheme.  It is easy to make fun of all this but one does not get consulting engineers or town planners to do a job overnight.  We have been pressing them very hard and I intend to continue doing so until we get this Report and are able to say: &ldquo;We want this particular type of pipe to go ahead with the remainder of the scheme.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past few years under the present Minister we extended water schemes to various parts of County <Col N="713" /> Dublin and while we may not have done enough, we have succeeded in doing something worthwhile in the past four or five years.  I hope the Minister will do his best to see that this Myles Wright Report comes to hand as soon as possible so that we can get on with a very urgent job.  We need the scheme completed for many reasons with which I shall not bore the House.  We want it for general development, for horticulturists and agriculturists and for people living in various towns where the water supply is inadequate.</P>
    <P>For these reasons I want to pin down the North Dublin regional water scheme.  While this scheme was discussed for many years, we could not get water until Dublin Corporation and the ESB began the Poulaphouca scheme.  We also had a number of technical difficulties to overcome.  It was a very big effort.  A few years after we had taken over government, the economy had been built up again.  In 1957 when we took over, there was not the price of a bag of cement left and we proceeded to build up the economy of the nation and to advance sufficiently to be able to sanction water and sewerage schemes not alone in Dublin city and county but throughout the country.  If Deputy Seán Collins would listen to me, I can tell him all about it.  I do not know what he is mumbling about over there.</P>

I admit I had been pressing for this scheme before I entered public life but <Col N="714" /> at that time there was no money.  As soon as the Minister got the opportunity, he allowed the scheme to go ahead and gave it his blessing.  I am grateful to the Minister and I hope we both shall live to see the day when he will come out to see the scheme completed. If Deputy Seán Collins minds himself, I might invite him.</P>

      <P>Housing is one of the problems on which we are all of one mind.  All of us are anxious to see more and more houses built.  Great advances have been made in Dublin city and county but we are up against the problem that in both areas the population has increased by more than 70,000.  We also had to face the situation that houses were falling down around us.  Then the Minister came to our aid and one of the results is to be seen in the very fine township at Ballymun. Things are going along very nicely and the people of Dublin are grateful to the Minister for helping the local authorities to ease the housing situation.</P>
      <P>For one reason or another, we were not able to come to grips properly with the housing problem in the city. Among other things, we had a number of bad houses and we had overcrowding. When prosperity came along under Fianna Fáil, the people began to come back from England.  During 1965 and 1966&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Everybody knows about it, of course, but in case the Opposition might be under a misapprehension, I want to repeat it for them and to remind them again of the good times we are living in by comparison with the times they left us in 1957.  At that time they left 350 houses unfinished at Santry and a number of contractors overnight had to go to <Col N="715" /> Canada, Australia, New Zealand and elsewhere.  Now, though I admit there is a shortage of money, the Minister for Local Government is doing the job very well.  He has not let things get out of hand as they did in 1956 when there was no money for anything. At that time a Bill was introduced providing that a man earning £10 or £11 a week must make his own arrangements to build his house.  I hope we will never go through such a situation again.</P>
      <P>Money has become scarce in England and other European countries, and even in the great United States. Though money has become a bit scarce here, the Minister has been handling the job well.  If he had not, we would have mass unemployment and all our housing schemes would have been shut down completely. Naturally if the Minister had enough money, we could build more houses and do a lot of other things.  With the present Minister, we are pushing an open door.  He has been pressing local authorities to build more and more houses and to acquire more land and develop it.</P>
      <P>Dublin Corporation have been easing the situation in relation to their priority list for housing.  I remember the time a few years ago when a man had to have five children to qualify. That has been adjusted now to three children and, with God's help, we will see it improved further so that a man with two children will qualify.  At the moment fewer of our people are going away.  There was a time when we had 1,800 houses vacant, 1,000 houses vacant and so on.  That day has gone and fewer of our people are leaving. I hope the economic winds will blow favourably for the Minister so that more money will be available for housing in the near future.  Houses are more important than hospitals because it is no use treating people in hospitals if they have to return to bad houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very concerned about the scheme of tenant purchase.  I am anxious that every corporation tenant should be able to purchase his house. There are such schemes throughout the <Col N="716" /> country and they have proved a great advantage to the people concerned. Owing their houses encourages them to be better citizens, gives them a greater sense of responsibility and a new pride in keeping their houses in good order.  In Dublin, we pay £500,000 a year towards maintenance of our 40,000 corporation houses. About 5,000 corporation tenants have purchased their houses and I should like to see the day when more of our tenants can do so.  I appeal to the Minister and to the City Manager to do everything possible to bring this about.  It is possible that some tenant purchasers might abuse the scheme by selling their houses but most of them will not.</P>
    <P>In the matter of roads, great progress has been made in County Dublin during the past few years. Twenty years ago some of the roads leading from Dublin were no better than prairie tracks.  If I wished to travel from one end of the city to the other in a hurry, I could not do so because if a heavy truck were being driven in front of me, there was not room to overtake it.  People will say we are spending too much money on roads and ask why we do not switch it to something else.  This expenditure is long overdue.  Dublin County Council are 20 years behind the times in regard to roadmaking.  The Bray road should have been completed years ago but pressure groups protested and said the road that was there was all right.  That road has been responsible for numerous accidents.  It is a very dangerous road.  Since I became a member of the Council of Europe, I take a keen interest in the way they keep the roads there.  The roads are a credit to them.  I would urge upon the Minister no matter what our financial position is, to carry on, within reason. with the making of main roads out of the city of Dublin.</P>
    <P>Another thing of which I am in favour&mdash;and I see it on the Continent also&mdash;is the by-passing of towns.  I travelled in the north of England and I was told that where towns are bypassed, the trade improves, because people will go in there and park their cars.  On the main roads, one may not <Col N="717" /> pull up.  I hope the Minister will follow this pattern as regards towns in north and south Dublin, and especially on the road to Bray.</P>
    <P>In ten years time we shall have ten or 15 per cent more cars on the road. Where I live in Santry, I find that, especially on a fine evening in the summertime, unless I have the car out and facing in the right direction, I cannot get out at all.  If we are to cope with future traffic, greater road development is essential.</P>
    <P>I should also like to see the roads lined where they are wide enough. Some people will keep to the centre of the road although the road might be wide enough for two cars.  If the road were lined, they would have to keep in on their own side.  While it might be a little more expensive to do that, it could prevent the tragic accidents that occur from time to time.</P>
    <P>Any support we can give the Minister and his Department on road safety we should give.  I was at the funeral of two unfortunate boys aged 18 and 20 years who were killed on Saturday night last at Hart's Corner.  It is appalling the number of young and old people who are killed every day.  A lot of it has to do with bad manners on the road.  Passing out other cars is a matter of life or death for some people. They want to do it in all circumstances, even if they are in a line of traffic. They have no regard for themselves or anybody else.  People should take the numbers of cars of people who display bad road manners.  We should be more public-spirited in this regard.  In France they have set up courts on roads and done a lot of other things like that.  If the people who have bad road manners realise there is somebody watching them and that they will be penalised if they do something wrong, it may improve their manners.  People will say drink is the cause of most accidents. There are many other causes.  There are people who think they can do anything they like on the roads, turn into other roads without giving signals and so on.  Such people are a danger to themselves and to everybody else.</P>
    <P>The Minister dealt with the question of lifesaving.  God be with the days <Col N="718" /> when I used to be in the swim.  I was 12 years secretary of a swimming club, and I must say my health improved when I was swimming.  Every encouragement should be given to lifesaving. Many people along our shores, in rivers and other places, lose their lives because they are not able to swim.</P>
    <P>I know housing is more important but some thought should be given to the erection of swimming pools.  There is no use in talking about a big swimming pool.  We have had a lot of discussion in Dublin Corporation about swimming pools.  Instead of a swimming pool costing up to £100,000 being built in one area, I would prefer the idea suggested first by the Department of Local Government and the Minister that a number of smaller pools would be provided, even of the type that has been built in Longford.  More would be achieved in that way.  People might say that the pools were not sufficiently large for a populous area.  I consider that they would be sufficiently large.</P>

      <P>To have a number of smaller swimming pools would be more advantageous than having one large pool.  It is of no use to erect a large swimming pool in a large area in the city and say that other areas must wait 20 years before being provided with a pool.  If a pool of the type provided in Longford were <Col N="719" /> erected in big housing schemes, whether privately or by the corporation, they would be of great advantage to the people.  All swimming pools should be heated.  I have no regard for the old type of swimming pool which consisted of a hole in the ground filled with cold water.</P>
      <P>I dealt with the question of estates last night and therefore will not take up the time of the House in dealing with that matter again.  In areas where there are no playing pitches the residents are anxious to acquire sites for amenity schemes.  I shall not press the Minister too hard because I realise that he is most anxious that that should be done.  When times improve, I hope he will have regard to this matter.  I would like to play football but I have got down to serious work and have not the time.  May I introduce a European note into the discussion ?</P>

I shall not delay on this matter but it does concern the Minister for Local Government.  The idea of the European Flag should be developed.

These are matters of a European flavour which I wanted to mention as means of creating a spirit of goodwill and harmony and of eliminating misunderstanding.

    <Speaker pid="PatrickTierney" hpid="Mr. Tierney Mr. Tierney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tierney</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should like to draw the Minister's attention to the question of housing in North Tipperary. We were always led to believe that any Government other than Fianna Fáil were short of money but that the Fianna Fáil Government had an abundance of money.  We find in North Tipperary, in Thurles, Roscrea, Nenagh and in the rural areas, a waiting list of at least 200 priority cases for housing.  All members of the county council, Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Labour, were anxious that the houses should be provided.  We have complaints from the county council officials that there has been long and undue delay in the Minister's Department in sanctioning proposals for the houses. Maybe a window was two inches too high or three inches too long.  The county council make the adjustment <Col N="721" /> and send the plans back.  It is four or five months before we get a reply back from the Department maybe refusing sanction or putting another obstacle in the way.</P>
      <P>An example is the Bulfin Road scheme where we set a large number of houses to a contractor.  We gave him a guarantee we would give him 13 houses in the same area at the same price.  At that time we were working on the undertaking the Minister had given North Tipperary County Council in regard to long-term planning.  We did plan in the long term, but then we discovered the Minister had refused sanction.  We were on the verge of letting the contractor go and disappointing the people waiting for houses. Then we sent a deputation to Dublin to meet the Minister.  I was rather surprised at that deputation when the Minister suggested we were not so bad in regard to housing in North Tipperary since the Silvermines people were building houses and would sub-let them to the people in the Bulfin Road area.  However, I must congratulate the Minister.  He has changed his mind on that and has sanctioned the Bulfin Road scheme, and the contractor we engaged is to complete it.</P>
      <P>The people of Ireland knew there was a shortage of money.  I believe the majority of them would have accepted that, and accepted the need for a slowing down in housing, if the Minister had said so publicly.  But instead of making a clear statement of that kind week after week, when questions were put to him here in Dáil Éireann, he denied there was any shortage of money for housing or that there were any long delays in his Department. He made the case a lot worse for Deputies and county councillors on all sides.  They read his statements that the money was there but that they were not doing their work properly and were holding on to plans for so long that they were the cause of the delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present there is a long list of water and sewerage schemes and housing projects from us awaiting sanction. There is no use in my going back to North Tipperary and telling the <Col N="722" /> people they are held up in the Department or that the Department have no money to meet them.  When the Minister concludes in this debate, they will read in tomorrow's papers there was never more money at the disposal of the county council.  That is not a fact, and the Minister knows it.  In future, Ministers and Deputies should be straight with the people.  The Irish people will accept that and meet them half-way.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to a problem concerning road workers in North Tipperary. I do not know whether it affects any other county.  Our road workers are waiting for the last increase&mdash;the increase given to every worker in the country except county council workers and forestry workers. I am led to believe the Minister has refused to sanction the increase to the county council workers in North Tipperary. When a wage increase is awarded, private employers have to pay it.  Yet we see Government bodies giving increases of up to £30 or £40 a week to their higher-paid officials but refusing to give the road workers the last increase of £1.  The Minister may say he is agreeable but that he does not want the increase to be retrospective to a certain date.  He is giving the workers a very raw deal.  At present they are getting a very small wage. If he has not already done so in the past few days, he should notify North Tipperary County Council he will now give the increase retrospective from 1st April last.  My council are prepared to go to the people of North Tipperary to meet that increase.  The county manager is willing to pay from May but I understand the Minister does not want to pay until June.  I hope the Minister will clarify the matter within the next few days.</P>
    <P>Recently we awarded a contract for a sewerage scheme in the town of Roscrea costing around £200,000. There have been complaints to the Department both by the people of Roscrea and by the fishermen of North Tipperary concerning the discharge of refuse into the Brosna River.  I am led to believe that the £200,000 expended with the Minister's sanction has been a waste.  When I raised this matter at the county council, I was told I was <Col N="723" /> not right in doing so because negotiations were going on with the contractor and by raising it, I might hamper them.  I was informed that the county council were now going to complete the work.</P>
    <P>There is not proper supervision of these larger schemes.  Whether it is at Departmental level or county council level, I do not know.  In regard to the Roscrea scheme, I am told that during the two weeks' holiday a contractor, who should not be a contractor under local government law, put in 400 tons of stones when there was no clerk of works and no workman on the site. The contract was supposed to be for washed stone.  I am led to believe these stones were brought in from the head-lands and ditches with clay on them and piled into the reservoir, with the result that now, at the present time, the sewerage from Roscrea is flowing as strongly into the River Brosna as ever it was.  I should like the Minister to inquire more closely into that.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Minister has any great function regarding the supply of water for cottiers.  I have a feeling that North Tipperary County Council have failed completely in the matter of supplying water for isolated cottages. Up to some years ago, we used to provide money for pumps where there was no regional water supply.  We have no regional water supply in North Tipperary but when we were thinking of adopting it, we used to allocate a certain amount of money per annum for pumps but that money has been cut out for the past six years or so and we have people drawing water out of quarries, and so on, for distances maybe up to a mile.  It is a North Tipperary problem and it is not altogether the Minister's problem.  Could he, at least, bring in some scheme to compel county councils to provide a water supply for the rural areas?</P>
    <P>On the subject of new driving licences, I am informed that the scheme for qualification for a provisional licence is misleading inasmuch as a person who submitted to the test told me has was asked the different road signs and all the usual questions. In my view, a lot of the accidents that have happened in recent years in this <Col N="724" /> country never happen at dangerous bends or on a crooked road.  All the major accidents happen on roads that have cost hundreds of thousands of pounds.  I often wonder if that money which has been spent on our roads and on making some of them into racing tracks would not more usefully have been spent on housing in Dublin, Cork, Tipperary and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Take, for example, the road from Nenagh to Limerick city.  Since the Department have done that road, more people have been killed on it than were killed on it since the motor car came into existence.  It is now a case of one or two every month.  Take the place where those poor unfortunate people were killed between Naas and New-bridge. The accident happened on the widest part of that road where there was a clear view for perhaps three-quarters of a mile.  These things happen, I suppose, more through speeding than anything else.  I often wonder if we are wise to devote so much money to making racing tracks for a certain type of individual.  I admit that people are driving cars, and always will, who have road sense, but no matter what kind of restriction is imposed regarding driving licences, we will nevertheless meet characters who, when they get a good road, want to see what the car will do.  A strict test for a driving licence will not cope with that problem and I would ask the Minister to reconsider the strictness of the test.</P>
    <P>In this year of 1966, I think the age for driving a tractor should be lowered. Every young boy in rural Ireland who is working for a farmer or for his father can drive a tractor in the fields and on the roads, if he is not caught, from the time he is nine or ten years of age.  I know that people will say that if you reduce the age for driving a tractor, you will have more accidents and more deaths, but I do not think so. This is the machine age and things are not as they were 40 or 50 years ago on our farms.  I have seen farmers' sons driving at the age of nine and ten years, and good little drivers they were.  At the same time, I am not advocating that age but I think the age for a tractor driving licence should be reduced by at least a couple of years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="725" /> I want to thank the Minister again for the Bulfin Road scheme.  He has now rectified the mistake that was made.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister, or whoever will succeed him, to give the Irish people at least the credit of having a small bit of intelligence and not to state that more money is being spent on housing this year than was spent last year and the year before that.  We all know that a house that cost only £900 or £1,000 two years ago now costs £1,800 or £1,900.  Furthermore, the Minister should be honest with the people in relation to the shortage of capital.  Tell the people that, due to circumstances over which we have no control, or due to a blunder&mdash;nobody will admit to a blunder &mdash;the position is not favourable at the moment: tell them the truth.  The people will accept an honest evaluation of the facts and Teachtaí Dála and county councillors will not then be pressed by people in relation to matters which cannot be tackled at the moment owing to our stringent financial position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondGoverney" hpid="Mr. Governey Mr. Governey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Governey</NameTxt>
      <P>After five days of this debate, there is very little more that can be said on housing.  I want to draw the attention of the Minister to the position that obtains in Carlow which is no different, I think, from that in any other county in this country. On numerous occasions we have heard Deputies speak of houses falling down on the people in Dublin. One does not have to come to Dublin to see even that.  At a meeting of Carlow County Council on Monday last, the council asked the manager for permission to build a prefabricated house for a family as the council was not prepared to allow them to stay any longer in a dangerous house. Carlow County Council are waiting for sanction for the erection of 60 to 70 houses which are badly needed.  I can well understand the Minister's position due to financial difficulties and, like other Deputies, I think the actual financial position should be made plain to the people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Governey</NameTxt>
      <P>He did not tell the local authorities that they would not have the amount of money they required to build the houses which are needed.  It is all very fine producing a document of this size with a great quantity of writing in it but it provides no consolation for a Deputy who still finds that there are people in his constituency living in overcrowded conditions.  I know of one case in the town of Carlow; there are 17 people living in one urban council house.  I appreciate the difficulties in which the Government find themselves and I am sure the Minister has tried to persuade the Cabinet to give him all the money he wants for housing, but he has not succeeded in getting it.  That is my complaint.</P>
      <P>With regard to reconstruction grants, over the past 12 months, and even before that, there has been delay in the payment of these grants.  People who have carried out reconstruction work have got credit from local traders and have had to wait for payment of the money due to them by the county council.  That waiting was due to the fact that the money did not come down in time.  These honest people, who were anxious to pay their way, got a bad name with the traders who were giving them credit and, all the time, it was the Department and the county council who should have shouldered the blame.  That has happened on numerous occasions.  People have had to wait for their money and traders, who could ill afford to do so, have likewise had to wait for their accounts. Something should be done to solve that problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to housing, with all the new methods of taxation&mdash;the turnover <Col N="727" /> tax and so on, and two Budgets in one year&mdash;surely the Government should at some stage have enough money to house the people ?  The people are taxed to the hilt.  One wonders where all the money collected in taxation is going.  I have a feeling that the money is not going in the right direction. The first duty of the Government and the Minister is to house the people properly.</P>
    <P>With regard to water supply schemes, the Parliamentary Secretary opened our regional water supply scheme during the year.  There are other areas in which group schemes are the solution.  In one area the people got together three years ago to start a group scheme; inspectors came down and inspected the source; another source was suggested; the thing was thrown around until it is only now the scheme is getting off the ground.  That is the sort of thing that is happening all the time.</P>
    <P>An earlier speaker tonight mentioned failures in driving tests.  According to the Minister's statement, there are 49 per cent of failures out of 35,000 applicants.  If that 49 per cent take out a provisional licence in order to do the test a second time, £17,150 is collected in that way alone.  I do not know if there are enough testers but I know of a case in which a person took out a provisional licence and paid her £1. She gave notice six weeks before her provisional licence expired that she was ready to do the test.  Before she was called to do the test, her licence had expired.  In the meantime, tests had been carried out in the town but that particular applicant was left with no alternative but to pay another £1 for another provisional licence.  There must be tests and they must be rigid.  There are still too many accidents on the roads.  We in Carlow County Council have co-operated with the Minister in every way in relation to the road safety campaign and all of us should stress at every possible opportunity the importance of safety on our roads.</P>
    <P>With regard to town planning, whilst there is necessity for planning, I think we are going a little too far and there <Col N="728" /> is too much of an element of dictation in this regard.</P>

I can bring the Minister, or his Parliamentary Secretary, or anyone else, into the town of Carlow and show him the neon signs over various premises.  But this man was deprived of the opportunity of advertising his business.  That is going a little too far with town planning.  There are signs all over the place and just one extra sign is refused.  I should be anxious to know at some stage the number of appeals to the Minister and the number that have been reversed by him.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter I would like to raise, and which has been raised by several other Deputies, is the matter of swimming pools.  In the town of Carlow in 1965, the people had the foresight to collect money for the maintenance of a swimming pool, the <Col N="729" /> erection of which they expected would be sanctioned by the Department. People went around voluntarily and collected over £5,000 for the maintennance of this pool.  On 14th December, 1965, I asked the Minister when it was hoped to sanction the plans which had been submitted for the swimming pool and the reply was that the Minister could not say when a decision would be reached on the proposed swimming pool, the plans for which were being examined at that time in his Department. Work on that swimming pool has not yet started.  As far as I remember, the Minister at that stage proposed a prototype pool and when I mentioned that it was not suitable, I received an answer to the effect that some people had more money than sense.</P>

      <P>It is not my intention to speak for very long because those who have spoken already have really covered every point in regard to town planning, local government administration and everything else.  However, I feel it my duty to add my voice to what has been said in regard to town planning.  I agree that town planning had to come but the way it is being implemented calls for some comment. Some 12 months ago on this Estimate, I asked the Minister to call every county engineer in the country up to his Department, to take them province by province, if necessary, to meet the senior officials of the Department and himself in order to come to some agreement in regard to plans for nearly everywhere so that a person would know how he was going to get on.</P>
      <P>There is one aspect of town and regional planning which I feel hits one section of the community more than another and that is the section of the community living on islands around our coast.  Perhaps we have more islands off the west coast, and especially off Galway, than any other constituency and with more inhabitants on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">

    <Speaker pid="JohnGeoghegan" hpid="Mr. Geoghegan Mr. Geoghegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Geoghegan</NameTxt>
      <P>In such cases, in regard to town and regional planning, there should be a conference between the Minister's Department, the Local Government engineer under his jurisdiction, and the Gaeltacht engineer under the jurisdiction of the Minister for the Gaeltacht.  If an applicant <Col N="731" /> wishes to build a new house under the Roinn na Gaeltachta scheme, he gets a plan and there should be no need for him to send a site plan looking for planning permission, or outline permission, to build on whatever piece of land he has on an island.  If an applicant is going to build a house under the grant given by the Department of Local Government, the same applies.  In the first place, an applicant must state how many feet he is back from the centre of the main road or broad and if he is not back a certain number of feet, he will not get sanction to build.  There should be some co-operation between the two engineers, the applicant and the Department, so that a man would not have to give a site plan so that he can build a house on an island.</P>
      <P>We have the three islands of Aran and for several days or weeks in the year, it is very difficult to land on at least two of them.  If you land on one of the islands and if the sea plays up, you may have to spend a week or two there.  Any sensible person will say to himself that no engineer will go out there to draw up site plans or housing plans for those people if there is a danger that he may be caught there and has to stay on the island for the night.  It would be sufficient if arrangements were made by the local authority engineer and the two other engineers, the Gaeltacht engineer in charge of Gaeltacht house planning and the Local Government engineer in charge of house planning so that permission could be given to applicants when they visited him.  This would avoid the engineer having to go out to the islands.  The person on the island would obtain permission on the spot and would then be able to go ahead with the new buildings without submitting any more plans.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Geoghegan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the only sensible thing for any authority to do. This would be giving justice to those people.  A lot has been said here about the lining of roads, warnings, corners and that type of thing.  I feel that the Minister for Local Government should impress on the local authority in Galway to instal traffic lights at all <Col N="732" /> the bad corners in the city in order to carry the traffic through safely. There have been a lot of accidents in the city over the past six months.  The roads are lined by the local authority. I often ask myself: &ldquo;If an accident takes place and one vehicle is slightly over the line and the other vehicle is well within its own rights but the line is not in the centre of the road, who is responsible?&rdquo; That is a fair question to ask the Department of Local Government.  If an accident takes place and the line is not properly on the centre of the road, who is responsible? It is the local authority who put the line there, or the man who is slightly over the line?</P>
      <P>There is a question I would like the Minister to look into, and that is, the matter of town and regional planning, especially around cities.  You have applicants from around the city boundary&mdash;I know of them in Galway &mdash;many of whom try to get on with the building of new houses but who are often refused permission.  They get the refusal from the local authority, who say that there is not enough soakage and they cannot allow any more septic tanks.  They ask the applicant to get more ground and perhaps he will get permission.  It is asking too much when you ask him to provide two acres of ground.  If the local authority have a sewerage system that you can sink from the site where the person is building a house, and he cannot get permission, then there is something wrong with the local authority.  The local authority should be able to sink a sewerage system out to where building is taking place.  I feel permission should be given within reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was my only reason for intervening in this debate.  I would sincerely ask the Minister, to come back to my first request, to investigate town and regional planning as it affects applicants, and also to give the people living on islands some chance.  It is hard enough for them to get concrete blocks, cement, sand, timber and other building materials, without being held up for building permission.  It is not easy, even if he is willing, to get an engineer to land on an island when he is not sure he will get off again.  I <Col N="733" /> should like to join with my friend, Deputy Burke, in his last remark, that is, to congratulate the new secretary of the Department of Local Government. He is a west of Ireland man and I feel he will give sound judgment in the cases which come before him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Casey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to delay the House very long with what I have to say.  I have listened to the debate and, in my absence, I have studied the contributions that have been made. They have been very interesting and very valuable indeed.  They have covered a wide field in relation to the authority of the Minister, but I must say, coming from a particularly built-up area, from the city of Cork, that, with all due respect to the previous speaker, the difficulties the speaks of in respect of road lines and septic tanks, must, to us, take second place to the grave problem the two major centres, Dublin and Cork, experience in respect of housing.</P>
      <P>I should like to urge strongly on the Minister, before he addresses himself to what I might refer to as minor problems, that he should come back on the lines and address himself to the obligation which he appears to have forgotten, the matter of re-housing our people in the city of Cork, the city of Dublin and the built-up areas generally. When I say that I say it in the sense that that is his job and we will not thank him for addressing himself to that problem.  That is his major job.  If I may suggest, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, the Minister and the Government have a miserable record in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Instead of devoting himself to matters we regard as footy-footy matters, he appears to have no concern at all for the very grave problem of re-housing our people who are living in hovels, flats and slums.  If anything should be noted regarding his activities, it is that there has been a breakdown with regard to local authorities in this regard.  I do not want to be personally offensive to the Minister.  Indeed, far be that from me, but any member of any local authority, and indeed any member of Cork Corporation, in particular, including <Col N="734" /> Deputies sitting behind him, and councillors who are supporters of his Party, will vouch for the frustration which we have known in this regard.</P>
    <P>I remember, when I had the honour previously of being Lord Mayor of Cork during the period of the inter-Party Government, I was upbraided every night by the people sitting opposite now.  The present Minister for Finance upbraided the inter-Party Government for not supplying the funds to build sufficient houses in the city of Cork and we had Deputy Jack Lynch, as he then was, coming in moving motions condemning the Government, the then Minister for Finance and the then Minister for Local Government for not providing the funds which ran to the extent, at that stage, of £750,000.  We have no such motions now and no such money.  We have nothing like the money that was being provided then for the building of local authority houses but there were plenty of motions condemning the Government and condemning me as Lord Mayor of Cork.  I want to place on record now that there was more money available then for the building of local authority houses in the city of Cork than there is at the present moment and we have no such resolutions from the Fianna Fáil Party either in this House or in Cork Corporation.</P>
    <P>Quite candidly, Sir, I do not want to make political capital out of this and I do not think any member of Cork Corporation, whether a member of my Party, the Fine Gael Party or the Fianna Fáil Party, would wish to do so.  Every member of our City Council is anxious to build houses&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Seeing that the Government supporters are so silent, I think I might speak on their behalf as well as on behalf of every person in Cork City Council.  We need thousands of houses and the fact of the matter is that by reason of the financial situation of the Government at the moment, there is no money to build houses.</P>

      <P>We have been prudent men, as Corkmen are usually prudent. We have acquired plenty of sites.  We have no shortage of labour to build houses.  We have our plans drawn up. All we need is the go-ahead, the indication from the Minister that the money is there to proceed with our plans, but, of course, we are not getting that.  The Minister is not brave enough to stand up and say: &ldquo;Look, you cannot proceed with your housing programme in Cork because we have no money.&rdquo;  He is not brave enough to say that.  Any time I pick up the newspaper I read that he makes statements somewhere or other&mdash;at some chamber of commerce dinner&mdash;that there is more money being provided this year than ever before.  We would like to see the proof of the pudding.  In other words, we in Cork Corporation would like the Minister to say to us: &ldquo;All right, go ahead with that scheme of 600 houses I so seriously interfered with not very long ago.&rdquo;  Perhaps I should explain to you, Sir, and to the House, that we had a very well designed scheme of house building.  We took the precaution over the years that we would never be short of land on which to build houses.  We acquired the land well in advance so that at no stage would we be short of land on the perimeter of Cork city.  We went further and got our planners to design the schemes and everything was well advanced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We cannot be accused, as has been insinuated by one of the Minister's advisers elsewhere, that we fell down on the job.  We had acquired the land, schemes designed and the labour available to build houses and then the Minister, in no sinister way but ill-advised by somebody, intervened to say that he thought we should introduce the system building scheme, and he went to the trouble, and we are grateful to him for it, of coming down to address us in relation to the Glen-Ryan/Assumption Road area where we had planned to build 600 houses.  I think the Minister was well-intentioned. I do not mind saying that were it not for the stupid advice he got from <Col N="736" /> somebody and the stupid advice he conveyed to us on that occasion in Cork Corporation, we would now be well forward in the completion of 600 houses and, God knows, we require 2,700 houses in the city of Cork, but the Minister, ill-advised as he was, intervened and we, stupidly enough, accepted his word.  The net result is that, whereas the Minister said he would immediately undertake the erection of these 600 houses and could do it by system building much more quickly than we could, there is not a brick on a brick.</P>
    <P>The land is there but there is no house.  The Minister, and his advisers, are still talking about it and exchanging correspondence but my constituents, whom I meet every day, are living in hovels and garrets.  It is no use for me to say to Mr. Patrick Murphy when he comes in and tells me he has a wife suffering from tuberculosis and three ailing children and that he is living over a pub and cannot get a pram up there, poor consolation for him, that the Minister for Local Government many moons ago told Cork Corporation that he could build houses more quickly than we could build them and that we were foolish enough to accept that statement?  Can you imagine my explaining all that to that man and can you imagine him going back to his wife and explaining that to her?  Quite obviously&mdash;I can see it now but I did not see it then &mdash;the fact of the matter is that with the limited amount of money available for the building of local authority houses the Minister had to resort to some gimmick to deny Cork Corporation their rightful share of whatever moneys were available.</P>
    <P>The Minister should be brave enough and man enough to stand up and say to the House and to the country: &ldquo;Look, the position is so and so; we have not the money available that we would like to make available: we have not the money which local authorities require and we have not money available to carry out the promises we made at the last general election.&rdquo; I remember quite well, as does every Deputy, the slogan at the hustings at the last general election: <Col N="737" />&ldquo;Let Lemass lead on&rdquo;; &ldquo;Prosperity is around the corner.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>&ldquo;If you want a house vote Fianna Fáil.&rdquo;&ldquo;If you want El Dorado, vote Fianna Fáil.&rdquo;&ldquo;If you want heaven on this earth, vote Fianna Fáil.&rdquo; I can assure the Minister that, in respect of the administration of his Department, the people are &mdash;to put it most charitably&mdash;more than disappointed.  I have in my room in this House my housing file for the city of Cork.  I would not mind showing to the Minister for his edification and, perhaps, his education, the list of living conditions of the people who have called on me seeking rehousing in the city of Cork.  I presume they do not all call on me&mdash;most of them do&mdash; but it would be a revelation for him. Or, if the Minister could spare one of his officers some day to come down to the City Hall to me, I will show him the cases authenticated by the Medical Officer for Health in the city of Cork as to the conditions in which some of our people are living.  If there is anything upon which all of us, of all Parties, in Cork Corporation over the years are united, it is in our efforts to endeavour to rehouse these people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then we have the Minister, misguided by his advisers, asking us to stop building 600 houses, which we would have been progressing with now because he has a scheme and he would build them overnight.  I think the Minister should have a look at this; I think he was fooled by the boys in the Department of Finance and he succeeded in fooling us.  He cannot retrieve the situation in which we now find ourselves but I would appeal to him, even at this very late stage, to regard it as a lesson in his relationship with the Department of Finance and never again be fooled or, if he is fooled, to say so and not try to fool us.  The situation is that the Minister has never admitted he made fools of us, as he did&mdash;not deliberately; I am stressing that&mdash;he made fools of Cork Corporation, of the people of <Col N="738" /> Cork and, worst of all, he made fools of the unfortunate people waiting for rehousing.</P>
    <P>I said I would confine myself to that point.  I hope it will sink into the Minister's head, that he will believe I have made a genuine contribution here and that he will look after it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt at all that this debate is overshadowed by the difficulties which have escalated into real crisis proportions in relation to rehousing throughout the State. While I do not in any way wish to interfere with the problems of my Labour colleague, Deputy Casey, living as I do within the perimeter of the city of Cork, I know perfectly well how serious the situation is and, if authentication were necessary, it would certainly be forthcoming from me that the situation, as described by our Lord Mayor, is absolutely true.  While it is a tremendous problem in the city of Cork, it is no less a problem in many of the isolated areas, particularly in many parts of my constituency, in the áiteanna iargcúlta where every possible contribution which can be made in the way of housing and social amenities becomes a priority because we have to try to arrest the flow of emigration from these areas which are so susceptible to it.</P>
      <P>I am a little chagrined that any Minister should have the effrontery to try to cover up a situation in which no suggestion of additional money is appreciated by local authorities or by the people seeking rehousing because they know perfectly well that, in fact, the moneys being made available this year will do less and considerably less for rehousing than the moneys contributed before.  We know prices have escalated in an alarming way.  We know that over the past couple of years the costs of building have become extremely high and that the amount of money necessary to finance a building scheme has accordingly, and in proportion, increased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no satisfaction in going back to your constituents and the Minister's colleagues behind him know that as well as I do.  They have read some charming statement by the Minister which means Sweet Fanny Adam and <Col N="739" /> they try to persuade you that now the road is clear.  You go back to the local authority, to the various central authorities and you find the situation is still the same.  There is not only a deadlock in relation to planning and sanction but there are, as I have said emphatically, only two speeds appreciated by the Department of Local Government&mdash;dead slow and stop.  The real explanation is, of course, that the financial situation, to the knowledge of all of us, was extremely difficult.  But had we been a little more honest about that, had we got a more realistic spirit of goodwill and co-operation into this House, based on honesty, we might have been able to tackle the problem with less vituperation, with less condemnation than we now do.</P>
    <P>There is no way out of it.  No Ministerial utterances, no slavish repetition by the Minister's henchmen will alter the fact that the people who are actually seeking grants, housing loans, various sanctions in connection with private building, and the local authorities in connection with their public buildings, are experiencing delays, frustration and there is a completely detrimental situation where the morale of these people seeking rehousing is slowly being undermined.  I know, and everybody listening to me knows, how frustration can build up in an unfortunate family with three, four, five, six, seven and, in some cases, eight children in dire need of rehousing.  We know how that frustration can lead to all kinds of social abuse and difficulty, and the responsibility for that can always be laid fairly and strongly on the maladministration, lack of cohesion, lack of co-ordination and lack of effort in the Department of Local Government.</P>
    <P>I am fundamentally a progressive thinker; I am fundamentally somebody who wants to go along with advances, who wants to go along with new methods.  Despite the fact that we have many new developments in building techniques, many new labour-saving devices, many new prestressed methods of construction, we are still lagging behind in any worthwhile, house production to meet the grave <Col N="740" /> necessity, the grave urgency and the grave moral duty there is on this House to give our people habitable and decent conditions in which to live. If we seek to establish a law-abiding and worthwhile society in this country, surely it is our social and moral duty, as rapidly as possible, to provide proper hygienic housing conditions for our people, irrespective of class or creed.</P>
    <P>One of the big difficulties is that we do not get our sense of values, our sense of priorities right.  While I may argue and will argue on another Estimate in connection with the many things that are not being done in regard to agriculture, there is one thing on which we can find agreement: this House will be unanimous in making money available to deal with the problem of housing.  Whether it be in Dublin city or Cork city or in other parts of rural Ireland where the immediate urgency merits a priority, I think we could get unanimity of purpose and strength of co-operation in this House to divert money even temporarily from other developments to get housing under way, to get it tackled realistically, with some real possibility of reaching a solution.</P>
    <P>We all know that in the development of modern society the Government have to find more and more of the capital as well as more and more of the current money to keep the big services going.  I do not think anyone in this House would cavil if something extra were given to alleviate the problems of those people who are living in hovels, in animalistic conditions, in some cases in surroundings worse than the cow byres or outhouses on our farms.  Whole families are living in virtually roofless houses, in conditions so primitive as to be very nearly incredible. I do not think anyone would cavil if the Government gave them priority in the matter of housing.  At the same time, the Government must encourage with every possible injection of finance and drive, those people who are prepared to undertake the building of their own houses with grants and SDA loans.</P>
    <P>I know perfectly well that the Minister <Col N="741" /> is not in charge of the till but he can take it from the trend of this debate that in so far as he wants encouragement to raid the till, he will have the support of all sections of this House so that he can get on with the job that is so necessary.  Strangely enough, I do not think the Minister himself likes the fact that there are so many of these delays and so many of what I would describe as the spurious queries&mdash;I am glad the Department officials are here because I want to repeat emphatically &ldquo;spurious queries&rdquo;&mdash;of the engineers and the so-called experts which go hither and thither between the local authority and the Department.  They are people with equal qualifications and of equal merit and the engineer is on the spot and has more knowledge and more appreciation of the situation than the gentleman who is in a more authoritative position sitting in a luxurious armchair and superintending the plans.</P>

      <P>If it sounded like that to the Chair, the Chair was the only one in the House to whom it did so sound.  We have to face the fact that while we must give priority to the housing problem, there are many other problems in the Department which are worthy of mention.  We must get down to basics and to a commonsense analysis of what limits should be placed on town planning.  There is no doubt that the appeal to the Minister has been effective in many cases.  The Parliamentary Secretary indicated this evening that as many as 50 per cent of the appeals had been successful.  That in itself indicates to me at once that there is some weakness in the system. We know there has been some cavilling at some of the Minister's decisions.  If 50 per cent of the appeals have been successful, the inference is that there must have been some terribly unnecessary refusals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is not the major issue on which I want to cross words with the Minister on town planning.  Deputy Governey referred to permission being refused for a sign in Carlow.  Indeed, <i>Inter alia,</i> there was a simple case in my constituency where an unfortunate person who had put a considerable amount of money into rebuilding and refurbishing a hotel could not get permission to put up a sign indicating where his hotel was: town planning would not allow it.  His personal assessment <Col N="743" /> of the Department was typically American.  He had spent many years in America and had come back to invest his money in this type of development in his native area and he would now be very glad to get rid of the whole establishment as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>There is a dreadful tendency in the type of bureaucracy that is growing up in the country to take every Act as a &ldquo;must&rdquo;and in the case of every power given under an Act to assume that you must exercise it against the interests of the individual.  We seem to be putting the individual in the dock always and making him justify things that really need no justification. Whether that is because of a Parkinson's Law effect that builds up in this situation I do not know, but the fact remains that it has come to exist widely and wildly.  All sorts of things that should be resolved at local authority level are being refused. Reams and reams of circular letters are issued.  Automatically, an application coming in is refused, apparently on the basis that this gives them time to think or will make the other fellow do some thinking.  Small things such as additional rooms, signs and so on should surely be determined without bringing into force the sections of the Town Planning Act.  The Minister, in consultation with the local authority, their officials and his Department, could draw up a sort of general plan under which many of the matters I have referred to and such as those mentioned by Deputy Geoghegan, town planning in islands rapidly being denuded of population, or in areas where all this clap-trap about main roads and main sewers is only moon-shine could be dealt with reasonably and quickly.  The Minister should stipulate that all these matters would be dealt with locally and kept out of the realms of this contentious and acrimonious town planning business.</P>
    <P>I agree completely that in many areas of the country, particularly as regards maintaining a reasonable appearance of progress and development of good type houses and other services, it is necessary to have town <Col N="744" /> planning but in the case of the small changes being made by the addition of a room or by the erection of a sign or where people apply in rather isolated areas for certain types of permission, there should be no question of their applications being refused if they are in the general category of meeting a reasonable standard of planning and the engineers are satisfied that the work will be structurally sound.  It has been indicated that nearly 50 per cent of these appeals succeed and thus it seems reasonable to think that many of the refusals were unreasonable and footling.</P>
    <P>Much has been said about necessary repairs and reconstructions.  Throughout the country the benefits were immense where substantial repairs and reconstruction were done and particularly throughout my constituency where expensive reconstruction has been carried out where grants were available.  Immense progress has been made.  Because of that, now that there is a slowing up in grants and in dealing with plans submitted for reconstruction, the impetus is going out of the effort that was so successful.  It is not entirely the Minister's fault but I urge upon him that any extra money he can scoop from the till should be directed as quickly as possible towards the resurgence of these reconstruction and repair grants so that our standard of housing can be maintained and improved and so that the bad will that has been growing up between the local trader and people who are trying to carry out reconstruction as a result of delays in getting grants, can be obviated and the whole effort revitalised.</P>
    <P>We would all like to see that impetus restored which would enable us to have a conscious pride in the rural areas such as my own and see the standard of housing improving consistently. Not only do many of these places cater for our particular type of tourist trade or package holidays with farmers but they also leave a lasting impression that our standards are improving considerably and that, we as a country and particularly the Government, are making an effort to create <Col N="745" /> excellent conditions for a very wide section of the people.</P>
    <P>I do not in any way want to give priority to anything else over the main rehousing problem but the Minister should be able, at the same time as he is dealing with the rehousing problem, to maintain the emphasis and vitality of reconstruction and repair work throughout the country generally.  There are many complaints by the county council in Cork regarding delays in getting sanction, delays at the planning stage of schemes submitted for housing. I ask the Minister to do what he can to obviate this delay, and even if money is not available now, at least to approve the principles involved and give priority to the schemes so that when money again becomes available for housing, we can have a fair amount of progress.</P>
    <P>It is time for the Minister, together <Col N="746" /> with his experts, to examine many improved methods of construction that will cut down the time factor in the provision of houses.  The delay that has occurred has created a crisis which is putting a time element into the necessity for a tremendous effort to get the houses built.  Without changing conventional methods and with the development of new and quick, effective methods of building, it might well be that we could cut very considerably the time factor in the construction of houses, particularly in the case of vast estates that have to be built by local authorities.</P>
    <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 6th October, 1966.</P>
