      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>This Bill proposes to postpone until 1967 the local elections which were due to be held this year and to extend the terms of office of existing members of local authorities accordingly.  It also provides for the holding of future local elections during the month of June and at quinquennial intervals after 1967, for the holding of annual or quarterly meetings of local authorities this year and for some other consequential matters.</P>
      <P>Important changes in the law governing local elections are in course of preparation.  A Bill is being drafted to repeal certain disqualifications for membership of local authorities and to set up new legal machinery for questioning local elections by petition. It is desirable that these changes should operate in respect of the next local elections, but, while it is my intention to have the Bill introduced as soon as possible, it is unlikely to be enacted this year.  Amendment of certain other aspects of the electoral law, including the extension of postal voting facilities, is also under consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1240" /> Pending the holding of the next local elections under the provisions of the Electoral Act, 1963, special provision was necessary in regard to the holding this year of annual or quarterly meetings by local authorities.  Since 1927 local authorities have been accustomed to hold these meetings during the period between 23rd June and 1st July and this period is specified by the Bill for annual or quarterly meetings this year.  Following the introduction and circulation of the Bill I advised local authorities to make arrangements accordingly and it is proposed that anything so done by the authorities in anticipation of the passing of the Bill will be validated.</P>
    <P>The Bill also includes certain minor consequential provisions concerning appointments of school attendance committees and meetings of vocational education committees.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> For the past three weeks, we have been discussing here the Estimate for the Department of Local Government. That debate lasted a total of eight days.  In the first six days we heard Deputies from every constituency criticising the Minister and the Department for the manner in which the Department had been administered during the past 12 months.  That criticism was well justified.  The Minister took two days to reply and, in the course of his reply, he answered to his own satisfaction apparently, but certainly not to the satisfaction of the Members of this House or of the country, every charge that had been made against him.  He presented himself here as a Minister who had done a job and done it well.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> The Minister presented himself to the House as a Minister who had done his job, and done it well, and as a Minister who deserves the best thanks of the House and of the country.  One would have thought that the Minister would have welcomed an opportunity of being thanked by the electorate for his services to the country during the past 12 months.  One would have thought that he would have welcomed an opportunity of seeking an endorsement of his policy and of his administration by the only people who are really entitled to endorse or to thank, that is, the electorate of this country.  Having boasted of his achievements for two days here, is it not extraordinary that the Minister should now come in this morning and in a speech lasting only a few minutes introduce a Bill seeking to postpone the local elections?  He is introducing a Bill denying the people the right to pass judgment on the local authorities elected as far back as 1960, and, in particular, denying the people the right to pass judgment on the activities of the Minister's Department for the past 12 months.  The facts speak for themselves.  It is obvious that the Minister is afraid to face the electorate. It is obvious that he knows in his heart, despite his protestations, that he has done a bad job, fallen down on the job and is afraid to face the electorate because he knows what the consequences would be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From time to time the Minister protests about being misrepresented and being accused of not being frank with the country.  I have rarely seen a more misleading Short Title to a Bill than the Short Title to the Bill we are discussing. It is entitled &ldquo;An Act to alter the years for holding local elections and to make provision for certain other matters connected with local elections&rdquo;. Anybody reading that title might think that instead of postponing the local elections, which are already two years overdue, we were bringing them forward.  Politicians in the years to come reading the Title of this Bill would never get the impression that <Col N="1242" /> the Government were in fact postponing the overdue local elections for purely Party purposes.</P>
    <P>A more accurate title of this Bill would be &ldquo;An Act to further postpone the latest date for holding local elections now overdue and to legalise retrospectively all acts done by the local authorities since the 8th of June 1966&rdquo; because that in fact is what we are doing.  We are being asked to postpone for a further 12 months local elections which were due to be held in June, 1965, and we are being asked to do that retrospectively because every act done by the local authorities since the 8th June has been an illegal act done in anticipation of having it ratified by this House, and we are now asked to legalise that retrospectively.</P>
    <P>Over 30 years ago, the Fianna Fáil Party introduced politics into local elections for the first time.  Since then, local elections have been fought on a political basis and Parties have put up candidates.  This Party never approved of politics being introduced into local elections but they were introduced by Fianna Fáil and the challenge had to be taken up by this Party.  I say, therefore, that politics having been introduced into the elections, and as the elections are run on a political basis, the electorate should not be deprived of the opportunity, whenever it is due, of passing judgment on the councils which have been elected and on the policy of the Department which controls those councils.  I say that the electorate is entitled to avail of these elections to express its opinion of the representatives who were elected five years earlier.</P>
    <P>It is significant that in the debate on the Estimate for the Department of Local Government, the Minister on several occasions saw fit to blame local authorities in various counties for not measuring up to their requirements, for not playing the ball, as he said. When it was demonstrated that housing had not been progressing as well as it should have been in certain counties, the Minister was not slow to say that it was not the fault of his Department but the fault of the local authorities who had not used the <Col N="1243" /> money available to them or availed of the machinery at their disposal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> Yet the Minister is introducing a Bill this morning to keep in power for a further 12 months beyond the time they should have submitted themselves to the country the very local authorities he criticises.  I suggest I am entitled to draw the attention of the House and the country to that because it seems to me to be an extraordinary situation.  It is equally important, I submit, that when local elections fall due between Parliamentary elections, the country should have an opportunity of availing of such elections to express its opinion on Government policy in so far as it relates to local government.  If ever there was a time in the history of this State when there was more controversy about the Department of Local Government, when there was more criticism of the Minister for Local Government, this is it. Therefore I submit that it is wrong, and very wrong, that these elections should be postponed.</P>
      <P>I think the Bill is a dangerous Bill. It contains all the ingredients of legislation and of Government thinking which should be avoided.  The policy and the mentality behind this Bill is a dangerous policy and a dangerous mentality.  I believe that if this attitude were to be pursued, it can truly be said that this Bill contains within it the seeds of the destruction of democracy as we know it in these islands, because it is a Bill which deprives the people of the right to pass judgment on elected representatives and to put them out of office, if they think fit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say that this Bill contains the seeds of the destruction of democracy as we know it and perhaps it is fortunate that we have an opportunity of discussing it now at the same time as there is sitting here a Committee to revise the Constitution.  It is only a short thought, at any rate, from postponing local government elections to postponing Parliamentary elections.  I am fully <Col N="1244" /> conscious of the fact that the Constitution provides that Parliamentary elections must be held every five years but I sincerely hope the Government's attitude at present, which appears to be reflected in this Bill, will not find its way into that committee examining the Constitution, and that the Government will not toy with the idea of removing from the Constitution the guarantee that Parliamentary elections must be held every five years.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I have finished all I want to say on it.  Those elections have been postponed. This is the second occasion on which a Bill has been introduced to postpone those elections which were due to take place in June, 1965.  I say that they have been postponed for party political purposes.  A general election was held on 7th April, 1965, <Col N="1245" /> in order that the people might be consulted before the true state of the economy and the true financial situation were known.  When June, 1965 came the state of the country, due to maladministration by the Government, was beginning to make itself manifest.  The Government then introduced a Bill to postpone the local elections for 12 months.  Of course, instead of things improving they got much worse.  Money became impossible to find.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> None whatever.  The local elections were postponed from 1965 until 1966. One would have thought that those elections would have been held in 1966 on the same day as the Presidential election.  I think that was the idea at the time they were postponed but again, for party political reasons, those <Col N="1246" /> elections were not held on the same day as the Presidential election.  Now I come to what I consider to be one of the worst features of the Bill.</P>
      <P>It was not introduced into this House in April or May of this year or discussed in this House in April or May of this year, as well it might have been.  Time and time again Parliamentary questions were put to the Minister for Local Government as to when the local government elections would be held.  He avoided answering those questions and he avoided giving any information to the House.  Instead of the Bill being brought before the House and discussed in the month of May or April, before the previous Act had expired, the Minister waits until the Presidential election is safely over, and until we come to the month of October several months after the local elections are due.</P>
      <P>He brings this Bill in retrospectively and asks the House to pass it.  He has taken this deliberative assembly, the Parliament of this country, for granted since the 8th June last.  He has gone merrily on on the assumption that, with his majority, he would be able to steamroll this measure through retrospectively and legalise and render valid all the illegal acts he has permitted the local bodies to do since 8th June last.</P>
      <P>I say that is unsound; it is a bad principle.  It is treating Parliament with nothing but contempt.  It is obvious why the Minister did not introduce this Bill in May or April of this year.  He wanted to avoid having a debate and a discussion on it in this House before the Presidential election was held.  The Government were determined at all times that they would not hold the local elections and the Presidential election on the same day.  When the Minister for Justice was asked, in Carrick-on-Shannon, why he would not hold the Presidential election and the local government elections on the same day he answered: &ldquo;The last time we did that we lost the referendum and we nearly lost the Presidential candidate.&rdquo;  That is putting party and politics before the country.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I did not give that impression.  That was the attitude of the Minister for Justice on that occasion and that has been the attitude of the Government to this matter. So much for the dangerous precedent and unsound principle of this Bill.</P>
      <P>I think, on those grounds, it should be rejected by the House and, having regard to the present financial and economic state of the country, I submit that I am entitled to refer to the gross extravagance and reckless waste of public money which this Bill will entail. It was intended to hold these elections on the same day as the Presidential election on 1st June last.  If that had been done, this country would have been saved £70,000 additional expense. I want to say that, in the Minister's words, £70,000 would provide several swimming pools for the people which the Minister admits he cannot afford to provide with the money at his disposal. It would provide 700 derelict site grants which, for all practical purposes, have been suspended.  It would provide 700 reconstruction grants of £100 each and, for all practical purposes, these grants have been suspended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1248" /> The Minister readily admits that money is scarce and that we are passing through difficult times.  Yet, the Government completely disregard the additional cost to the country which this Bill entails.  This Bill should be rejected by this House, and this Party will oppose it on the ground that it is fundamentaly unsound.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to detain the House long on this Bill. My remarks will be brief.  Subparagraph 5 of Article 16 of the Constitution says that &ldquo;the same Dáil Éireann shall not continue for a longer period than seven years from the date of its first meeting: a shorter period may be fixed by law.&rdquo;  I understand five years has been fixed, but the Constitution says seven years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not go the whole way with Deputy T.J. Fitzpatrick <i>(Cavan),</i> although I go a long way with him in much of what he says.  I do go with him in that it was wrong to postpone the local elections for two years.  It is only a short time since the local elections were held every three years. Then it was decided that they should be held every five years.  I do not blame the Minister for postponing the elections; it was a Government decision. They decided it was not politically <Col N="1249" /> wise to hold the elections in 1965 and then they apparently decided it was politically unwise to hold them in 1966.  They now propose to postpone the elections until 1967.  Having postponed them for 12 months and are now proposing to postpone them again for 12 months, it is quite on the cards that the same Minister will come into this House again and postpone them.</P>
    <P>I think something final should be done about the matter of fixing a date for local elections.  It should not be possible to have a period twice as long as was the normal period.  After all, three years was the normal period. It is now proposed to have a seven year period between the last elections and the next.  That is also true because of the fact that we have had all sorts of talk about the changes which should be made in local administration, particularly in the administration of the health authorities, and indirectly county councils and corporations.</P>
    <P>The Minister said yesterday he had no function whatever in interfering with the setting up of local councils and generally proposed to make regional councils, and a lot of things like that.  One Minister for Health has announced that his successor has been going around the country telling everybody that whether the local authority members like it or not, it is proposed to have regional councils looking after health which was a matter which was normally dealt with by the local authorities.  The Minister for Health also said that it will be the 1970s before he will be able to introduce legislation in this House to put this into operation.</P>
    <P>Possibly this present administration may not be responsible for what will happen in this House in 1970.  I believe the local elections should have been held in 1965.  Since they could not have been held in 1965, they should still be held this year.  It is too bad that we should have this question under debate just to suit the Government of the day.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of this on <Col N="1250" /> which I do not agree with Deputy Fitzpatrick.  He says his Party do not agree with politics in local elections. Could anybody explain to me how you could divorce politics from local elections?  I am aware that no matter under what heading people go into local authorities, they will vote on what their policies have been.</P>

      <P>I would like to make it clear, though it may not be exactly true, that the local elections are the political barometer of the day and show what way the country is thinking.  That is the reason we did not have the local elections in 1965, did not have the local elections in 1966, and if the Government feel that it is not very suitable, we will not have them in 1967.  I am repeating this because I want to be able to say when the time comes: &ldquo;I told you so&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a couple of points which need to be dealt with. For instance, it is suggested that the date of the local elections will be June. Has the Minister thought over this? Has he decided that June is, in fact, the most suitable month for an election? I live in a seaside resort to which people come for their holidays.  We know holidays are cheaper in June than in July or August.  I know that at the last local elections and other elections people have been on holidays and therefore have not bothered to vote. Then if the Minister picks a date late in June, it will run into the haymaking, a period during which, very often, farmers will not find it convenient to vote and for some extraordinary reason, though they may complain afterwards, they do not vote if they have something else to do.  I suggest the Minister should make up his mind as to whether the most suitable time of the year has been selected and we <Col N="1251" /> should know now what the date will be.  I do not know what the Department hope to gain by having it loosely worded so that the elections can be held on any date from 1st to 30th of June.</P>
      <P>There is something else the Minister should look at.  He says he is bringing in legislation later on to deal with certain aspects of local government. There is the question at the present time of, let us call them for convenience, the constituencies.  There are, in this country, areas where we have 13,000 or 14,000 voters represented by five councillors.  Next door to that we have 9,000 voters represented by five councillors.  We have 13,000 voters in the same county represented by seven councillors.  This is something which, apparently, the local authorities, because of the particular majority in control there, do not want to have altered.  The Department of Local Government must take the initiative in having fair representation and the only way they can have fair representation is by laying down the number of voters there should be to each seat, the same as the Dáil elections. I will not talk about the West of Ireland or other places over-represented like Donegal on this Bill; that will come later on.</P>
      <P>There is something else which the Minister should be well aware of and which he must do something about, that is, the tendency in framing Bills coming into this House to put in sections which will disqualify elected representatives from voting in elections. They should be entitled to vote.  The Minister should be careful about that because we have in the last Housing Bill peculiar circumstances which can result in the majority of councillors in a county council being disqualified from voting because of the fact that they, in fact, live in local authority houses.  This sort of thing can make a joke of local authority representation. This is something which should be dealt with if the Minister is considering improving local electoral law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have nothing further to say except that the Labour Party are of the <Col N="1252" /> opinion that the local elections should not be postponed until next June. They should be held as soon as possible, that is, this year.  There should be in the Bill a date on which the local elections will be held and every succeeding local elections will be held and there should be a proviso that in no circumstances will it be possible to postpone local elections at the whim of a Government.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick said one thing which I thought correct, that is, that the cost of the local elections, if they had been held along with the Presidential election, would have been very much less.  I would not go all the way and say £70,000, but it would have been very much less than if the local elections are held on their own.</P>
    <P>Let us not have the old story of the people putting ballot papers in the wrong boxes.  People do not do things like that nowadays.  You will have the odd fellow who does a thing like that because he thinks it is smart but the majority of the people are more intelligent and they ensure that they put the ballot paper in the box for which it was intended.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would appeal to the Minister again not to hold to June for the local elections and let us decide to have them regularly every five years and not at the whim of the Government in power.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasOHara" hpid="Mr. O'Hara Mr. O'Hara">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>It is regrettable, in my opinion, that in the year in which the Irish people had the 1916 celebrations, in which everybody joined, a Minister of a Government of this country should come into this House with a Bill of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been listening, on radio and on television, to what those great men achieved for this country and for the freedom of this country and we all appreciate the efforts made by those great men and women in times of trial and difficulty.  I am sure those people who are now gone to their reward and many of whom sacrificed their lives for this country never visualised a situation in which a Minister of State of this Republic would come into this House with such a Bill, taking from the people <Col N="1253" /> the fundamental right of voting at the proper time in local elections, and all because the Fianna Fáil Party and the Fianna Fáil Minister were well aware that if they came before the people and held the elections at the proper time, they would get their answer.  It is a sad thing that a Minister of State in this Parliament should try such mean tactics to deprive the people of their fundamental right of selecting and electing to urban councils and county councils and, for that matter, to Dáil Éireann, the people of their choice.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his brief statement in introducing this Bill, tried to create the impression that it was for the good of the people generally that he was bringing this Bill to the House as, in fact, he tried last night to create the impression in winding up the debate that this country was well on the road to prosperity and has been on the road to prosperity in relation to housing, sewerage, water and other matters.  If the Minister thinks he is fooling Deputies or the people outside, he is making a mistake, and when the time comes and the people are afforded an opportunity of voting in the local elections, they will give him his answer.</P>
    <P>The people outside, as well as the Deputies, are well aware that the reason the Minister and the Government decided to postpone the elections was that they were afraid to face the people.  There is no doubt in our minds about that.  Deputies on this side of the House, and on the far side of the House, for that matter, know what the reason was for the postponement.  The position has deteriorated rather than improved since the Government decided to postpone the elections and, as things are going, I am convinced that when the appropriate time comes, the Minister and his Party will get their answer.</P>
    <P>I consider, too, that a seven-year period is far too long to deprive the people of the opportunity of expressing their opinion, in the ballot boxes, on their elected representatives.  Yesterday the Minister was very critical of all local authorities round the country.  He was very critical of the methods used in dealing with local affairs, with particular reference to housing, water and <Col N="1254" /> sewerage schemes, in relation to the position here in Dublin, Cork, other cities, and also in the rural areas.  In fact, he must have set an all-time record for the longest speech, in having rambled over the whole of the country from the capital city right round to the rural areas, taking them county by county and urban council by urban council in an effort to belittle the efforts of local representatives who are unpaid for their work and the majority of whom it costs, in my opinion, £2 or £3 a week&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that on this particular Bill we have to keep on the straight and narrow path, and I will try to do so, but I submit that if the Minister had such a bad opinion of these elected representatives around the country, if he thought they were irresponsible&mdash;and that is how he painted the picture&mdash;there was there for him a wonderful opportunity to hold the local elections at the appropriate time and not to retain on these bodies these irresponsible people, as he described them&mdash;if he did not use the word &ldquo;irresponsible&rdquo;, he suggested in the whole of his speech that there were people there who had money for disposal although we all know that that statement was not true&mdash;and permit them to administer affairs at local level.  He had the opportunity, if the elections were held at the appropriate time, of dealing with that and giving to the people who are, in the final analysis, the bosses, that is, the ordinary electorate, the opportunity of saying whom they wanted to represent them in the local councils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Instead of that, of course, we know the Minister was trying to have it both ways.  When he felt there was a danger of his Party suffering defeat at the local elections, he would not take the risk of running the elections and, as Deputy James Tully put it, no doubt it was a Government decision, and not just a decision of the Minister's. But even if he were left on <Col N="1255" /> his own, if I know that gentleman&mdash; and I think I know him fairly well&mdash; he would have made the decision along the same lines and he would be coming into this House with this Bill and trying to get it passed by the Dáil.</P>
    <P>I suggest there is not much we can do about it.  We can protest; we can say we are opposed to these tactics; we can make it known to the public that we are in total disagreement with the Minister's tactics; but the people who really will be able to give the Minister his answer with the passage of time, and when the opportunity arises, are the ordinary people of this city and of the rural areas as well.  I believe the people are only waiting for the opportunity to give the Minister and this Government their answer for what I would describe as three-card-trick tactics and I regret I cannot give them a more responsible title.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Fianna Fáil, in my opinion, are only prolonging their own agony and the agony of the electorate of this country in postponing the local elections.  The local elections were due in 1965 and were postponed until 1966. We have a Bill here today postponing them until 1967, but, as has been pointed out, the Minister for Local Government put in roughly eight hours this week and last week boasting of the achievements of his Department, both in rural Ireland and in Dublin city.  If that is so, why is he afraid to submit his candidates to the electorate? He knows that what he told us here in the past few days is a completely untrue picture and that is the reason he is most anxious to postpone these elections.  He is depending upon the majority he has here in the House to push through this Bill, just as the Fianna Fáil Party depended on the majority, aided and abetted by a number of Independents in the Leitrim County Council, last week to push through the co-option of a candidate of theirs.</P>

      <P>We all know that the reason for the postponement of the elections is the want of finance.  The general election came in 1965 and came before the true financial situation was known to the country; that was what brought about that election. When that election was over, the Minister and the Government knew well at that particular time that they had no intention of running the local elections in either 1966 or probably in 1967.

We all know the reason that was not done.  The point is that they will have to find £70,000 more from the Exchequer to pay for these elections, whenever they decide to hold them, and I rather doubt if they will be held next year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say a few words on this Bill, the purpose of which is to postpone the local elections until June of next year. So far so good.  All one can talk about in connection with this Bill, without getting into what I call pure politics which I do not propose to get into, is why the elections were not held some time last spring.  The Presidential election and the 1916 celebrations and commemorations kept the country in a heightened state, and I suppose there was an idea that something as humble as the local elections would be a come-down. I think that was a mistake.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick and Deputy Reynolds referred to the cost of the local elections.  Apparently it is something like £70,000.  That is not to be sneezed at, but I do not think it is the most important aspect.  It is an important aspect but not the most important.  The idea that the local elections were second-class elections came inevitably from their postponement, and from the refusal to hold them at the same time as the Presidential election.  That was a mistake from the point of view that it gave rise to the idea that the local elections were not very important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They are enormously important.  A great deal of the life of the community in general is debated and decided at local government level.  It is not necessarily at a lower level than the parliamentary level, but it is at a different level.  It is not good for our people to have the idea that it is at a lower level.  We are still a very young State.  We know, of course, that we are an old country with a long history, but we are young in the administration of self-government.  Most of the better <Col N="1258" /> legislative minds that have dealt with our problems over the past 40 odd years have recognised that a buildingup process was very necessary and very desirable in Ireland&mdash;building-up and a strengthening of our people in the arts of self-government.</P>
    <P>One of the greatest arts of self-government is the art of local government. Especially nowadays, with the State coming more and more into the lives of the people these matters should be tested at local government level. These matters should be discussed and public opinion tested and indeed formed at the level of the councils and county councils throughout Ireland. Matters dealing with roads and behaviour on the roads, and all that type of thing, reach the consciousness of the public through that medium in a far better way that they could through discussion in Dáil Éireann, so anything that tends to denigrate the importance of local elections is not good.  For that reason alone it would have been a good thing to hold what is the greatest election in this country at the same time as ones which individually are much more humble but which in their general effect are of enormous importance for the dignity of the country at large.  Next June is probably as good a time as any to hold these elections.  I will come back to that again.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred in his speech to the important changes which he was going to bring into the law governing local elections.  He gave some hints as to what will happen.  He said:</P>
    <P>A Bill is being drafted to repeal certain disqualifications for membership of local authorities and to set up new legal machinery for questioning local elections by petition.</P>
    <P>I and the House would very much welcome more details as to what is intended in that measure.  In view of that very desirable need to build up public opinion in that respect, the Minister and all Ministers should not lose any opportunity to inform public opinion by illuminating the scene which they propose to change by legal action and by new Bills.</P>
    <P>It is a pity that the Minister did <Col N="1259" /> not give us more details about what he is going to do.  I wonder has he or have the Government any notion of bringing into our elections something they have in other countries where one-third or one-quarter of the body go out of certain councils after a given period.  Some members retire after a year and there are elections all the time.  I am not very sure that that is a good thing.  It means that every year some elections are held and there is never a general municipal election.  At least that would prevent the disruption which large elections bring about.</P>
    <P>We who are politicians and who are engaged in that avocation whether or not professionally&mdash;and by that I mean whether or not we are engaged in it wholetime&mdash;are apt to lose sight of the fact that, while we are endeavouring to carry out the wishes of the people, while we are endeavouring to govern the country at Parliamentary level and administer local councils at local government level, our electorate are not always pleased&mdash;in fact very seldom&mdash;when disturbed by an election.  Municipal elections have become really minor general elections and mean a considerable disruption of the ordinary life of the community and business people and others do not particularly welcome them.  Neither do they welcome general elections and, therefore, we should try to minimise the disruption brought about.  From that point of view there is something to be said for the policy of electing a few persons to each council every year.  I hope the Minister will consider that.</P>
    <P>Personally, I have no firm views on that method of election.  It has points for and against it but it does prevent the big disruption that an overall municipal election causes.  I would be the first to say that is democracy working and it is a necessary thing but we must take into account that many people do not realise the necessity for it and can become disgruntled and fail to vote because they consider the election a disruption of their business and almost an invasion of their <Col N="1260" /> privacy and free time.  We would be wise to take that into account in considering the general question when matters are being recast in that respect.</P>
    <P>I have been a member of Dublin Corporation for about 25 years and before that I was for some years on Dún Laoghaire Corporation.  Generally speaking, in spite of the faults and weaknesses of councils I would say the public on the whole are well served by their local representatives although they do not always realise that and councillors do not always show their true worth.  Sometimes at meetings when the Press is present they talk politically and do not get down to work when, in fact, the same councillors may be very hard-working and doing a great deal of solid constructive work in committee meetings which are not open to the public.</P>
    <P>There used to be on Dublin Corporation commercial representatives who came from a commercial register and it was felt that as business people contributing through the rates very large sums to local taxation it was only just that they should have special representation.  Through the years I am constantly aware of the lack we now suffer through the absence of commercial representatives.  We have some commercial representatives in Dublin Corporation and in Dún Laoghaire Borough Council and in the County Council but they are not there specifically as business representatives and that tends all the time to make these various bodies politically minded, always viewing things from a political angle more than from a business point of view.</P>
    <P>I am not trying to make the case, for a moment, that there should be any overwhelming representation of the business community.  Various reform Acts were brought in over a century ago which altered that situation and nobody wishes to go back to that but a balance is an important thing and it would be for the good of the community at large and lead to better deliberations by those bodies if there was a commercial register so that there would be a number of commercially-minded people elected to</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1261" /> Dublin Corporation and Dún Laoghaire Borough Council.  The county is a different matter but in the case of these two bodies which deal exclusively with urban matters it would strengthen them and make them much more effective in dealing with matters which vitally affect the commercial community, if they had commercial representatives.</P>
    <P>In saying &ldquo;commercial community&rdquo; I am not referring only to business people themselves.  Nowadays we realise that every business is composed of all the people who work in it and you cannot affect any business adversely without affecting the lives and happiness of all the employees and their families.  When I say &ldquo;commercial community&rdquo; I mean that in the very widest sense, including those who are employed and get their livelihood in it.  I should like the Minister to consider that when he is contemplating altering the electoral machinary and going into the various matters concerning councils throughout the country.  I am sure that in other cities in Ireland the changes I have advocated would make for better management of councils.</P>
    <P>It is a pity we did not get our elections over in 1960 and thus avoid-a recurrence of what has been occurring, namely, that in the spring of 1965 we had a general election, in the spring of 1966 we had the Presidential election and in the spring of 1967, we shall have the local elections which, as I have said, present as big a disruption of life generally as does a general election.  In future, therefore, every effort should be made to telescope the different elections, not only for reasons of cost but so that we shall keep before our people the very high purpose served by local elections.</P>

      <P>I have listened from the outset to the debate and may I say that from listening to Deputy Fitzpatrick from Cavan, I formed the opinion that his was a complaining speech in the sense that he charged Fianna Fáil with trying to postpone the local elections in order to postpone judgement on policy?  The Fine Gael <Col N="1262" /> Party cannot have it both ways.  Had we decided to hold the local elections on the same date as the Presidential election, the Fine Gael Party could equally obviously say, as they said some years ago and as newspaper commentators and leader writers said, that we were doing it mainly for Party purposes, putting Party interests before the flag.  How can Fine Gael have it both ways?  This applies equally to the Labour Party because I can remember Labour Deputies saying in the House that we were putting our Party&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>As I have said, neither can Labour have it both ways. Deputies have said this is a manoeuvre on our part.  Quite a few members of the Fianna Fáil Party would have welcomed the local elections on the same date as the Presidential election not merely from the point of view of getting the local elections over, of getting the work done.  I should point out that on any council where Fine Gael have a majority, they have made full use of it.  There is no denying that politics have entered at local level.  We have always had politics in local matters and it would be a pity if we had not. If we had not Fianna Fáil.  Fine Gael and Labour in local councils we might have some other type of Party in them. To say we can cut out politics from local elections is pure fantasy.  We are not living in a Plato republic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whatever faults our political Parties may have, whatever motives may urge us on in politics, there is this much to be said on behalf of members of local authorities: what they do, the <Col N="1263" /> services they perform are done in the open, subject to comment, subject to review in the newspapers and all the rest of it.  To that extent it is a good thing we should have politics at local level, that we should have open competition, thereby letting the people decide on which Party they want to hold a majority in each local authority. Deputy James Tully asked me to quote.  I do not wish to resort to quotations on this short Bill which is merely to regularise the position.  All of us hope we shall have the elections early in the coming year.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will have an opportunity of speaking on this matter.  Some of us would much prefer an earlier date from many points of view which I shall not go into now.  I wish to repeat that it serves no purpose to have Deputies coming into the House blaming the Government for fixing the date for local elections, saying it is being done from Party motives.  It would have suited us better if we had the local elections on the same date as the Presidential election. There was no reason why we should feel the wrath of the electorate any more than Fine Gael or Labour.  Now that local government has assumed such wide scope in administration that it covers every aspect of everyday life, if I may put it that way, people will be able to judge in each locality what is being done and how the various political parties shape up to their respective responsibilities.  In that respect it can be said that there is no ulterior motive in bringing in this Bill at this time to regularise the position and ensure that the local elections will be held early next year.</P>

      <P>The last speaker mentioned his desire and that of his Party to have the local elections held as soon as possible.  This could be easily done this morning.  I understand there is a majority of Opposition Deputies in the House and if we could have the agreement of the Fianna Fáil Party, there could be a vote on this matter right away and the elections could be held within a month.  That would fulfil all the expectations of the last speaker.</P>
      <P>I am one of the Deputies here who suffer the disadvantage, since my election to Dáil Éireann, of not being a member of Dublin Corporation.  The local elections which were to have been held in the year of that election were postponed for one reason or another, and it is now past the memory of most of us, and certainly past the memory of many of the citizens of Dublin, when the last local elections were held.  My Party are very anxious that these local elections be held as soon as possible.  There is a growing feeling that many members of Dublin Corporation are out of touch with their constituents and the problems of Dublin.  My Party have only seven members out of a membership of 47.  We are very anxious to change that state of affairs because Dublin Corporation is controlled by an alliance of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael councillors, with some satellite Independents.</P>

      <P>I do not follow the reasoning of that.  However, it is quite a long time since these councillors were elected, and in order to bring them back to a sense of reality, the sooner the elections are held the better. We ourselves hope to have as many candidates as possible for these local elections to give the citizens an opportunity of returning a majority of Labour councillors to Dublin Corporation. Many of the things that require municipal control in Dublin cannot be gone into properly until the majority of the councillors of Dublin Corporation are agreed in regard to certain changes in the administration of the city.  I do not think any capital city in Europe is more badly managed than Dublin is at the moment.  Councillors do not appear to be in control of the things that are happening in Dublin, and there does not appear to be the machinery to enable councillors to keep an adequate check on the activities of the officials.</P>

      <P>It is important that these elections be held as soon as possible so that reforms can be brought about in the administration of Dublin Corporation, reforms that will give the councillors proper knowledge of what is going on and give them the necessary powers to check upon activities which would be against the interest of the citizens.  The sooner the elections are held the better because the majority of the members of Dublin Corporation, that is, excluding the Labour members, who are in close contact with their constituents, are out of touch with the realities of life.  This distance from reality is probably more marked among Fianna Fáil councillors because they have to back up the activities of a Minister for Local Government who has failed dismally on housing.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>This measure before the House this morning is regrettably <Col N="1266" /> necessary.  I regard it as regrettable because the introduction of retrospective legislation is undesirable.  I wonder how much local government would be affected by the non-passage of this Bill.  Looking after local government affairs seems to be a matter of administration rather than government. In section 1 (1) (a), we have the phrase &mdash;and I wonder if it is another pious expression&mdash;that &ldquo;the election shall be held quinquennially thereafter&rdquo;.  It seems rather pointless to put that into a Bill if, for one reason or another, elections can be postponed once more.</P>
      <P>Another point one might mention is in relation to sub-committees.  Take, for instance, the section dealing with the School Attendance Act.  Is there any real value in that when no provision is being made in regard to the appointment of new committees?  It is just a continuing process.</P>
      <P>The Minister speaks in his statement of a Bill being drafted to repeal certain disqualifications from membership of local authorities.  He says this Bill is not likely to be enacted this year.  I am sure a great many people would like to know whether this Bill will be in accordance with the electoral laws at present in force and which were recently enacted in this House.  Does the Minister contemplate that in the new Bill he will make certain changes which will be at variance with existing electoral law?  If he does and if he considers it desirable to do so, I cannot understand why we do not further postpone the elections until that Bill is ready.  If changes are to be made, why not postpone the elections pending that Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the last Electoral Act certain disqualifications were removed in regard to the enrolment of electors and their exercise of the franchise.  Disabilities under which candidates had suffered under electoral law were removed as a result of a study made at the time by the Electoral Law Committee. The matter was discussed at length prior to the Bill being debated in the House.  It is a pity the Minister did not give some indication as to what exactly is the intention in this regard.  I take it that the Minister will be legislating for improvement.  Is there <Col N="1267" /> any reason why we should hold elections next year under what would, under the new Bill to be introduced, be regarded as an antiquated system?  I understand that a new system is being devised which is supposed to confer benefits on candidates for election and on the electorate, who would have the benefit of new candidates.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to certain other aspects of electoral law, including the extension of postal voting facilities. The extension of postal voting was canvassed on previous occasions.  It was suggested that certain sections of the community were deprived of their vote by reason of the fact that their business took them away from home on the occasion of an election.  This happens to a large section of people, travellers and so on.  It is proposed that local elections be held next year and quinquennially thereafter.  That means that if the Bill which the Minister has indicated will be introduced is introduced in 1967 and secures a passage by the following year, the voting community will not have the advantages of that Bill in the 1967 local elections and will not have them for five years thereafter.  One wonders whether we should not continue to postpone the local elections or legalise the <i>de facto</i> postponement which is taking place. One wonders whether we should not go the whole way with the Minister's desire to introduce a Bill designed to improve the machinery of local elections and to remove certain disqualifications for membership of local authorities.  Local administration has been mentioned as one of the places where the younger persons might find their feet in the matter of the exercise of the franchise and of representation and is a very valuable training ground.</P>
    <P>The Minister has devoted a good deal of his statement to the proposed changes, including the question of the new legal machinery, and says it is desirable that these changes should operate in respect of the next local elections.  He says that while it is desirable that they should operate and while it is his intention to have the Bill introduced, it is unlikely to be enacted.  In other words, the Bill has <Col N="1268" /> reached the stage of being on the stocks; the Minister considers it desirable that it should be enacted but&mdash; and it is a very important &ldquo;but&rdquo;&mdash;he says it is unlikely to be enacted.  In that case I want to suggest to the Minister that it was a pity that, instead of postponing the elections for this 12 months, he did not decide to introduce a Bill postponing them until the Bill he has in mind is enacted.  I do not think anybody would have cribbed if the position was to be improved in so far as representation is concerned.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) of section 3 refers to meetings being regarded as quinquennial meetings.  I cannot understand why they should be regarded as quinquennial when they are not quinquennial. It would be more honest to say that they will have the same power as if they were quinquennial.  I do not think it does any good to legislate in that fashion.  The provision does not express what, in fact, happens.</P>
    <P>The question of local elections is a very important matter for local people.  As I have said on many occasions here, the real question, as has been referred to by Deputy O'Leary, is what the local authority can do, whether it is a corporation or a county council.  The powers of the local authority are hedged around by the County Management Act.  The effective power left to the local authority is hedged around by that Act.  It is really of no great concern whether local elections are held every five years or every ten years, if local representatives have not got the right, as they ought to have, to decide local issues.  This omnibus Act governs all the activities of the local authority. The only thing is that you have a chairman to sign the necessary orders made by the county council, a council meeting on a certain date to pass a rate and, after that, the annual election date on which the chairman of the council or mayor of the town or lord mayor of the city is elected.  In regard to the new Bill, the Minister might consider the desirability of including provisions designed to do what he has said he has been doing for some time, namely, cutting the red tape, shortening the process and taking <Col N="1269" /> matters down to local level where decisions can be made.</P>

I regret that it is necessary to bring this Bill before the House.  It would be much better for the members of local authorities if we adhered rigidly to the system of holding the elections within the statutory period, without having this House imposing its will on the local authorities in regard to these matters and depriving the electorate of their rights under the electoral laws.</P>

      <P>Certain charges have been made against the Government and the Minister in relation to the delay in holding the local elections. I am sure there are members of the Parties opposite who are very glad the local elections were postponed. Their future membership of local authorities may have been in the balance and the extra year or two was, I feel sure, of great importance to them.  I am sorry the local elections were postponed.  Now that they are being held in 1967, I am sorry the new Bill is not in operation so that the new councils would take up office with the knowledge that people who should have been disqualified in the past were eliminated and that other people were now in a position to be elected to local authorities.  However, that is not to be. I trust the Bill will be implemented as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>There is little advantage to the Government and the Fianna Fáil Party in postponing the elections from last year to this year or next year.  Had they been held last year, there would have been quite a change on local councils.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dockrell referred to the question of commercial representatives and said that this matter should be considered.  The corporation had commercial representatives in the past, as had other councils.  These people with commercial interests will get the opportunity of presenting themselves for election and when duly elected, will be able to speak on behalf of the people they represent.  Every opportunity will be afforded to those contesting the elections.  I do not believe any particular section should be given the opportunity of entering the council without having the confidence of the people.  If one section is brought in in that fashion, I cannot see any reason why corporation tenants and other interests should not have representation in the same manner.</P>
      <P>As a member of a local authority for about 12 years, I feel that quite a number of changes are necessary in relation to local politics.  Mention has been made of Party politics entering into local affairs to an undue degree. It can happen that the political paupers of some of the Parties will try to introduce every item as a political item in order to ensure that the terrorising tactics that are often used will prevail.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>We in the Labour Party object strongly to any further delay in the holding of the local elections. Those who offered themselves to the public in 1960 to be members of local authorities did so on the basis that they would represent the people for a period of five years.  It is our opinion that, at the end of the period of five years, the Fianna Fáil Party and the Minister postponed the elections that should have been held in 1965, for political purposes.  We know that when the elections were due to be held in 1965, the reason given for not holding them was the general election. However, it was quite obvious to all that the reason they were not held in 1965 was the deplorable state of the country, which was so obvious in June of that year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A tremendous change has occurred in the mumblings of Fianna Fáil spokesmen from the time of the general election campaign in 1965.  The tune changed after they had been returned as the Government in this House and they postponed the local elections to <Col N="1277" /> this year, in the forlorn hope that things might improve to such an extent it would be possible for members of the Fianna Fáil Party to present themselves to the electorate for election to local authorities with some degree of confidence that they might, once more, be able to hoodwink the people.  However, they found that was not possible in 1966 and the gimmick of the Presidential election was used to postpone the local elections again.</P>
    <P>We feel very strongly in this matter. This is a democratic society and the people have the right to be given the opportunity of expressing their views about the stewardship of their elected representatives, and they have that right every five years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">

      <P>Deputy Dowling spoke before I rose and he and many of his colleagues are not now in what I should describe as a very enviable position in relation to local elections.  They probably feel that, if they could get away with a further postponement, the people will have forgotten many of the things best forgotten about Fianna Fáil, things for which Fianna Fáil have been directly responsible and things in relation to which the people want the right to express in the most emphatic way their particular view through the medium of the polling station.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many issues in local government at the moment which will have to be faced up to in a responsible manner by local representatives. Fianna Fáil councillors will have to make a stand.  One of the most controversial issues on which they will have to make a stand is the revision of the differential renting system. Fianna Fáil have a majority on Dublin Corporation and they are in the unhappy position of not being able to <Col N="1278" /> come down on the side of justice, on the side of fairness&mdash;&mdash;</P>

We in the Labour Party are most anxious that the people should be given the opportunity of exercising their democratic right and we regard this as illustrating the jeopardy into which democratic freedom is being put.  This discussion follows immediately on the Taoiseach's announcement yesterday, in reply to a question with regard to Telefís Éireann, in which it was made quite clear how little regard Fianna Fáil have for democracy if another system will suit their immediate ends.  We ask the Fianna Fáil Party and the Fianna Fáil Government to give the people an opportunity now of deciding.  We are not afraid to face the people; we are not afraid to go before them and give an account of our stewardship.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash; I did not express any opinions there that I have not expressed in this House, in Dublin Corporation and elsewhere, and I shall continue to express them, irrespective of the way in which the Minister for Local Government cracks the whip.  I do not have to jump through a particular hoop as Deputy Dowling has to jump and I am afraid Deputy Dowling and his colleagues are very conscious of the fact that there is more than a chance of their being caught halfway through, if the people are allowed to exercise their democratic right and give their view now on what they think of the present Administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The main proposal in this Bill is to postpone the elections for a further year beyond the point of time at which they should have been held and to deprive the people of their democratic right to pass judgment on the performance of the Government, and particularly of the Minister for Local Government, represents to me a further abuse of Government power. As other speakers have said, abuses of Government power are becoming more numerous in recent years.  Certain reasons are given for the postponement and of course they are not the real reasons.  We all know why the elections were postponed last year but there was some justification for a postponement then because many members of this</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1280" /> House are also members of local authorities, and it would hardly be fair to expect that they should stand the burden and strain of two elections in the same year.  I would say there was some justification for postponing local elections in the year of a general election but it was deplorable that these elections should have been further postponed in the present year.  They were postponed at a time when a considerable saving could have been effected if they had been held in conjunction with the Presidential election.</P>
    <P>We all know how scarce money is at present, how difficult it is to get money for essential services of one sort or another, but the Government have decided to abuse their power simply because the country is going through a serious economic crisis, a crisis brought about by their mismanagement. They are afraid to face the electorate and they are postponing the day in the hope that there will be turn for the better.  They are postponing it because of the hopeless position in relation to housing, because rates are at an all-time high and the capacity of the people to pay rates is less as time passes because of the increased cost of living and the hopeless prices for cattle and sheep at present.</P>
    <P>We are being asked to agree to this Bill for some reasons which are certainly not spelled out and in anticipation of legislation to be brought forward.  It seems strange to me that this Bill should be brought in at present.  If we can legalise what has happened since last June by this retrospective legislation, I fail to see why we could not wait that bit longer and again legalise by retrospective legislation what has happened in the meantime, in order to give the Minister an opportunity to bring in this new legislation in relation to local authority work to which he referred in his opening speech.  He said that important changes in the law governing local elections are in course of preparation. It is quite unfair to give that as a reason for postponing the elections and not to spell out the changes.</P>
    <P>One matter referred to was the extension of the postal vote.  It is well <Col N="1281" /> known that we on this side brought in a Bill for this purpose and it was rejected by the Government Party without good reason.  We brought it in to extend the facility of the postal vote to a large section of people who are precluded from voting under the present system.  Now it is proposed to introduce something of that sort but we are not told to what extent it is proposed to do it.  At the same time, we are being pressed to accept this Bill.  There have been two postponements and I should like to ask the Minister if the Government next year feel like it in the circumstances prevailing, will there be a further postponement and a further abuse of the power they have in law, by denying the people the right to pass judgment on them?</P>

This Bill seeks to set, not in any specific way, but in a general way, a date for the next local elections.  It does not give a date but mentions next June.  I want to suggest that in fact this charade about local elections is unreal and it would be far more honest if the Government &mdash;and all political Parties&mdash;were to forget about local elections altogether, because the representatives on local authorities are no more than &ldquo;fall guys&rdquo; for the managers and the Minister.

      <P>I bow to your ruling, of course, as I am always anxious to abide by the Standing Orders of the House.  At the same time, it appears to me that the discussion has been very restricted.  Surely, if the Bill proposes to hold elections, and I wish to point out the actual position which local authority representatives hold as a whole, it should be considered relevant?  However, if you say it is not relevant, so be it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To return to the actual narrow point which the Bill makes in regard to the date of the elections, it has been stated here that it is seven years since the last occasion when the electorate had an opportunity of deciding who would populate the local authorities throughout the country.  Many of us have regard for democracy.  I do not for a moment suggest that all the Members of this House have very much regard for democracy.  In fact, I suggest that most members of the Fianna Fáil Party <Col N="1284" /> at least, have nothing but contempt for democracy.  They feel that if they cannot fashion it to their will, then democracy is nought.  Those of us who cherish the ideal of a free choice by the people of our representatives know that those people are no more than ciphers in the local authorities by reason of the hold which the managers and the Minister have over them.</P>
    <P>Those of us who feel that we must maintain the thin grasp we have on the remnants of democracy, relevant to the election of local authorities, regard it as a scandalous shame that seven years have elapsed since there was an opportunity for the people either to return those who are now members or to replace them with others.  It is verifiable that on inquiry from most local authorities, it will be found that from one-third to one-half of the membership has been changed in that seven years by reason of members dying or resigning and being replaced by co-option. It would be interesting to know how many co-opted members there are in Dublin Corporation.  I certainly know there has been a number in Dublin county and I suppose there also has been a number of co-options throughout the country.</P>
    <P>This is the very opposite of what is meant by the exercise of the franchise in democratic elections.  A great deal of the abuses arising in local authorities are the result of co-option in a large measure and these co-options have become necessary because we have not had local elections for so long. It was understandable, I suppose, that local elections were not held at the time of the last general election, although I remember local elections being held in conjunction with a general election and it was not found to be all that hard on the candidates.</P>
    <P>I remember a previous occasion when there was a Presidential election on the same day.  This was a device which, of course, worked to produce substantial Fianna Fáil representation on many county councils and other local authorities throughout the country because the machine, the home-made Tammany, which we have all come to know, was at its peak at that time.  Whatever arguments may <Col N="1285" /> have been adduced in favour of postponing the elections to some other year, other than the year in which a general election takes place, there was certainly no valid argument whatsoever brought forward for not holding the local elections in the present year.</P>

      <P>In any event, as Deputy Barry reminded me, the reason the elections were not held this year was the fact that the energies of the nation might have been dissipated by local candidates for county councils seeking support for themselves rather than doing their national duty.  This was obviously what happened but it might have worked the other way.  At the same time, the fact that this step was taken is, as I have said, one more piece of evidence that the Party now temporarily occupying the Government benches are in the condition of senility in which they are.</P>

      <P>To turn to the Bill, we have no assurance in it, and we should like the Minister to give us an assurance.  I challenge him to give us an assurance that this is the last postponement there will, in fact, be on the local elections. It is a matter of considerable concern to the 800 odd councillors up and down the country, if for no other reason than the relationship it has to the Upper Chamber, apart altogether from the fact that members of the local authorities, and the members to be, the various rúnaithe of the cumainn, have their eyes open for unseating the present leaders with all possible expedition. It is characteristic of the Tammany party.  It is only fair that they should have assurance from the Minister for Local Government that this is the occasion when they can make their effort.  Many of them have been engaged in long-distance efforts. The Bill provides in a vague way for the possibility of local elections in June.</P>

      <P>Again, the rules of order, and indeed more than the rules of order, the canons of order and the laws in relation to profanity forbid me to answer in the kind of language Deputy Dowling so deserves.  As I was saying, people, even in the Minister's Party, are entitled to know whether there will definitely be local elections in June next.  People who are about to enter public life have a right to be told that in six months' time D-day will be upon them.  The same can be said for some who are about to make their exit from public life, who will have to put their political affairs in order and retrieve from the wreckage whatever they may need in the years that lie ahead.</P>
      <P>I have no intention of delaying the House unduly on this matter.  I merely want to express my view, which I feel strongly, that it would not be right that we should have any discussion regarding local authorities in this House without there being some advertence to the importance of these authorities.  I know this matter is not covered in the Bill but we are not offered any opportunity of making reference to the situation wherein, as I have said, members of local authorities are made a whipping-boy by the public for every piece of misfeasance which can be laid at their door by the managers of the Department of Local Government.  I hope that I will have another opportunity of raising that in a much broader way.  In the meantime, I think that the Bill is long overdue and we should, in fact, have the local elections much earlier than the date set out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is simple in its terms but it shows the desirability of having local elections. For my own part I wonder what useful purpose would be served by having local elections.  As the situation is at present, elected representatives of the local authorities tend more and more to be of political groups.  The difficulty for the ordinary citizen who elects them is that it becomes a competition very largely for popular support with a view to parliamentary elections.</P>
      <P>In the present situation a person who is not a member of a local authority might wonder what can our local authorities do.  The clamour from local authorities, as far as I can see, is, under political pressure, for more and more money from the central authority and after that there is little enough heard of them.  The point I am making is whether local elections in themselves are, under present circumstances, as important as some people try to make out.  They certainly should be separate from the Parliamentary elections.</P>
      <P>I should like to develop the point about Parliamentary elections but I shall leave it at that because I can see that I could very easily get out of order and I do not want to do that.</P>

      <P>It is this.  In 1965, there was the general election.  It was desirable that the Parliamentary and local government elections should not be held together.  This year there was another election and whether one regarded it from the point of view of the Opposition in 1945 or from the point of view of the present Opposition there is very good reason for not having confusion.  Therefore, the only thing that could be done was introduce this Bill and for that reason I think it should be passed.  It does not call for very much comment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am at a loss to know what exactly one can say in relation to whether or not there should be local elections having regard to the rulings on this matter.  The last speaker raised a very pertinent point when he asked: &ldquo;What can local authorities do?&rdquo; I think this comes within the ambit of this Bill because the Bill, from my reading of it, says that the local elections should be held in June of next year.  That being so, one should be allowed to make a case as to whether or not there should be local elections next year and for what purpose.  I submit that local elections are regarded by a number of people as miniature general elections.  They are an opportunity for the people to indicate how they feel about local affairs which are very much related to national affairs.</P>
      <P>It is a well-known fact that local authorities are stepping-stones to either this House or the Seanad.  That being so, local election time is an occasion when people are afforded an opportunity to account for their stewardship and the electorate in turn are afforded an opportunity of saying whether or not they are satisfied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can say, as a member of Dublin Corporation, that the local elections are long overdue.  They are overdue because of the fact that what the <Col N="1291" /> people in relation to local affairs desired in the city of Dublin certainly did not come about.  There are many events taking place and there are many things which should be done not being done because of the way the local authority operates.</P>
    <P>In the second paragraph of his speech in connection with this Bill, the Minister says:</P>
    <P>Important changes in the law governing local elections are in course of preparation.  A Bill is being drafted to repeal certain disqualifications for membership of local authorities and to set up new legal machinery for questioning local elections by petition.</P>
    <P>In the last paragraph he says:</P>
    <P>The Bill also includes certain minor consequential provisions concerning appointments of school attendance committees and meetings of vocational education committees.</P>
    <P>Why go so far and then go no further? Why can we not have an indication from the Minister when he makes this point that he intends or does not intend to take steps to alter the way in which local affairs are administered?</P>
    <P>One of my colleagues referred to, and, indeed, I think Deputy de Valera adverted to it in a certain way, the question of whether or not any useful purpose is served by having local authorities, particularly in regard to managerial functions.  This is something which is related to this Bill because we should decide whether or not it is necessary to have local elections.</P>
    <P>I agree with previous speakers that those elections have been held off and I think anybody, no matter what his political affiliations, will agree they have been held off deliberately because the time was not opportune so far as the Government were concerned to hold the elections.  That does not answer the problem.  As Deputy Cluskey said, we are living in a democracy, at least we are supposed to be, and surely the people should be afforded an opportunity of saying whether or not they are satisfied with the administration of local affairs.</P>
    <P>There are many facets of local affairs which are crying out for attention.  If <Col N="1292" /> the Minister is now saying that the local elections should take place in June of next year, as Deputy Seán Dunne said, can we have any assurance that they will, in fact, take place? Can we have an assurance that things that are not desired by the people will not be perpetrated against them in the meantime?  Can we have an assurance that the people will be afforded an opportunity of saying how they feel about the manner in which their local affairs are being administered?  Will the people be given an opportunity, if and when county managers carry out Ministerial instructions in connection with rents, of deciding, through the ballot box, whether or not they agree with it?</P>
    <P>I submit that there is little point in having this Bill if we are not afforded an opportunity of making a case for and against whether or not it should be today or tomorrow.  We submit it should be instantly, because people need the opportunity, and deserve the opportunity to make known how they feel about local affairs.  There is no denying the fact that there is a situation in existence in Dublin which requires attention for a number of years.  There has been a housing emergency in Dublin for three years now and surely that alone constitutes a need for local elections?  We read in the papers every day expressions of fear on the part of tenants of local authorities who are seeking to have something to say, were they but given the opportunity.  I would expect the Minister at least to make a case as to why the local elections should be further postponed.  What is wrong in having the local elections next month, for example?  We have our own views and, indeed, the reasons given from these benches can well be substantiated as to why the elections have already been postponed.</P>
    <P>Bearing in mind these valid reasons and the dissatisfaction that exists, surely an opportunity should be given to the people to determine how they feel about the members of local authorities, how they feel about lending themselves to a situation not looked upon with favour by them?  Having regard to the fact that the Minister did <Col N="1293" /> say he was looking into this position, that he was preparing a new measure, might I ask him, also having regard to what he has said in his statement, if it is his intention to give members of local authorities more power?  This is a very pertinent point because there are quite a number of people, apart from members of local authorities, who have become very much aware of the inability of members of local authorities to do something positive with regard to local affairs.</P>

      <P>I want to intervene briefly to say that, in my honest view, there is no justification whatever for postponing the local elections still further to June 1967.  I want to make a point which I believe has not been made already here in regard to local elections, that is, that too many people here in this House have little or no regard for rural Ireland at all.  The Minister for Local Government and most Deputies here will agree with me when I say that, when the last local elections were held in the month of June 1960, the poll in rural areas was an all-time low.  That was so because the month of June in the country, especially for the farming community, is one of those months when people are extra busy and if one gets a fine day in the 30 days of June, one is busy saving hay and so forth.  I am wondering now if it is the attitude of the Minister for Local Government and the Government to forget completely that rural Ireland exists at all and if there is any consideration for the people in the country when it comes to fixing the time and dates for local or national elections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I want to suggest now more than anything else is that, while I disagree completely with the postponement of the local elections for the past two years, I do not think there is any reason whatever the Minister can put forward to justify postponing them further than March of 1967.  Let us look at it this way&mdash;January and February are regarded as months when the weather is rather hazardous and there might be a danger that people <Col N="1294" /> could not get out one way or the other but the month of March would suit most people, whether it be in Dublin or the country.  I am suggesting now in all seriousness to the Minister that he have a second look at this Bill and, rather than suggest June 1967, should suggest March 1967.  That would be giving the people two advantages.  It would give them the chance, denied them for two years, to change their local representatives, and would also give them a chance of voicing their opinion with regard to the national parliament one way or the other.  At this stage the Minister should decide to have these local elections in March 1967, rather than June 1967 and at least show the people in the country they are not forgotten completely and that their views or decisions are not altogether forgotten either.</P>

      <P>Great play is being made with the reasons for postponing these local elections until 1967 and all sorts of motives are being attributed to Fianna Fáil, to the Government and to the Minister for Local Government in relation to this postponement.  But what really puzzles me is that, when a year or so ago we were postponing them until some time, any time, within 1966, the reasons then enunciated as to the advisability of postponing them were agreed to as being good reasons by the Fine Gael speakers.  In regard to that, I should say that at column 800, Volume 217, No. 5 of the Official Report, we had Deputy Clinton&mdash; who was the chief spokesman last year for the Fine Gael Opposition on local government matters&mdash;at that time opening his remarks by saying:</P>
      <P>We on this side of the House are in general agreement with the proposals in the Bill.</P>
      <P>He goes on again and says:</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, I think it is quite a sensible thing to postpone the elections for another year even if many people are anxious to have an opportunity to express their dissatisfaction with the way local government matters have gone during the past few years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1295" /> He continued in the same column:</P>
    <P>Members of the House who are also members of local authorities have had their fill of elections for one year.</P>
    <P>and further down in the same column he says:</P>
    <P>I disagree with this view in the circumstances in which we find ourselves</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;that is the view that these people are dissatisfied and want to have a go at whoever was in the councils for some years past.</P>
    <P>Deputy James Tully, in the same debate&mdash;which incidentally was a very short one&mdash;opened his remarks, at column 802, by saying:</P>
    <P>I have no objection to the postponement of the elections.</P>
    <P>If those two spokesmen&mdash;I take it they were acting as spokesmen for their two Parties&mdash;had those views to express about a year ago in regard to a postponement, for which there was no different reason from that which exists in relation to the proposed postponement, how come there is such play being made and so many motives being dragged out of nowhere to be attributed to Fianna Fáil for presenting this Bill to the House?</P>

Where he gets these understandings, I do not know.  I am not disputing that his point of view, at this particular juncture, may appear very reasonable to him but he will pardon the rest of us if we cannot go right along with him and agree that this understanding was there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were only three speakers on this Bill to which I have referred: one from Fine Gael, one from Labour, and <Col N="1296" /> myself.  Lest it might be said that there was a slip of the tongue on Deputy Tully's part, or that I quoted his first words only, at column 803 of the same volume he said:</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset &mdash;and I have quoted the outset&mdash;&mdash; we have no objection &mdash;he said &ldquo;I&rdquo; the first time&mdash;&mdash; to the postponement.</P>
    <P>Further down in the same column he said:</P>
    <P>I expect that this will not be a very contentious Bill and that it will not hold up the House...</P>
    <P>It is a pity that the same sentiment could not have been expressed and maintained in regard to this Bill.</P>

Not only are they now inconsistent with their predecessors and founders but they are absolutely inconsistent with what was said by the Fine Gael spokesman who spoke on the postponing Bill a year ago.  All one can say is: what happened to Fine Gael in the meantime?  What happened to bring about this departure from the sentiments they expressed in similar circumstances last year which were consistent with what was done by Cumann na nGaedheal 40 years ago?</P>

      <P>There is no point in talking to a man who when he has seen he has made a blunder will not admit it.  Deputy Clinton claims that <Col N="1303" /> his Bill of last year would have extended postal voting&mdash;as he claims, to quote his own words&mdash;&ldquo;to a large section of the people&rdquo;.  The large section of the people according to the figures we can get would be approximately 4,000 and the electorate generally is 1,700,000.  If 4,000 in relation to 1,700,000 is &ldquo;a large proportion&rdquo; of that figure and if this is the measure of the accuracy of Deputy Clinton in this debate, then I think we can ignore almost anything else he says.</P>
      <P>In fairness, I may say that the postal vote, without any of this clap-trap we hear about &ldquo;a large section of the people&rdquo;&mdash;4,000 out of 1,700,000&mdash; has already been extended without any flourish of trumpets to 6,000 or 7,000 people by the present Minister and Government and we are not going around trying to tell the people that this is something that only we could give.  According to Deputy Clinton, the 4,000 is &ldquo;a large section&rdquo; of 1,700,000.  Then Deputy Fitzpatrick described the Bill as an instrument to destroy local democracy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I begin to wonder if the Deputy knows anything about democracy, national or local, judging from the way in which during the past couple of days he has kept interjecting and interrupting, despite the best efforts of the Chair to keep order. If that is his view of national or local democracy, it is not my view of how democracy should work in this House. This Bill, as we know, is a simple, straightforward measure the like of which Members of the House have not had experience of in the past, the recent past or the distant past, and its description in the terms used by Deputy Fitzpatrick can only be understood when one begins to appreciate the sort of Deputy the Deputy is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy James Tully spoke about fair representation.  He said there are local areas, counties, local councils, <Col N="1304" /> where the number of electors related to the number of elected members shows wide disparity and that this is unfair representation.  The funny thing about it is that we cannot expect to have agreement in Fine Gael on this matter.  That being so, how could we expect to get agreement between Fine Gael and Labour?  It was particularly interesting to note that Deputy M. Dockrell has quite a different view about this.  He would have us change back to what we had years ago, back to giving more votes to ratepayers in some way related to their total valuation. According to him, it should no longer be as it is now, one man, one vote.  He would have us revert to the old system of not having the heads counted but the money counted so that those with the most money and the most property would have votes corresponding to that wealth and property.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I can never see Deputy Tully and the Fine Gael spokesman achieving unity of views on what fair representation should be.  It is even more strange to find not only Deputy Tully's Party members in some of our cities but the Fine Gael members in our city councils here and there throughout the country howling when I made, or indicated that I was about to make, changes in these cities to give fairer representation related to the number of heads <i>versus</i> the number of seats by setting up the ward system and designating the seats nearly equally in relation to the population. Where, I ask, can I turn then except to my own Party?</P>

In these circumstances, one would be better occupied looking anywhere than over there.  There is no help from over there.  I should like to see fair representation, as Deputy Tully says.</P>

      <P>It is quite simple. There was an assertion that we are filching from the local authorities and the people their legal rights or their constitutional rights, or both.  There was an assertion that the local elections were being held every three years. If we check back a bit, we shall find that when the three years were supposed to be the term between local elections, during a period of 30 years, <Col N="1306" /> there were exactly six elections held, which gives an average spread of about five years.  Instead of having the election every three years as designated by law, the average gap between the elections was not three years but five years.  If we are to become mathematical about it and relate three to five, how are we to relate five to seven? I know Deputy Fitzpatrick will work this out and be forced down on the side of the Minister for Local Government who is speaking here at the moment.</P>
      <P>We had contributions from a few other Deputies and the one I appreciated most was Deputy O'Hara from Mayo, this morning bright and early. I am delighted he is now back in the House.

After the past two days&mdash;I finished at 10.30 last night&mdash;I was amazed and gratified to hear Deputy O'Hara, who listened to a lot of my speech during the past couple of days and who contributed a lot to my speech by way of interruptions, complain because I did not speak sufficiently long this morning.</P>

      <P>Though the reasons are valid for my decision that there should <Col N="1307" /> be a postponement &mdash; as valid as they were when they agreed with them here &mdash; they are now sorry and angry and disappointed that they are not allowed to do as they habitually have done&mdash; try to make use of national difficulties for their own petty political advantage even in local elections.  According to their own professions, Fine Gael and their predecessors, Cumann na nGaedheal, never believed in and in fact, condemned roundly year in and year out, the use of Party politics in local elections.  It is amazing that, in spite of those professions, Fine Gael would now avail themselves of the local elections in order to gain political advantage by distortion of our national difficulties.  It is only the sort of mind displayed by Fine Gael over years that would be capable of doing that, and I am sure that if they are still around in 1970 and in 1980, we shall experience this duplicity again.  However, many elections over the years, including local elections, have shown that the electorate as a whole have not been taken in by the duplicity of Fine Gael, or certainly have not been taken in consistently.  Even we in Fianna Fáil really believed at one time that Fine Gael meant what they said about deploring Party politics in local affairs until we found to our cost this was not so.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Tully said earlier today, no matter how a person goes before the electorate, no matter what way he may be described, when the life of the council to which he has been elected has run its course, whether it is the fixed course or an extended course, we always find that these people join up into Party political groups.  Because of this I am firmly convinced, as is Deputy Tully in the Labour Party, that there is nothing whatever wrong with Party politics in any election, that there is every reason why Parties should declare themselves for what they are rather than go around in various cloaks before an election not belonging to the &ldquo;bunch over there&rdquo; sort of thing but, as soon as they get in, almost invariably having no difficulty whatsoever in finding where they belong, for the very good reason that they knew where they belonged before they started out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1308" /> This Fine Gael practice of cloaking the real purpose of some of the candidates has worked for them in the past, but it will work in fewer places in the future.  This may be a fair tactic but it is not one for which I have a very great liking.  I prefer to go out and fight the election on the basis of the candidates' declaring their affiliations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that, due to traffic congestion on the main Dublin-Swords road, the Ballymun road is now being used by a heavy volume of traffic?  Many of these people going to the airport travel very fast. The extension of the speed limit to a point beyond the school would be an added safeguard until the school is built.  As the Minister is aware, the school is in the course of being built at present.  There is a considerable amount of anxiety in relation to the safety of these children.  In addition, there is no traffic warden either.  About 100 children from the estate use it.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is presumably referring to the reduction of 12/- per cwt. which took place the previous week.</P>
      <P>I understand that the Pigs and Bacon Commission, which is the body responsible for the marketing of Irish bacon in the form of Wiltshire sides in Britain, did not agree that the reduction was justified and that the Commission as a body discussed the matter with the pricing agents' committee in London on 5th October.  The price of Irish bacon in Britain was increased by 17/- per cwt. on the following day whereas the prices of other bacon generally were increased by only 5/-per cwt.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (a) the number of people at present employed at the sweet factory of the Condensed Milk Company, County Limerick; (b) the number laid off and the compensation paid to them for years of service; and (c) what plans, if any, are proposed for its expansion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">

      <P>The number at present employed at the factory of Cleeves Confectionery (Limerick) Ltd., is 53, a reduction of 35 as compared with a year ago.  The reduction is due mainly to the employment of fewer casual staff because of a falling-off in sales.  Casual employees are recruited on a temporary basis when required <Col N="1316" /> and no question of compensation for loss of employment arises.  No other staff were laid off during the year but one employee died, two retired on age grounds and one left of his own accord to take up other employment.  <i>Ex gratia</i> payments amounting to £235 were made to the two employees who retired and to a dependant of the deceased employee.</P>

      <P>In view of the falling off in the sales of this industry in Limerick, would the Minister undertake an investigation into its running in order that we may improve the employment situation in Limerick? Because of the potential in the Condensed Milk Company and the fact that the raw material is ready at hand, the Minister should insist that a sales drive be instituted immediately.</P>

I should add, too, that it has been established as a result of inquiries made by the Prices Advisory Body, and similarly in 1956 when I think there was an inquiry into this matter, that, generally, what happens is that when the price of cattle goes up substantially, the price of meat will rise but not in proportion to the rise in the price of cattle, that is, it will rise to a lesser proportion.  When the price of cattle goes down, then the price of meat will go down but, again, not in proportion.  In other words, they carry some of the increase and they recover it, then, when the price of cattle goes down.</P>

      <P>The importation of tobacco from Rhodesia is prohibited except under licence since 18th January, 1966.  In practice, licences have been granted only for tobacco which had already left Rhodesia or for which a definite commitment to pay for the goods had been entered into prior to the 18th January, 1966.  In the circumstances, no special action to control the export of such tobacco is necessary. I might add that most of the licences so far issued have been in respect of Rhodesian tobacco being imported from the United Kingdom.</P>

Séard is cúis leis an méadú mór seo ná gur árdaíodh rátaí cúnaimh shóisialaigh ó thosach mí Lúnasa, 1965, agus rátaí árachais shóisialaigh ó thosach mí Eanáir, 1966.  Meastar go gcosnóidh na méadaithe sin maille leis na feabhsaithe eile a rinneadh ins na scéimeanna tuairim is naoi milliún go leith punt i rith na bliana seo.  Beidh tuairim is milliún eile de bhreis caiteachais i mbliana toisc líon na néilitheoirí a bheith ag dul i méid, agus dá bhrí sin meastar go mbeidh beagnach £10,500,000 ag teastáil i mbliana thar mar a deonadh don bhliain seo chaite. Táthar ag súil, ámh, le teacht isteach breise de £4 milliún toisc gur árdaíodh na rátaí ranníoca ó thosach mí Eanáir, <Col N="1325" /> 1966, agus gur árdaíodh an teorainn árachais ó £800 go £1,200 le héifeacht ó mhí Meán Fómhair, 1965.  Mar sin tá suim ghlan de tuairim is sé mhilliún go leith punt sa bhreis ag teastáil.</P>
    <P>B'fhéidir gur cheart dom a rá go bhfuil comparáid á dhéanamh agam idir Meastachán 1966-67 agus Bun-Mheastachán 1965-66 de réir mar a taispeántar iad i Leabhar na Meastachán. Is eol do Theachtaí, ámh, gur aontaíodh le Meastachán Forlíontach i mí Márta seo chaite chun an caiteachas breise ó mí Lúnasa, 1965, ar sheirbhísí cúnaimh agus ó mí Eanáir, 1966, ar sheirbhísí árachais a íoc.

    <P>Tá £176,000 sa bhreis de dhíth i gcóir costais riaracháin i mbliana.  I gcás árachais shóisialaigh, siad na seirbhísí is mó is cúis leis an méadú ná sochar míchumais, breis agus dhá mhilliún punt, pinsin seanaoise ranníocacha £1,850,000, sochar dífhostaíochta, tuairim is milliún punt, agus pinsin baintrí, breis agus milliún go leith punt.

    <P>The net Estimate for my Department for the financial year 1966-67 is £42,203,000 as compared with an original Estimate of £35,508,000 for the year 1965-66.  The increase of £6,695,000 is a consequence of the very substantial improvements in the social services resulting from the enactment of the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1965.  When that measure was before the House in June of last year, I pointed out that its provisions were expected to increase the gross expenditure on social welfare by £9.53 million in a full year. This estimate still stands.  In fact the total gross cost of the assistance and insurance services, leaving out administration  <Col N="1326" /> costs, is expected to be higher by £10,479,000 in the current year than the original Estimate for last year.  About £9½ million of this is attributable to the legislation I have just mentioned, and the balance reflects mainly an upward trend in expenditure.</P>
    <P>In regard to administration&mdash;Subheads A to D of the Estimate&mdash;there is an overall increase of £176,000. Slightly over half of this increase is in respect of salaries, wages and allowances, reflecting the higher levels of remuneration arising from salary revisions in recent years.  In addition to the 1,947 officers shown at Part III of the Estimate, provision is made under Subhead A for the remuneration of 87 managers of branch employment offices and 323 clerks to old age pension committees and sub-committees. The increase of £37,760 under Subhead D is caused by an increase of 20 per cent in the capitation rate on which payments to medical certifiers for the issue of free medical certificates to insured persons are based.</P>
    <P>Under Subhead E&mdash;Payment to the Social Insurance Fund&mdash;there is an increase of £2,732,000.  As Deputies are aware, this is a net subhead which provides only for the portion of the cost of the insurance services falling on the Exchequer.  The detailed estimate of the expenditure and income of the Fund is set out in the appendix to the published Estimate.  It will be seen from the appendix that the estimated total cost of the insurance benefits in the current year is £30,591,000 as compared with £24,024,000 for 1965-66. The services primarily responsible for this increase of £6,567,000 are disability benefit £2,044,000, old age (contributory) pensions £1,850,000, unemployment benefit £1,000,000 approximately and widows' and orphans' (contributory) pensions £1,538,000.  These increases are, of course, a reflection of the substantially increased rates of payment which came into operation at the beginning of January last.  The income of the Fund is expected to increase by £4,000,000 as compared with last year because of the increased contribution rates effective from January, 1966, and the <Col N="1327" /> raising of the insurability limit for non-manual workers from £800 to £1,200 from September, 1965.  The net result is that the payment from the Exchequer to the Social Insurance Fund is estimated at £12,450,000 as compared with £9,718,000 last year.</P>
    <P>In the case of Social Assistance&mdash; Subheads G to K&mdash;the estimated increase is £3,912,000.  Non-contributory old age pensions are responsible for £2,635,000 of the increase, unemployment assistance for £813,000 and widows' and orphans' non-contributory pensions for £400,000.  These increases are due very largely to the higher rates of payment in operation since August, 1965, and also, in the case of unemployment assistance, to the change as from January, 1966, in the method of assessing the means of smallholders in congested districts.  An increase of £50,000 is forecast under Subhead H&mdash;Children's Allowances&mdash; because of a continuing upward trend in the number of qualified children.</P>
    <P>The comparisons I have made between the estimated expenditure for this year and for last year are based on the figures in the published Estimates Volume for 1966-67.  In other words, I have compared the Estimate for 1966-67 with the original Estimate for 1965-66.  Deputies are aware that in March last the House agreed to a Supplementary Estimate was required mainly to meet the increased cost in 1965-66 of the provisions of the 1965 Act.  Thus, while the figures shown in the current Estimates Volume in respect of 1965-66 do not represent the full estimated expenditure in that year, I thought it would be less confusing to base comparisons on the figures as published.  I should, however, mention that when we take the Supplementary Estimate of £3,835,000 into account, the net provision sought this year is £2,860,000 more than the revised provision for last year.</P>
    <P>In the course of the debate on the Supplementary Estimate the practice of asking the House to vote additional money for social welfare towards the <Col N="1328" /> end of the year was criticised.  I endeavoured to clarify the position by pointing out that as the Book of Estimates is published before the Budget, it is not possible to include the estimated cost of any increases which may be provided for in the Budget.  Accordingly, the Estimate now before the House does not, and could not, include any provision for the improvements provided in the 1966 Social Welfare Act which will come into operation as from the 1st November next.  I will, very likely, have to seek additional provision for these increases before the end of the present financial year.  I mention this now in the hope that Deputies will not be surprised should there be another Supplementary Estimate before the end of the present financial year.</P>

      <P>Sé tuairim Fhine Gael nach bhfuil dóthain sa Mheastachán seo.  Ach ós rud é gur fearr leathbhollóg ná easpa aráin nílimid i gcoinne an Mheastacháin.  Dúirt an tAire nach bhfuil ach £2,860,000 sa tsuim bhreise atá ag teastáil don bhliain seo thar mar a deonadh anuraidh.  Sé mo thuairim gur breis de 5 nó de 6 faoin gcéad an méid sin cé gur 75 faoin gcéad an méid ba cheart a bheith ann.</P>
      <P>The small increase this year reflects little more than the amount necessary to maintain the already grossly inadequate standard of social services which we have.  The Minister pointed out, quite rightly, that in regard to administration, the overall increase represents £176,000, of which half was in respect of higher levels of remuneration. It is not unreasonable to say that if persons in receipt of salaries, wages and allowances achieve an increase of those dimensions, the amount sought this year in respect of increased allowances and benefits under the social welfare code reflects to a considerable extent the increase in the cost of living, the increase which has to be paid by people for necessary services.  Therefore, that further reduces the significance of this year's increase to a paltry 2½ per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We in Fine Gael believe that if we <Col N="1329" /> are to achieve a just society within a period of five years, social welfare allowances must be increased by not less than 75 per cent, that is, accepting that monetary values remain static, but our economic and financial experience is such as to justify and anticipate that in order to achieve a better level of improvements, we would need to have something like a 100 per cent improvement in social welfare benefits.  The Minister and other critics of the Fine Gael objective to achieve a just society say that we are liberal in proposing improvements and not so ready to suggest ways in which the money can be made available.  We have indicated in a very clear way that we consider that within the targets which the present Administration has already set for itself in its Second Programme for Economic Expansion, there is room, without additional taxation, for providing a more equitable distribution of the national cake.  Even if this is not possible&mdash;and we feel the inflationary spiral which the Government have initiated and continue to encourage, may make it impossible to achieve their targets without additional taxation&mdash;we believe that the public conscience is sufficiently disturbed that the better-off sections would endure an increase in the burden of taxation if such were directly related to improvements in social welfare benefits.  Unfortunately, the experience under the present Administration has been that while they boast time and again that improvements in the social welfare code will follow if there is an increase in taxation, the reverse has been the experience.</P>
    <P>We had, some years ago, tens of thousands of the taxpayer's money spent on advertisements to justify the turnover tax which we were told was going to provide better social welfare and health benefits but we know that far from better services being provided, the reverse happened because the real value of money needed to finance these services has decreased.  However, we think it desirable that in future if there are to be increased tax impositions, we should relate those impositions specifically to the creation of a social welfare fund so that the people would have the <Col N="1330" /> feeling that they were paying directly for improved services.</P>
    <P>We think it regrettable that notwithstanding any improvements in various sectors of our national life over the past 40 years and notwithstanding improvements in our social welfare services, we are in fact falling behind the rest of Europe.  That is a situation which in the experience of our own people here is regrettable but it is also a situation which will create considerable difficulty for us in the future, if and when we become associated economically and financially with any great European social and economic structure because it is clear that those structures require all their members to maintain equal social standards.</P>
    <P>Whenever we in Fine Gael have criticised the present administration for their failure to move with European countries, whenever we have criticised them for their failure to maintain their rate of progress at such a pace that there would not be any great differential between our welfare services and those abroad, the Minister has endeavoured to cloak the arguments advanced by us to suggest there were various fringe benefits which we did not take into account.  I do not think the situation is as confusing as the Minister seems to suggest.</P>
    <P>We know that there are hardly any two countries which have identical social welfare schemes.  They are paid for in different ways; they are administered in different ways and their ultimate results are different; but we think it is possible, taking an overall assessment in different countries, that we could improve them.  The Minister has said we are not comparing like with like.  I believe you cannot do it in detail but you can in a global way.  The OECD, UNESCO and other international organisations have done this.  We are prepared to rely on them.  If you accept those figures, you will find that the Irish figure is exceedingly low and will have to be greatly improved if we are not to have increasing injustice in the future.  I use the word &ldquo;injustice&rdquo; in a general way to mean inequality of treatment, unnecessary differentials, advantageous treatment for one section of the community and disadvantageous treatment for others.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1331" /> We have, unfortunately, here in our social and economic code, two strata and, instead of endeavouring to bridge the gap between those, we continue in our legislation, year in and year out, to crystallise those prejudices of days gone by.  Take, for instance, the differential in treatment which we operate between manual workers and non-manual workers.  A manual worker is still regarded as a person who is to be hired and fired at short notice, who is not to have a pension related to his job and whose unemployment benefits are to be maintained at a standard barely sufficient to keep body and soul together.  On the other hand, non-manual workers, by agreement which they have been able to negotiate for themselves, and by the kind of snob theory which operates here, are regarded as people who are entitled to a great deal more than the manual workers.  Some of those non-manual workers enjoy generous pensions, to which often they have not contributed themselves, and in many ways they are treated as privileged members of the community.</P>
    <P>We need, if we are to have a just society here, to break down those prejudices of days gone by and treat everybody, whether he be regarded as a so-called manual worker or a non-manual worker, as equal so far as conditions of employment and benefits of employment are concerned.  Our social welfare code is bristling with prejudices so that we need an entirely different approach to social welfare matters.  We want to get away from the Victorian approach which is operating at the present time.</P>
    <P>I have said before, not meaning to be offensive but to be objective, our Department of Social Welfare has become little more than an accounting agency for the Department of Finance. They are more concerned with ensuring accuracy in bookkeeping than with the provision of a humanitarian service for people who have fallen on difficult days.  It is time we took a look at our whole social welfare code and endeavoured to assess whether or not we are helping some section of the community adequately or fully by giving them purely monetary payments <Col N="1332" /> more comfort, better living conditions more comfort, better living conditions, and better prospects of recovery by affording to them domiciliary services, medical services, food services and clothing services through a domiciliary welfare scheme.</P>
    <P>It is significant that private people here have appreciated the need for domiciliary services.  A great deal of credit must be given to those people, particularly in Dublin city, who are at present organising a meals on wheels service.  This service per head of population could benefit more but would probably cost less than some of the State schemes of monetary payments but the real effect in many cases will be that many elderly people and disabled people, for the first time in years, will receive one square meal and one well-prepared hot meal a day.  This is because this takes into account not merely that money is needed to live but that one also needs help, skill and the will to be able to live properly.</P>
    <P>There are very many elderly people who are unable to manage on the paltry amount of money given to them by the State, not merely because in monetary terms it is inadequate, but also because, working alone and in isolation, it is impossible to arrange and discipline one's life to get the best out of life.  I believe the State should endeavour to encourage those kinds of services and expand them.  I believe that with the more human type of service which could be given under the auspices of the Department of Social Welfare, the overall effect would be of greater advantage than just adding a little money here and adding a little there, year in and year out, without regard for the ability of the recipient to spend the money wisely.</P>
    <P>One of the most difficult Departments of State to deal with in regard to its activities and scope is the Department of Social Welfare.  This is because all its activities are related to what the statutes and regulations say it may or may not do.  Somebody has described Local Government law as a jungle but the jungle of the Department of Local Government is, I think, a desert compared with the jungle of the Department  <Col N="1333" /> of Social Welfare with its legislation, rules and regulations.  It is an extraordinary thing that although that is so, the impact is a very individual and a very personal one.  I think the Minister ought to encourage his Department to use plain English when dealing with the numerous people who address their little problems to the Department for attention.  It is regrettable to have to state that one of the worst scriveners available to us is the Department of Social Welfare.  Write about any of the multitudinous things that are proper to a Department of State to one of the other Departments and you will receive a legible type-written letter in language which people can understand.  But communicate with the Department of Social Welfare and you will get in one or other of the official languages a paper which is of the worst quality Government stationery in a form which will contain innumerable errors with interlinear alterations in every type of indecipherable scrawl.  I am sure members of this House have also had great difficulty in trying to understand these missives, but it becomes absolutely impossible for people who are not familiar with the dialogue of the Department of Social Welfare to understand what some of these notices may mean.  In addition to that, you have the Department on some occasions using phrases in the Irish language which even Irish linguists are unable to understand.  It is time to call a halt to the confusing camouflage which the Department of Social Welfare so readily put up.</P>
    <P>Some time ago I received a communication from the Department of Social Welfare which I passed on to one of my constituents.  This communication read:</P>
    <P>Tá orm a admháil go bhfuarthas do litir (Uimh. Thagartha....)</P>
    <P>Then there was a long line and the end of the brackets.  Then it went on:</P>
    <P>den ... 26-7-1966.</P>
    <P>The final message was:</P>
    <P>Táthar ag déileáil léithi.</P>
    <P>I passed this to my constituent but he, on receiving it in the post, took it to the Christian Brothers in one of the <Col N="1334" /> schools in my constituency.  The Christian Brothers thought the matter was urgent and referred the man back to my door.  He was advised late in the evening that some great benefit was being given him.  He was amazed to learn that the last phrase meant &ldquo;Táthar ag féachaint chuichi&rdquo;; in other words, &ldquo;They are looking into it&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I have told my constituents the meaning of &ldquo;Táthar ag déileáil léithi&rdquo;. I think we ought to be primarily concerned with the least fortunate and lesser educated members of the community and that we should not use phrases and language, in either of the official languages, beyond the comprehension of even relatively educated people.  Therefore, I would appeal to the Minister to ensure, even though it may mean a small increase in administration costs, in overheads, in stationery and an increase in the number of typists in his Department, that there is a substantial improvement made in future in appearance, layout and form in papers from his Department because even Deputies have the greatest difficulty in trying to decipher some of the communications from the Minister's Department.</P>
    <P>I notice the Minister did not, in his address, refer to the considerable saving he has enjoyed because of the increases granted earlier this year to British pensioners here.  I think he said earlier this year, replying to a Parliamentary Question, that it was in the region of £800,000 but I may be wrong in that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>My personal experience is that an increasing number of people are having their pensions cut.  I heard from people who had their pensions cut that they had them restored in part.  The figure is not even £250,000 but it is big enough to justify mention in the Minister's address.  I am not sure <Col N="1335" /> whether that £250,000 is included in or excluded from the Minister's figure for last year or for this year.  It ought to have been isolated for special redistribution to the sections of the community who are in most need of increased benefits.</P>
      <P>I should like to draw attention to a problem which mercifully does not frequently occur but it is one which, I think, ought to receive the Minister's sympathy and attention.  It is one which can be remedied in the regulations.  At present, the mother of an illegitimate child is unable to get benefit for that child if she loses her employment, and if she is living with a relative and, in particular, if the relative with whom she is living is a person who is himself in receipt of social welfare benefit.  I have in mind the mother of an illegitimate child who, through no fault of hers, became unemployed.  She was living with her father and because he was the head of the household the mother of this child was unable to get benefit.  Her father was an extremely difficult person to deal with.  Like many old people he resented the presence of the child, not because of the status of the child but because old people generally are unable to endure the crying and wailing and domestic upset of children.  He was not contributing anything towards the child's food or clothing bills and this mother was in dire distress because of the fact that she had not sufficient means herself, through her own unemployment benefit, adequately to maintain herself and her child.  I think it should be possible to look at this on the merits and, where circumstances appear to justify it, payment of unemployment benefit in relation to such a child should be made by the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another problem of administration which I think ought to be remedied.  I refer to the frequency of delays in the payment of weekly disability benefit, particularly where the disabled person, the person who is ill, is required to make weekly certificates available.  I am sure that a number of Members of this House have had complaints about these.  Our invariable experience is that when you convey <Col N="1336" /> these complaints to the Department, you receive from the Department an apologia which asserts that your complainant is wrong, that the Department are right and they have issued payment on specific days and within the time that it should have been issued.  One is not always in a position to contradict the Department but I have seen cases where the Department asserted that they posted payments on particular days and where the postmarks on the envelopes containing the benefits were, in fact, one or two days subsequent to the dates on which the Department believed that they had posted the letters.  It may be that the Department handed them over to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and that a delay then occurred and that the Department of Posts and Telegraphs did not frank the letters on the day on which they received them, but if this is so or whatever the reason, I should like to see a substantial improvement in the payment of these benefits.</P>
    <P>We come now to a matter which I think needs remedial action.  In a substantial number of cases where people are in receipt of such benefit it is apparent that they will be disabled and that they will be unable to follow their employment for a considerable time.  I feel that in such cases, rather than awaiting a specific application by the beneficiary or on behalf of the beneficiary, the Department should waive the requirement of weekly certificates and allow the certificates to be furnished monthly.  It is extraordinary that where the Department is prepared to accept certificates at monthly, or longer intervals, the weekly payments appear to be made regularly and without any delays on the part of the Department or the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. These delays occur, apparently, with most frequency, where there is a requirement to furnish a weekly certificate. It appears that a certain section of the Minister's Department awaits the furnishing of these certificates and then on getting them, approval is given for the making of payment but in the processing of the certificate, the approval and the issuing of the money and the delivery of <Col N="1337" /> the money, varying degrees of delay frequently occur.  I feel that the burden of work in the Department would be greatly reduced if they accepted certificates at longer intervals than a week. The Minister should endeavour to reduce the requirement of weekly certificates.</P>
    <P>Having said all that, we fully appreciate the reason for weekly certificates.  It is to ensure that nobody receives payment for a longer period than he or she requires it but I believe that in the long run the State would lose little even if the odd person were to get benefit for a week longer than was necessary.  The reduction in manpower in the Department and the reduction in overhead costs would be substantial if certificates were, in many cases, accepted at longer intervals than a week.</P>
    <P>From the humanitarian point of view I feel it is an undue hardship to impose upon people who are disabled and who are probably in domestic difficulties to require them to attend a doctor week in week out to furnish these certificates.  This in itself imposes undue hardship on people who are themselves disabled and, in this city, many people so anxiously require payment of benefit that they endeavour to expedite it by personally delivering their certificates at the Department of Social Welfare.  For many people this requires an expenditure of a couple of shillings or more in bus fares and a number of hours which they can ill afford to be absent from their homes. Notwithstanding the fact that they are unable to follow their occupation they would probably be better off in their homes resting and recuperating than enduring the hardships of public transport or the absence of it in this city.</P>
    <P>This brings me to a matter which I have raised on numerous occasions. I make no apology for again bringing it before the Dáil.  It is the obligation which we unnecessarily impose upon recipients of old age pensions, contributory and non-contributory, children's allowances, widows' and orphans' pensions and other social welfare payments to attend in person at a post office for payment of their pittances.  As I have pointed out <Col N="1338" /> before and as I emphasise again, there is no justification for requiring personal attendance of people at post offices in large urban areas.  The justification, if such it could be called, for the requirement that people attend personally is to reduce the possibility of fraud, to reduce the possibility of people representing themselves as being the beneficiaries.  Personal attendance might be of value if the person actually making the cash payment were in a position to identify the recipient but it is ridiculous to suggest that in urban areas, where as many as 1,000 to 3,000 people per post office are in receipt of benefit, personal attendance is required for identification purposes.  The postmistress, sub-postmistress or any assistant in the post office could not possibly know the identity of the vast majority of people personally attending at such post offices.  In any event, if a person wants to avoid personal identity in Dublin or in any other urban area all he needs to do is nominate a post office outside his own particular parish and the Department will allow the payment to be made there.  It is beyond all reason, in my opinion, to continue this requirement which imposes a colossal burden on the recipients themselves and which takes no account of the domestic difficulties which such personal attendance requires and which imposes on the post office authorities a burden which is unnecessary, inconvenient and costly.</P>
    <P>The Minister is familiar with Ballyfermot. In Ballyfermot, between the two post offices there, on one day of each month almost 5,000 families are entitled to get payment of children's allowances.  It can be argued that there is no obligation on the recipient of a child's allowance to attend on the first day of entitlement to obtain payment.  That is perfectly true but as far as I can gather actual experience is that something between 75 per cent and 85 per cent of the people who are entitled to such allowances seek payment on the first or second day of entitlement simply because their incomes or wages are not sufficient to give them enough to pay for clothing or to pay the rent.</P>
    <P>It is common knowledge that Dublin Corporation's rent fund is maintained <Col N="1339" /> to a substantial extent up to date by referring children's allowances towards the rent arrears.  If children's allowances were to be abolished tomorrow, even if all salaries were increased by a weekly sum equivalent to the children's allowances there are many house-holders in this city and elsewhere in the country who would not be able to manage their rent affairs because they would not have that expected monthly income coming in.  Anyway, there is a problem that we have thousands of people in urban areas where they are no more than bearers of an impersonal cheque book requiring them to attend, because we believe that in some way or another this will stop fraud.  It might stop it in a small village where the postmistress knows everybody but it certainly will not stop it in any of the large urban areas.  I would once again beseech the Minister &mdash; who, I think, is not unsympathetic &mdash; to take the plunge and do away with this rule in so far as the urban areas are concerned. Mind you, if it is unnecessary in the urban areas, I do not see how the rural areas should have to endure it either in the future.  After all, all that is required is to allow people to cash their allowances in places other than the local post office.  If they could cash them in other than the local post office, the possibility of fraud would probably be less because the local shopkeeper or butcher &mdash; although these people do not frequent the butcher's except at Christmas because they cannot afford the price of meat &mdash; would probably know more about them, their appearance and their family circumstances than many a postmistress.  I venture to suggest that, in the areas where there is the greatest demand for social welfare payments, you also have the least amount of letter writing and letter posting.</P>
    <P>It is now over a year since we increased the ceiling of remuneration for insurance.  We increased it from £800 to £1,200 on 6th September, 1965.  I know an effort has been made to peg incomes over the past year but, of course, it has not succeeded.  Many people who, a year ago, were within the insurance limit have now &mdash; perhaps <Col N="1340" /> fortunately for them &mdash; gone beyond it.  Of course, it is possible for them to maintain voluntary insurance, but, human nature being what it is, some of them will not do so or they may be pressed, due to other financial commitments, and may feel disinclined to do so because of financial embarrassment.  It is desirable that this rate should change more frequently than we have permitted it to change in the past.</P>
    <P>Speaking now from recollection, I think there was a lapse of something like eight or ten years from the time the £800 limit was fixed to the time it was fixed at £1,200, and the result was that a substantial number of people &mdash; something in the region of 10,000 &mdash; in the intervening period, went outside the insurable limit.  This is undesirable; it certainly creates difficulties and leads to a sense of grievance, when people who have contributed for several years, and then when they fail to contribute because of a change in their salary structure, fall into difficult times, find that, notwithstanding the fact they contributed large amounts over the years, they are disqualified.</P>
    <P>The way to remedy this is to have a more frequent change but perhaps I should not dwell too long on this because I think it does require legislation at present to change this limit.  I am not certain whether, in the last piece of legislation, we allowed this to be changed by Ministerial order, but, whatever way it can be done, it ought to be done with more frequency.  If wage levels change, as they do tend to change, yearly or thereabouts, then this limit ought to be increased by the average amount by which income levels have altered in the intervening period.</P>
    <P>There are many other aspects of social welfare we would like to discuss but perhaps we can do that at another time, as the Minister has promised us a Supplementary Estimate in the course of the year.  One thing can be said in favour of Supplementary Estimates, that is, they allow one to talk about the matter more frequently, but that is all that can be said for them.  We think it desirable that we have a keen social conscience in this <Col N="1341" /> country and perhaps the more people in public life preach about the necessity for improving our social services, the more will people be prepared to accept that it means a sacrifice for some people, because their incomes will be redistributed but it is a worthwhile aim if we can improve the overall standards of our people.</P>
    <P>Deputy James Tully and I were recently privileged to be in a country where there is no social service or code such as we understand it here, and it is only on seeing at first hand the appalling absence of a social conscience that one realises how vitally necessary it is to have a socially just society.  We have in this country, I think, fallen into the ditch of indifference. We have assumed that all will be well as long as we add just that little amount of money one year after another to match increases in the cost of living, as long as we add that little amount to existing social welfare payments. That is certainly not enough. As I said earlier, we can provide a more socially just society in many ways other than by increasing the monetary allowances paid.</P>
    <P>This is something to which the Department of Social Welfare ought to direct its attention.  It has a worthwhile role and it ought to endeavour to be something other than an accounting agency for the Department of Finance.  It ought to endeavour to see in what ways the standards of our people can be improved, to see in what way the colossal differences which now exist between the various strata of our society can be abolished or can be narrowed to some extent.  This is a worthwhile aim and I should like to see the Department doing more in that regard.</P>
    <P>We are fortunate in recent times in having inaugurated, in our universities and colleges, courses of social studies. Some of these faculties have produced some very worthwhile studies in recent times.  The research work being carried on is, I believe, of the greatest value and is deserving of support.  I feel the State is not helping these studies as much as it ought to; in fact, I do not think it is helping them at all in so <Col N="1342" /> far as the Department of Social Welware is concerned.  These people, who are skilled in these researches, are ready, willing, able and anxious to have an exploration in depth of our social requirements and I should like to see the Department of Social Welfare playing a positive part in encouraging these people to carry out this work.  If we had more of that kind of research work, we might be able to build a more inspired social code than the one upon which we are relying at the present time.</P>
    <P>I would, therefore, like to see substantial grants being paid by the Department to these faculties to have the necessary research carried out.  I do not think the Department officials themselves are in a position to do it; all they can do is as much, perhaps, as public representatives can do, that is, to list, to refer and to try to make decisions within the existing code upon individual cases presented to them from time to time.  But the kind of new work necessary, the kind of new society we should be building, will not adequately be planned unless we carry out widespread research at home, outside the ambit of the official code, official requirements and statutory requirements we have at the present time. Other countries have done this with great success and that is why they have, in many cases, different types of social services from what we have here.</P>
    <P>Unless we do this and do it quickly, we will be in serious difficulty in years to come on two fronts: our own people will not be adequately provided for and we may not be able to match the requirements of countries which, for economic, financial and political reasons, we may desire to be associated with &mdash; not that I am to be taken as advocating some of the alliances which some people speak of at the present time, but if they are coming and if the people desire to have them we must be prepared, or else the effect on our people, socially and economically, will be disastrous.</P>

      <P>I must on this occasion, as I have done on each occasion on which I spoke for my Party on the Estimate for the Department <Col N="1343" /> for Social Welfare, pay a well-deserved tribute to the officials of the Department for their courtesy in dealing with the very many queries addressed to them by myself and members of my Party.  One thing which has always amazed me is the fact that they are able to produce in a very short space of time replies to complaints which we make to them, and they usually come up with the right answer.</P>
      <P>On the few occasions on which I have approached the Minister's office, I also received courtesy and co-operation, and for that I am grateful, and I want to place that on record. It is a pleasure to deal with the officials of the Department but what we have cause to complain about is what they have to administer.  It is true that over the years social welfare benefits have been substantially increased. Unfortunately, social welfare assistance does not seem to have kept pace and, as a result, we still have people attempting to live on a very miserable pittance, their only crime being that they are old or ill, and that before they became old, they were attempting to eke out an existence in noninsurable employment, people such as the self-employed.  Something will have to be done to try to improve the lot of these people, and I believe that could be done within the framework of the existing social welfare legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister and his Department cannot be very proud of the various means tests as they are administered. On previous occasions I incurred the wrath of the Minister and his predecessor because I said that the people who investigate the means of applicants for various types of assistance seemed to be created from a special mould.  For some extraordinary reason, they seem to take pleasure in searching into the souls of the people they are questioning, to try to find out if by any chance they happen to have a hen hidden away at the back of the house which they have not disclosed, or if they had a few apples the previous year which they sold and did not disclose.  I instanced already the case of a widow with a few children who had planted <Col N="1344" /> one small ridge of potatoes and 50 cabbage plants in her back garden. The genius from the Department assessed them as means and valued them at an income of 4/- per week.  That 4/- a week would represent about £10 a year but it put her £2 over the limit which would entitle her to a few shillings extra in social welfare.</P>
    <P>I mention these things because they do not run true to form or to the code by which these things are administered in the Department.  There are serious causes of complaints.  I am a member of an old age pension sub-committee. While we do not get very much respect as a committee and our recommendations do not cut much ice, we are still a necessary part of the set-up.  We make recommendations and, on occasion, officials come in to us to prove why someone we have recommended for an old age pension is not entitled to a pension.  In very many cases the officials concerned could not know less about the situation if they tried.  They simply take what they see, or what someone else has told them, at face value.  I have one extreme instance of an official who came in to prove that an old man of 75 years of age who some years previously had rented nine acres of land had an income of £1,000 a year.  Eventually it turned out that the poor man, who was a very good judge of cattle, had been attending the local mart and buying and selling in that mart for individuals who did not want their names entered for one reason or another, and he usually got a glass of whiskey or something like that.  Yet the person who made the investigation produced evidence that he had an income of £1,000 a year.  That sort of nonsense should not be allowed to continue, and I would ask the Minister to do something to prevent these people from making stupid reports.</P>
    <P>I have had numerous complaints from people whose means were investigated and who claimed that the officials were less than courteous.  In the case of an old person who never had very much to do with officialdom, and who always feels when he is asked questions that someone is trying to trap him into giving a wrong answer, it is not good enough to have someone advising him that he is liable to a <Col N="1345" /> heavy fine or imprisonment for making a false statement which he had no intention of making until he got a bit confused.</P>
    <P>My comments will be rather disjointed because I do not want to detain the House or the Minister, and I want to cover a number of disconnected points.  We have unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance and if an insured person becomes ill, he is entitled to disability benefit, but if a non-insured person becomes ill, he is not entitled to anything under the social welfare code.  He can apply to the local authority for a disability allowance but that is not payable if the person is a patient in hospital. There is no reason why the Minister should not consider some type of disability assistance which would be comparable with disability allowance, which would be payable to people who, through their own fault, or through no fault of their own, are not entitled to disability benefit.  In most cases it is not the people themselves who are affected but it is the unfortunate wife and family who are left without any income.  Perhaps that is something the Minister might rectify.</P>
    <P>I was interested to hear Deputy Ryan's reference to the young lady who had an illegitimate child and was unable to draw unemployment benefit because her father was the head of the house.  I had a similar case recently of a young lady &mdash; not in Meath but in an outside area &mdash; who had two illegitimate children.  She applied for home assistance, which was granted, but subsequently it was refused by the home assistance officer and she was told to try for unemployment assistance. When she signed, she was told it was an employment period and she was not entitled to unemployment assistance. She pointed out that she had two dependent children and she was told in writing that she was a spinster with no dependants and as such was not entitled to any benefit.  I am not going into the rights or the wrongs of that young lady's having two dependent children.  The fact is that she had them and it was rather stupid that such a decision should have been taken because <Col N="1346" /> it is impossible to get away from the fact that she had two dependent children.  Because the home assistance officer felt he had no responsibility to pay any benefit to her from the rates, and because the Department felt they had no responsibility to pay her unemployment assistance, she and her children were hungry for a considerable period, I understand. That should not happen in this country.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of the person who has been employed for many years and when he falls ill or becomes unemployed, finds that in one of these years the employer, through negligence, or deliberately, failed to stamp an insurance card, with the result that he is disqualified from benefit for a period.  I know he is entitled to recover the lost benefit from the employer but in many cases he is not in a position to do so.  There should be a special section set up in the Minister's Department to deal with this sort of thing.  While the Department many, if requested and if they so desire, take proceedings to recover the lost benefit, this is done only in exceptional cases.  There is no reason why it should not become a set arrangement that in all cases where failure to stamp an employment card is discovered and this results in loss of benefit, in addition to recovering the lost stamps &mdash; which the Department do &mdash; they should also recover the amount of benefit lost to the employee.  It would not entail a very great amount of work and there might be no loss of revenue because I am sure the Department could recover from the person concerned the amount of the costs of whatever action was taken.  I am sure also that if the Department decided they would take this action, the people who did not stamp cards would be very anxious to have payment made.</P>
    <P>Another point that is causing a lot of trouble is in regard to the person who has not ever drawn unemployment or disability benefit.  He becomes ill, goes to hospital and subsequently sends in a half dozen, or perhaps a dozen, certificates claiming disability benefit.  He is entitled to that benefit. <Col N="1347" /> In fact, if he were in hospital and the certificates were sent in, the benefit would be held up in a number of cases unless there was a special request made for some payment or for payment to be made to somebody at home until the patient was discharged.  Is it not extraordinary that if the certificates are sent in late, although the person may have been stamping cards all his life, in nine cases out of ten, the Department will rule that the person is not entitled to benefit because the certificates were late?  I think this is wrong, and when it was provided for many years ago, there must have been some peculiar idea at the back of it which no longer exists.  The person is only asking for what he is entitled to get and I ask the Minister to make the necessary change in the present system. It will require only a slight change but as it is, it has inflicted much hardship on many people I know and I am quite sure on others throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Another point impinging on this is that when a person is in hospital, payment is held up until he leaves hospital, except perhaps for the £1 or so a week that may be allowed for comforts. I recently had occasion to ask a question in the House about a married woman, the wife of a farm labourer.  She had worked with farmers and she was in hospital.  The Department insisted on holding up payment until she left hospital.  I can see the merit in holding up payment in the case of a single man or woman who has no dependant.  If payment were not held up in such cases, it might fall into the hands of somebody not entitled to it and the person concerned might find that he had no benefit to get when discharged; but I cannot see why benefit which would normally be paid into the household and spent on the house should be held up where a married woman is concerned and where her husband and family are at home and could do with the small amount of money involved.</P>
    <P>I recently had a query about a man who had become unemployed.  When dismissed, he went to the local labour exchange.  The unfortunate man had <Col N="1348" /> some obstruction in his palate or the roof of his mouth and was very difficult to understand.  I fear the lady in the labour exchange was not very kind to him and told him in no uncertain terms what he was to do.  I am sure he also told her what she could do but he understood what she said while she could not understand him.  In any case she told him to go and get certain information.  His wife brought the matter to my notice and I took it up with the Minister's officials who very quickly made arrangements with the lady concerned to allow the man to sign, which he duly did.  That was done in the following week.  Then somebody decided they would investigate his right to unemployment benefit.  There was nothing to investigate.  The man had been many years in hospital and had been discharged.  He was married and had been working as a builder's labourer for about two years.  He had the necessary number of stamps and was entitled to benefit.  But some people decided to raise a hare for the purpose of getting their own back on the unfortunate man.  That sort of thing should be stopped and I propose to give the Minister particulars of the case.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred some months ago to the fact that he was introducing a new system by which a domestic servant would be entitled to draw unemployment benefit but he spoiled it by one condition which he added on, that she must have ten years insurable employment.  That is scandalous.  There is no reason why domestic servants should be put in a different category from anybody else.  I know there is the mentality in this country that domestic servants should be kept on tap, just in case some of the people who call themselves &ldquo;the upper set&rdquo; should require domestic help.  That idea remained until a few months ago when the Minister made a change.  It is a pity when he made the change that at the last moment somebody persuaded him to put in this provision which, in effect, means that there is no change at all. Domestic servants as a rule work for short periods and only a very small number remain in domestic service over a period of ten years.  Most of <Col N="1349" /> them get married and have houses of their own.  The people who, for one reason or another, remain in domestic service for long periods are becoming very scarce.  I am sure the Minister knows that as well as I do.  Even at this stage he should remove this provision which should never have been put in.</P>
    <P>The Minister has a reference here which rather intrigues me.  He says that the increase of £37,760 under Subhead D is caused by an increase of 20 per cent in the capitation rate on which payment made to medical certifiers for the issue of free medical certificates to insured persons is based.  Am I correct in thinking that a sum of 5/- per insured person is added to the fund from which medical certifiers are paid and that it is distributed in the ratio of 1/- or 1/6d throughout the country to 2/- for a city for each certificate issued? If that is so, why has such an increase which has caused a reduction of a substantial amount in the Insurance Fund, been considered necessary?  I most certainly am not opposed to the payment of medical certifiers for work done, but when an average of 25/- is now being paid for the issue of medical certificates it is a little bit out of the way to add 20 per cent to it.  Perhaps the Minister would give us any information he has on that when he is replying.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ryan referred to the increase in the British pension.  It is true that a number of people in this country got extra money to the tune of £500,000 or £600,000 as a result of that increase, but the State has collected roughly £250,000.  It is quite easy for the Department to say: &ldquo;We cannot be expected to have a separate set of rules for those who are in receipt of British pensions.  We cannot be expected to have a means test which applies one way and does not apply the other way.&rdquo;  There is, however, a little suggestion of meanness in this.  After all, we did make a great stir about the fact that we were looking for this reciprocal agreement and about the fact that we got it.  Having got it, it is rather out of the way that the Department of Social Welfare should swipe £250,000 of the money concerned <Col N="1350" /> for the purpose of boosting State funds.  I can see the difficulties, but it does not look well.</P>
    <P>It is rather a pity that employment exchanges cannot be, in fact, employment exchanges.  I have yet to find, in the country districts anyway, any employment exchanges where people are offered employment.  I realise that under the new Ministry for Labour there may be a change suggested in that.  Some arrangement must be made whereby people who go to employment exchanges can be told if there is employment available in the area.  The fact that we have not got full employment or anything like it is causing a certain amount of difficulty, but when there are jobs available in an area, the employment exchange there should know about them and should be able to inform people in this regard.</P>
    <P>Another matter which has come to my notice over the years, and particularly this year because of the cut down in the amount of money available for certain public works, is that people who were working as labourers on public works and who would prefer to be working have been told that because there is a cut down in the amount of money available, or for some other reason, the works are closing down and they are being disemployed. These people tell me that on a number of occasions they will go to the labour exchange and, by signing at the exchange and on condition that they do not do any work, will receive the same amount of money and in one case I know of more than if they had been working a full week.</P>
    <P>Let it not be thought that I am objecting to the payment of social welfare benefit by the Department of Social Welfare to people who are entitled to a big payment.  However, there should be some method of coordinating the activities of different Departments of State.  It is ridiculous that a man who would prefer to be working can have more than his full wages, on condition that he does not work, while the job he was working on, a public works job, is closed down because there is no money available to continue employment in that job.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1351" /> I should be grateful if the Minister would consider having that matter investigated.</P>
    <P>I notice the Minister made no reference as to when he proposes to put the new Industrial Injuries Bill into operation.  Surely we are not going to have to wait four or five years, as we did in regard to the report, before the Bill is introduced.  After all the trouble we went to, some effort should be made to implement the Bill.  Various reasons have been given for the delay. One thing I notice is that the insurance companies have not been put on notice that it is proposed to introduce the Bill from a specific date, and surely that must be done before the Government can introduce the Bill? Some arrangement must be made whereby people who are insuring work-men under the Workmen's Compensation Act will know they are no longer liable and that the State will take over from a particular date.  Perhaps the Minister would let me have some information about that when he is replying.</P>
    <P>I appreciate very much the co-operation which the Department and the Minister have given me for the period I have been acting for my Party on social welfare matters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasOHara" hpid="Mr. O'Hara Mr. O'Hara">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>My main criticism of the Minister in connection with this Estimate is in regard to the treatment of old age pensioners, widow pensioners and others in receipt of British pensions.  In the west of Ireland, and particularly in the constituency I represent, it is well known that people have been forced to emigrate down through the years.  Many of them have been obliged to break up their homes or small farms, ranging in valuation, as in the case of people living in Achill, from £2 to £5 and, in my own immediate neighbourhood, from £7 to £10. The majority of these people, because there was no local employment, emigrated to England and found employment there.  They have remained there for a long number of years and qualified for certain allowances under the British social welfare system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of these pensioners have now taken up residence in Ireland, having <Col N="1352" /> endured many years of hardship and, perhaps, risked their lives during the emergency.  When they were in England, they sent money home to their fathers and mothers or brothers and sisters in order to keep the home fires burning.  The national income has an item on the receipts side which, although I cannot say what the figure is at the present time, has been running at a very high figure for many years. These people contributed in a big way towards the support of the national economy.  The British Government have been generous in granting increases in benefits to these people now resident in the Republic, and many of whom are in the west of Ireland.  That an Irish Minister for Social Welfare would instruct his officials to go and make a thorough investigation of these cases and in nine cases out of ten, to collect their pension is intolerable.</P>
    <P>Some of these people have reached an advanced age.  In going to them, the officials have been blunt and I might even use the word &ldquo;insulting&rdquo;.  It is a disgrace.  Surely the Minister knows the hardship these people have gone through, the hardship their forefathers went through in their fight for their little holdings in days gone by?  I am proud to be descended from that class whose sons, in turn, were forced to emigrate to keep body and soul together.  Is it not a disgrace that an Irish Minister in the year when we have been celebrating the sacrifices and the great things these people did should get legislation passed empowering him to send out social welfare officers to the mountain homes of these people? It is something any Minister should be ashamed of.</P>
    <P>I was in Achill as recently as Monday last and I found several of these cases on the island.  The sons and daughters had to emigrate to England, and from their hard-earned money, to help their homes.  Anybody who has gone to Achill in the tourist season or out of it will notice how well these people, by their hard earnings, have helped to improve their homes.  Some of the people at home are now in a position to rent their bungalows for the purpose of supplementing their income. It is to their credit that they are able <Col N="1353" /> to do these things.  However, I have people in Achill and in other poor areas such as Mulranny and Newport where these calls by the Minister's officials have been made.</P>
    <P>Because of the credit squeeze and the general scarcity of money, as another Deputy has been in the habit of saying, there is no limit to the depths to which Fianna Fáil can descend when it comes to grabbing from a deserving class, a class in need, the last few shillings of their hard-earned money and at the same time to depriving them of what they are justly entitled to in their old age.</P>
    <P>I have brought these things to the Minister's notice frequently and recently I addressed a question to him asking if he were aware of the hardship these measures have been causing, if he were aware that pension books were being collected from these old, poor people.  I asked him if he were aware that social welfare recipients in general were being penalised.  His reply, which is to be found in the records of the House, was that he was not aware of any such hardship.  If he is not so aware, he had better go down the country where the people will tell him what they think of him and his officials.</P>
    <P>I live among those people; I know their problems and their difficulties; and I put it to the Minister that he could effect savings among his inspectorate staff sufficient to pay the pensions of these people.  We have inspectors drawing mileage allowances and salaries to travel to those people, now in their 75th and 80th year, telling them they are not entitled to anything from an Irish Government. It is scandalous treatment, and if I were allowed to use a stronger adjective, I should be inclined to do so.</P>
    <P>In Achill recently I met an old woman in her 80th year.  She suffers from arthritis and her health is very poor.  She requires frequent medical attention; she has to buy tablets and drugs to help her get a night's sleep. I can tell the Minister and the House that on the day the social welfare officer called to collect her pension book, her drugs and her tablets were <Col N="1354" /> not much good to her.  It is disturbed her that day and many a night and day since.  To think that after rearing a family of nine or ten children and seeing them going across the water to work hard to earn a livelihood, she should be treated like this is scandalous.</P>
    <P>I suppose that because of the present financial state of the country, the Minister and the Government feel that any way they can get money, even at the expense of those poor people, is all right.  It is no wonder, therefore, that homes are being closed in the west of Ireland, in my native parish.  Other Ministers go to Tourmakeady and Ballina and Ballycastle promising all the great things they will bring, the different schemes and plans they have for those areas.  Is it not hard to expect that people will believe these Ministers when they see all around them the treatment poor old people are getting at the hands of the Minister for Social Welfare?</P>
    <P>I did not have the advantage of being in the House when the Minister moved his Estimate but I have got a copy of his speech from which I shall quote a paragraph:</P>
    <P>In regard to administration, Subheads A to D of the Estimate, there is an overall increase of £176,000.  Slightly over half of this increase is in respect of salaries, wages and allowances, reflecting the higher level of remuneration arising from salary revisions in recent years.</P>
    <P>It is true that many of our civil servants, nearly all of them, have got increases to which they were justly entitled.  It is also true that many of them, especially those with £1,500 a year or more, have got very generous increases.  Some people prefer to call them status increases.  At a time when some of our civil servants with salaries of £1,500, £2,000 and £3,000 were given increases of £100, £200 and £300 a year, our old age pensioners and widows were being hounded all over the place, being interrogated with a view to taking their pensions from them.  It is no wonder that there is the emigration and frustration that we witness in the west of Ireland, and particularly in Mayo.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1355" /> I quote again from the Minister's speech:</P>
    <P>In addition to the 1,947 officers shown at Part III of the Estimate, provision is made under subhead A for the remuneration of 87 managers of branch employment offices and 323 clerks to old age pension committees and sub-committees.  The increase of £37,760 under subhead D is caused by an increase of 20 per cent in the capitation rate on which payments to medical certifiers for the issue of free medical certificates to insured persons are based.</P>
    <P>I have met constituents of mine whose benefit was stopped when they became unemployed, in some cases through ill-health.  They felt that all they had to do was to report to the labour exchange, complete the necessary forms and that the cheques would be issued to them without serious delay.  These schemes were contributory schemes to which the persons concerned had made contribution.  When it came to making a claim for benefit, officers who had been granted increases in salary, particularly medical certifiers, saw to it as far as they could that the unfortunate individual seeking benefit because of injury or ill-health would be put through the mill.</P>
    <P>A neighbour of mine was called in for investigation by a medical certifier. When he entered the room where the medical certifier was sitting he was told to sit down.  He moved a chair into a position which he considered suitable.  He was asked by this medical certifier why it was that he moved the chair.  The applicant told me that that medical certifier was very lucky that he did not hit him with the chair on the head.  He said that he felt he was entitled to benefit, that he had worked on the bridge at Foxford excavating ten or twelve feet of hard rock with a hand drill and had suffered injury, and that he should not be insulted in that way by an officer of any Department.</P>
    <P>The Minister should see to it that persons engaged in investigation should have respect for the working man, who contributes a great deal to <Col N="1356" /> their salaries.  I should like the Minister to investigate that case.  It happened a couple of years ago.  Perhaps the same gentleman is still attending at that office.  He should be told where to get off.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully referred to cutting down on public works.  Yesterday I had a question to the Minister for Finance in connection with the cutting down of employment in one important work being carried out in my neighbourhood, namely, the Moy arterial drainage scheme.  At present, an abnormal number of people are being cut off employment on that scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>How is this related to the Estimate?  The Minister for Social Welfare is not responsible for employment schemes or drainage schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasOHara" hpid="Mr. O'Hara Mr. O'Hara">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make the point that, as a result of this cutting down of employment, there are many people who will have to depend on unemployment benefit and some of these people have come to me.  Deputy Tully made this point too with reference to public works.  You did not pull him up.  I am following the same line. There is one scheme of public works where the number employed is being reduced and I am asking the Minister to see to it that when persons who are so disemployed apply for unemployment benefit there will not be prolonged investigation and delaying tactics.  I hope that people who are entitled to unemployment benefit will not be confronted with the type of medical referee or officer &mdash; Deputy Dillon used to call them &ldquo;cigires&rdquo;&mdash; who draw big salaries and who make investigations with no other purpose in mind than to deny the ordinary workingman benefit to which he is justly entitled.  Some of these applicants have wives and children to keep.  They have rates to pay.  They cannot sell their cattle or sheep at the present time.  Neither they nor the merchants who supply them with goods can afford the time taken in the Minister's Department to issue a cheque. Official personnel may be able to get credit in local shops and their salaries may be sufficient to allow them to have <Col N="1357" /> some spare cash but many of the people about whom I am concerned live from week to week.  They pay rates, taxes and all the other things. In connection with unemployment insurance and unemployment assistance, I would ask the Minister to see to it that much of the red tape is cut out and that applicants will be given the justice to which they are entitled.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Hara has covered a great deal of the ground that any Deputy coming from the west would have to cover in relation to the work of the Minister for Social Welfare.  Most people realise that the Department of Social Welfare is of the greatest importance to the &ldquo;have-nots&rdquo;. It is, therefore, necessary that the Minister should be a man of wide understanding of the problems involved and should have the kindness of manner that is necessary in such cases as occur so often in the west and, indeed, throughout the country.</P>
      <P>The Minister must realise that for some years past the &ldquo;have-nots&rdquo; have not been treated in the way that a Christian people, a Christian government and a Christian society should treat them.  Possibly that is due to the fact that enough money could not be made available.  Other Ministers have assured us in the Dáil, yesterday and today, that they have more than enough money for their particular services.  I refer in particular to the Minister for Local Government.  Apparently, he has been able to whisper into the ear of the Minister for Finance and to secure for his Department a great share of money, if we can believe the Minister. The Minister for Social Welfare should adopt the same procedure and should try to get more money for old age pensioners and others in the social welfare and social insurance classes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everybody knows that, today, 47/6d a week will not provide the bare necessaries of life for an aged person who has to pay rent, clothe and feed himself and provide himself with light and heat.  The sum of 47/6d is a mere pittance today.  Yet we find that not everybody is entitled to 47/6d. We find cases, in the west particularly, <Col N="1358" /> where you have a man who decides to turn over a small farm to his son to allow him get married and start a new family.  The old man applies for the old age pension.  Due to the tradition and history of the west it has often happened that a marriage agreement is made whereby the old people are entitled to a living in the home.  But, mark you, the living in the home is a serious question for the people concerned.  I had a case recently.  An old man came to the house to see me.  He said he had got notice that morning that his pension was to be cut by 5/- because he had a living in the house.  The land valuation of the farm was £1 15s. I ask the Minister or anybody else listening if they realise what the maximum production would be from a holding with a valuation of £1 15s to contribute to the livelihood and comfort of an old age pensioner.  It is an impossibility.  The living in a house appears to be rated as something more than £26 per annum.</P>

      <P>I can assure the Minister that this man has given me the facts and I shall present them to the Minister.  Even if it is assessed at one shilling per week the fact is that this man has been told he is not entitled to the 5/-.  I know the valuation of the holding.  I know my facts are right. There are many other cases in which something of the same nature occurred. Where you have extremely small valuations and hardly any income it is a damnable thing that an investigation officer, with a very fine salary himself, should go down and find it necessary for the economy of the country to clip 2/6d or 5/- off those unfortunate people.  I do not think any Minister could or should stand over that &mdash; or any Deputy either.  This has been going on for a long time.  I am asking the Minister to approach the matter in a more broadminded fashion and attempt, even if legislation is necessary, to give a fair crack of the whip to those people.</P>
      <P>As was pointed out earlier by Deputy O'Hara, we know that when investigation officers come along their first concern is to get the poor, unfortunate person flabbergasted if they can.  They try to get him to mix himself up in a way that his statements can be twisted.  They attempt in every way to ensure that as little as possible must be given to the applicant.  That is the official attitude.  They feel they are only doing their duty if they make it so hard on everybody that they tangle themselves up in statements and give the officers some reason for depriving them of that to which they are entitled by law.  That is something the Minister should whisper into the ears of those who go down.  He should attempt to get them away from that attitude.  I admit it is not as prevalent among investigation officers today as it was some years ago, but there are cases where it has happened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also delay in the investigation of claims.  The Minister should see to it that where claims are presented they will be dealt with in as short a time as possible.  Old people particularly like to have these matters dealt with because delay occasions <Col N="1360" /> them more stress and worry than a younger person.</P>
    <P>In the case of sick benefit, we find at times that an individual who becomes sick or gets hurt and has to apply for benefit may suddenly have been hurt in a car crash or may be suddenly stricken unconscious and taken away to hospital.  But the law states there is a very definite period within which the applicant must notify the authority.  If he does not do so inside the specified time he is debarred from receiving the benefit. Even through it is probably necessary to have regulations for practically everything, it is unfortunate that a person should be so deprived either because he was unable at the time to comply with the regulations or because he was ignorant of the regulations. There are many people living alone, many poor people who had not a great education, who could never be <i>au fait</i> with all the regulations of Government Departments who could be deprived of this benefit without any substantial reason.  In cases of that kind the Minister himself could exercise his prerogative and ensure that people, who through no fault of their own were unable to comply with the regulations, would get a fair crack of the whip.  Keeping to the letter of the law in cases of that kind would do no credit to an official or a Minister.</P>
    <P>I have heard of many cases put before the Minister to which he was very sympathetic.  He knows the conditions. But it is very hard for the Minister to control his officers.  I suppose the same thing applies to practically every Ministry.  Even though the Minister may be broadminded, tolerant and willing to take a wider view, it is probably very hard for him to get his officials to follow the same line.  All social welfare problems must be approached in a broadminded and tolerant way.  The people who need these services are the &ldquo;have-nots&rdquo;.  If the Minister would see to it that he would get more of his share of the moneys provided by the Government, and get it distributed amongst the classes of persons I have mentioned, he would be doing a good, Christian, charitable job and, along with that, he <Col N="1361" /> would be enabling people to stay in their own homes, which is vastly important for old people and people who are sick.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the House must know that it is far more economic to keep a person in his own home and to pay him the amount of money that will enable him to live there than to institutionalise him, which has another effect.  I am afraid too many people are institutionalised in this country at the moment not because, as some people state, their relatives are getting hardhearted and do not want them &mdash; that is not the reason &mdash; but because not sufficient money is available from amongst their relatives and of their own to maintain them at home and to give them the medical attention they need.  Probably, it is a fairly wide field.  The Minister for Health, as well, would have to enter into it. However, so far as the functions of the Minister for Social Welfare enter into this picture, I think that every penny he can provide to enable an old person to live in his or her home will be money well spent rather than the alternative of putting them into an institution where they are all part of a common herd.  I feel very strongly about this.</P>
    <P>I have been a member of a local authority for a long number of years. I have seen the effects on old people of taking them away from the family environment and putting them into homes of one kind or another for the reason that there was not sufficient money to maintain them at home.  I would ask the Minister to examine the situation to see if he can raise the old age pension to a level approaching the standard at which it should be in a modern society to enable those people to have a better living and also to increase widows' and orphans' pensions. If he is dynamic enough to approach this matter, he will have the support of Dáil Éireann and the country because he will be doing it for the people who need it most in our community. In all good faith, I ask him to attempt to do this.</P>

      <P>The Department of Social Welfare is probably one of the <Col N="1362" /> most important Departments and it is fitting that the man in charge of it is a man of imagination and courage, a man of sympathy for and understanding of the problems of the weaker sections of the community.  His efforts, since he became Minister, have been made in no uncertain way and appreciation of them has been made known not alone by members of his own Party but by members of other Parties. The weaker sections of our community are dear to all our hearts.  We must bring commonsense to bear on the improvements which are necessary, within the framework of the Department of Social Welfare, to remedy the defects in their condition.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to children's allowances and to ask the Minister to have another look at this question.  I believe that, at the moment, children's allowances are paid to people with substantial salaries of as much as £4,000, £5,000, £6,000 and £7,000 per annum. I believe the children's allowances should terminate at the salary level of £1,200 per annum and should be taken back in full within the income tax assessment.  The amount recovered should be distributed among the weaker sections of the community by way of additional benefits of one kind or another.  I feel very strongly about this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many alterations have taken place in the income tax code over the years. When children's allowances were introduced, we were told that there might be offsetting factors but many alterations have taken place in the meantime so that the position has been nullified so far as a return to the Exchequer is concerned.  This is a very serious problem.  People with incomes of £6, £7, £8, £10, and £12 per week who have large families are drawing the same amount of children's allowances as people with similar sized families but who have an income of many thousands of pounds per annum. We shall have to have another look at the problem and achieve a greater understanding in relation to this scheme.  I have made many inquiries from time to time and I have always been informed &mdash; especially in the far distant past when this scheme was first <Col N="1363" /> introduced &mdash; that these offsetting factors would be put into operation.  I have examined the changes that have taken place in the structure of the income tax code and if there was an offsetting factor, then all I can say is that so many changes have taken place that the position seems to be nullified. It is a matter that should get fresh and comprehensive consideration.</P>
    <P>I also believe that where the bread-winner dies and the widow is left with a number of children &mdash; it is possible, here, that discussions will have to take place with other Departments &mdash; she should be enabled to keep her family at home rather than to have to put them into institutions and to go out to work herself.  With the small pension, such a woman is in many instances unable to care for her children.  Take, for example, a widow with four or five children.  In a State institution, each child would cost about £5 per week for <Col N="1364" /> its maintenance.  If the widow got at least half the amount which would have to be paid to the institutions for the maintenance of her children, plus her widow's pension, then she could stay at home and look after her children and keep them together.  In that way, a greater service would be done not alone to the children and their mother but to the community in general.  Many widows find that they are left with very heavy commitments and liabilities such as the repayments on a house or a fairly high rent which they are paying to some landlord, apart altogether from local authorities. It is not desirable that the home should have to be sold or given up and the children put into institutions.</P>
