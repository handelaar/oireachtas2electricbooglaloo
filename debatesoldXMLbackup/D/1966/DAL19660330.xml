      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night I was explaining the obligation on the Government to effect savings where they think it is possible to do so.  I pointed out to those Deputies interested where these savings had been effected.  I also pointed out that they could study these savings in the Estimates for Public Services, 1966-67.  Despite the many savings effected, however, provision has been made for increased expenditure in many directions.  To disprove statements made during this debate by Opposition Deputies that less and less money is being spent, I have picked out some of the items in which increases have taken place and I should like to bring them now to the notice of the House.</P>
      <P>In Vote 38, Agriculture, there is an increase of £3,544,000.  If interested Deputies will turn to page 106 they will find there under various headings the different increases.  Under Research Work, subhead C.1, seed testing, propagation and certification, etc. there is an increase of £17,514.  For veterinary research there is an increase of £23,690.  Under subhead C.3&mdash;Subscriptions, etc., to international and other research organisations there is an increase of £4,749.  World Food Programme (grant-in-aid) a sum of £150,000 is provided; this is a new item and, therefore, represents an increase in itself.  Under Contribution to Irish Meat Association (grant-in-aid) there is an increase of £38,400.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come now to Agricultural Education and Development.  Under subhead D.1, Agricultural Schools and Farms, there is an increase of £17,088; Grants to Private Agricultural Schools, etc., there is an increase of £3,054; Trinity <Col N="187" /> College, Dublin, School of Veterinary Medicine shows an increase of £15,000; University College, Dublin, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, an increase of £10,000; Additional Grants to University Colleges, an increase of £144,420; the total increase for 1966-67 under those headings alone is £305,000.  Under Improvement of Live Stock, Milk Production, etc. there is an increase of £9,678; Improvement of Poultry and Egg Production, an increase of £11,946; Grants to County Committees of Agriculture, an increase of £49,500; Special Agricultural, etc., Schemes, £42,998.  The total there is £304,528. Contributions to Irish Countrywomen's Association (grant-in-aid), the sum there is maintained at £8,000; contribution to Macra na Feirme shows an increase of £2,500 which brings the figure to £6,500.  Under subhead I.5&mdash; An Foras Talúntais, there is a substantial increase of £92,720, bringing the total to £1,386,000.  Under subhead K.7&mdash;Farm Buildings Scheme and Water Supplies&mdash;a very important item in the west of Ireland&mdash;there is an increase of £219,043, bringing the total to £2,427,204.  Under Subhead K.8, Land Project, there is an increase of £172,062; this is another very important item in my constituency. The total estimate under this subhead for 1966-67 is £2,518,000.  Lime and fertiliser subsidies show an increase of £15,000, bringing the total for 1966-67 to £4,860,000.</P>
    <P>I could go on quoting increases.  I just mention these to emphasise to Opposition speakers who have continually stated that the Government have no money and the Government are bust, that the Government are not bust and that more and more money is being spent.  That is why we are here to vote for this Budget to provide extra money to the tune of £12,500,000 so that farmers and other sections of the community may benefit by these increases.</P>
    <P>I should like to bring another very substantial increase to the notice of the Opposition; it is subhead K.19, Payments to Pigs and Bacon Commission, <Col N="188" /> an increase of £550,000, bringing the total estimate to £2,350,000.  I could go on down through every departmental Estimate and Vote to show the increases.  In Industry and Commerce there is an increase of £1,760,700.  On page 131 of the Estimates for 1966-67 there is an increase for An Foras Tionscal of £15,000 and for Córas Tráchtála there is an increase under subhead H of £100,000. That is an answer to the many false allegations of those Opposition Deputies who said that the Government are not interested in industry. Last night Deputy John A. Costello said that the increased taxation was going to affect industry and hinder production and that the Government were not interested in industry but we see in subhead R an increase of £2,499,990.  This has been provided to help industrialists meet the levy put on by the British Government.</P>
    <P>As we are dealing with industry, it is worth while to put on the records of the House a statement made by Deputy Dillon on 5th May, 1952, when he said that the tariff quota industries set up by Fianna Fáil were purely badly run relief works.  Would he say that now to the thousands of people who are finding employment in the industries set up by Fianna Fáil? Opposition Deputies are fond of quoting statistics of unemployment and emigration but there would be many people unemployed today, if it were not for the industries set up by this Government.</P>
    <P>It is a well-known fact that all over the world there is a big population shift from agricultural employment.  We have that problem here but in it we are not different from any other country.  This has been stated time and again by Ministers of our Government, that this is one of the problems we have here, that the people are leaving the land and going to seek employment in other places.  If that alternative employment is not available for them here, all they can do is to emigrate to the other side of the Irish Sea or to America.  That is where they went in 1956 and 1957 when there was no industrial employment available for <Col N="189" /> them here, when the inter-Party Government ridiculed our industrial policy.</P>

      <P>Last night I showed Deputies the graph in the <i>Irish Times Annual Review</i> of December, 1965, where the page could not contain the graph showing the number of people who emigrated in 1957.  To continue to illustrate the increases in the provisions for the creation of employment, I would like to state that in the Estimate for Transport and Power, which shows a total of £7,631,000, there is an increase of £21,900.  I will read out some of these increases and if Opposition Deputies think the money is being illspent, they can say so and I will sit down.  Under Vote 41 for tourist traffic, there is an increase of £64,000, bringing the total to £1,911,000.  Under the heading of holiday accommodation, there is an increase of £245,000.  Fine Gael Deputies do not like the tourist industry but I would like to remind them that if it were not for Fianna Fáil's industrial policy and the tourist industry, we would have many more people leaving the country and there would be very little employment in my constituency, and particularly in the town of Galway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to quote a very interesting report from the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 5th January, 1948, in which Deputy Dillon is reported as saying that he observed with amazement the astonishing collection of strange people crowding the hotels in Dublin and elsewhere, and that it was time we got rid of them in such terms as to ensure that none of their brothers would come to us in future.  Deputy Dillon would not be very welcome in Galway if he made that statement in 1966.  Deputy John A. Costello was reported in the Irish national newspapers of 18th December, 1947, as saying that the number of tourists and their total expenditure in <Col N="190" /> the country must be controlled and reduced.</P>

      <P>In the reports of Dáil Éireann that are sent to Deputies every week, it is interesting to note the number of interruptions by Deputy L'Estrange and Deputy Harte.  They only contribute ignorant interruptions. Under Subhead O of the Estimate for the Department of Transport and Power, there is an increase of £103,200 for rural electrification.  How many times have we had questions on the Order Paper asking to have the special charges removed or reduced?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is of great interest to the people in the west of Ireland.  There is a total figure of £627,700 to assist the installation of electricity where it is most needed&mdash; the homes of rural Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the special service charges?  Have they been increased, too?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Deputy was not listening to me so I shall tell him again about the many questions put down by me and by Opposition Deputies requesting some improvement in the situation regarding special service charges.  We have increased the money for rural electrification which will help to speed up the installation of electric light in country homes.  Of course, the Deputy will walk in and vote against it.</P>
      <P>On primary education there has been an increase this year of £1,483,200&mdash;a wonderful increase in the amount of money provided for a service which is one of the worthiest on which the Government could spend money.  It is an investment in the future of our people.  During the past ten or 12 years, I have kept myself informed on questions relating to education and I have seen that in that period Fianna Fáil have always been anxious to give a better deal to the national teachers.  A better deal has come in this Budget, which provides an increase for teachers' salaries of £1,397,000.  This brings the total amount paid in salaries to teachers in primary schools to £15,975,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>National teachers have got a great deal from Fianna Fáil. They know that Fianna Fáil are looking after them.  For secondary education there has been a net increase in the Estimate of £1,138,700, and if the Deputy is interested, he can turn to page 82 of the Book of Estimates, Vote 30.  There he will see an increase of £25,000 in laboratory grants and of £54,000 in scholarships and prizes, bringing the total now estimated to be spent on scholarships and prizes to £253,070.  If Deputies wish to go in and vote against this increase, I wonder will they stand up at home and let it be known that they did so.  Special courses are provided for secondary teachers and there is an extra sum of £5,450 towards this item.</P>
      <P>One of the big increases shown in this Vote is in Subhead J., Building Grants to Secondary Schools, which has been increased by £115,000.  This was never done by an inter-Party Government.  In Subhead K. we are providing £402,000 extra for comprehensive schools.  Perhaps the Opposition do not agree that we should spend this money; perhaps they will vote against it.  Perhaps they would like to see the men who are at the moment engaged in constructing these buildings going without their pay.  Otherwise, why will they vote against these things?  There has been an increase of £45,460 in the Vote for vocational education.  There is a sum of £38,850 extra provided for the training of vocational teachers and it is interesting to note that in Subhead E. we are continuing the contribution of £4,800 to Macra na Tuaithe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The universities this year are to get an extra sum of £293,500, the total cost being estimated at £3,182,800.  Speaking as a Deputy from Galway city, I should like to express the gratitude of the people of that city and of the authorities in the university for the substantially increased grant to the university which this year is £83,620 greater than in 1965-66.  This brings the total Vote for Galway University to £355,000.  I may say that I played my small part in having the attention of the Minister brought to the need for an increased grant to UCG.  There <Col N="193" /> have been other increases in this Vote. Our friends in University College, Cork are to receive £103,000 more and Trinity College is to receive £318,500 more.  The annual grant under the Institute for Advanced Studies Act, 1940, has been increased by £3,920 to £137,290.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to bore the members of the Opposition or the Government by continually quoting figures but I feel the truth is in the figures.  I have given the figures relevant to the Departments under which the increases are to take place.  There is another Department to which a substantial increase has been given and I feel it is of very great importance and worth recording in the Official Report.  There has been an increase of £1,977,931 in the Vote for the Department of Health bringing the net total to a figure of £17,337,000.  The grants to health authorities at £15.8 million represent an increase of £1,419,000 on last year's figures.  One of the reasons for this increase is worth noting and is set out on page 183 of the Book of Estimates &mdash;supplementary grants to ensure that the amount of the improved net health expenditure falling on local rates in respect of the year 1966-67 will not exceed the amount in respect of the year 1965-66.  The supplementary grants in this respect amount to £310,000.  How often have we heard the cry: &ldquo;Do something about the rates.&rdquo;  Something is being done about the rates now and I wonder will members of the Opposition still go in and vote against this something that is being done.  I know that this will mean something to the people of the west of Ireland who are so hard pressed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The rates in Galway have not gone up due to health charges because of the action of the Government. On the question of local government, the Opposition members have been misinformed and have misquoted figures, as I explained last night.  In that Vote, the figure of £8,551,450 <Col N="194" /> represents an increase of £734,750 and if the Opposition Deputies read page 69 of the Book of Estimates they will see this is correct.  However, let them do their own homework.  I do not see why I should do it for them.  Under the heading of local authority housing, there is to be an increase of £200,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is to be an increase of £365,000 in grants for private housing, water supply and sewerage.  Water supply and sewerage schemes show an increase of £110,000 and grants in respect of derelict sites, public amenity works and dangerous places show an increase of £8,000.  An Foras Forbartha Teo. grant-in-aid shows an increase of £23,000.</P>
      <P>My personal view is that it seems to be the ambition of the Opposition Parties that the money would not be spent.  They do not wish to see progress or change except that implemented by themselves.  It is not the country they are interested in but their own political ambitions.  Rather than delay the House too long at this exercise of educating the Members of the Opposition&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In the Estimate for 1966-67 for Social Welfare, there is an increase estimated at £6,695,000. That is quite a sizeable sum of money and if the Opposition members do not wish to see this money spent, let them get up and say so, or else come in and vote with us but they cannot have it both ways without being absolutely dishonest.  As public representatives of the people, they are obliged to act in a responsible manner.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the heading of Social Welfare in the Book of Estimates <Col N="195" /> for 1966-67, it can be seen quite clearly where this increase will be spent.  Under Subhead E&mdash;Social Insurance&mdash;Payment to the Social Insurance Fund under section 39 (9) of the Social Welfare Act, 1952 there is an increase of £2,732,000.  On page 179 of the Book of Estimates for 1966-67, a breakdown of this figure is shown.  This money is needed to pay increases in disability benefits, marriage grants, maternity allowances and grants, treatment, old age (contributory) pensions, unemployment, widow's (contributory) pensions and orphan's (contributory) allowances. The excess of expenditure over income in the Social Insurance Fund is £12,450,000.  If the Opposition think this is money thrown down the drain, they have an opportunity of voting against it and of speaking against the spending of this money.  But let them not go before their own people and tell them that they are in favour of these things if they intend to come into the Dáil to speak against them and into the lobbies here to vote against them.</P>
      <P>At page 175 of the same Book of Estimates for 1966-67, under the heading of Social Insurance, Old Age Pensions (Non-Contributory), there is an increase of £2,635,000.  Children's allowances are up by £50,000.  Unemployment assistance is increased by £813,000, widows' and orphans' non-contributory pensions are increased by £400,000 and miscellaneous grants by £14,000.  Miscellaneous grants&mdash;for those Deputies who do not bother to make themselves conversant with such things&mdash;apply to grants to county councils, county borough councils, urban district councils and town commissioners, not exceeding half the sums spent out of the rates, for the provision of meals for children attending national schools.  Very worthy work, but not to be voted for by the Opposition!</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These increases in social welfare illustrate to the country and to this House the continuous efforts made by Fianna Fáil Governments to help the poor sections of our people, to relieve <Col N="196" /> hardship in times of distress, such as sickness, unemployment, old age or, God forbid, in the event of the death of the breadwinner.  This has been the policy of this Party for several years and it will always be so.  I can assure this House I would not stand as a Fianna Fáil Deputy if I did not feel in my heart and soul this was their honest endeavour&mdash;to provide for the poor section as well to continue the growth in other spheres.</P>

      <P>Very few of the Deputies on this side of the House can afford to drive Mercedes cars. These Opposition Parties may wonder why they are not attracting the young people into their ranks and why, when they look up at me, they have to see my young face.  It seems to hurt them very much that they have failed where Fianna Fáil have succeeded.  I think the reason the young people are following Fianna Fáil and why we have been successful is that we have been consistently progressive and have never compromised.  Now Fianna Fáil have won the confidence of the people. It is an organised Party, efficient, determined, competent, truly honest and truly representative of the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had the courage at all times to fulfil our promises even though we had to do it in face of unpopularity.  It is very easy to govern with the wind but to stand up here and know what you are doing and do it is a different matter.  That is what the people like in the long run and not the chasing of the hare we have seen when other Parties were in power.  One of the great qualities of this Government is their great social conscience, clearly illustrated by the figures I have quoted.  They have endeavoured, despite strong opposition, to gather in the moneys which they could distribute to the poorer sections of the community and help people in distress, as I have already emphasised.  In this respect I should like to quote part of a speech made here on Tuesday last, 22nd March, volume 221, No. 12, <Col N="197" /> column 1996, of the Official Report by the Minister for Health.</P>
    <P>He said:</P>
    <P>Every piece of legislation in this country advancing the status of the worker was introduced here by a Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    <P>He continued:</P>
    <P>If anyone denies this I will sit down.</P>
    <P>I was present in the House at the time. There was not a murmur, just as there is no talk now.  There was dead silence.  The Minister&mdash;he did not have to sit down&mdash;continued:</P>
    <P>Every piece of social legislation has emanated from Fianna Fáil; the widows' and orphans' pensions, the blind pensions, the children's allowances, unemployment benefit, unemployment assistance, wet time insurance, holidays with pay.  All these things have come from a Fianna Fáil Government and it will always be our ambition year in and year out to continue to ensure that the less well-off groups in our community, who are our primary consideration, are not forgotten, and that will never happen while a Fianna Fáil Government continues to administer the affairs of this country.  It is our belief that the social welfare benefits in Ireland today are still insufficient and grossly insufficient.</P>
    <P>That is what has won the confidence in this Government.</P>
    <P>I spend quite a while listening in this House.  I listened to very many of the debates on this Budget and the other economic debate which took place during the year.  As a new Deputy&mdash;one who spends more time listening than speaking or interrupting&mdash;I can see the pattern emerging among the three Parties in this House.  The Opposition criticise the Government for what they are doing in one breath and, in the next breath, they criticise the Government for not doing enough.  No suggestions come from the Opposition except on how to spend more money. Yet, when the Government spend <Col N="198" /> money, they are criticised, and when they save money, they are criticised.</P>
    <P>We had the FCA training week heavily criticised.  There was also criticism of the abolition of the Garda Band.  All these matters were done with a view to saving the taxpayer's money. The Government effect savings and are criticised and, yet, when the Government introduce taxes to provide extra money in other ways, they are criticised, too.  Unfortunately, the only conclusion to which I can come, studying this situation and sitting here on these back benches, is that the Opposition's contribution towards progress in this country is absolutely nil.  Indeed, I would repeat for them a statement which appeared in an editorial in the <i>Irish Independent</i> on Monday of this week, 28th March, 1966:</P>
    <P>Logic, not to mention fair play, requires that criticism should spring from knowledge.</P>
    <P>It is an excellent statement and one which I admire and feel it is worth bringing into my speech to emphasise the manner in which the Opposition Parties have been acting here, in my observation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and which may be the cause of some trouble in this difficult year ahead.  I want to refer to the continuing demand for wage and salary increases.  In this respect, I should like to say that, unfortunately, I must welcome the Government's <Col N="200" /> responsible action in setting the figure of £1,200 as a possible limit beyond which wage and salary increases should not be granted in this year.  From the figures and other relevant data which I quoted here last night, it is obvious that there is absolute need for restraint in every sector of the economy, especially in the better-off sector.  There is need for restraint on the part of workers who are strongly entrenched and are getting a reasonable wage, within the ability of the economy if they are to earn further increases in the future. My view is that it will probably be up to January, 1967, before it will become possible for the economy to stand any substantial increase in wages. I would ask those people who are not really that badly off, who are looking for extra fringe benefits and extra increases in salaries, to restrain themselves for the sake of the country and to hold back and make some sacrifice because, in times of difficulty, sacrifice is needed.  It will be in the interests of everybody if restraint is exercised now. The rewards can be reaped in the not too distant future, and my forecast is January, 1967.</P>
      <P>There are very many people in the lower income group who, in my opinion, must get increases and who deserve them.  I think this is the opinion of the Government, too.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The poorer section of the community are entitled to some increase and this must be negotiated. Any employer who is paying a married man with a family less than £10 a week is not carrying out his Christian duty to pay a just wage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>He can scarcely earn a living wage at present, owing to taxation. The Deputy has very little knowledge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>There are employers who are well able to carry a just wage, if one is to judge by the returns they are issuing.  They should be obliged to remunerate their employees in a <Col N="201" /> just manner.  There is another section of the community to which I feel attention should be directed and that is those employers who employ young girls aged 14 to 16 years and pay them £2 to £3 a week.  Those employers say that these girls are doing only light work.  I would point out to them that what they call &ldquo;light work&rdquo; can be the greatest physical and mental strain on young people because of its boring, repetitive nature and lack of challenge. I feel that some of these employers who are getting away with this kind of thing in present-day Ireland are actually slave-drivers and should be rooted out and exposed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not hold with employers who are slave-drivers or profiteers.  I recommend the trade unions to investigate these matters. The worst aspect of this type of employment&mdash;it has been brought to my notice on several occasions&mdash;is that these people are interested only in paying a slave wage to girls aged between 14 and 16 years.  Once they become 17 or 18 years of age, they will sack them at the slightest excuse in order that they may employ, in their stead, young girls of 14 years and pay small wages again.  These employers know that if the girls are kept up to 17 or 18 years of age they will, in time, make demands for reasonable wages.  People ask why the trade unions do not do something about it. The unfortunate situation is that these employers will not employ people who are members of a trade union.</P>

      <P>Another group of workers who work very hard, who do not know a 40-hour week, who do not know the fringe benefits we heard Deputy Treacy talk about last night, <Col N="202" /> are hotel workers who are on duty from 8 a.m. until 11 p.m. and midnight. They are a lot better paid than they were ten years ago.  I know this from my own experience as I once worked in an hotel.  I started at 9.30 a.m. and I finished at 11.30 p.m., with two half hours off for lunch and tea. That was 13 hours a day, seven days a week, for £3 a week.  Things are not as bad now.  In the hotel industry they are getting fairly good wages.  It is very difficult to set out a schedule of work because of the nature of the work and because it is seasonal.  Efforts should be made to improve the working conditions of hotel workers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not deny that the farm worker is underpaid.  Certainly he is underpaid.  This is another injustice in our society.  These men are employed for a few pounds a week and their keep.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the causes of the labour shortage&mdash;and this is reflected in the fall in the acreage of beet this year&mdash;is the small wage paid to farm labourers.  These men are not paid sufficient wages, and this increases the trend towards leaving agricultural employment.  This is a serious problem. Like the industrialists, the farmers should play fair with the men who are working for them.  They should keep them informed as to how things are going on the farm.  They should get them interested and give them some form of incentive, because if the worker is not brought into the farm management, and is there to collect his small wage at the end of the week only, it is very hard for him to maintain his interest and to give of his best.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This has been clearly illustrated on Telefís Éireann&mdash;and I congratulate them&mdash;in the excellent programme, The Riordans, where they are doing exactly what I am saying, and exactly what I should like every other farmer in the country to do.  This programme shows an excellent relationship between the farmer and his labourers, and that is a very good example that should be <Col N="203" /> followed by every farmer in rural Ireland.  The farmers will not lose their workers if they treat them as human beings and as part of the farm enterprise.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go into detail about nurses.  There are tremendous improvements that could be carried out in that sphere.  There are many other sections of the community who are underpaid, and it is the ambition and the policy of the Fianna Fáil Government to get fair play for those people.  I would recommend to the trade unions to help the people who are grossly underpaid. Indeed, they would be much more appreciated if they concentrated on eliminating injustices in Irish society rather than trying to look after the well-entrenched section who are well paid, and trying to reduce their working week.</P>
    <P>Last night Deputy Treacy mentioned the 40 hour week.  If he wants that now, what will he want this time next year and the year after?  If we follow that to its natural conclusion, a man should eventually get £100 a week for doing no work.  We should all be a little more responsible.  I agree that we must reduce the working week to a certain extent, but I am not too sure that I am in agreement with the fiveday week.  I do not know if it is in the best interests of the country.  I think it came too soon.  I would ask those people to show restraint and to have some consideration for what the economy can bear.</P>
    <P>It is very important that the workers in industry should be educated as to what exactly is happening around them and not go with blank minds demanding more money for less work.  I met people who were involved in strikes and I said to them: &ldquo;I hear you are on strike.  What is it all about?&rdquo;  They could not explain why they were on strike.  They did not know.  They just knew that they had to go with the rest or they would be called scabs or some other word.</P>

      <P>All over the country. There is another aspect of this industrial difficulty which is being negotiated at present.  Quite recently I had discussions with three or four men and I asked them what exactly they were looking for; was it a reasonable demand; did they feel the economy could bear it; did they feel they were entitled to the increase?  They did not know.  They did not know what they were demanding, or what the union was demanding for them.  All they knew was that if it went through they would get more money.  Everyone should be more educated in these matters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Despite what Deputy Corish said yesterday, there have been quite a number of strikes, and threatened strikes, and unofficial strikes in the past year.  That cannot be denied, and it reflects not only on the workers but primarily on the employers. There are some employers who are not prepared to negotiate.  They pay their workers as little wages as possible.  The employers must be prepared to put the facts before the workers.  If they are Christian people, and if they are interested in the lives of their workers, they will do this and they will not be ashamed to do it.</P>
      <P>I know a big employer who refused to join the Federated Union of employers because, he told me, he did not agree with what they are doing.  I have no axe to grind for the FUE or the Irish Transport Union or any other union.  I am here to express my own opinion, as I see it, and to say what my constituents think about these things.  I say there are definitely faults on both sides.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>No one will decry the man who makes reasonable demands, but if we had more negotiations and more open discussions on the full <Col N="205" /> facts between workers and employers, we would have less difficulty and fewer disputes.  Most of the blame can be put on the employers' side, because they are the people who have to give in the end.  If the unions make unreasonable demands which are not related to the ability of the firm in question to pay, eventually they will injure themselves.  I would not blame an employer who refused to negotiate with people like that.</P>
      <P>The employers must keep their workers informed.  An employer who is afraid to show his balance sheet, or to tell his workers what profit he is making, is either paying his workers an unjust wage, or making an excess profit.  There are many industrialists who would be delighted to publish their accounts every year.  There are some employers who are making a very small profit and in some cases there are firms which are making no profit at all.  Any employer who is afraid to show his accounts must be guilty of making excessive profits or paying unjust wages.</P>
      <P>There is special mention in this Budget of the £100,000 which is to be spent on special services in the west of Ireland.  The problems of the west are many and varied.  Indeed, Government aid alone cannot solve them. Last week Deputy O'Hara described some of the scenes in the towns in Mayo and he mentioned in passing that I could bear out what he said, that I knew the people nearly as well as he did.  The only thing that was wrong with the speech was that it was obviously blueprinted for the <i>Western People</i> and in every second sentence he blamed the Fianna Fáil Government.  I pointed out to Deputy O'Hara that I met a man in Crossmolina very similar to the man Deputy Dillon met in the station in Swinford. This man was earning £20 a week in the Bellacorick power station.  He told me he was on his way to England the next day.  I asked him why and he said he did not really know but that he was going anyway.  I ask Deputy O'Hara would he blame Fianna Fáil for this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I pointed out to him that he was in a very privileged position earning £20 a week in a small town in the west of Ireland.  He was living at home and even if he got bigger money in England, he could never save as much money, in those circumstances, as he could at home. He did not show any interest.  I quoted this instance to Deputy O'Hara and when I looked up the Official Report afterwards on that occasion, I found he said: &ldquo;Deputy Molloy is referring to a little patch of temporary prosperity.&rdquo; I would suggest, when Deputy O'Hara made that statement, that he himself was suffering from a little patch of temporary mental instability because if he did not realise that this young man is typical of the young people being reared on small western farms in isolated areas, he is not aware of the facts and he is not facing up to the issue he sees before him.</P>
      <P>The Deputy must know that young people will go where there is something happening.  They will go where they think the amenities are.  Modern science has provided very many amenities now in cities and the bigger towns and it is only natural that young people, especially now when they are more educated, will be attracted to the greater amenities.  Possibly it will take them some time to realise their mistake when they go to England and try to rear a family.  As we know, very many of them, at that stage, are very anxious to come back.  Young people have this urge to go away.  It seems to me to be the breed of every one of us who comes from the west.  I went to Scotland but I came back after a sojourn there.  I did my stint of emigration like everybody else.  Everyone who goes has that desire to come back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a very big responsibility to try to provide something in this country which will keep the people here, whether it is in their own countryside, living at home beside where they were brought up or in the bigger towns.  I feel, as far as the west is concerned, a very progressive step was made when the Government announced they would set up in Galway city an industrial estate.  This, to my mind, is part of the solution.  Where you have a growth <Col N="207" /> centre you can help the growth and you can attract people there who, at the moment, are leaving the rural areas and going straight to England.  We should try to attract them into the growth areas in Ireland and not try to set up artificial growth centres.  It would be a waste if money were poured into schemes which are doomed to failure before they start.  It is difficult enough to make the right decision but here you have a growth centre and I would advise the Government to concentrate on those areas, to enlarge them and make them attractive for our young people.  This would satisfy their desire to move where the amenities are.  It would keep the young people near their own homes so that they can go home at the weekends.  They could rear their children in the environment, or near the environment, in which they were reared themselves.</P>
    <P>The raising of the standard of living of small farmers in the west of Ireland, to my mind, depends on a greater awareness among the people of the part they themselves must play. Each farmer must strive to increase his own productivity.  They can best do this by working together and cooperating more closely with the Government services available, especially with their agricultural adviser.  There are very many farmers, to my knowledge, who do not know all the services and grants which are presently available from Government sources.  Indeed, like the workers and management in industry, they must co-operate with those services and avail of them in order to achieve increased productivity. There is a very big obligation on farmers not to be complacent, to try to advance themselves and avail of every opportunity to educate themselves and to make greater use of the resources and the assets which they have on their land.</P>
    <P>I know a lot of what I have said may not have been liked by the Opposition Members but I say it as a Deputy who was elected here from the west.  I feel a lot of time in this House has been wasted by ridiculous quotations of statistics&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have listened for a long time to another western Deputy. I can assure this House that if we are to believe everything he said here this morning for the last hour and for some time last night, we would go home quite satisfied that the country was in a very sound financial position.  Deputy Molloy, to my mind, has spent a lot of his time reading the books sent out by Fianna Fáil, with all the rosy figures pointing to the great prosperity that was here and the prosperity that was coming, but, to my mind, he must be visiting some of the great hotels which have been built by Fianna Fáil and which give great entertainment to many of our tourists.  I see we have many decent Fianna Fáil Deputies who have not even attempted to speak on this Budget, for the very reason that they know, as well as we do, by going through their constituencies, that the position is far from what has been quoted by Deputy Molloy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say a few words on the Budget.  I do not intend to say a lot but this is an opportunity which we get of speaking on behalf of our constituents and it is our duty to come here and, for the sake of information for the Government, to point out the position as it is down in the west.  I come from Sligo-Leitrim and I live in the very centre of my constituency.  As I am a member of the county council, I can assure you I have a fairly good knowledge of what conditions are like both in Sligo and in Leitrim.  I am continually <Col N="209" /> in touch with these people there.  If I were to read as much as Deputy Molloy, I would see very little of it.</P>
    <P>We learn that since last year, the cost of running this country of ours has increased by £12 million.  We must ask ourselves what has caused taxation here to go up by £12 million.</P>

      <P>Even with Fianna Fáil Government, we must ask ourselves what is being done about housing, about roads leading to farmhouses, about increasing farm produce, about providing greater employment for small farmers anxious to earn money to augment their small incomes.  For years we have been talking about housing and now we have reached the stage when section 5, as it is known to local authorities, is very much spoken of but in my county alone after two or three years, all we have got is, I think, 24 or 25 houses.  There must be something desperately wrong when taxation has gone up by £12 million and reached a total of almost £1 million a day and we still have Deputies from constituencies like mine saying they can see no progress.</P>
      <P>Let nobody think that I am trying to make political propaganda.  I can assure Deputies that if they come to my constituency they can see the position for themselves.  Only one section of the community, the poorest and most neglected group, the old age pensioners who have nothing to their name other than being in receipt of 47/6d. a week which will increase by 5/- next November, have benefited by the Budget.  I wonder how they can survive on 47/6d. a week if they live in a town in a rented room and have to buy everything except daylight.  A social welfare officer to whom I spoke before the last Budget admitted he did not understand how they managed. He said he had asked one old age pensioner this question&mdash;and the cost of living has gone up since then&mdash;and she said that she bought half the commodities she required in one week and the other half the following week and tried as best she could to keep going.</P>

      <P>It is rather peculiar that if there is this great wave of prosperity, about which Deputy Molloy spoke, Fianna Fáil are still not prepared to hold the local elections on the same day as the Presidential election and so save £120,000.  If that amount were distributed to the group I have mentioned, it would make a considerable difference to them but when it comes to Budget day, we cannot afford it.  Yet we can afford to postpone the local elections not only until October, but as I now understand, until June, 1967.  There is something definitely wrong there and I fear that the rosy picture&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The grant of £100,000 being given by the Minister for Agriculture for western farmers may seem a big figure to the Minister but if he were to go down the country&mdash;he was in Castlebar once or twice&mdash;and meet the various county councils and committees of agriculture, he would come back satisfied that the £100,000 is only a drop in the ocean. You can have £50,000 buried in a half mile of road and yet we have the Minister boasting about this £100,000. for the small farmers in the West.  As another Deputy described it, it is only a halfpenny in the pound.  If that is the only way of stemming emigration, I <Col N="211" /> fear the Minister will have to come again with a bigger sum.</P>
      <P>This time last year we were in the middle of an election campaign and everywhere and in every paper and from every Fianna Fáil supporter we heard nothing but: &ldquo;Let Lemass Lead On.&rdquo;  Many carried badges with this slogan implying that everything would be all right, that we should not change horses in mid-stream.  The pattern of life has changed considerably since then.  We thought we were in a time of progress but the picture has changed and there is no such talk now.  We are told to go slow and it is now admitted that there is a credit squeeze.  It took a long time for some responsible officials to admit that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McLaughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Fianna Fáil representatives spoke on television telling the people about the state of the country and the attacks made on them by the Opposition.  They said that if Fine Gael faced up to their responsibilities, they should tell Fianna Fáil where to effect remedies and make economies.  Fianna Fáil have been in power since 1932, except for a few short periods, and if we now have to tell them about the condition of the country and what they should do, it is high time for Fianna Fáil to hand over to somebody capable of doing their job.  It should not be necessary for us to advise them and tell them about the condition of roads as we find them in many western counties. After 50 years, I think first consideration should be given to the people who have worked hard and made a decent contribution to the State in all these years.  They have paid high rates and met their commitments all through and yet thousands of them are left <Col N="212" /> with roads that are a disgrace, leading to their houses while we have no hesitation in spending hundreds of thousands of pounds on main roads that are in reasonably good condition. A sum of £50,000 is spent on a road that could carry the traffic for another five years.  We should concentrate on the roads that are in the worst condition.</P>
      <P>Now I come to the question of drainage.  The Government would get greater production from the land if drainage were carried out and that would lead to a better Budget.  There are thousands of acres in my constituency alone, lying along big rivers or tributaries, which are subject to flooding. What is being done about it? Apart from one river, I know of no drainage being carried out at the present moment.  In the past the smaller rivers were drained under the Rural Improvements Scheme but, as a result of the squandering of money, the Rural Improvements Scheme had to be suspended and applications received up to October last are on a waiting list.</P>
      <P>I always advocated the Rural Improvements Scheme in connection with my constituency and will do so when the scheme is brought into operation again.  Through that scheme, relief was given to the small farmer whose land was subject to flooding, employment was provided and there was a great incentive to do the job well because there was a local contribution invested in it.  I deeply regret the suspension of that scheme.  As a result of that scheme, drains were opened, pipes were cleaned, by-roads were improved, hedges cut. The result was an improvement of the locality and the creation of employment. Admittedly, it might be only short term employment but it was of assistance.  Attention must be given to local problems if people are to remain in rural areas.  The fact that help is not forthcoming to deal with local problems or to improve localities will cause people to consider emigrating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should be mentioned that the persons to whom I refer are paying a rate of £3 9s in the £.  Having regard to the fact that the population of a <Col N="213" /> village may be small and trade negligible, such a rate imposes hardship. If the Government do not take action in that constituency and in the west generally to improve matters, I warn them that, regardless of the rigmarole of figures given by Deputy Molloy in this debate, the people will go.</P>
    <P>Let us consider the question of emigration. No man who has a wife and family will think of emigrating if conditions are reasonably good at home. A man who is living in a peaceful area amongst his neighbours, in the house where his parents lived before him, has no desire to emigrate and will not do so unless it is impossible for him to make a living on his small farm or in the village.  Only recently I met a man and his wife in a local town who told me that they were unable to meet their commitments and keep clear of debt and that the rising cost of living meant that they would have to consider emigrating, that they had only a small farm.  Most of the people of whom I am speaking have only small farms and the same will apply in their case if some relief is not forthcoming.</P>
    <P>There is another group of people who are hard hit.  They are men who work at forestry or road work.  The day had arrived when these lads were able to run a car.  Now a car in respect of which they were paying £14 tax will be taxed at the rate of £18 and they will have very little left out of £1 when they buy three gallons of petrol &mdash;2/8 or something like that.  The man who was running a car or had a notion of buying a car will be very cautious. I can visualise that some of the lads will leave the cars at home and will move on because they will not be able to meet the cost of running them.</P>
    <P>It would be well for the Government to consider the effect of taxation on villages and depopulated areas.  As I have said, the rate in Sligo is about £3 5s in the £ and in Leitrim it is £3 9s. If something is not done to curtail the rise in rates, there will be fewer ratepayers.</P>
    <P>There are a great number of complaints about schools being closed.  I have been a member of this House for about five years.  Since I came into the <Col N="214" /> House, I have been making representations to the Department of Education to have school repairs carried out.  The policy of closing small schools is a result of so many schools having been neglected and being unfit.  The Department, therefore, had to prepare a scheme whereby one school would cater for the children attending three small schools.  I suppose that would eliminate a lot of trouble and would save the Department having to carry out repairs.  The policy of closing schools is not meeting with a good reception.  The Department should have faced up to the problem of preserving small schools which played such a useful part in the community in the past. If they had done so we would not now have the problem we have to face.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the ESB.  If the Government want people to remain in rural areas, they must ensure that ESB supply is available to them.  I make representations to the Sligo office very often in regard to exorbitant charges imposed in cases where the consumer lives a distance from the main supply.  The ESB is a paying proposition.  Persons who are off the beaten track should get special consideration rather than a special charge. Having regard to the taxes imposed on him, no farmer can pay exorbitant charges for ESB supply.</P>
    <P>The many disabilities under which rural people have to live are responsible for widespread discontent and emigration.  People cannot meet increased taxation and the other demands out of the profits made on small farms. In passing, I should like to say that I am often asked to make representations to the Department in regard to the £15 subsidy on heifers.  It is a pity that when people qualify for this subsidy, it should be withheld from them and that they should have to make representations to a county councillor or a TD.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McLaughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree, but due <Col N="215" /> to the increased taxation, I think it is relevant to suggest that these payments should be made quickly.  The same would apply if a man was to buy a cow for £70 in March and suggest that he should pay for it in September. Recently a very substantial increase was given to a group of people who are already well paid, civil servants.  Senior civil servants are well paid but recently some of them got an increase of £500 and some went up by £900.  If an attempt is being made to effect economies, this is far from being a good time to give such increases.  There are many people still who have been disappointed because they have got nothing at all.</P>
      <P>I remember making representations on behalf of an Old IRA man who suffered considerably during the troubled times and because he did not happen to be in the thick of the trouble during the last three months, he did not get a pension.  He was always a Fianna Fáil supporter but I always felt that regardless of whether or not he had been there during the last three months, he was entitled to a pension. There are many like him and it is a pity that this small group should be so neglected.  Recently I received a letter from the Department in regard to a 14/- or 15/- increase&mdash;I agree that he has unemployment benefit&mdash;&mdash;</P>

In addition, there are 160,000 fewer people in employment than there were in 1951.  Is this what we call progress?  It is high time the Government forgot about big spending and <Col N="216" /> big schemes which are reaping very little reward.  I am a great believer in having good roads but I would leave roads which are in a reasonably good state as they are for the moment.  Instead, I suggest that in the rural areas the county councils should be given a substantial grant for making roads to the houses of small farmers.  Being a small farmer myself, I can assure the House that if this were done, the people would willingly stay at home and make their contribution towards the running of the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>In rising to speak on this debate, I am actuated by the contribution made by Deputy P. O'Donnell last night.  He proceeded to go back to 1932 and he made a fleeting reference to a free trade area, or a free trade position, that existed with Britain up to 1932.  He never really told us what he was getting at because he left the picture hanging in the air.  I do not know whether he intended to infer that conditions at that time were such that they should never have been changed.  For the benefit of the Deputy, I will go <Col N="217" /> back to 1924.  There are very few in this House who lived through that time who are in a position to talk about it today.  At that time the standard wage in rural areas was 12/- a week.  In the old Great Southern Railways at the time, the employees of which were, as far as I can remember, members of the National Union of Railwaymen, the wage structure up to 1932, and indeed up to 1936, was 27/6 a week for the ordinary yardsman or railway porter, 32/6 for a signalman and 36/- for storemen or storecheckers.  That was the top bracket.  It was stated here in answer to a question the other day that the £ today would purchase the equivalent of goods to the value of 5/1 as compared to 1924.  If we are to equate that with the relevant wage structure at that time, the ordinary railway yardsman would be earning £5 10s. 0d., the signalman, £6 10s. 0d., and the checker £7 4s. 0d.  I give those figures to show younger Deputies how far we have come.  We have a position now to be proud of, even though at present things have gone wrong.  The resilience and ability of the Irish nation to lift itself up is always there, and this can be proved again if we can get the co-operation of all our people, particularly of those opposite.</P>
      <P>The Land Commission wage at that time, the only other one by which you could judge the wage structure, was 24/- and that continued, I think, until 1934 or 1936.  Deputy O'Donnell spoke about the production of butter, pigs and cattle.  The price of butter in the Kerry markets at that time was 4d per pound and 4½ per pound for separated butter which was the top quality.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy P. O'Donnell. I mentioned that at the outset.  I am not reflecting on anything he said but I would like to give the picture that existed at that stage.  I was connected with the trade in those days and I know those figures to be correct.  We produced then two-fifths of the butter we produce today, and at the same time we had to export 75 per cent of it in order to import the commodities we required.  Even at 4d or 4½ per pound <Col N="218" /> our people could not afford to eat the butter.  I worked with many people in the farming community at the time and we did not get butter because the farmer could not afford to put it on the table.  That was the position that existed under the free trade of those years.  I remember in 1931 I had come back from England to find a very progressive farmer in my own area producing pigs which we termed the one-and-a-half hundredweight pig live-weight. He took them to the market at Killorglin where they were available at 30/- each.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am just giving the conditions.  I give all due credit to the Government of the day for some of the things they did, particularly the Shannon Scheme.  It was foresight to have established an undertaking of that kind in those days.  I asked Deputy O'Donnell last night if he were trying to project a picture of favourable conditions in those days.  I asked him the reason for the reduction of 1/- in the old age pension.  The Deputies of the day, who were not dependent on 10/- a week, did not reduce their own salaries. They took it from the old age pensioners. Deputy O'Donnell's reply was that this was necessary to build up the country and repair whatever damage was done by some of our supporters. I am sure the old age pensioner who had to contribute this 1/-, or their relatives today, feel proud of that contribution. Is it any wonder that the country, particularly the poorer sections, cannot have any faith in the people opposite who have that heritage and who from 1932 onwards have opposed and rejected every effort to industrialise the country?  They stated in 1938 or 1939 that the industries established and licensed here were only cobblers' shops and harness makers' shops and were not industries at all. Those were the industries that enabled us survive through the war years, industries like the turf development industry which enabled us to keep neutral in a dangerous moment of crisis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can take anything said by the Opposition members&mdash;many of them <Col N="219" /> are very decent people&mdash;so long as it is constructive; but when they attempt to damage the nation, I hold it is not the duty or the right of anybody to sabotage the efforts of our people.  We are in the middle of a difficult situation. I would not attempt to make any excuse or hide our problems.  We will have to use every bit of knowledge and energy we have to get out of these difficulties. But we can do so.  If we do not unite in this House to try to find the answer, another 100,000 or 150,000 people will be compelled to go.  The people in the front-line trenches are the very small shopkeepers and small landholders.  The very poorer sections are looked after to some extent and they will be able to carry on.  But the small shopkeepers in the rural towns and the smallholders with five or six cows cannot afford to pay the rates and meet all the other demands on them.  Something has to be done.  If we face up to the problem and unite, I believe we can solve it.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that we had to meet this 12 per cent wage increase and the status increases.  We had a Minister telling us here that the Civil Service section alone cost £10 million. It is estimated that local authorities got a further £3 million and State bodies another £1 million.  That is £14 million taken out of the production pool by a body which, in the strict sense of the word, is non-productive. They do not produce the basic materials necessary to earn that money. If that £14 million had been expended on the weaker sections of our economy, it would have made a vast difference.  I do not know what can be done at this stage to remedy the position.  Certainly, this pressure of organised groups to scrape what they can out of the existing pot will have to stop if we are to survive.  Otherwise, they will bring down the house of cards and we will all be faced with having to take much less. But our problems can be solved if we get together and tell the people that the lifeblood of the nation is at stake, that they will have to try to save more in order to meet the necessary demands to keep the economy going.</P>
    <P>Deputy McLaughlin commented on <Col N="220" /> old age pensioners trying to exist on 47/6d a week.  If the Deputy's county council are doing their job, another 12/6d should be added to that.  The poorest section, those old age pensioners without any means, should be getting the supplemental 12/6d.  It is Deputy McLaughlin's duty to see that they get it.</P>
    <P>One section of our producers not getting their due share are the fishermen. There is a vast potential off our coasts if it is organised and developed on modern lines so that the fish are landed and processed here.  There are plenty of foreign markets, provided the fish is available.  Much more money must be channelled into the production side in order to increase exports of fish, a very natural source of wealth for the economy and the nation.</P>
    <P>There must be a check to rising rates in local authorities.  In the Kerry County Council, I tried to bring a halt to increased rates this year.  I suggested that the county council should do a small bit of paring under every heading. I referred particularly to the matter of health as regards the different hospitals, and I thought a saving of about £10,000 could be brought about.  Unfortunately, a council member stood up and said I was trying to hit the poorest of our people.  That was not my intention.  Every year we allocate a certain sum and we find at the end of the year we have overspent and have to find an extra two shillings in the coming year.  Some form of control must be exercised by the Minister for Health to bring about an easement of that position and to obviate the increases that have taken place from year to year above the amount allocated in the rates.  The Minister for Finance should do something to help in that direction.</P>
    <P>I should like to appeal to Deputies both on the far side of the House as well as on this side to bring home to our people, wherever we speak, at the crossroads or at the meetings of public bodies, the necessity for being careful at this stage.  Many of our younger people are looking for motor cars.  I have seen as many as four motor cars outside labourers' cottages. <Col N="221" /> People are entitled to have them undoubtedly but, with hire purchase facilities, things are made too easy and people who have a wage of only £7 or £8 a week are trying to keep a car going.  It costs an average of about £4 to run a car, even if it is used only at odd times.  In my young days we could not even afford a bicycle, and they were cheap then.  We must do our best to stop the terrific pressure that exists throughout the country from all our people for more money, more State help, more wages.  Unless there is increased production to justify increased wages, we can only end up in a crash which will have disastrous results for the nation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>While I was somewhat interested in the comparisons which the previous speaker made in regard to present day wage rates and those of many years ago, one of them needs some comment from me.  I refer to the formula which he adopted for comparing present wage rates with wage rates in the 1920s and 1930s.  It is far from acceptable to give the value of the £ in 1924, we shall say, and its present value, and to equate the wages in 1924 with those of the present year.  That is not the method by which present wage rates should be adjusted or on which present wage rates should be termed to be good wages.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that formula will not go outside this House because it would not help the present position. To come to the Budget proper, this Budget of 1966 has been repeatedly described, and rightly described, both inside and outside this House, as the take-all and give-very-little or give-nothing <Col N="222" /> Budget.  It provides for an extra increase in taxation of £12,500,000, and this £12,500,000 is to pay not for increased or better services but simply for the mistakes of bad government over the past couple of years.</P>
      <P>One of the most frightening aspects of this increase in taxation is that it does not provide for urgent and necessary improvements in the various services. It does not provide for the improvements necessary in housing, health, education, industry and many other important services.  It is also frightening to think that in order to provide these necessary services extra taxation will have to be found.</P>
      <P>One of the worst hit services is housing.  It is sad to think that although this House spent the past six months debating a Housing Bill and the many worthwhile proposals put into that Bill. it is not worth the paper it is written on because the money is not available to implement the various improvements outlined in it.  The local authorities have got their allocations for housing for the next 12 months.  If the other local authorities have got a similar allocation to that which Kilkenny Corporation and Kilkenny County Council have received, then the out-look in the next 12 months for an increase in house building, both in the local authority sector and the private sector, is very bad.  Kilkenny Corporation, who have under their jurisdiction 11,000 people, have been allocated in the coming 12 months an amount which will provide for about eight houses at the most.  For supplementary reconstruction grants, they have been allocated £1,200 and a sum of £5,000 for house purchase and house building loans.  That amount will barely cover the provision of two houses in the next 12 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now that is the picture throughout the length and breadth of the country. For years people have been waiting for houses, living in flats, and sometimes in hovels, and paying exorbitant rents.  They have been given no hope of any kind of any improvement in their position in the next 12 months. That is the bitterest disappointment to the hundreds of thousands who have <Col N="223" /> been on the waiting list of every local authority for the past four or five years.  Some of them are paying up to £2 and £3 a week for one or two rooms.  Some are paying doctor's bills and hospital bills because of poor health arising out of lack of proper accommodation and proper amenities. Something will have to be done to make money available for such an essential service as housing.  I understood the Government were putting their priorities right in this situation in which they find themselves without any money.  Housing should come first, in my opinion, and, if it is first, God help the other priorities that come after it.</P>
    <P>This shortage of money will hit the building trade in general very seriously. There will be a cut back in both the reconstruction and the erection of houses.  It is inevitable that large scale unemployment will occur in the building trade in the next few months.</P>
    <P>A good deal of discussion on this Budget has been devoted to wage and salary increases and industrial unrest. The NIEC Report advocated the introduction of an incomes policy covering all incomes.  If the Government are not willing to introduce an incomes policy, then they should not meddle in wage negotiations.  Neither should they have interfered in the negotiations towards the end of last year and in the beginning of this year. The Taoiseach and other Ministers have advocated wage restraint and an increase of three per cent.  That interference by Ministers has done nothing but harm.  It has added to the industrial unrest in many parts of the country.  If the Government are not willing to introduce an incomes policy on the lines suggested in the NIEC Report, then they should not try to influence any wage agreement.  Apart from not accepting the NIEC recommendations, they did exactly the opposite to what this council advised them to do.</P>
    <P>Lowly-paid workers who got an increase of 12 per cent two years ago benefited in most cases by no more than £1 per week.  These workers could <Col N="224" /> justifiably have claimed an increase 12 months ago but they restrained themselves, as did the trade union movement, from asking for such an increase until the expiration of the National Wage Agreement.  These workers who suffered so patiently for the past two years are now being told that they can look forward to no more than a three per cent increase.</P>
    <P>It is time some headline was set where lowly-paid workers are concerned. People who are not in a strong bargaining position and who are existing on a starvation wage should get the benefit immediately of some formula to provide them with a decent wage.  An incomes policy as such would be of little help to them because such a policy would apply more to the larger groups of workers with better incomes.  Some form of compensation will have to be provided for the married man with a take home wage of £7, £8, £9 or even £10 per week.</P>
    <P>The best examples of the way these workers are treated will be found in local authorities and Government Departments.  I refer in particular to county council road workers and to the non-nursing staffs in hospitals.  The average wage of an adult male employee is £7 per week.  How a man can live on that passes my understanding. Many attempts have been made in the past 12 months to improve the lot of domestic workers in hospitals and wardsmen.  All efforts have been ignored by the responsible Minister, by the county managers and by the others responsible.  A White Paper should be issued outlining an approach which could be adopted by outside employments, a White Paper that would outline a minimum figure for these people which could be copied by outside employers.  There are many employers who can afford to pay in excess of these figures and who are sheltering behind these rates.  They say that the county councils are paying only £7 a week and ask why they, in private industry, should pay more. The fact that many unscrupulous employers are sheltering behind this wage structure is the reason I ask that something be done.</P>
    <P>The present unrest is due mainly to <Col N="225" /> the type of society that has been built up in this country, a society in which life gets more and more tough for the labouring man with a family.  The standard of living is still low, about 70 per cent of the British standard, and the British standard is low in comparison with the European standard. If we are to judge by the expensive clubs and dining places that have been opened in Dublin in the past 12 months and which seem to be doing well, there must be a good many people who have a lot of money to throw away.  There is a section of our community making easy money on the sweat of the workers.  We have not to go too far from this House to see places where meals cost anything up to £3, £4 and £5 per head.</P>
    <P>Whilst the Leader of the Labour Party has dealt adequately with the matter, I must again comment on the impression that is going about that all the present troubles in this country are the result of wage demands and the 12 per cent increase.  It is not those who got 12 per cent on wages ranging from £8 to £15 a week who have caused inflation.  The people who got an increase of £1 per week under the ninth round were not the people who caused inflation.  The inflation was caused by people who got big increases on already big salaries.  The man who got £1 on a wage of £8 or £10 per week needed that increase to provide for himself and his family.  We must get rid of the wrong impression which lays our present difficulties at the feet of the trade union leaders of this country.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to our manpower policy which is part and parcel of the Budget, part and parcel of our economic expansion and the means by which our present difficulties can be resolved.  Economic expansion depends on economic investment and technical development.  Adaptation costs money but failure to adapt costs productivity and that, in turn, costs people.  If productivity decreases, employment is adversely affected.  One of the greatest mistakes of the Government and of the people who exhort workers and others to increase productivity is the absence of all efforts to produce a manpower <Col N="226" /> authority.  It is useless to try for increased productivity without adequate and definite proposals to deal with the manpower problem.  This is of first importance.  Productivity and manpower must go hand in hand.</P>
    <P>Indirect taxation in this Budget leads to higher prices and these, in turn, lead to demands for increased income.  That process solves nothing and the only hope is increased production. The growth of our economy depends on our capacity to export and that depends on the amount we are prepared to invest in economic activity and technical development.  All these things depend on an adequate manpower policy which will cover all aspects of the problem and not merely the retaining of our workers.</P>
    <P>There are many criticisms of this Budget which I could make but I do not think I should take up the time of the House at this stage when the time is limited and other speakers wish to express their views.  Comment on social services and other services would be justified by me but these matters have been dealt with by other Labour Party speakers.  One pressing problem is the increase in local authority rates which went up sharply last year and again this year.  There is no relief in this Budget for those people, for the small farmer and small shopkeeper who is now faced with increased rates, increased taxation on his petrol and car and increased costs all round.  All this is indicative of the failure of Government policy, of their failure to implement promises they made, their failure to solve even the fundamental problems of unemployment and emigration. The only sentiment I want to express in closing is the hope that it will not be necessary to have a further Budget this year.  A further attempt to increase taxation would only result in further inflationary trends and I do not think would help the situation.  I mention these things briefly, lest my failure to advert to them be taken as agreement with the proposals of the Budget which provides this negative increase in old age pensions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. T. O'Donnell Mr. T. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not detain the House very long because in the limited time left, some of my colleagues <Col N="227" /> may be anxious to contribute.  This Budget is remarkable not so much for what it contains but rather for what it is symptomatic of.  It reveals an alarming situation which many people suspected for a time past was coming and which a great many people knew had arrived.  The Budget proves conclusively and beyond all doubt that the economic policy of the Government has failed and particularly that the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> has veen virtually a fiasco. My Limerick colleague, the Minister for Health, when speaking last week was very critical of the Opposition, particularly of Fine Gael, on the ground that, despite the issue by the Government in recent months of numerous publications explaining quite clearly the causes of the present situation, Fine Gael Deputies did not take the trouble to do their homework and study the various publications.</P>
      <P>I have studied the various publications, the documents which have been quoted at length by Government spokesmen during the past couple of weeks.  Politics being what it is, it is only natural we should take a different interpretation.  Deputy Dowling last night quoted at length from many of these documents and Deputy Molloy followed his example this morning.  My reading of the publications issued by the Government leaves me in no doubt whatsoever that the cause of the present situation, particularly the circumstances which forced the Minister to introduce this Budget, is solely the failure of the Second Programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ordinary man in the street, whom I am proud to represent, is asking a very intelligent question.  He is asking why it is that despite all the money that has been raised in taxation and by borrowing in recent years, the Government in 1966, in the middle of the Second Programme, should find it necessary to introduce a Budget of this sort.  That is the question every Deputy, irrespective of the Party he belongs to, has been asked in recent weeks.  Year after year for many years past, we have had new methods of taxation introduced, new methods of raising <Col N="228" /> revenue.  Among the most noteworthy have been the abolition of the food subsidies, saving £18 million in 1957, PAYE, netting £15 million in 1959 and the introduction of the turnover tax.  As well, there have been increases in the taxes associated with the obvious commodities every year and again this year&mdash;cigarettes, tobacco, spirits and petrol.</P>
    <P>Despite this continuous increase in taxation year after year, the Government in the past year have had to resort to what they call exceptional borrowing.  The extent of that borrowing is very striking and very alarming. I quote from <i>Capital Budget</i>, 1966, page 13, paragraph 10:</P>
    <P>The situation just described was dealt with (a) by raising exceptional finance amounting to £20 million from the Central Bank, (b) by making a drawing of £8 million from the IMF to support the national reserves, (c) by the issue of a Sterling/Deutschemark Loan for £7 million, and (d) by seeking bank accommodation of approximately £11 million.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 11 points out that calls on the banking system for amounts of the order of £46½ million must clearly be exceptional.  Paragraph 12 deals with foreign borrowing:</P>
    <P>Foreign borrowing is expensive and the repayment periods are usually shorter than would apply in the case of domestic issues.  Such borrowing, therefore, adds heavily to the taxation required to meet debt service charges.</P>
    <P>On page 12, paragraph 3, we find:</P>
    <P>The Public Capital Programme gives effect to a large extent to the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> and a report on it, therefore, is very much a progress report on the Second Programme.  The following general comments on public capital expenditure in 1965/66 and 1966/67 are intended to align what has happened or is planned with the projections of the Second Programme.</P>
    <P>We also find that the expenditure for <Col N="229" /> 1965-66 is expected to show an excess of £5.6 million on the figure for the same period in the previous year.  It is apparent, therefore, that the assumptions made for the resources in the Second Programme are not being realised.  Small savings and investment resources of departmental funds have fallen sharply.  So we find that the financial projections of the Second Programme have been completely wrong and we have had to resort to what has been described as exceptional borrowing.</P>
    <P>The outlook for 1966-67 again indicates that, in addition to the taxation imposed by the Budget, there will be further borrowing.  With all this taxation and all this borrowing, what results have we got?  That is the question the ordinary man in the street is asking.  We have another document&mdash; The Second Programme for Economic Progress Report for 1965 which I intended quoting at length but I do not intend doing so now, in view of the limited time left.  This Progress Report reveals a terrible situation.  It reveals the situation that, in sector after sector of the economy, the targets have not been reached and the best criterion or test we can apply to any programme for economic expansion is employment. We find in the NIEC Report No. 13&mdash; Comments on Department of Finance Review of Economic Progress in 1965 and Prospects for 1966&mdash;and I quote from page 25, paragraph 36:</P>
    <P>The growth in employment has fallen short of target in all sectors.</P>
    <P>That is a terrible indictment of Government policy.  It is a clear indication that the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> has been a failure.  In employment then we have the situation that in 1965 14,000 people left the land and there has been a net reduction in employment to the tune of 7,000.  The NIEC Report goes on to comment on page 25, paragraph 37:</P>
    <P>We are disquieted by the fact that total employment has fallen and we attach importance to the outcome of the examination of the policy measures that may be required to <Col N="230" /> secure the fulfilment of the targets which is now proceeding in the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>So that the acid test of Government policy and the acid test of any programme for economic expansion is employment.  In that test, this Programme has failed completely.</P>
    <P>Again, in this Progress Report on the Second Programme for Economic Expansion, we find that in the major sectors such as agriculture, we have had a drop of 14,000 people; 14,000 people have left the land, and in sector after sector of the agricultural industry, there is a failure to meet production targets.  In some of these branches of agriculture the reduction is very alarming.  I referred here on Thursday last to the reduction in milk supplies.  We find that in the month of January of this year, milk production is down by four per cent; three per cent in February, and the latest information I have had over the last weekend is that it is down, at the moment, for March to the tune of 12 per cent.  Beet production is down by 15 per cent.  Pig production reveals another alarming situation.  What I am worried about is this&mdash;not merely does it reveal a very dangerous situation in our agricultural industry from the point of view of the farmer but it reveals a much more dangerous and alarming state of affairs by virtue of the fact that the commodities I have just mentioned which have shown a drastic reduction, such as beet production, milk production, pig production are the branches of agriculture which provide employment in the processing industries.  I fear, therefore, for the employment content of our milk processing industries, for our bacon factories and for the sugar industry.</P>
    <P>If there were any sense of priorities at all in Government planning and investment, it would surely indicate that the sector of our economy which contributes in the biggest way to exports should receive the greater attention. Despite all that has been said and the progress made in the development of industry, the stark naked fact still remains that agriculture is the foundation of our economy, and but for our agricultural exports in 1965, we would <Col N="231" /> be in a situation today which one could not imagine.  We found that even a small reduction in our cattle exports for 1965 has been a major factor in bringing about the present situation.</P>
    <P>Therefore the situation revealed by this Budget is significant but it is also very alarming.  It is unfortunate that in the Minister's speech on the Budget and in the Budget itself there is nothing to indicate these exceptional measures which are now necessary to lift the economy from the doldrums into which it has fallen.  There is nothing in this Budget to stimulate our people to greater effort.  In my view, that is the worst feature of the Budget. Many people, especially thinking people, as well as asking what has happened, where has all the money gone or how did the present situation come about, are now asking what went wrong with the<i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> and why did it fail to produce the results which were so confidently forecast by the Taoiseach and other Government speakers in recent times?</P>
    <P>I am not an economics expert but I studied these documents and I believe the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> failed for the simple reason that it was only a programme. It is pointed out quite clearly in one of these NIEC publications that the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> merely outlined the targets which might be achieved by 1970 but it did not mark out the road or path by which those targets could be achieved.  I admit that reading the Second Programme is not the type of reading most people indulge in, but, for the want of something better to do some nights ago, I read, for the first time, that final chapter under the heading &ldquo;The Methodology of the Second Programme for Economic Expansion&rdquo;.  While a lot of the statistical methods employed there, and the terminology and equations, and so on, did not make sense to me, nevertheless it is true to say that the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> was nothing but a hypothetical academic exercise&mdash;and that is commented on.  That is a way of saying <Col N="232" /> what the NIEC have said, that it did not map out the road or path.  Instead of saying what might be done, it did not say how these targets could be achieved.  It is quite simple and it is an interesting exercise, if one had the time.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the Department of Finance expert considered the social implications, the human and psychological problems and the many other factors that have to be met with in determining and drawing up a national policy.  I believe and I am convinced now as never before, that the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> is what I said it was, namely, a hypothetical academic exercise having no foundation in reality and no awareness whatever of the problems which had to be encountered and which have since had to be met.  There is further evidence of this, in relation to investment, in the NIEC Report No. 13.  I shall quote from paragraph 33 on page 23:</P>
    <P>It seems to us, therefore, that some ceiling must be fixed for investment that will allow an acceptable increase in consumption and that will not push the balance of payments deficit beyond acceptable limits.</P>
    <P>It goes on to point out that the choice of an investment that does not add to productive capacity in such a way as to facilitate, for example, an increase in exports means the permanent sacrifice of an investment that would.  These two documents, Reports No. 11 and No. 13 of the NIEC, are more critical and, reading between the lines, far more critical than any Opposition Party could be of the methods employed in drawing up the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion.</i>  It criticises the lack of financial statistical information.  It criticises the very bad standard of investment management and the lack of efficiency in operation.  All of these criticisms are made by the NIEC.  I think that Deputies such as Deputy Molloy, who spoke for one and a half hours and quoted what X said in 1957 and what Y said in 1961, would be much better employed making use of the University Degree which he has by applying his mind to these problems. <Col N="233" /> This NIEC Report reveals tremendous weakness in Government policy and in Government planning.  When the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> was introduced&mdash;particularly in relation to targets which were fixed for agriculture&mdash;I recall that, at that time, numerous organisations and many people who understand agriculture, who know the problems, criticised the targets not because they were too high but, mark you, because they were too low.  I remember speaking here on the Budget two years ago and quoting the NFA green book publication where it states that the targets for agriculture in the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> were far too low and unrealistic.  Mr. Raymond Crotty produced an excellent document at that time and pointed out in no uncertain manner that, unless an annual gross rate of 5 per cent was achieved in the agricultural programme, total economic expansion could not be achieved on the target specified in the Second Programme.  Mr. Allwood, who is management expert with the Agricultural Institute, in a paper about two years ago addressed to the Statistical and Social Society of Ireland pointed out, in relation to the development of the west, that industrial development was not enough and that unless an overall growth rate for agriculture, the basic industry, was achieved, the Second Programme targets could not be achieved.  Despite the fact that the NFA, the ICMSA and other economists and independent experts criticised the Second Programme targets because they were too low, we now have the unbelievable situation that those low targets have not been achieved and, as far as we can gather, the progress rate of expansion in agriculture in 1965 was only 1 per cent.</P>
    <P>I do not know what methods are used in the Department of Finance in the matter of investment analysis, in the matter of fixing priorities for investment, and so forth.  Agriculture, and industries based on agriculture, is contributing the major portion of our exports.</P>
    <P>Except for the £100,000 for small western farms, there is nothing in the <Col N="234" /> Budget to enable this most important major industry to expand and develop. On the other hand, money has been invested in industries and in various projects which have proved to be unwise and unsound investments.  A classic case, and an example which has been quoted quite frequently in this House and which has been the subject of numerous Questions, is the Potez Aircraft Factory at Baldonnel.  I could never understand why, and on what ground, the Department of Industry and Commerce decided to invest a substantial amount of money in this industry.  It was well known at the time that, for various reasons, this project had not an earthly chance of succeeding.  The type of aircraft it was producing had become obsolete.  The British aircraft manufacturing industry was in the doldrums.  Was it conceivable that a French aircraft manufacturer could succeed in the industry at Baldonnel in this country, where there was no pool of the skilled technicians so necessary in aircraft manufacture, at a time when the British aircraft industry, with its long experience, was in the doldrums?</P>
    <P>It is vitally essential that this House would be told by the Minister (a) on what grounds this money was allocated for that industry and (b) who vetted the proposal.  On the other hand, while this money could be made available to industries which were very doubtful from the word &ldquo;go&rdquo;, every Deputy, including myself, has had numerous complaints from small industrialists and small businessmen in our constituencies, about the extreme caution and the fine-combing methods of the Industrial Development Authority, and the almost impossible job it is to get a grant of a few thousand pounds for a small industry.</P>
    <P>We must do a lot of rethinking in relation to this question of investment, and particularly investment in development projects.  As I have said, the NIEC have been very critical of the Department of Finance.  In their Report, No. 11, at page 50, paragraph 71, referring to the question of priorities, they state:</P>
    <P>In particular, in the case of capital <Col N="235" /> expenditure, a ranking of projects in order of national importance is necessary to ensure that the resources available for public and private investment, which are now scarce in relation to the demands being made upon them, are used to maximum advantage... If the new opportunities for growth are to be exploited to the full while at the same time maintaining stability, a stricter examination of the relative benefits from the various possible projects is required... In deciding on the appropriate rankings for productive investments and the share of resources to be devoted to each, close attention must be given to the increase in national output, and especially in exports, which is expected, relative to the size of the investment, to the length of time before the increased output accrues and to the relationship of different projects to each other... The priorities must be clearly defined if they are to be understood by the community at large.</P>
    <P>There are numerous other paragraphs dealing with this particular subject.  It is very significant that the NIEC, a Government-sponsored body, making an intelligent analysis and assessment of the Second Programme, should be so critical in so many spheres of development.</P>
    <P>However, there is some indication that the Government, and the Department of Finance in particular, have learned a lesson from the failure of the Second Programme, and have taken note of the criticism of the NIEC Report because in the Capital Budget, 1966, at page 17, under the heading &ldquo;Review and control&rdquo; it is stated:</P>
    <P>Particular attention is being given to methods of assessing the national value of investment projects in order to determine those investments which, in relation to their cost, yield the maximum economic and social benefits to the community.</P>
    <P>This gives some hope that there is to be a new approach to the whole question of economic development.  The selection of priorities for investment, the proper management of investment, <Col N="236" /> and so forth, are all vitally important factors, but there is another important factor, that is, economies in the cost of public administration to which Deputy Costello referred last night. This is the age of the management consultant, the efficiency expert, the investment analyst.  Over the past five or six years, we have had the Taoiseach and Government Ministers and spokesmen, exhorting businessmen and industrialists, and even farmers, to modernise their methods, to effect all the economies possible, and to strive for the most efficient possible methods of production.</P>
    <P>This year, and every year recently, we found a colossal increase in the cost of public administration.  Surely if the businessmen and industrialists and farmers, by the application of modern management techniques and methods, could achieve economies, the Government could do likewise.  It is very bad example for the Government to be preaching this and not making any effort to set a lead themselves. That, in fact, is what the Government have been doing.  There must be room for economies in the Civil Service, in the administration of the various Departments, and so forth.</P>
    <P>Another important factor in righting the economic situation is the question of savings.  The reduction in savings has been very disappointing, and has been a significant factor in leading to the present situation.  Over the past four or five years in Budget speeches, I drew the attention of the Minister to a method of saving which has proved very successful, particularly in Britain and in the United States, a method of saving which is very attractive to the ordinary person.  I refer to the unit trusts.  I understand that some unit trusts are operating here.  I do not know to what extent.  I feel this method of saving is well worth looking into still further.</P>
    <P>There are three questions: Where did the money go?  Why did the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion fail</i>?  What can be done now to save the situation?  The situation will not be saved by coming in here with tomes from the Dáil Library and quoting what one Deputy said in 1957 and what another said in 1960. <Col N="237" /> Deputy Molloy last night and this morning delayed the House for an hour and a half quoting from this, that and the other book.  I did not hear him quote once from a Government publication.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy wishes to make his maiden speech, he will have an opportunity in about five minutes.  The third question which now remains is: What can be done?  In the course of the debate over the past few weeks, various suggestions have been put forward.  I believe that the NIEC can play a much stronger and much more active role in economic planning and development.  I believe the NIEC should be reconstituted, and that the obvious flaw and great weakness in the NIEC is the fact that there is no representation for agriculture.  I believe that should be remedied without any delay and that the terms of reference of the NIEC should be extended, that they should not merely be a National Economic Council but should be a National Economic Development Council, which is an entirely different thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, there is need also for the reorganisation of the economic unit, if there is such a thing, within the Department of Finance so that people will know what is happening.  The lack of information, particularly from the Department of Finance, has been commented on and criticism has been voiced here in the NIEC Report, No. 11, that information, vital to the assessment of progress, was not forthcoming in time and delays of two and three months were very often experienced.  I feel, then, there will have to be a complete re-thinking and I would suggest&mdash;I think Deputy Treacy mentioned this last night&mdash;we should hear no more about the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> but that the mistakes of its failure can be learned <Col N="238" /> and an entirely new approach adopted for the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not my intention to delay the House too long.  I just wish to refer to one aspect of the Budget, which is perhaps a very limited one.  With regard to the dancehall tax, the owner of a dancehall is liable to turnover tax if his income for the month exceeds £150.  As I understand it, with the application of the new Budget tax, this will disappear and he will be liable to ten per cent turnover tax on his complete takings throughout the year.  This will hit many of the small dancehalls very hard.  I refer particularly to the communityowned halls throughout the country. Many of those have been built by committees and organisations such as the ICA and parish committees and they are owned by the people of the parish.  All of them that I know are, at the moment, finding it very difficult to meet their responsibilities.  Their incomes are very low and the rates and income tax imposed on them are very high.  They must consider the cost, no matter what functions they run.  This will certainly put many of them out of business.</P>
      <P>These dancehalls are run for social purposes rather than for profit.  They are places where people can congregate from time to time.  They have their socials and they run functions for profit to run various organisations in the parish.  Now two standards are fixed by the Budget, more than 100 patrons and a charge of 4/-.  I am not aware of any rural halls in which the charge is now 4/-.  I think it is always 5/-.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Even though the population in many areas throughout the west is very low, I think that on social occasions you will rarely have a crowd smaller than 100.  I think this concession means nothing and I would ask the Minister to have a second look at this problem.  It is obvious that he and his advisers realise that the problem of those dancehalls should be dealt with but I feel their information must be very limited when they <Col N="239" /> picked those figures as the limits for exemptions.</P>
      <P>Considering that the Budget covers all the economy of the country, and considering all that has been said about it, this problem may sound very trivial and small but I feel it is one of great importance to the community.  It is one which can be appreciated only by a person who lives in a rural community, as I do, and who has some little responsibility for organising and running the social life of the country and trying to keep those particular halls open so that they will be there any time the people need them.  It is not my intention to go into any other problems of the Budget.  As I said, they have been dealt with in detail. I would ask the Minister again to give a second look at this particular difficulty as I feel that what has been offered will, in practice, mean nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Each Budget seems to me to get steadily worse and worse.  There was a time when we could look forward to a Budget as giving some substantial reliefs and asking for some taxation but now we have arrived at a situation where we have substantial taxation and very little reliefs.  The cost of living seems to me to be steadily increasing, and, although in this Budget the cost of foodstuffs was not directly increased, the increased freight charges and the increase in petrol and motor taxation costs must raise the price of foodstuffs. We have arrived at a situation in which many housewives are faced with an impossible task in balancing their weekly budgets.  It has become for many a gigantic challenge to feed and clothe their children alone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mean to be very brief because I know there are a number of other speakers but there are a few things I should like to mention.  I would like to point out that, by deliberate Government action, the cost of living is being increased this year.  Some time ago&mdash;I think, last year&mdash;the Minister for Finance decided that the petrol companies should not increase the price of petrol because he felt, I suppose, they make enough profit as it is and because he felt that the motoring <Col N="240" /> public could not afford the increase. Now, by the deliberate action of the Minister, the price of petrol is being increased and motor taxation is being increased.  Those of us who live in rural Ireland realise that a motor car is no longer a luxury.  CIE provide little or no transport in rural Ireland, particularly in the west of Ireland, and, therefore, a motor car is a necessity.  God knows, it is hard enough to keep the people in the west of Ireland without penalising them still further by forcing them to lay up their cars.</P>
    <P>A great many people in the west of Ireland make a living out of travelling shops and the use of trucks and lorries. Those people are now faced with an increase of 25 per cent taxation.  That will be very hard on a great many of them.  Every Budget brings an increase in the price of alcohol.  I know alcohol can be regarded as completely a luxury.  I will not say whether it is or not but we must remember that there are thousands of publicans&mdash;there are some of them in this House&mdash;who are trying to eke out an existence nowadays. In Bible times, a publican was considered a tax-gatherer but it was never as true then as it is now.  The publican is a tax-gatherer.</P>
    <P>Here again we have the spectacle of the Minister last October or November solemnly telling the publicans to keep to the prices they had in the last Budget.  I suppose he felt the people could not afford the increase of 1d on the pint.  He also solemnly warned Guinness that they had to keep to the prices they had in the last Budget.  Now we have the position that in a few short months the Minister deliberately increases the prices.  It seems that Ministers, particularly the Minister for Finance, speaks with his tongue in his cheek: one month he assures the publicans and the brewers that it cannot be done, that the public cannot bear increased costs and next month he gives the increase.  I am rather alarmed at the way the Guinness company are treated in this country. I know they make large profits and people say: &ldquo;Look at their profits&rdquo;. Have we arrived at a situation when it is becoming a crime to make a profit? <Col N="241" /> I remember after the Minister's statement last year seeing the managing director of Guinness interviewed on Telefís Éireann.  His words at that time shook me.  He pointed out that while Guinness had increased the pint by 2d, I think, since 1952, the other increases had been caused by deliberate Government action.  He also pointed that if this continued, Guinness would have to look at their programme and see where best they could manufacture their products.</P>
    <P>We must remember that Guinness are big employers and good employers. They contribute in many ways to the social life of the country.  They endow scholarships, contribute to and sponsor various functions and because they are making big profits that is no reason why they should be penalised.  I wonder what crime they are guilty of.  Is it one of omission or commission?  It seems as if there is some deliberate Government action to push this company a little too far but the day we push Guinness out of the country, it will be a national tragedy and the Minister for Finance who is trying to balance the Budget without the revenue coming from Guinness will be faced with serious difficulties.</P>
    <P>I expected some relief in income tax in this Budget.  I expected, and I think everybody else did, that the rate of income tax would be increased slightly but I thought the allowances would be increased also.  There was one slight concession of £30 for children over 11 years of age but if we look at the allowances, we see that a single man may earn only £6 per week before paying income tax.  A married man may earn £520 a year and a married woman, if she is earning, is allowed the princely sum of £45.  I know a great many men in this country consider that women's heads are made like Professor Higgins said of cotton, hair and rags and that when a woman marries, her place is at the kitchen sink.  I regret to inform the House that we have arrived at the situation, whether for good or ill, in which married women are working and, as the years go on, more and more married women will work.</P>
    <P>To my mind, such people should be <Col N="242" /> divided into two categories, the women who work because they are not sufficiently occupied at home, not because of financial considerations, and those who work because they must.  The former are not so much to be pitied as those who must work.  A great many people in Dublin city and throughout the country are working to eke out an existence for their families, trying to give them a reasonable education. They are badly hit and it is time the Minister for Finance had another look at this £45 allowance for a married woman because that allowance does nothing for her and certainly does not help her morale.</P>
    <P>Another interesting situation is that if you have a single man and woman, brother and sister, living together in a joint home, they have an allowance of £312 each per annum before paying income tax which brings them, if my arithmetic is correct, to £624 per annum while a married man and his wife do not get quite £600, assuming the married man and woman have no children.  It seems to me that the married woman is being penalised and that the whole system is wrong.  There is a Victorian attitude about it, an idea that women should be seen and not heard, that they should be in their homes at the kitchen sink and that they are fit for nothing else.  It is time we had more enlightenment and time someone said something of that kind. Perhaps I am not the best person to do so but I feel I should say anything I can to highlight this injustice which is being done.</P>
    <P>This Budget does very little for the social welfare recipients.  In fact, the 5/-extra given to old age pensioners and postponed as it is until next November is a very inadequate increase in the times in which we live.  This 5/-, I note, is given only to those who have absolutely no means.  The time has come when there should be some tightening up in the system of unemployment benefit.  The allowance given to those who need it is scarcely adequate but in the west of Ireland particularly&mdash;I know it is politically unwise to say this&mdash;there are people getting unemployment assistance who could be working.  I believe the day we <Col N="243" /> give them the incentive to idle is the day we do a bad turn for this country. Those who cannot work or genuinely cannot get employment are entitled to more than they are getting.  If people were honest and if those who could work worked, those who cannot get work could get more.  I think the Government have sufficient inspectors and some sort of inspection should be carried out to ensure that those who are receiving unemployment assistance are entitled to it.</P>
    <P>Much lip service is paid here, particularly by Ministers, to saving the west.  I suppose the Minister considers that his gesture of £100,000 for the farmers of the west of Ireland will do something to save them.  It is only a drop in the ocean and I consider that our farmers were deceived up to this year.  They were given to understand that there would be some relief or aid for them in this Budget.  They suffered last year&mdash;shall I say it&mdash;through no fault of their own, a disastrous year and in point of fact they got nothing. Although much is said about saving the west when it comes down to brass tacks, I do not think any Minister gives two hoots for the west.</P>
    <P>I have been following newspaper reports and comments by political correspondents for the past three weeks very carefully and I note they are all disappointed that the Opposition do not suggest ways of balancing the Budget.  It is not the duty of the Opposition to provide the Government with this information.  Every Government is supplied with a vast service of highly-paid and competent civil servants and it is the Minister's duty to seek the aid and advice of those civil servants.  I have reluctantly come to the conclusion that the Civil Service may give that advice but it is certainly never heeded.  Therefore, I do not think it is any duty of mine to tell the Minister how he can balance the Budget but I can tell him in my opinion one way in which he can save money.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ryan asked a question last week about how much it costs, on average, to run a State car.  If I am correct, I think the average cost was about £3,850 per car per year.  We are <Col N="244" /> a very small and poor country by West European standards.  Yet we run a vast fleet of State cars costing £3,850 each per year.  I suggest these State cars should be withdrawn and that we should have a system such as they have in England whereby a pool of cars is maintained, so that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>When a Minister finds he has to fulfil a State engagement, he can simply ring up and say: &ldquo;I need a car to go to Cork&rdquo; and that would be provided.  I know these cars are allotted to Ministers and they are allowed to use them as they would use their private cars.  Many of us in this House drive cars and we all know we do not spend anything like £3,000 per annum on them.  This is only a very small thing but it is typical of the country to do everything on a magnificent scale as if we had means to spare.  If we began with the small economies, we would save a considerable amount of money in the year and would not be fleecing the unfortunate taxpayers to the same extent.  We have now reached a situation in which there is no incentive for a person to work. The more you earn the more is taken from you.  I consider the whole income tax code to be demoralising.  That is all I can say about it.</P>
      <P>I shall not delay the House any longer but I would recommend the Minister to look particularly into that last recommendation of mine about the State cars.</P>

      <P>The relevance of the Deputy's concluding remarks to the Budget of 1966 escapes many of the Members of the House, including, I am sure, the Chair.  I doubt if Deputy Ó Ceallaigh really understands the relevance of it or if he has even read the papers to which he made reference and which he said Deputies should read before they come into the House.</P>
      <P>It probably would help if when dealing with the Budget of 1966, people would concern themselves with the problems of 2016 as well as with those of 1966.  We have heard a great deal about the events of 50 years ago. Never in the course of this debate did I hear anybody on the Government side of the House refer to the inevitable consequences in 2016 of what we are doing in 1966.  Yet there are today in swaddling clothes, there are today in our national schools, and there are about to be born in this year of 1966, children who in 2016 will be but in their early fifties.  These are the people about whom we in Fine Gael are primarily concerned.</P>
      <P>While everybody in the nation will pause to reflect in this year upon the deeds of the men of 1916, we say we are not keeping faith with those men, we are not keeping faith with our own people, if we neglect to consider the consequences of the folly of this Government, which will have damaging effects as far away as 2016.  Fifty years hence may seem much further away than 50 years gone by to some people, but there are many of us who were not born during the years and years and years they have quoted in the course of this debate, and the relevance of what happened in the first, second or third decade of this century must escape many people today who are concerned with the pressing problems of 1966.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We recall that at the last general election the Taoiseach sought the votes <Col N="248" /> of the people on his giving an undertaking that this would be his last chance.  He asked for a last chance and promised that he would resign before the next general election.  It would seem prudent for him to resign now because everything upon which he went to the country has been rejected by him since. The path on which he led the people has exploded, is now full of ruts and is now impossible for the people to discern. They do not know where they are being led, if they are being led at all.</P>
    <P>One wonders why the Taoiseach has not the decency to resign yet, but then one recalls that he said his greatest pride&mdash;they were the words he used&mdash; his greatest pride would be to be Taoiseach when the country would be celebrating 1916.  Therefore, in the true tradition of the leadership of Fianna Fáil, personal pride comes before the national interest.  One wonders, when his pride is satisfied in the next few weeks, will he then have the decency to resgin, or will he again display the weakness of the leadership of Fianna Fáil, an inability to understand when he has outstayed his welcome.</P>
    <P>The Government are taking some comfort in the fact that, in a typically patriotic way, the Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Cosgrave, has stated that we in Fine Gael are satisfied that this country has a basically sound economy.  But we have never said at any time in the course of this debate that that economy has not been seriously damaged by the behaviour of the Government over the past nine years.  We are convinced that it has been seriously damaged, and that is why we have carried on this debate for almost a month and why we refuse to allow the Government to give the impression that things are sound or that no serious damage has been done.</P>
    <P>History, small petty history, has been produced in the course of this debate. I might be pardoned for referring to two really significant historical and economic events.  I refer to the United States of America, then and now the wealthiest nation in the world, which in the 1920s had a sound economy but which had a Government lacking in moral courage, which had a Government lacking in appreciation of <Col N="249" /> what the country needed, as we have here today.  The result was that a sound economy came crashing down in 1929, accompanied by suicides, accompanied by economic, financial and social ruin.  It needed a Roosevelt to save the American economy, to save the American nation and indeed to save the world.</P>
    <P>In Germany, mighty, wealthy Germany, rich and powerful then as now, there was in the 1920s another weak Government, lacking moral leadership, lacking moral courage, doing intense damage there to the national morale, as is happening here today.  Germany knew economic ruin when one day after another a barrel load of marks would be needed to purchase something that one mark would buy the day before, and the week after a lorry load of marks would be needed to purchase something that a barrel load would buy the day before, with growing inflation, with growing depreciation in the value of money, just as we have today.  The German economy came crashing down, to be followed by the advent of Herr Adolf Hitler, because the people had to turn to something in the depression.</P>
    <P>In 1966 we face the same desperate possibilities.  Because our sound economy is being seriously and continuously damaged, accompanied by a desperately low standard of national morale due to the dreadfully low lead given by the Government, we face very serious dangers and the very steps taken in this Budget are the steps the National Industrial Economic Council said should not be taken.  That is why we so vigorously and so viciously attack it.  They did the very thing they were told by their experts and advisers not to do and what we in the Fine Gael Party told them not to do. There are some commentators apparently who are not capable of understanding what was in the NIEC Report or what has been said by us.</P>
    <P>Many people are wondering why we are in this position at the moment.  Let us reflect on the figures.  Even though they are in millions, they are nevertheless relevant and are easily understandable to anyone who wants to understand them.  Last year the records <Col N="250" /> show that there was a drop in small savings of £5 million.  Withdrawals from post office banks and small savings were £5 million greater than deposits.  Why?  The small saver is not a speculator; he is not a spendthrift. He is the person who tucks a little away for the rainy day and uses it when the rainy day arrives.  This £5 million which was taken out represents an umbrella used by these people when the rainy day came under Fianna Fáil in 1965 and 1966.  These people still have the umbrella up.  In case we did not know, the Government have showered more financial rain on them in this miserable Budget.</P>
    <P>Departmental funds, which are a barometer of the people's confidence in the Government, and a barometer of the buoyancy of the economy, also fell by £4 million.  Again, this is a vote of no confidence on the part of the people in the Government.  Because of the credit squeeze which the Government generated in their panic, and again in ill-advised circumstances, the Government had to pay ransom money to get their own overdraft.  They had to pay £3½ million as a consequence of their own credit squeeze.  Exchequer Bonds are a barometer of the confidence of the business community in the Government and are an indication of what savings are available in the private sector.  The Government were compelled to sell £5½ million of Exchequer Bonds to pay back the investors who were no longer prepared to lend the money to the Government who were bringing about the financial ruin that has blighted the country.</P>
    <P>Then we have to go into the world market to see the consequences of the Government's folly.  We had to contribute £4,300,000 to the International Monetary Fund in order to try to stabilise our economy.  At home, because the preachers would not practise what they were preaching to everybody else, the Government outran their own estimates of expenditure and their capacity to pay for what they were doing and spent an additional £8 million beyond what we were asked to produce to them last year.  This has culminated in the greatest national degradation we have suffered for <Col N="251" /> decades, having to hawk our credit and the standing of our economy through the financial capitals of the world.</P>
    <P>Do not let anybody think that our inquiries were confined to New York or Duesseldorf.  We went to every Irish embassy and legation and the people there were told to make inquiries in the financial capitals in which they were situated to see if Ireland could get a measly £7 million.  Seven million pounds which the American stock market would spend or throw out while a stockbroker would be sneezing was refused to this Republic, notwithstanding the fact that we had a basically sound economy.  I ask why? It was because these financiers took a look at the book which Deputy O Ceallaigh said we should look at and because they watched how the economy was drifting and because they saw the Government were mismanaging affairs.  Then they refused to lend the money which, as I said, they would spend while a stockbroker was sneezing on the New York Stock Exchange.  We could not get it there and we had then to go to Europe, to Germany, where there is more money than they know what to do with.  We had to pay exorbitant terms for the price of the Government's folly.</P>
    <P>This is a condemnation of the Government's approach to the Budget. Having made all these mistakes, one would think that they would try to learn by their mistakes but they have done the reverse.  At the end of six years, not only have we had trade deficits but in our net expansion of external activity, we had a deficit of £20½ millions.</P>
    <P>We arrive at the few weeks before the Budget in which the Government had to consider what policy to adopt. They are told in the NIEC Report, a Report prepared by industrialists, financiers, economists and so on, people best able to judge, that there was a chance of the economy recovering, provided the Government observed the prerequisite of recovery and that was not to increase taxation.  The Government ignored that advice and increased <Col N="252" /> taxation by the biggest increase we have ever had in the 44 years of our independence, the biggest and most savage increase.  I wonder that the members of the National Industrial Economic Council have not resigned. Their advice was ignored and they have been thrown out.  They have been told that no matter what advice they give, the Government are going to ignore them and so we have increased taxation of the order of £12½ million.</P>
    <P>What will be the consequences of this taxation?  You cannot accuse us of trying to take political advantage or of trying to cause unnecessary scares. We will rely on the experts in the NIEC Report.  We are told that the consequences of increased taxation will be a fall in employment.  That is the Government's deliberate intention, to increase unemployment in 1966-67.  Do not let anybody have any doubts about whether this Government carry out their printed intentions.  In 1958, they told us they intended to cut down on housing because social investment had been completed.  They did that and in some years produced one-fifth the number of houses built in the days of their predecessors.  The intention of the Budget is to increase unemployment.</P>
    <P>The second consequence of increasing taxation this year, the NIEC Report says, in support of what we in Fine Gael have been saying for the past few years, is that it will bring about a fall in output.  This is going to reduce national productivity.  This additional tax bill is going to do the very thing which is completely contrary to all the Government's boasted intentions in the second programme of so-called economic expansion.</P>
    <P>We in Fine Gael have forever been pointing out&mdash;and we are supported by the NIEC Report&mdash;that increased taxation will increase prices and costs. There is no other way in which taxation can be levied except by increasing prices and costs.  This will be an inevitable consequence of the £12½ million increase in taxation.  We are told this by people of no less ability than those on the NIEC Council.  This increase in taxation will also reduce our international competitiveness.  That is also <Col N="253" /> an inevitable consequence of this Budget.  In case there is any doubt about it, we had experience of that years ago.  Every time Fianna Fáil brought in a vicious Budget that was the result, and this one is more vicious than any that went before.  Finally, we are promised in the NIEC Report that the consequences of increasing taxation this year will be to prolong the restrictive measures the Government were obliged by their own folly to bring into operation in the last 12 months.</P>
    <P>These are the consequences of the Budget.  All the silly backbenchers of Fianna Fáil can do is to run down to the Library and look up the index to see what Tom, Dick agus Harry said 20, 30 or 40 years ago.  We are concerned with 1966 and, as I said, with 2016, which most of us will not see and, therefore, for many people it is irrelevant today.  But for the young people it is intensely relevant.  We are concerned that a Budget should be brought in in this day and age which will reduce employment and output, increase prices and costs, disimprove competitiveness and prolong the restrictive measures introduced last year.</P>
    <P>On income tax, we had the Taoiseach for want of a better argument suggesting he was merely returning to the level of taxation operated by the last inter-Party Government.  I suppose ten years ago is not too far for him but it is for many people not then of voting age.  However, he has made the argument and I shall answer it.  The 8d in the £ increase in tax now proposed is equal to a deduction of three per cent in the rate of wages of the people. While the Minister for Finance and members of the Government are saying that the maximum that can be allowed is three per cent by way of wage increases, they negative that completely with one stroke of the pen by increasing income tax to a level equivalent to reducing incomes by three per cent. In addition, the number of people paying income tax is increasing year after year.  The proportion of the earning population now paying income tax is much greater than it was ten years ago. Unfortunately, for reasons best known to themselves, the Revenue Commissioners <Col N="254" /> and the Statistics Office are always very much behind the times with their income tax statistics.  Deputies will have noted in the Income Tax Report published in 1962&mdash;the Seventh Report of the Commission on Income Taxation&mdash;that the figures used to illustrate their arguments were for the financial year 1954-55, seven years before the publication of their own report.  Therefore, we have not got available to us the figures upon which to make an accurate assessment of what the position is today compared with 1956.  But I say without fear of contradiction from watching the trends over the years that at present compared with 1956 three people pay income tax for every two who paid it at that time.  This clearly indicates that income tax, which at one time was a tax on the rich to feed, clothe and comfort the poor, is now a tax on the majority of the people.  It is no longer a progressive tax but a very regressive one.  Imposing a three per cent increase in income tax while at the same time permitting only a three per cent increase in wages to some sections of the community is grossly unfair and we in Fine Gael cannot support it.</P>
    <P>I wish to give way to other Deputies because in these closing stages of the debate it would be unnecessary as well as unfair to travel the whole field of the economic statistics which have been published and frequently quoted.  But the steps and consequences I have indicated globally are the inevitable consequence of this year's Budget.  Therefore, this Budget stands condemned for the consequences it will have on the economy.</P>
    <P>Within the past 18 months industry and commerce have suffered severely because of the Government's dithering and playing around in the field of international trade.  For the 12 months prior to the announcement of the consequences of the negotiations with the British Government, industry here did not know what way to turn, what steps should be taken.  In very many cases industries very properly delayed expansion schemes and contemplated alterations because they did not know whether they would be able to remunerate the capital spent on alterations <Col N="255" /> they had in mind.  They were hoping that when the uncertainty vanished&mdash; even though it vanished in a disastrous way for some of them&mdash;at least they would be able to make plans for the future.  But now, when they could be making plans and executing those plans, they find themselves entirely deprived of credit because the banks will not make the money available to them.</P>
    <P>The result is that in this year, in which we ought to be changing and expanding to meet the challenge we now have to face, industry and commerce are unable to do so.  We in Fine Gael feel that the Government are doing serious damage to the economy, particularly to the industrial arm, when they bring in a Budget of depression and restriction at a time when industry ought to be able to move forward with more confidence and get their wants in necessary financial assistance.  They certainly will not get it from the banks or from the ordinary private lending agencies.  They are forced to turn to whatever small pittance the Government are prepared to make available through the Industrial Development Authority and other industrial financial agencies.</P>
    <P>I am sorry to say we are now living in an age in which no Irish need apply for financial assistance from the State.  Really, these Government agencies ought to print on their notepaper or post in the windows of their offices &ldquo;No Irish Need Apply.&rdquo;  What the landladies of Birmingham, Manchester and Coventry have put in their windows for years now is the slogan of many State agencies and Government Departments.  I do not say that lightly. The experience of many Deputies, industries and public people must be that again and again when respectable, long-established Irish institutions seek money from State concerns it is refused to them unless the applicant is accompanied by some foreigner of unknown parentage and uncertain background. If he can bring in some person with an unpronounceable name and some unknown background an Irish person has a chance, so long as he is the subtenant of some foreign interest. <Col N="256" /> This to us is an appalling state of affairs and something we entirely reject.  While we accept that the percentage of industrial losses and failures is small relative to the number which have been sustained, we say these failures should not have occurred.  We share the views of industry and commerce and the country in general that we cannot afford losses of the magnitude of those which came to light last year.  The ultimate consequence of losses of that kind is that the sections in this country which are paying have to pay not only for themselves but also for the mistakes and folly of the Government.</P>
    <P>I conclude with these words.  A good barometer of the Government's economic success or failure is housing. Every county council and city corporation has been notified within the past week of the money to be made available to them over the next year or in advance to meet existing commitments. The result of this notification will be that local authorities all over the country will have to bring building operations practically to a halt.  That is a disgraceful situation.  It is an unpardonable situation and, in view of what the Federation of Builders said last week, it is an appalling situation for the thousands employed in the building industry.  What is really despicable, however, is that for the past six months public servants, both local authority and State, have been asked to behave in an extremely shabby manner, in an unprofessional manner, in an untruthful manner, in dealing with people urgently looking for houses.  It would not, perhaps, be pertinent to this debate to dilate further on this, but we shall certainly deal with the matter <i>in extenso</i> on another occasion.</P>
    <P>It is now quite clear that there is nothing short of ruin facing the building industry, not to talk of other industries and other sectors which will be savaged during the next 12 months. All this will flow from the folly of this Budget and the folly of this Government over the past nine years.  When will the Taoiseach have the decency to get out of office?  He promised he would do so.  He has broken every <Col N="257" /> other promise he made to the people one short year ago.  If he is a man of honour, there is one promise he can keep, that is, to get out.  He is no longer wanted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>Government policy is very clearly outlined in this Budget. There was a choice between cutting down on essential services or finding the money by additional taxation. Cutting down on essential services would be fatal.  It would result in the slowing down of the economic growth of the country, and that at a time when we must be in a position to avail of every opportunity that offers in the years ahead.  Cutting down would mean unemployment.  We all know what happened in 1956 when similar difficulties confronted the inter-Party Government.  Their action then was far more costly to the country than will be the action taken by the Fianna Fáil Government today in similar circumstances. What happened in 1956 must never happen again.  We in Cork city remember very well the years of inter-Party Government.  We had unemployment; we had emigration.  Our biggest factories were on half-time.  Worse still, people lost all confidence in the future of the country.  The year ahead is a promising one, especially in the field of exports.  If full advantage is to be gained and if we are to avail of all the opportunities, then the country must be geared to meet the challenges that will certainly confront us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am amazed at the picture that has been painted here by some members of the Opposition.  I wonder are these Deputies trying to engender panic in our people?  Or are they trying to bulldoze the Government into taking irresponsible action?  That is the question that is being asked.  I am afraid the Opposition have failed to engender any panic.  We are an educated people and people generally are fully aware that the Government are obliged, as a responsible Government, to take responsible action to cure the country of its present ills.  I fail to understand why the Opposition are so critical of Fianna Fáil policy.  No matter what legislation is introduced, it is bitterly <Col N="258" /> opposed by the Opposition and, in particular, by Fine Gael.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>The extraordinary thing is that the legislation brought in by Fianna Fáil has been successful and has been welcomed by the people.  If that were not the fact, we should not be sitting here today on these benches. Fifty years ago great sacrifices, including the supreme sacrifice, were made by great men.  Today we are asking the people to make little or no sacrifice to ensure that whatever difficulties the country is in will be successfully surmounted at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>
      <P>I am a member of a trade union and it is only right and proper that I should refer to the importance of bringing about closer co-operation between worker and employer.  Unless there is this co-operation, what hope is there for the future?  If there are difficulties and if the wheels of industry are not running as smoothly as they should, it is only to be expected that both sides should come together in mutual understanding of each other's problems. The Irish worker has brought this country through many a crucial stage and I have no doubt that Irish workers will co-operate now&mdash;I speak on behalf of the workers of Cork in the main&mdash;in whatever action may be necessary on the part of themselves and their trade unions.  No sacrifice is too great for progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Listening to the debate here I have been wondering if we are being told indirectly that the Government should never have approved, if you like, of the Irish worker getting an increase of 12 per cent in 1964.  I wonder are we being told now that that was wrong. In 1964 industrial production was the highest on record.  So, too, were exports.  Surely the Irish worker was entitled to his slice of the cake.  It is very important that incentives should be given to the worker; if the incentive is forthcoming, the Irish worker will prove his worth in industry and elsewhere.  I propound my views so that the man in the street will understand <Col N="259" /> the circumstances.  The Opposition must remember that they are dealing with educated people, with people who understand the problems and who are prepared to co-operate, irrespective of what sacrifices are expected of them.</P>
    <P>I say in all sincerity that at a time like this the people of Ireland, not only we on the benches of this House, are looking for leadership from the Government and also from the Opposition, and, so far, that leadership has not come from the Opposition benches. There is still time when we leave this House to go back to our constituencies, to put the problems before the people and to ask their co-operation to help the country out of the present circumstances and put it on the road to prosperity.  If they make that appeal to the people, the people will give all the help and co-operation asked of them and give it willingly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>The Budget of 1966 which we have been discussing over the past month is a cruel, hard and deceptive Budget.  Despite the fact that we know the people were expecting, through Government pronouncements, a tough Budget, this Budget surpasses their worst expectations. It is a Budget designed to take the money out of the people's pockets and to produce a surplus next year, and it can only be said for Fianna Fáil that over the past few years they have been getting more and more for worse and worse.  As one wit has said, we do not mind supporting the Government but we think the Government should leave us enough to support ourselves.  After this Budget the people will have little left to support themselves. Never has so little been done by so many for so few.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We now have an all-time record increase in taxation of £12 million, and that despite the promises made by Deputy MacEntee when he was Tánaiste in 1956 and also by the present Taoiseach that Fianna Fáil would not further increase taxation. Despite that £12 million increase in taxation, only a miserly 5/- per week is being handed out to the destitute <Col N="260" /> poor, to the widows and blind persons. I asked a question only a week ago and I was told that only 21,000 old age pensioners would qualify for that increase, despite the fact that &ldquo;Truth in the News&rdquo; had glaring headlines on the day of the Budget that all old age pensioners would get an increase, and this increase which was normally given from 1st August is now postponed until 1st November.</P>
    <P>In 1964, the Government gave an increase of 2/6d. per week to the old age pensioners and they paid it from 1st August of that year.  They gave an increase of £16 per week to the High Court judges and made that increase retrospective to the previous November. Many Deputies have spoken here of the sacrifices made in 1916.  This year is the fiftieth anniversary of the deaths of the men who gave their lives for Irish freedom and many people are today inclined to ask if it was worth it all.  Did they die in vain? Have we let them down?  Unfortunately for the Irish people, Fianna Fáil have been in office for 28 of the past 34 years and far from cherishing all our people equally, their policy has been to make the rich richer and the poor poorer.  There is no denying that.</P>
    <P>I have already related what they did in 1964 and we all know the status increases that were given that year when the Government knew the country was in difficulties.  They gave increases of between £900 and £1,000 a year to people in top positions.  The same Government are now prepared to pay an increase of no more than £1 per week to the lower-paid employees.  It cannot be said that the present Government have lived up to the ideals of the men of 1916.  They gave their life's blood for Ireland but Fianna Fáil are now sucking the life's blood out of the Irish people and the nation is bleeding to death.  We are living through a period when, although the financial structure is sound, the Government are sticking to a policy which has brought the nation to the brink of bankruptcy.  That cannot be denied.</P>
    <P>The Government have hawked the credit of the nation throughout the <Col N="261" /> world.  They were refused a loan in America and had to seek one in Germany, a country which was torn to shreds by two world wars and where, before they could go to work to build up the nation, the people had to make the tools with which to work.  They got from Germany a loan of £10 million at a rate of interest which Deputy MacEntee calculated is about ten per cent.  If that money was borrowed to build houses, to build hospitals or to give employment to our own people, we might say that there was some sense in it but it has been borrowed to pay debts incurred by the Government.</P>
    <P>I read in a newspaper recently, as recently as March 23rd, that the Minister for Health was shocked by the challenge to the institutions of Government. In 1956, in a time of similar challenge, the Fianna Fáil Deputies of Limerick marched in the funerals of people who were challenging the institutions of this State.  Their chickens are now coming home to roost.</P>
    <P>It is opportune to ask now what has produced this present situation, what, to quote the Minister for Finance, has gone wrong?  We all have to admit that the answer is the deliberate inflationary policy which the Government have pursued since taking office in 1957.  The Government were determined to pursue an open inflationary policy and the evils that would ensue from such a policy were pointed out to them time after time in this House by different speakers.  Deputy Sweetman, Deputy Dillon and Deputy T. F. O'Higgins all pointed out their mistake. I will not go into the number of times Deputy Dillon told them, but I think it was 17 times he pointed out to them what would happen if the Government continued their inflationary policy.  But, despite that warning, the Government paid no heed.</P>
    <P>Last week, the Minister for Transport and Power said in this House that we had rank inflation since 1962, that &ldquo;inflation&rdquo; is a dirty word and that it is time the people of Ireland came to realise that it is a dirty word.  Why did he not preach that in the Fianna <Col N="262" /> Fáil Cabinet?  I want to give him credit for going as far as he went because it has been known throughout the country for the past three or four years that he did say that.  It was well known that there was division in the Fianna Fáil Cabinet when the Minister for Transport and Power was warning them for the past two or three years.  He was prepared to put country before policy but the Government were not.  Their idea was to get back into office and to stay there.  Their idea was to use the people's money to retain their positions and to keep the fruits of office for themselves and for their own followers.  It is a pity the Government did not listen to those warnings.</P>
    <P>It might be no harm to refer to what Deputy Dillon said in a speech at Mountbellew on 3rd October, 1964, as reported in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of the following day.  He said that the economic situation in the country was highly critical.  He said he pointed out to the Government on the debate on the Adjournment on 1st July, 1964, that certain trends in Great Britain could no longer continue after the general election and that the post-election period in Great Britain would bring new and formidable problems for this country.  Deputy Dillon continued that speech by saying that the Government here were entitled to reasonable time to demonstrate what steps they proposed to take to meet the new situation.  He said that if, as he expected, they had no plans to deal with what could only be described as the crisis which then confronted the country, it was high time for them to get out.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon suspected and, unfortunately for this country, he was right that at that time the Government had no plans to deal with the situation confronting them.  When the Taoiseach taunts us about why we do not make proposals or why we do not say this or say that, I would remind the House that when he was questioned in 1956, he said it was the duty of the Government, as they hold the reins of office, to make the proposals and to govern the country, to control the economy and to balance all the factors, one against the <Col N="263" /> other.  They are the only people in a position to know the full facts.  They have the Civil Service behind them and they have other ways of finding out and nobody else has the same opportunity. Such information is not available to the Opposition.  The Government, with all that information available to them, should be able to avoid the successions of boom and slump which have been the unfortunate lot of the country.  Let us admit that they have failed to do their duty which was pointed out to them by the Minister for Transport and Power.  They took a gambler's chance on gaining admission to the Common Market to cover up all their faults and failings.  They have since negotiated the Free Trade Agreement with Britain and all their hopes now seem to be dependent on that agreement.</P>
    <P>The more we look at the sad history of the past few days, the more each and every one of us realises the Government's responsibility for our present plight; the more we realise how necessary it is that the Dáil&mdash;and not outside bodies&mdash;should hear a statement from the Government; the more we realise it is time the Taoiseach, or somebody else, came in here and told us the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.  Let us admit the incontrovertible fact that we have not been told the truth for a long time.</P>
    <P>No later than 16th November, when the Fianna Fáil Árd Fheis was being held, the Taoiseach referred to a time of economic difficulty.  The report of his speech to the Árd Fheis on that occasion is to be found in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of Wednesday, 17th November.  He said they need not be unduly perturbed because exceptional difficulties were affecting the country's rate of economic progress at that time. He then said he had taken measures to deal with the situation not a moment too soon and not a moment too late.</P>
    <P>I want to say deliberately that Fianna Fáil have not told the people the truth for the past month and they are not telling them the truth today, even in Leinster House.  The Minister for Local Government, in particular, <Col N="264" /> is withholding information from the people.</P>

      <P>Water schemes, sewerage schemes &mdash; the whole lot.  I shall quote from the circular issued from the Department of Local Government on 22nd March, 1966, just to let the House know how bad things are.  In the concluding paragraph, we read that it will be necessary to finance approximately ten per cent of the global capital allocation for any county council area for housing, sanitary and miscellaneous services from sources other than the Local Loans Fund or from internal resources.  Just to show how bad things are, there is mention of receipts from the sale of lands or other property and special repayments of advances for house purchase loans.</P>
      <P>The county councils of Ireland are being told in effect at the present time, when they are crying out for land on which to build more houses: &ldquo;If you have an acre or two anywhere in the county, put it up for auction: sell it immediately and try to meet some of your commitments.&rdquo;  The county councils are also being told: &ldquo;If a person has borrowed money for a house, get after him immediately and try to get him to pay the loan.  Try to get him to pay it within the next few months instead of over the next 35 years.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards County Westmeath, due to the fact that the Minister for Local Government has been telling us that money is available and that money will be available and has denied that there is a shortage of money, our county council are pledged to pay <Col N="265" /> £131,000 in grants and loans, but, according to this circular from the Government, our total allocation for 1966-67 will be a sum of £92,000.  In other words, Westmeath County Council will be £39,000 short in the amount necessary to meet their commitments from last year.  We must call a special meeting to tell the people that housebuilding has drawn to a close and that neither Westmeath County Council nor the Government have any money to give to pay loans or grants and that the only suggestion we have got from the Government is to get the money from the sale of land or other property.</P>

      <P>From the beginning of this year weekly payments are being made to smallholders in County Mayo and other western areas under an amendment of the Unemployment Assistance code based on a new method of assessing means arising out of the occupation of land in those areas.</P>

      <P>An application was received on 2nd December, 1965, from Mayo County Council for sanction to the raising of a loan of £3,000 for the erection of four houses with the aid of grants under section 6 of the Housing (Loans and Grants) Act, 1962 in respect of the rehousing of elderly persons.</P>
      <P>This application has been the subject of discussions and correspondence and the council have been advised that it might be more advantageous for them to provide this type of housing under the new provisions in the Housing Bill, 1965, whereby they would secure a higher rate of subsidy.  Alternatively it was suggested that the houses might be provided by an approved charitable or philanthropic body.</P>
      <P>It is understood that the matter is being further considered by the council on this basis.</P>

    <P>NOTE: Housing authorities were informed in the letter notifying the housing capital allocations that the allocation for local authority housing was decided on the basis of detailed consultations with the authorities generally regarding commitments for work in progress and in relation to tenders already before the Department.  Where no allocation was made on this basis, the authorities were notified to the effect that the position will be reviewed in due course in the light of such proposals as may be submitted later for the acceptance of tenders for new works.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government whether the amounts of money notified to each local authority for housing purposes represent an increase or a decrease in the current budgetary provisions.</P>

      <P>As regards the amount of the capital allocations notified to each housing authority, I would refer the Deputy to my written reply to his question today on the subject.  The total amount of these allocations was slightly less than the total budgetary provision for the appropriate housing services, because it was necessary to keep a small reserve for allocation later to areas where no works are now in progress or at tender stage.</P>
      <P>The total amount of the allocations represents an increase on the equivalent provision for 1965-66.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Parliamentary Secretary knows that this answer is complete and absolute bluff?  Does he not know that the amount notified to Dublin County Council is only sufficient for applications sanctioned before last December and that it represents sufficient for less than half the applications there at present?  Is he further aware that of all the private houses built in Ireland last year 42 per cent were built in Dublin county?  Does this mean that private house building must just sbottom for the next 12 months?</P>

      <P>I know the Parliamentary Secretary's difficulty&mdash;that he might not have all the material the Minister would have&mdash;but is the Parliamentary Secretary briefed to discuss this?  If a local authority have already entered into commitments for SDA loans or other housing purposes which are in excess of the total amount now provided for the year 1966-67, are they to understand that during the financial year 1966-67 they will not be in a position to make any provision for any new houses over and above those for which they are already committed? If that is so, we ought to know it and the industry ought to know it.  Otherwise, you will have a very acute crisis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Casey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware of a letter written by the Minister to Cork Corporation last week which indicates quite clearly that the amount of money sought by the corporation for capital development in respect of their housing projects has been reduced by two-thirds and that they will get less than one-third of the money required to carry on their normal building operations without expanding at all?  The Cork City Manager has the unfortunate task of sitting down and writing to these applicants: &ldquo;You are out.  Apply again next year or the year after, but the corporation cannot assist you to build a house this year.&rdquo;</P>

How does the Parliamentary Secretary expect Cork County Council (West) to build houses in 1966-67&mdash;is it with marbles?&mdash;seeing that the amount allocated is nil?

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>and <b>Mr. Spring</b> asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he is aware that a number of small farmers who made application for the new unemployment assistance were informed, prior to any decision <Col N="302" /> as to whether they were qualified to receive it, that this assistance was to be discontinued from 9th March until November next; if he is further aware of the grave disquiet existing among these farmers who were under the impression that this new assistance was to be paid throughout the year; and if he will now take the necessary steps to annul this disqualification period and pay the assistance throughout the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Boland) Kevin Boland">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is assumed that the question is concerned with the Unemployment Assistance (Employment Period) Order, 1966, in so far as that Order affects new smallholder-applicants from congested areas in the West.  As was made clear from the outset, the special provisions for these smallholders contained in the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1965, referred directly to the method of calculating means derived from the use of land.  In all other aspects, applications from such persons are governed by the general conditions of the unemployment assistance scheme.  It follows that this class is not exempted from the operation of the Order under mention, which debars all persons resident outside incorporated towns, who are occupiers of land with a rateable value exceeding £4, from receiving unemployment assistance from 9th March to 1st November, 1966.</P>
      <P>It is the settled procedure each year when the similar Employment Period Order is made to notify each person who is likely to be affected by it that his application for unemployment assistance is being reviewed.  This is done so as to avoid any misunderstanding about the stoppage of payments and to relieve the applicant of any further trouble in furnishing evidence of unemployment unnecessarily. As soon as possible thereafter, the applicant is given formal notice of any disallowance as imposed by a deciding officer, together with instructions as to how the right of appeal may be exercised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any delay which may occur in a given case in determining an application <Col N="303" /> for a qualification certificate will not cause any loss of payment to the applicant.  Under concessions also introduced by the 1965 Act, an applicant is now free to make a provisional application for unemployment assistance while his means are being determined and the grant of a qualification certificate can be made retrospective. Thus, where appropriate, payment can date from the time of the applicant's first approach to my Department, provided the decision as to means allows him to qualify for payment.  It will be appreciated, therefore, that the advance issue of a notification about the current Employment Period Order cannot of itself prejudice the right to payment up to 9th March, 1966, of any new small-holder-applicant whose means may not have been determined at that date.</P>
    <P>As regards the general question of eliminating the Employment Period Orders, I have already informed the House that a decision to do this would involve considerable extra expense and cannot be considered at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that this piece of legislation created a very bad impression in the minds of the general public and, in particular, in the minds of small farmers?  Farmers now with a valuation of more than £4 5s. are not entitled to any assistance from early March until November, that is, for two-thirds of the year.  Surely he will agree it is most unfair that such a regulation should be imposed, precluding them from any assistance whatsoever for eight months of the year and, in view of the prevailing position, would he not agree that the Order should be abandoned and those who qualify should, when their circumstances warrant it, be paid the whole year round?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>This has always been the position, as far as I know.  It has certainly been the position for a long number of years and the amendment of the Unemployment Assistance Acts did not affect that aspect of the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>We thought that the purpose was to help farmers to increase production, in view of the importance <Col N="304" /> of increased agricultural output.  Now we find that from March to November, the farmer will get nothing.  I believe these farmers should be carried the whole year round.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot help it if Deputy Spring did not read the Act that was passed here, but it was quite clear it referred only to a new method of assessing means in these areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that a farmer with a valuation of £4 is deprived of unemployment assistance?  Surely a farmer with a valuation of that size cannot make any money?  Surely the Order should be amended.  Will he consider amending legislation so that those who qualify will be paid this money for at least a longer period than the present three or four months?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not rule out the possibility of amendment at some time in the future, but it cannot be done at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>This legislation was introduced to subsidise the income of the small farmers and help them to increase production on the land.  They have no production from November to March.  From March to November they have production, but it is not sufficient and surely they should receive payment to help them increase production in those months and not just during the winter months?  This is poor consolation to the small farmers.</P>

    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Investigations carried out by my Department's Veterinary Research Laboratory over a number of years show that the organe-phosphorus compounds used for the treatment of cattle for warble fly do not cause abortion and do not, in fact, have any effect whatsoever on the course of pregnancy.  This is confirmed by the findings of experts in other countries.  Brucellosis is a bacterial disease caused by a specific germ and has no connection with warble fly dressing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no argument about this.  Our veterinary tests have proved conclusively that there is no connection between warble fly treatment and contagious abortion. We have also quite clearly established that there was no change in the pattern of abortion last year when the campaign was in full swing.  Thirdly we have established from samples sent on to us that there was no difference between abortions alleged to be related to warble fly dressing and those where dressing was not involved.  Finally, we have had the opinions of experts in other countries who have come to the same conclusion as our own, that there is no connection between warble fly treatment and contagious abortion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I reported progress, I was speaking of the circular sent by the Minister for Local Government to the local authorities during the past week.  This is a most important matter and should be discussed in connection with this Budget.  According to this circular, housebuilding in every county in Ireland is slowly grinding to a halt.  In County Westmeath, we are committed to an expenditure of £131,000 and for the year 1966-67, we are permitted to spend only £92,000. As of this very day, we are short of £40,000 to meet our commitments of last year.  We have called a special meeting of the county council for next Monday to tell the people the truth, that the money is not there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been speaking to other county councillors and I have heard from <Col N="316" /> them that it is the same all over, in Cork, Limerick, Mayo and Galway. The amount of money allocated for next year will not meet present commitments. What is the use of the Parliamentary Secretary coming in here&mdash; the Minister for Local Government is absent today when this most important matter is coming up&mdash;and saying that the emphasis is on the building of new houses.  What is the use of saying that, when the county councillors of Ireland know that they cannot meet their present commitments, never mind getting new loans or grants for the coming year.</P>
    <P>I want to put this question to the Government: why not tell the people the truth?  Is it the idea to keep up this bluff until the Presidential election is over?  We have said here that, fortunately the economy is sound but that the Government have gone bust.  The people have no confidence in the Government.  The Shannon Scheme was described by the people opposite and by Deputy MacEntee as a white elephant but a few weeks ago it could float a loan for £7 million which was oversubscribed in ten minutes.  The people of Ireland have lost confidence in the Government and, according to Deputy Moore, there is a pessimistic outlook throughout the land.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely it is time you told the people the truth?  Remember that in 1939 Churchill promised the people of Britain blood, tears, toil and sweat and the people had confidence in him because he told them the truth. However, people such as Deputy Dowling and his Government have kept the truth from the people of Ireland for the past couple of years and they are still keeping the truth from the people.  You are trying to carry on one great bluff hoping something will turn up and provide money for the <Col N="317" /> Government to meet their obligations. Even at this late hour, if the Government took the people into their confidence and came into this House and made statements here, it would be much better than statements made by them at meetings of chambers of commerce or at Fianna Fáil meetings throughout the country.</P>
      <P>We had an answer today by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Flanagan, when Deputy James Tully asked him a simple question.  Deputy Flanagan snubbed him and would not give him a proper answer.  We have had experience of that type of arrogance as the stock in trade of the Fianna Fáil Party for a long time but it will not get anybody anywhere.  Even at this late hour, Fianna Fáil should take the people into their confidence and tell them the truth.  The country might still be saved.  But, as I have said, when you see a circular going out to local authorities of the kind I mentioned, it is obvious that the position is very serious.</P>
      <P>In case Deputy Dowling does not know it, the circular states that it will be necessary to finance approximately ten per cent of the global capital allocations for county council areas for housing and sanitary and miscellaneous services from sources other than the Local Loans Fund or from internal resources&mdash;we may put it on the rates now.  Here is an example. They mention receipts from the sale of land.  The corporations and the county councils are now told to go out and advertise their property, to sell some of the land they have and to realise some of their assets.</P>

      <P>The truth.  Any Party seeking election to office should tell the people how they will use the <Col N="319" /> power to be entrusted to them.  Things are bad in Ireland today but we did not think they were as bad as they are until we received this circular which was sent out to the county councils in the past few days.  I want to say here and now that the election deceit of the Government has at last been found out.  The financial crisis which is upon us at the present time and which the Taoiseach and the then Minister for Finance, who is now Senator Dr. Ryan, and other members of the Government, last January so falsely denied before the general election is now revealed, officially acknowledged and is felt by each and every one of us.</P>
      <P>We all know that Britain has her difficulties today but they are due to her huge commitments abroad.  Our difficulties are due to the mismanagement of our own Government and are largely due to internal causes.  They are coming upon us at a time when we are in a position to take effective action.  The Deputy who was heckling me a few moments ago asked about 1956.  Our present difficulties are coming upon us at a time when we are getting record prices for what we have to export&mdash;not as in 1956, when there was a Suez crisis and when the Minister for Transport and Power was making all the political capital he could out of it.  The only constructive thought we got from the people now sitting on the Government benches came from Deputy Moran who was trying to do all the harm he could by references to the devaluation of the £.  We got every sort of obstruction from the Fianna Fáil Party at that time.  If the Deputy does not believe me, let him read the Dáil debates.</P>

To trace the reason for the financial crisis and the present mess and the root of the economic distress and industrial unrest we have in Ireland today, we have to <Col N="320" /> go back to February, 1963, when the Government issued a White Paper <i>Closing the Gap:</i> we all remember it. Its purpose was to underline the dangers of living beyond our means. Our people were told they were spending too much money and that it was clear we could not maintain that level unless we earned more, worked harder, and so on.  We have heard all this from Fianna Fáil before.  That bright young dynamo, Deputy B. Lenihan, the Minister for Justice&mdash;he does not look like a hard-working man&mdash;told us all last week that we must take off our coats, roll up our shirtsleeves and work harder in the future.  I would say that a little action is worth a lot of words and is much better than words.</P>
      <P>According to that White Paper, the Departments, the State-sponsored organisations and all others were urged to make no more demands for higher wages until we increased production and exports.  When a reasonable appeal is made, the people rally behind the Government.  That appeal brought a reasonable response.  Until the autumn of 1963, we had stability. Wage demands were few and strike demands were few.  Then the Government introduced the iniquitous turnover tax, a new form of tax in the history of this country, which was imposed on bread, butter, tea, sugar, medicines and other necessaries of life.  I heard Deputy Ó Ceallaigh go back to 1927.  I shall not take up the time of the House in quoting what Fianna Fáil said in the past about the poor who were dependent on subsidies and their insistent assertions that they would never dare to do away with the food subsidies.  On 28th February, 1957, the Taoiseach said:</P>
      <P>The coalition leaders are threatening the country with high food prices and a lot more besides.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He said that if Fianna Fáil became the Government, they did not intend to do any of these things.  He asked: &ldquo;How definite can we make our denials of these stupid allegations?&rdquo;  That quotation can be found in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 29th February, 1957.  The statement was made by the Taoiseach <Col N="321" /> at Waterford on 28th February, 1957. He asked: &ldquo;How definite can we make our denials of these stupid allegations?&rdquo; Not alone did he reduce the subsidies immediately after that but he put a tax on the necessaries of life. Fine Gael pointed out at that time as did Labour and others throughout the country, the bad effect of this ill-conceived policy.  A tax on necessaries of life was bound to increase the cost of living and kindle again the flames of inflation with all their harmful effects and it would do irreparable harm to the economy.</P>
    <P>All our forecasts have proved right. There was a sudden jump in prices; the cost of living began to rise.  The Government called for restraint but the workers' paypackets were not purchasing as much as they did in the past. Fianna Fáil supporters argue that the turnover tax could only have minimal effects on prices.  Were Fianna Fáil so innocent as to believe that a policy of restraint could be maintained in the new conditions, with higher prices and the cost of all foods, medicines and necessaries of life going up in a situation which Fianna Fáil had created themselves?  That was a major tactical error and the starting point of all our troubles.  No less a man than the Minister for Transport and Power told us that inflation was a dirty word and that we had inflation since 1962.  If so, it is a wonder he did not whisper it into the ears of his Cabinet colleagues.  If he did so, why did they not heed him?</P>
    <P>The next move was a clever political manoeuvre.  The deaths of two Deputies suddenly closed the gap.  The Taoiseach changed horses in midstream. He took up his pen and wrote a letter and anybody can see in the <i>Irish Press</i> of that time displayed across the front page the headline: &ldquo;The Gap between Spending and Income has closed&rdquo;.  How it closed we have not been told since.  Neither the Taoiseach nor any member of the Government gave any figures to prove to the people that this gap had closed. The Taoiseach simply wiped out the picture he had been painting throughout the year and drew a bright new one in optimistic Fianna Fáil colours.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="322" /> Then we had the famous 12 per cent as a bribe to the electorate of Cork and Kildare and £40 million was injected into the economy.  I do not blame the people for voting for Fianna Fáil at that time when they were told by Fianna Fáil that there would be no increase in prices, that merchants and traders would absorb the turnover tax, that it would not be passed on to the consumer.  Having won the two by-elections, the Taoiseach switched horses again and proceeded to sound dire warnings through the spring and summer of 1964.  Among them he said that the 12 per cent was more than we should have given. He was now back in the position of backing the employers.  We were told we had taken a mortgage out on the future.  Productivity and exports would have to go up to cover it and we were told there must be no more wage demands.  The arguments may have been valid on statistics but they did not follow logically what the Taoiseach and the Government had been saying before the Cork and Kildare by-elections. Once more the Taoiseach was contradicting himself, but what of it.  So far as he was concerned, he had won two by-elections by bribing the people.  Fianna Fáil were back safely in power and the circus went on.</P>
    <P>The people saw through the Government and their broken promises and Fianna Fáil lost Roscommon to Deputy Mrs. Burke, East Galway to Deputy Donnellan and Mid-Cork to Deputy Mrs. Desmond.  The economic crisis was getting worse and Fianna Fáil knew the full facts.  They had all this information at their disposal and they knew the full facts about the recession that was about to come upon us.  They knew it would become worse and they decided that the only thing to do was to have a general election.</P>
    <P>Again they changed horses and showed they were prepared to stop at nothing to cling to power.  Overnight, on this occasion, according to Fianna Fáil, the country became more prosperous and the message was preached at every crossroads, on the radio and television and in innumerable speeches by the Taoiseach and even by the present Minister for Finance. <Col N="323" /> Unfortunately, I have not got the cutting of his speech but if he questions it, I can get it.  At Dundalk or Drogheda, he promised 86,000 new jobs between that time and, I think, 1970. I remember that distinctly.</P>
    <P>There was a full page advertisement in the <i>Sunday Press</i> of 4th April, 1965, where one read in huge type: &ldquo;This is no time for a change&rdquo;.  What a change came about when Fianna Fáil returned to office!  This advertisement continued:</P>
    <P>Does it make sense to exchange the Fianna Fáil Programme&mdash;which is working successfully now&mdash;for a leap into the past with Fine Gael, Labour or a Coalition?</P>
    <P>I do not think the past could be much worse than the present and only God knows what the future holds.  We were told that Lemass was leading on but we do not know where he is leading us at present.  The advertisement continued:</P>
    <P>Our recent prosperity is not yet strong enough to withstand the shock of a change of Government.</P>
    <P>We now find the prosperity they spoke of so loudly was not strong enough to withstand the shock of Government by Fianna Fáil for four or five months. The advertisement continued:</P>
    <P>In this crucial general election you must ensure that Fianna Fáil is enabled to carry on with a working majority so that the economy is given a chance to continue expanding without confusion, delay and indecision.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Ó Ceallaigh spoke here today, he asked why did the people vote for Fianna Fáil so consistently over the past 30 years.  There is the reason: Fianna Fáil were prepared to promise the sun, moon and stars, prepared to use the people's money and inject it into the economy, not caring what harm they did at the time if they were able to win by-elections or general elections and keep themselves in power. What confusion do we find today among the local authorities when, as <Col N="324" /> the Minister for Finance knows, a letter has gone out to them telling them to sell land or any property they have to meet their obligations.  What delays have we seen in this House when county councils that had applied for grants to pay out loans on houses built six, eight or ten months&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I shall obey your ruling, Sir.  The <i>Sunday Press</i> advertisement continues with the words: &ldquo;The best is yet to come&rdquo;.  Is it any wonder people voted Fianna Fáil when they read those advertisements?  It should have read: &ldquo;The worst is yet to come&rdquo;, but if that were said, people would not vote for them.  To those people I say that we are in the present mess because of the bad government and mismanagement of Fianna Fáil and because that Party are prepared to put the Party first and the country last. They have proved that in the past 30 years and they will spend the people's money to get themselves and their followers back into office and enjoy its fruits.  Those who do not believe me may remember that Deputy Smith resigned from the Government because, as he said, the Minister was running with his little satchel, bending and humiliating himself to meet certain people.  He said he would not live with that kind of tyranny.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An ex-Minister for Finance who was Tánaiste in the Fianna Fáil Government in a letter in the <i>Irish Times</i> on 12th March, 1966, answers the question of the Minister for Finance: &ldquo;What went wrong with my Budget?&rdquo;  Deputy MacEntee, who says he was Minister for Finance from 1932 to 1939, said in his letter that outstanding among the chief culprits he placed the astrologers and soothsayers who deluded our people with fantasies of the affluence which awaited them when we got to the end of the rainbow some <Col N="325" /> years hence.  Who are the soothsayers? Is there not proof in that advertisement I have read that the astrologer and the soothsayer was no less a person than Deputy Seán Lemass, the Taoiseach, and he is condemned in the words of Deputy Seán MacEntee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>We are coming to the concluding stages of the debate on the Budget.  Because of a change in Standing Orders, there has been a little widening of the scope of the debate.  It might be no harm to consider for a moment what is before the House in this Budget and the fact that the Budget does not start at the beginning of the year or end at the beginning of the year.</P>
      <P>When a Government comes to frame a Budget and to draft a Financial Statement and to decide on the taxes to be imposed, very often their considerations are affected by what has happened in previous years, not only the years immediately preceding the Budget but years long before that.  A Government who have just taken over office, with no long record of government, could well excuse themselves at Budget time by pleading that they had just taken control and had only now got possession of the facts and figures on which they had to base their Budget. Such a Government might well be excused if they came before the House and said that they had to find an extra £12½ million out of revenue.</P>
      <P>Of course, that is not the position of the Fianna Fáil Government.  They did not take over just in 1965.  They have long years of experience in Government.  Any Opposition Deputy, whether from the Labour Party or any other Party, is entitled on this occasion to remind the public at large of the whole basis on which the Fianna Fáil Party have operated down the years and to remind them of the failure of the Government to take appropriate action at the proper time to avoid imposing unnecessary taxation on the shoulders of the ordinary citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil record is fairly well known.  They have fairly capable publicists. There is a newspaper that serves their purposes fairly well.  However, some parts of their record should be <Col N="326" /> called to the attention of the people again and again.  On any occasion on which they find themselves in a difficulty, they have visited hardship on the ordinary working people in our community. They do that either by the attempted imposition of Trade Union Acts or by wages standstill orders and such panoply.  They have done it repeatedly.  At the same time, they have been notorious down the years for making either direct or implied promises to the people that, providing they support Fianna Fáil, everything in the garden will be lovely, if not next year, the year after that or some other year.  This was particularly the position in recent years.  In addition, they, or some of their spokesmen, have the habit of chiding contributors to a debate on the Budget and seeking from them cures and solutions for problems which Fianna Fáil, by their inept government and their inept Ministers have got the country into and, as one of the Fianna Fáil Deputies, Deputy Dowling, did yesterday, they query Deputies whose views are not in accord with the views of the Government as to why they did not vote for the necessary taxation.</P>
    <P>This must be answered at this stage. It is necessary to remind the Minister for Finance and all his colleagues, and I as a Deputy fully admit, that there were problems in 1956.  Did Fianna Fáil vote at that time for the imposition of the necessary taxation to provide benefits and so on for the people?  No&mdash;they went into the division lobby against it.  Yet, their spokesmen are asking the Opposition today why should they not support a revenue Budget of £12½ million.  There is a very clear and definite answer.  It is because the raising of the money to fill the gap now facing the country will be at the expense of the ordinary citizens and the necessity arises from the failure of Fianna Fáil not only to take adequate steps but even to deal with the people in a reasonable and proper manner.</P>
    <P>I and other Deputies were quite well aware of the antics of Fianna Fáil in 1963 and 1964, the antics of their Ministers and spokesmen, indicating <Col N="327" /> that what they wanted was heavier expenditure under nearly all headings, their almost written request and urgings to local authorities to provide schemes on which money could be spent from capital which I do not know that they felt was available even at that time.</P>
    <P>During the coming year, the people on whom these taxes will fall are the ordinary people of the country.  It might be interesting to examine as to who some of these people are.  Take the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion.</i>  Take the table at page 9 which shows the average actual earnings of workers in transportable goods industries.  The table shows that the average actual earnings of those workers, whether engaged on a normal week's work, engaged in overtime or employed under incentive bonus schemes, and so on, were, in the month of September, 1965, 216/8&mdash; £10 16s. 8d.  Such workers represent a very considerable section of the community on whom these indirect taxes will fall and a great proportion are persons with wives and families whom they have to maintain out of these average earnings.</P>
    <P>The same table indicates the position of agricultural workers on the minimum wage rates and shows that in September, 1965, they had 160/9 per week&mdash;£8 per week.  This is the payment of agricultural workers after so many years of Fianna Fáil rule. This is the Government who repeatedly promised a land flowing with milk and honey.  If anybody could exist on these minimum rates of wages anywhere, I do not think it would be possible in this country.  It appears that there would be a parallel with some of the people living in underdeveloped countries, such as Africa. Very few people on these benches have ever considered that Fianna Fáil have any real regard for the ordinary agricultural workers or the very small farmers.  They rely for their support on the large farmers and rich ranchers.  I do not drink and I do not smoke, but I know that the majority of these people do and the increases under these headings are going to fall <Col N="328" /> on these people and will indirectly affect their families.  It is unfortunate that in our society when a man takes a drink and the price of his pint goes up, he will continue to take the same number of pints and the hardship will be on his family.</P>
    <P>Not many years ago Fianna Fáil were promising 100,000 jobs.  That was reduced to 86,000.  Let us have a look at their performance.  In the same document, on page 98, there is a table for the estimated total labour force and number of persons at work in main branches of economic activity in April, 1961 to 1965.  This interesting table shows the advances we have made under the Taoiseach, Deputy Lemass, the same type of advance as we made under his predecessor who is now President.  We always appear to be advancing down some little alley way and then emerging worse off than we were before.  For instance, in 1961 in non-agricultural economic activity, the number of workers was 673.8 thousand and in 1965 it was 712,000, or an increase of 38.2 thousand.  It appears to be a very satisfactory position until we look at the numbers employed in agriculture, forestry and fishing in 1961.  The figure was something over 378,000 while in 1965 it was 338,000, a reduction of 40,000 in the period.</P>
    <P>This was a marvellous achievement and well up to Fianna Fáil standards. Perhaps the figures were wrong, but as they are published in this booklet, I presume they are official.  The same table gives the figures for the total at work, which was 1,052,000 and the total at work in 1965 was 1,050,000. I am sure the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Agriculture, must be priding themselves that they are doing a good job.  They are getting people out of employment.  Obviously while we are concerned in this House to see an increase in industrial activity, we are also concerned to see that the numbers employed should not go down but should rise fairly steadily. There is little use in anybody going to the hustings and saying: &ldquo;We will have 100,000 new jobs by a certain date&rdquo;, if by that date you reduce employment by 120,000, because there <Col N="329" /> is a net loss of 20,000.  Of course, we have emigration to take care of that problem.</P>
    <P>In the same booklet we have projections for 1966 and I quote:</P>
    <P>Industrial employed increased by 14,000 in the two years and came close to the annual projection for this sector.  Employment in the other domestic sector increased, though at a rate well below that projected; estimation of employment in this sector in an inter-censal period is difficult and it is possible that employment may have increased by more than is indicated in the table.  The increases in employment in the industrial and other domestic sectors are, however, completely overshadowed by the unexpectedly high rate of decline in employment in the agriculture, forestry and fishing sector.</P>
    <P>I presume the Minister for Agriculture is responsible for this position.  I have heard him being called &ldquo;The golden boy&rdquo; but he must have been a &ldquo;platinum boy&rdquo; to arrive at this result.</P>
    <P>The fall in employment in this sector in 1965 alone was equal to the growth in industrial employment in 1964 and 1965.  The fall in the two years 1964 and 1965 was two and one half times the annual average projected in the programme, and exceeded by 25 per cent the annual average figure in the period of the First Programme.</P>
    <P>That is not very pleasant reading for our community.  It continues:</P>
    <P>The projections for 1966 suggest that there will be some fall&mdash;perhaps 3/4,000&mdash;in employment in that year;</P>
    <P>That is not much.  It is no harm from Fianna Fáil's point of view to say that there may be 3,000 or 4,000 fewer in employment in 1966.  I wonder is this part of the reason why they are not going to hold the local elections? Perhaps somebody might have the bad manners to suggest that members of the Fianna Fáil Party who have such an inefficient Government are hardly worthy to be returned to the local <Col N="330" /> authorities because they might make the same mess as the Government have done at national level.</P>
    <P>The paragraph continues:</P>
    <P>increases in industry and services will be more than offset by a reduction in agriculture, forestry and fishing. If this projection is realised, the average annual increase in employment required in the period 1967-70 to achieve the programme's target would be nearly 23,000.</P>
    <P>It appears that the only possible way in which you can make progress along those lines is to change the whole Front Bench of Fianna Fáil.  On their record for the past five years, they have been striving to bring about a situation of fuller employment.  I am sure they have read the leaflet issued in 1957 by the Irish Congress of Trades Unions giving a plan for full employment, but they do not appear to have grasped how to put that plan into operation.  It goes on:</P>
    <P>Past experience suggests that it will be extremely difficult to increase employment at this pace.</P>
    <P>This is the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion.</i>  It indicates clearly what the position has been under Fianna Fáil Government for the past five years and what the position is likely to be this year.</P>
    <P>I wish to pass now to the Report on the Economic Situation issued by the National Industrial Economic Council. During recent months, the Taoiseach and members of the Government have been talking about the serious situation in regard to industrial unrest.  In paragraph 43 of that Report, page 36, we read:</P>
    <P>An example of the dissatisfaction with existing differences is the attitude of manual workers towards the relationship between their earnings and the earnings of various clerical or other office workers.  There also appears to be dissatisfaction among wage earners generally with the differences in conditions attaching to their employment as compared with salaried employment: in very many cases there are, for example, differences <Col N="331" /> in security, pension rights, holidays, sick pay and hours of work.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 44 states:</P>
    <P>There is a feeling that there is no justification in equity for the extent of the differences that currently exist between different kinds of income, that is, between wages and salaries and profits, dividends, capital gains, professional earnings and incomes from rents ...</P>
    <P>We did not hear much about capital gains in the Budget.  The Minister for Finance kept away from that.  He imposed an increase in taxation on the ordinary workers in industry and agriculture but he kept away from doing anything about capital gains.  Neither did he make any specific effort to draw into the net of the Revenue Commissioners the considerable sums of money obtained by one means or another by a fairly large section of the community who do not complete the normal income tax returns, who are self-employed or in a certain elevated state in agriculture or so on.  These are overlooked but the ordinary taxpayer is required to meet the heavy burden of the increases.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 44 continues:</P>
    <P>The extent of these differences, and the feeling of inequity to which they give rise, are highlighted and, perhaps, even exaggerated by the impressions created by particular instances of conspicuous affluence in business entertainment or ostentatious living by the few ...</P>
    <P>I like those words &ldquo;conspicuous affluence in business entertainment&rdquo;.  The Minister and his colleagues should be able to talk at length on this because many of them make their principal political announcements at that type of entertainment rather than here in the House.  The paragraph continues:</P>
    <P>To the extent that people have these impressions, whether justified or not, they influence their attitudes towards what is regarded as an acceptable rate of increase in their real and money incomes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="332" /> I have read those paragraphs because they bear on another point I should like to make in regard to the record of this Government.  I understand the Government have accepted that Report in general.  Certainly, as far as their own employees are concerned they have not accepted what is contained in the paragraphs I have read.  Today, after many years of Fianna Fáil Government, there is a large percentage of wholetime unestablished employees in every Department of State who have no sick pay provisions.  The State, headed by a Fianna Fáil Government, by Ministers who lecture us on all forms of economic and social theory, has not taken the time to look at its own employees. Many private undertakings could show a good example to the State in this regard.</P>
    <P>It is not as if the question has never been raised.  The question of these wholetime unestablished employees in the Department of Defence, the Department of Justice and the Board of Works has been raised repeatedly for years, but nothing has been done. Consequently, these people on wages of £10 to £11 per week are the one section in the Government employment who, if they meet with illness, have to fall back on social welfare schemes and have no payments from their employers.  This is all in all with the approach of the Government to social welfare payments.  The Government should give a lead.  The Taoiseach is on record as indicating&mdash;I do not know whether the Minister for Finance did so also&mdash;that if there is any justification for an increase in wages and salaries, it would only arise in relation to the lower-paid workers.  The people I referred to earlier in agriculture and industry all come under that heading.</P>
    <P>What about the people employed by the Department of Justice in the Four Courts and other places as night watchmen? They work for seven days a week at night work for less than £10 a week.  The most reactionary employer in private employment would hardly get away with that type of wage.  These are forgotten people.  I do not criticise civil servants getting salaries commensurate with their responsibility.  But I think in these matters of salaries and <Col N="333" /> wages the Minister for Finance and his colleagues should direct the Secretaries of their Departments to look at the wage rates paid to Government employees and to examine whether they provide even a meagre living for these people.  We must make comparison between those employees who are engaged on night work spread over the nights of the week, including Sunday night, and civil servants&mdash;and again I am not criticising them&mdash;who have a five-day week with normal hours.  There should be some concern for these other people.</P>
    <P>Those are some of the reasons why this Party do not find it possible to support the taxation proposed in this Budget.  They supported the one item of taxation which would meet the provisions for the social welfare cases. At one time the dancehall proprietors were the darlings of Fianna Fáil.  This time there is a tax imposed on dance-halls, and we supported this tax because it would help to relieve distress. The Labour Party did not support the other taxes because they are imposed to endeavour to cover up the faults and failings of the Fianna Fáil Government not only in 1965-66 but in 1964-65, 1963-64 and so on.</P>
    <P>Building is in a parlous position at the moment.  Building activity, as compared with last year, is reduced by 50 per cent.  I do not know whether the Government are concerned about the situation, having regard to the fact that the level of activity in building has a tremendous effect on the level of activity in every other sphere in a country.  I want to confirm what Deputy L'Estrange said earlier this afternoon, that bad as the situation appears now, it will be much worse in the coming year.</P>
    <P>The local authority of which I am a member also got a circular in connection with the Capital Programme for 1966-67, and this is a beautiful lesson in economics.  The amount for which provision is made this year is just over £6 million, £3,500,000 of which is for the purpose of servicing the capital expenditure on the Ballymun project, but if that consortium does not operate to the extent that they will require the £3,500,000, there <Col N="334" /> is no suggestion that it could be used for other essential housing construction or development.  A sum just short of £3 million is to be reserved for housing construction and development.  The interesting fact is that practically all that money is already committed to contractors who are doing building work at the present time, and the amount of money that will be available for new schemes&mdash;and this will possibly be the situation in every local authority area in the country&mdash;will probably not exceed a couple of hundred thousand pounds.  In other words, what will be said to the local authorities is: &ldquo;Do not send up any schemes except for less than ten per cent of what you need.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On the question of supplementary grants and loans, the same position applies.  There are hundreds of applicants for SDA loans in the local authority area of which I am a member, lodged since January, and only a percentage of those applicants have any hope of getting a loan as a result of the issue of this circular. I am sorry the Minister for Local Government is not here because I had the pleasure of seeing letters from his Department in 1964 impressing on Dublin Corporation the desirability of submitting schemes&mdash;hurry on, hurry on&mdash;and yet there are schemes with that Department since September, 1965, for development work which will affect the provision of dwellings for the next year or so.  The details of what can be done will possibly have to be examined, but certainly there is only a minimal amount of money being made available for new schemes in 1966.</P>
    <P>Under every heading this Government have been failures.  They have not provided the necessary number of new jobs.  In regard to educational activity, even there, I am sure there will be a cut-back in the provision of schools during the coming year.  We know it is not in the Capital Budget, but, in the light of the circulars coming out at the present time, the Capital Budget is hardly worth the paper on which it is written.  It reminds one of the previous prognosis of so many new jobs each year.  If money is provided for new <Col N="335" /> schools, what is the position of the children coming out of those schools, if the Government fail to secure opportunities for employment for those young boys and girls?  Will the figures for emigration continue to rise.  The figure in 1962 was 21,000; in 1964, it was 26,700; in 1965, it was 27,300. This is a marvellous record for the Fianna Fáil Party, for a Government with all the experts they are supposed to have.</P>
    <P>There is no use in the Minister for Finance or any other Minister saying in this House that something went wrong in 1965.  That is a very poor excuse having regard to their statements in 1956 when they were on this side of the House.  In Europe as a whole, there has not been any great cut-back in employment or in the credit position in 1965 as there was in 1956.  This country has not been affected by the situation in Europe. It has been affected by inefficient&mdash;I shall not say &ldquo;ill-advised&rdquo;&mdash;government. The Government's advisers prepared programmes.  They are no longer called plans.  Indeed, many years ago, the present Taoiseach used to be very critical of plans and Fianna Fáil are still somewhat critical of plans.  Now they call them programmes.  If there is a plan, they are compelled to accept some responsibility for taking steps to ensure that that plan is carried out, but, if it is a programme, they can say it is simply a projection which may be carried out if someone else does the work.  In this fashion the Government then can, in fact, try to plead ignorance of the real situation.</P>
    <P>There is then the matter of the Government's approach to social welfare recipients at Budget time.  Once more we have had the meagre increase and, in order to make sure they will save something on that meagre increase, it will not come into operation until some months hence.</P>
    <P>One matter that appears to be escaping the attention of the Government altogether is their complete failure to deal with prices, a failure which has resulted in all kinds of difficulty and confusion.  The situation has got out of <Col N="336" /> hand and workers who have had to face an increase of 10.4 per cent in the cost of living since 1963 are now told they should be satisfied with an increase of three per cent.  We have adverted to this before.  The year 1963-64 was the time in which the Government should have examined the situation and taken remedial action.  That was the time to ensure there would be no increase in prices except where such increases were publicly justified.  We do not contend that prices should in no circumstances increase.  We are quite well aware of the fact that if the cost of raw materials coming into the country increases, prices must naturally increase.  At the end of 1963 and in 1964, two sections of the community took advantage of the situation.  Those with goods to sell increased their prices and the Government took advantage of the ninth round wage increase negotiated between trade unions and the Federated Union of Employers and other groups.  The Minister for Finance cannot deny for one moment that his Party did not take full advantage of that situation.</P>

      <P>I shall finish in that time.  These are some of the factors which have influenced the Labour Party to vote against the imposition of this taxation.  I recommend to the Minister that, in relation to the imposition of taxation, he should do two things. He should endeavour to secure that those who are presently escaping the taxation net and enjoying good living at the expense of the ordinary taxpayer and the ordinary wage-earner, whether industrial worker, agricultural worker, or white-collar worker, are brought within the scope of that particular net. Secondly, he should pay some attention to the people who get substantial increases in income from capital gains &mdash;from gambling.  If the ordinary worker is required to bear this burden of increased taxation, the Minister is <Col N="337" /> equally responsible for securing that no one escapes paying his just share of either taxes or rates.  The Fianna Fáil Government conveniently overlook this all the time.  There is no doubt that at the moment there is a close affinity between the Fianna Fáil Government and those who are determined to prevent the workers from securing a justified increase in their wages and salaries.</P>

      <P>When the Minister opened this debate, he posed a question: he asked what had gone wrong. This Budget debate has since then been in the nature of an inquest presided over by the Minister.  Indeed, the Minister actually answered his own question, though he seemed to be in some doubt as to the veracity of his answer. Since he posed the question, he has heard many answers in this House and he can be in no doubt as to the intent of those answers.  The plain truth is the Government have blundered in their conduct of the financial affairs of the country and must now accept the responsibility.</P>
      <P>There is in this Budget a heavy increase in taxation designed to bridge a large deficit.  As the Minister admits, the alternative of borrowing is out of the question since the Capital Budget has got out of hand and any borrowing that might take place would be necessary to bring it back under control again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Health characterised this debate as sterile.  The Budget we have been discussing was prepared by the Minister, approved by the Government, submitted, I assume, to the Fianna Fáil Party for their support, and it came in here sure of a passage on the strength of the votes of the Fianna Fáil Party.  What else could the debate be but sterile?  Decisions have been taken and, no matter what discussion took place, the Minister and the Government were determined that the proposals would be pushed through. What we have been engaged in is really a mockery of the democratic process.  There is no use in pretending that anything said from any side of the House other than the Government <Col N="338" /> side would have any weight with the Minister regarding the Budget.</P>
    <P>There was invariably from the other side of the House a resentment of criticism, of any attempt to see if there could be a putting together of the jigsaw puzzle of what had happened to the economy on this occasion.  It was a very good tactic on the part of speakers on the Government side of the House, and particularly on the part of the Minister for Health, to indulge in the well-known strategy that when you are on the defensive, you should attack.  The best thing for the Minister for Health and others over there to do was to attack the Opposition for their temerity in calling the Government to account for their administration of the financial affairs of the nation.  The Government are now in the role of the improvident spend-thrift who, having squandered his money, is now full of good intentions for the future, if he is given more money to spend.  The Government now promise that they will do better in the future.</P>
    <P>They are just stumbling along and this is most at variance with the situation as the country found it presented by members of the Government 12 months ago.  Then we had Government speakers telling us on every possible occasion how well off the country was.  Rosy pictures were painted for the people and all they had to do to continue to have everything good was to return the Taoiseach and the Government to this House.  People will remember the appearance on television of the Taoiseach when he said that he would put the economy on such a sound basis that no Government would ever afterwards be able to shake it.  It seems to me that on that occasion he miscalculated his own unsettling prowess.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance spoke of the traditional role of the Budget as the regulator of the economy but for some time now this fashion seems to have disappeared and the Budget is no longer the regulator of the economy. It is being used more and more as a political instrument.  The situation into which we have been put now is <Col N="339" /> a result of political decisions being taken, it would seem, for mere Party interests.  We have had a solemn declaration of intent on the part of the Minister for Finance that this Budget is going to do all that he claims for it. He tells the House that it is a Budget of reality, and that there will be no further increases in personnel or expenditure. But no sooner is this Budget through the House than we will have the inevitable supplementary Estimates coming in afterwards.  These are brought in here and the Minister and the country will have to pay for these supplementary Estimates in the proximate future of the next Budget.</P>
    <P>I am indebted to the Minister for Health who tells me that the Irish people at the present time are well briefed with the spate of documentation and statistics issued to them.  The Minister said that they are well aware of the situation, even more so than some members of the House.  I wonder if the public have ever had put before them the hard facts, if they have been told that expenditure in this country has risen from £119½ million in 1957-58 to a figure in this current Budget of £250 million.  These are harsh facts but they are the facts which the public ought to be brought up against so that they will know the source of the problem now facing the country.</P>
    <P>One boggles at the fashion in which these figures are glossed over as if they were trifles.  Every year since 1959 expenditure has been going up and up and up.  If we take the figures in the revised Abstract of Estimates&mdash;I wonder why the series was discontinued because it was of some interest to the people&mdash;we find that expenditure in 1959-60 was £6.1 million up on 1958-59; in 1960-61, it was £8.07 millions up on 1959-60; in 1961-62, it was £11.26 millions up on 1960-61; in 1962-63, it was £20.9 millions up on 1961-62; and in 1963-64, it was £18.99 millions over 1962-63.  Why does it go up in such a spiral?  It would remind one of the increase in the cost of living.</P>
    <P>One could sacrifice a balanced Budget for the sake of a balanced <Col N="340" /> economy.  Even a higher level of expenditure could be envisaged, if there were no chance of inflation.  But in this country at the present time we have a higher level of expenditure, we have inflation and we have unbalanced Budgets.  We have all three.  The balanced Budget has been sacrificed in vain because the unbalanced Budget has not done what should be expected of it.  There is much more need by way of explanation from the Minister as to what went wrong with the economy.</P>
    <P>I should like to know what watch was kept on the financial affairs of the nation, or what scrutiny there was and what changes were observed in the trends of our economy.  I should like to draw the Minister's attention to some figures in this connection.  I do not intend to quote these figures at any great length but in the Appropriation Accounts for 1964-65, receipts are shown at £219,045,000 and issues at £253½ million.  How much of that excess was attributable to capital issues?  This is a very pertinent question for the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>In regard to the repayment of issues under the various Acts, we find on the same page that the ESB paid back £820,000 to the Exchequer.  Right across the page we have an issue under the other ESB Acts of £1.3 million.  We have, under the Transport Acts, a payment of £300,000 and across the page we have an issue of £300,000.  Under Industrial Credit we have a repayment of £1 million and across the page an issue of £1.3 million.  I should like to know from the Minister if it is true that, actually, this capital was not made available to these bodies at all but was kept in the Exchequer in the nature of a drawback or issues that should have been made, and, when there was need for money, that that is what happened to it at that level.</P>
    <P>On the same statement, we have the situation regarding money raised by the creation of debt.  Saving certificates brought in £6.5 million and Prize Bonds £6.26 million.  Across the way, we have repayment of Saving Certificates £2.975 million and repayment of Prize Bonds £2.94 million.  In other words, small savings were declining <Col N="341" /> Certainly, it was known to the Minister and his advisers that they were declining in that year, that savings were down and that net savings were only in the nature of £6.84 million. Surely, then, the trend ought to have been clear that there was this excess of issues over revenue receipts, that there was this curtailment or had to be a curtailment of credit for State enterprises, that small savings were declining.  Indeed, if one took note of what was being made available for Telephone Capital Account, which is traditionally financed by the Post Office Savings Bank, one could equally see that here, again, the trend was that small savings were declining.</P>
    <P>Another set of figures which I think it is pertinent to bring to the attention of the Minister are those published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> which show the income and expenditure from 1st April, 1965, to 11th March, 1966.  The total revenue is £224 million odd and issues £246 million odd.  Perhaps the Minister would tell the House how much of this excess was due to capital needs.  We have the same picture in regard to the other receipts into the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Under the Turf Development Acts, we had £404,000 being repaid while we had issues of £1.39 million.  Even with such a small figure as that relating to Sea Fisheries, we had £54,000 odd being repaid against £30,000 issued.  Again, under the Electricity Supply Acts, we had £880,000 odd coming back to the Exchequer out of issues of £1,070,000.  As if these were not sufficient indications, there are the figures for the creation of debt.  Ways and Means advances total £51.94 million and yet we had a repayment of £74.7 million.  Prize Bonds brought in £4.33 million and £2.36 million was repaid.</P>
    <P>Saving Certificates brought in £4.8 million and £3.125 million was repaid. In relation to other borrowings totalling £11 million, £12.7 million was repaid. Here again, there was certainly food for thought for the Minister in regard to the situation.  It is the same type of pattern.  You had the issues exceeding revenue, with this drawback of capital, and you had this <Col N="342" /> further decline of small savings to which the Minister himself referred and, on this occasion, it was disastrous in so far as small savings were concerned because we came down to £3.65 million net small savings.  Yet, in the face of this, the Estimates were prepared. I do not think we should call them Estimates any longer in this House&mdash;a nearer word would be &ldquo;Guesstimates&rdquo;&mdash;because it seems that there is nothing firm about them, one way or the other.  No sooner are they made than they are changed.</P>
    <P>In an attempt to be somewhat different from what the Minister for Health thinks us to be in regard to this debate, might I suggest to the Minister that the time has arrived, irrespective of who is here, for the establishment of an Estimates Committee of this House?  What is the use of a Public Accounts Committee of this House examining expenditure when it is past? What is the use of commenting on various facets of that expenditure when there is no opportunity for this House to examine the requirements for revenue and expenditure purposes?  I certainly would have more faith than evidently some of the speakers from the Government side of the House have in regard to the calibre and intent of the membership of this House in regard to such an operation.  I believe it would be an exercise well worth while.  The membership is there to do it.  Even though they have been classed by the Minister as second-rate politicians, I believe that their integrity, their ability and their honesty in regard to this matter could be relied on to the hilt by the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not attribute it to the Minister for Finance at all. I certainly think my suggestion would be an operation that would achieve <Col N="343" /> nothing but good.  It would bring the membership of this House into close touch with the realities of the financial affairs of the country and of the Minister and his Department.  If they did no good in their suggestions, they certainly could not do any harm in the suggestions they might have to make, coming, as they do, from the various constituencies, from the very rural ones to the urban ones.  They would bring a fresh approach to these problems and certainly, afterwards, they would be able to justify their decisions in this House.</P>
      <P>One of the things that strikes one in this regard is the vast sum of money which is expended outside the control of this House&mdash;moneys which are passed to State bodies.  In the Estimates for this year, no less a sum than £29.23 million of moneys provided by this House will fall to be spent by bodies outside the control of this House.  The only controlling factor that exists is that these sums will be examined by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  However, once he has finished with his audit, it no longer is the interest of this House, unless Members are prepared to pursue these statements to the Library and elsewhere and to get a thorough appraisal of what is in them.  I seriously suggest to the Minister that this House, as the custodian of the money of the people, is entitled to advice from experts in regard to the examination of these accounts and that so large a sum as this amount should certainly fall to be examined by a Committee of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It need not be the Committee of Public Accounts: it could be a Committee of all sides of the House.  We have had such Committees in the past. I see no reason why anybody should fear an annual investigation of such accounts.  In the light of what has happened, it is certainly time this House had an opportunity of examining closely this type of expenditure. These sums in the main are under the aegis of the Department of Agriculture which, if you take Agriculture and Fisheries at present, are responsible for passing on for expenditure something <Col N="344" /> over £17.3 million; Industry and Commerce, £5 million; Transport and Power, £5 million; the Gaeltacht, small as it is, £240,000; and Posts and Telegraphs, £1,750,000.</P>
    <P>To come back to the term applied to this debate by the Minister for Health, its sterility, he suggested there are some people outside the House far more competent to express an opinion regarding this type of expenditure than Members of the House.  I should hate to think the Minister was to be taken seriously, that he would reflect on the Members on all sides of the House in this way because, despite all the talk the Taoiseach had recently, and Deputy O'Malley in Limerick, in speaking of preserving the democratic process and democratic rights, this is the place where such rights are preserved.  Here is where the rights of the people rest, where the rights of elected representatives rest.</P>

      <P>Here is where Ministers and the Government get authority for the taxation imposed.  I would be slow to think that this House or any House in the future would lightly pass on its responsibilities to anybody outside it.  Surely when the Minister and the Taoiseach speak in terms like this, it reminds one of a great dramatist of this city: &ldquo;I Must be Talking to Myself.&rdquo;</P>

The Government are drawn from the membership of the House, and if any Minister denigrates the membership of the House, he denigrates the Government drawn from it.  If he speaks of second-rate politicians, then we must equally have second-rate Ministers and no matter how well they may be briefed, they can never produce first-class decisions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>Expenditure at central and at local authority level is continuing to rise.  We are aware of the amount <Col N="345" /> of that growth over the years.  I am sure the Minister has available to him the trend in regard to local authorities at present.  Despite the effort made, which was indeed welcome, of coming to the assistance of local authorities in respect of health expenditure, an examination of the rating situation so far as I could gather up to date, of 19 local authorities and the rates they have struck, shows that the average increase over the 19 is 4/9¾ in the £ in the current year.  This is a further impost on people who will have to provide the revenue at any stage.</P>
      <P>I have said, and I shall repeat even to the point of over-emphasis, that speaking of the revenue and the Exchequer do not convey to the public what should be conveyed to them, that the money comes out of their own pockets at all stages.  There is no secret factory the country or the Government have to produce money or credit, and whatever efforts the Government may make, they can only do so in so far as they take money from the public to do it.  It is a fallacy which ought to be nailed and finished with that there is some secret mechanism whereby Governments can make money available for desirable projects.  There is no way beyond taxation and the savings of the people.  That is the only way.</P>
      <P>Regarding this problem, which is part of the Minister's problem, the expenditure of local authorities, it is only fair that the Minister should tell the House when concluding what the position will be as regards financing the operations of local authorities.  In the past few days, they have had from the Minister for Local Government a circular dealing with the allocation of money for housing.  It has been a great shock to them to find that the allocations are not what they expected and that we have and will have a serious situation developing regarding planning of local authority housing in the coming year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A point which was stressed before in the debate, and blame was laid on previous Governments in this respect, is that you cannot slow down a housing programme without doing irreparable damage to the programme in <Col N="346" /> succeeding years.  The prospect will certainly not be a very nice one for those who expected that housing schemes would be carried out in various local authority areas&mdash;this applies to town, village and country areas&mdash; to find that there will be a serious cutback in the amounts made available to them for their requirements.  Quite a lot of this money is already committed to schemes already in hand. What it will mean, certainly in regard to new schemes or projected works, is that there must be a rethinking on many occasions to determine priorities in regard to how work will proceed at local level.  There is no reason why the Department of Local Government which draws its finances from the Central Fund should not have made known as yet to local authorities its intentions in regard to issues for roads or sanitary services.</P>
    <P>The Minister is proposing in this Budget to take 25 per cent in road tax and to use it for the benefit of the Exchequer.  Allocations to the Road Fund have not as yet been notified to local authorities.  How could anybody expect a county engineering service to plan its road services for the future when it does not know what the allocations will be?</P>
    <P>The Minister said that he felt the honest approach was the best approach. I believe the Minister has been honest in that.  But, how honestly have the facts been presented to the House or to the people?  That is the important question which the Minister and his Government have to answer and on which they will be judged.  At the present time, so far as the public are concerned, there is grave doubt as to anything they have been told when they find that things they felt would go correctly are not going that way and that they cannot depend on the kind of promises that were made to them.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that we were in a happy position, a much happier position than other countries were in, in regard to our budgetary prospects.  As has been pointed out already, it would be completely unfair to compare the positions from the point of view of <Col N="347" /> income and expenditure without having regard to the circumstances in this country <i>vis-á-vis</i> those in other countries which have large defence commitments.  For instance, in Britain, of £1 of revenue, in 1959, expenditure on defence was 5s. 8d.  In the 1960 Budget, expenditure on defence was 5s. 5d. of every £.  In this country taxes on income have gone up from 5s. 7d. in the £ in 1963-64 to 5s. 9d. in 1965-66.  Incidentally, we find that non-tax revenue was declining at the same time, from 3s. 2d. of every £1 in 1963-64, to 3s. 1d. in 1965-66.</P>
    <P>In regard to expenditure, although I have heard of all the benefits that have been conferred on the public in this respect, we find that in regard to social services the position has been absolutely static.  In 1963-64, we spent 6s. 10d. of every £1; in 1964-65, 6s. 10.; in 1965-66, 6s. 10d.  It is remarkable that the health charge has remained static at 1s. 3d.</P>
    <P>Questions were asked here as to why more should not be done in regard to health, particularly when a service like education was getting more.  I find that in 1964-65, 2s. 5d. of every £1 went to education; in 1965-66 it dropped to 2s. 4d.  So, instead of there being an increase for education, there was a decrease on this social service.</P>
    <P>The amount of every £1 that we contribute to our defence services, taking the Army and the Garda Síochána together, was, in 1963-64, 1s. 7d.; in 1964-65, 1s. 7d.; in 1965-66, 1s. 6d.</P>
    <P>These figures certainly belie the assertion made that we must pay for better services.  The Minister will have to show much more convincingly that services have been improved.  If he can disprove the figures I have quoted, I certainly will be very glad to acknowledge it, but until such time as that is done, we certainly cannot preen ourselves on the much publicised progress we are supposed to be making.</P>
    <P>Our capital programme ran into serious difficulty.  One must ask the Minister why did it happen?  Why did <Col N="348" /> the Minister, who is the custodian of finances, allow this capital programme so to get out of hand that the figure was in error around £24 million in the past year and how was it that such a deficit as £8 million occurred in regard to a Budget when there was opportunity of having it vetted by the Minister, his advisers and the Government before its presentation here?  How did these things happen?  The House and the country are entitled to this kind of information.</P>
    <P>At present it is exceedingly difficult to find capital.  The Government are experiencing difficulty in finding capital. The private sector is having extreme difficulty in getting capital.  If any is available in this sector, it is only to the very odd private person.  I am sure the Minister knows quite well that the Agricultural Credit Corporation have a long list of applications from the farming community seeking aid in order to increase farm production and that the farming community are being put off and applications are refused.</P>
    <P>The record of the Government as displayed by the Budget provisions can be summed up by saying that in their approach to the problems before them they have been acting in a puerile fashion.  In regard to the management of the economy of the country, they have been futile because the economy seems to have got out of hand.  I certainly agree that unless the coming year brings some improvement, it can be said that the conduct of the Government in charge of the financial affairs of the country has been, not alone in the past year, but in the previous year, sterile.  It has produced no result which would give hope that at present the economy can, without great sacrifice or effort, be brought back to such a state that everybody is going to feel more confident about it in the future.</P>

      <P>This has been an unusually long debate and probably has followed what might be expected to be the usual pattern of a Budget debate.  It was only to be expected that Opposition Deputies should seek to score whatever points they could pick off in a debate like this, especially in a Budget in which there was new taxation.  However, some of the most important points that were made from the Opposition benches were inaccurate and based on wrong assumptions.  I hope, in the time at my disposal, to be able to demonstrate this to some extent.  As many Deputies pointed out, the Budget is the principal instrument, though not the only instrument, by which the Government can fashion their economic policy.  One of the first functions of any Budget is so to organise the nation's finances as to ensure as far as possible that revenue and expenditure will balance. Another of its important functions is to create the climate in which economic progress can best be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the first of these points, the objective of the Budget to make income and expenditure balance, I want to reassert what I stated in the course of my Budget Statement, that there is no question whatever of my budgeting for a surplus.  I said clearly in my Budget Statement that I was budgeting for a balance and no more. The allegation that I am budgeting for a surplus does not stand up to examination in the light of the estimates of receipts and expenditure provided before the Budget.  The plain facts of the matter are that current expenditure for 1966-67 is estimated at £262 million and the revenue, at pre-Budget rates of taxation, is estimated to yield about £250 million.  The resultant gap of about £12 million had to be met by increased taxes, since in view of the general economic situation, and in particular, the difficulty of financing the public capital programme, it would be indefensible to <Col N="350" /> budget for a deficit which would have to be covered by borrowing.</P>
    <P>It has been contended that I did not take adequate account of the revenue buoyancy and that some reduction could have been achieved in the incidence of taxation by making the traditional allowance for errors of estimation. In the light of the experience of the current financial year, in which an allowance for errors of £4 million was made, and where a deficit of some £8 million appears to be likely, it would be clearly unrealistic, and indeed, I might suggest, dishonest, to pretend that the Budget could be balanced in this manner.  The revenue buoyancy in recent years reflected the rapid growth in the economy, and in particular the rapid rise in incomes. The projections for the economy in 1966 do not envisage a large increase in incomes or, consequently, in consumer spending.  It is clear, therefore, that we cannot expect the same degree of buoyancy as heretofore.  This is reflected in the published estimates of revenue.  It would be inconsistent to expect on the one hand, a moderate rise in income and on the other, a disproportionate increase in revenue.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I should like to scotch any idea that there is in this Budget undisclosed revenue buoyancy sufficient to meet outgoings as we see them now, without the necessity of raising taxation this year.  I should like to say, with all the conviction that I can summon, according to the best of my judgment and on the best advice available to me, that taxation at the level now proposed and Exchequer income from other sources, will provide no more than will be sufficient to cover expenditure as set out in the Book of Estimates.  Therefore it follows that if extra expenditure arises in the coming financial year, it must be met either out of savings on the current Estimates or from extra taxes.</P>
    <P>In regard to the possibility of getting savings on the current Estimates, I want to say that this year the Estimates of each Department were examined and pruned as perhaps never before. Each Department's Estimate was rigorously scrutinised and demands for <Col N="351" /> new services, except where absolutely necessary, were resisted.  Indeed, some Estimates were cut so near the bone that they will require all the vigilance of the Department of Finance and of the responsible Department, and all possible restraint, to contain them as they are.  Therefore, if current expenditure will have to be increased for any proposal for new or expanded services, or for pay increases in the public service, then I may have to come back again to the Dáil with proposals for raising the necessary additional revenue.</P>
    <P>I should like to comment on the suggestion made by Deputy Jones in regard to an Estimates Committee.  He said there should be an Estimates Committee drawn from all Members of the House but I am not too clear as to the functions Deputy Jones would give to such a Committee.  Under the Constitution there is imposed on the Government the responsibility of drawing up Estimates for public expenditure and responsibility for ensuring that the corresponding income will be there to meet them.  I do not think it would be possible in the first instance to derogate from our Constitutional obligations, and secondly, it would not be right for any Government to palm off part of its responsibilities on the Opposition.</P>
    <P>Deputy Jones also mentioned the fact that much of the expenditure that we provide here and vote on is spent by organisations and people who have no responsibilities to this House.  I take it that he was referring to many of the State companies that have been set up by statute and to which, by Acts of the Oireachtas, we have deliberately given that freedom of action which will enable them to compete in the spheres in which they operate.  These activities if they were to be curtailed or under scrutiny or review by the Committee of Public Accounts, or whatever other organisation or group suggested by Deputy Jones, would certainly to a large degree be encumbered, beyond what their competitors would have to face.  However, as Deputy Jones in his capacity as Chairman of the Committee of Public <Col N="352" /> Accounts is aware, following a recommendation by that Committee, I have under examination suggestions made in this regard and will duly report to the House on them.</P>
    <P>I was referring to the obligation of avoiding deficit budgeting in the current year.  Some Fine Gael speakers, notably Deputy T.F. O'Higgins and Deputy J. A. Costello, seemed to suggest that the extra taxation was not justified on economic grounds and was contrary to the advice contained in the Progress Report of the Department of Finance and the commentary on that Report by the NIEC, and that it was against the general economic interest at the present time.  This is certainly not true.  Indeed, there is no justification whatsoever for the view that the present economic situation calls for a deficit on current account in 1966-67 following the estimated deficit of about £8 million this year.  To frame a Budget on these lines for the coming year would have maintained the inflationary tendencies observed in the present financial year.  It certainly would be unjustifiable in a period where capital is short for necessary expenditure for productive purposes deliberately to create a situation in which such a deficit would have to be covered by borrowed capital.  I will not go into great detail on the public capital programme. As Deputies are aware, the capital programme was covered in several documents recently, commencing with the White Paper which was laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas in October, 1965, and culminating in the Capital Budget for 1966 as published.</P>
    <P>In relation to the suggestion made that the announcement conveyed by the Minister for Local Government to the various local authorities indicated a cutting down on the capital available for housing, sanitary services and building and construction generally, that is quite untrue.  As far as I am aware, the amount indicated by the Minister is fully in accord with the publication of the Capital Budget as referred to specifically in Table 7, which indicates that the amount provided for building and construction, for housing, sanitary and other services <Col N="353" /> is in excess of what was provided last year.  That is still the position.</P>
    <P>But the rate of capital public expenditure is of course governed by the resources available to finance it.  In this connection I should like to repeat the statement made in paragraph 20 of the White Paper to which I have just referred to the effect that the possibility of financing the full capital programme for 1966-67 as outlined cannot be assured.  Therefore, if it transpires during the course of the coming year that the available resources are not adequate to finance the capital programme, then that programme will have to be reviewed.</P>
    <P>I might say in this respect that for many years it was not necessary to have much concern about the draws on that capital programme because the amount of economic activity being generated in the country was not sufficient to exhaust the capital resources available to us or within our procurement in very many ways.  But because economic activity has been generated considerably in the past six or seven years, there has been an increasing draw on available capital resources to the extent that the draw on and use of capital resources have outrun those resources.  Therefore, on both capital and current account, it is the intention of the Government to ensure that expenditure and resources will keep in line.  This is the only basis on which real and lasting progress can be made.</P>
    <P>It gets tiresome to hear speaker after speaker from the Opposition benches saying there is nothing in this Budget for this and for that.  I suppose it is part of the old exercise of repeating an untruth so often that the people will come to believe it.  the Budget of course must be taken in the context of the Book of Estimates as published and of the public capital programme and must take account of and provide for all the items of expenditure contained in these two documents. What is often highlighted in a Budget is the topping-up operation of increasing the income, in other words, increasing taxation, in order to meet higher expenditure where existing rates of taxation are not sufficient. This is often done to meet <Col N="354" /> improved benefits and the tax increases, in the minds of Deputies and in the public mind, are directly related to increased benefits.  But these increased benefits which are specifically mentioned in any particular Budget are often very marginal.  More than often they are invariably very marginal when compared with the total expenditure of which the Budget has to take account.</P>
    <P>In the current year this total provision includes, for example, for Social Welfare, £44 million for this year as against £37 million in the year just ending; £17 million for the Vote for Health compared with £15 million; £36 million for the Vote for Agriculture as against £32 million.  I am not suggesting these figures tell the entire story about any of these services, certainly not about agriculture.  I am not suggesting that of all the millions I have mentioned every penny goes into the farmer's pocket, but I will refer to agriculture more particularly in a few minutes.  Nevertheless, these figures give an indication of the increased expenditure in general for which the Budget has to provide and, I suggest, give the lie to these inaccurate and insincere suggestions about there being nothing in this Budget for this and for that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, I will deal more particularly with agriculture.  In the first place, it is estimated farmers' incomes generally will increase this year by about £5½ million as compared with last year.  That was an agreed figure in the recent review of agricultural incomes. In most of the important areas where the Government assist agricultural expenditure and incomes, there is an increase in the provision over last year.  For example, the butter and milk support at £12.64 million is up by £2 million; the fertiliser subsidy is increased; the provision for the Land Project is up; so is the farm buildings and water schemes provision; education and research in agriculture have increased; and the agricultural grant for the relief of rates is increased from £12½ million to £13½ million.  Deputy Molloy gave very detailed figures this <Col N="355" /> morning and it is not necessary for me to repeat them.  There was also an increase of 10/- per barrel allowed for the 1966 wheat crop.  I am not suggesting that it is an immediate Budget commitment or obligation, but wheat prices, as every Deputy knows, can ultimately give rise in one way or another to extra obligations on the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>I do not think it necessary to refer again to the benefit that will accrue to agriculture under the Free Trade Area Agreement which will come into force on 1st July.  These benefits include an assured outlet for all the cattle and sheep our farmers can export to the British market, the reduction from three months to two months of the waiting period before our store cattle qualify for the British price guarantee, and the linking, for the first time, of exports of carcase beef and carcase lamb, to the extent of 25,000 tons in the first case and 5,500 tons in the second, to the British guaranteed payments system.</P>

      <P>I am afraid I have not got the figure.  I can say that the Government have intimated that they will carry any subsidy or any assistance of a similar nature in excess of the 25,000 and 5,500 tons, respectively.</P>

      <P>Not necessarily.  However, it is an undertaking that will be met, if and when the time comes.  In view of the suggested action by dairy farmers of picketing Leinster House after the Easter recess, perhaps I may be permitted to say something more particular about milk.  I think it is agreed that the farmers income from milk&mdash;and again I refer to the recent review&mdash;will be about £60 million this year, about £3 million in excess of 1965, and of this the Exchequer will provide, as I said a minute ago, over £12,500,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to look at the effect an increase in the price of creamery milk would have on butter prices.  It is estimated that it takes about 256 gallons of milk to make one hundredweight of butter.  On that basis an increase of 1d per gallon on milk would add about 2?d to the price of 11b. of butter.  Therefore, an increase of 3d would add about 7d to the price of butter.  Having regard to the fact that the subsidy is paid direct to the creameries, it is possible, when one takes account of the amount of butter exported, the increase in the price of butter in the home market might even be higher.  A suggestion has come recently from the dairy farmers that 4d a gallon extra should be paid on the first 7,000 gallons of milk delivered by each farmer to the creamery, and 2d a gallon on the excess over that quantity.  I believe that the great majority of farmers who send milk to the creameries would qualify for the full value of the 4d increase for 7,000 gallons.  It is estimated that this would cost about £5 million, if the Exchequer were to pay for the increase, and if we are to take account of the 2d a gallon over 7,000 gallons, it might add up to £1 million more, making in all about £6 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This proposition would involve substantially increased taxation, or, alternatively, on the basis of the rate of increase to which I have just referred, about 1/- per lb. in the cost of butter.  This would certainly not be in the interest of the community at large and, indeed, of many farmers, some of whom do not supply milk to the creameries and many who do are small farmers with big families and <Col N="357" /> would lose out in the long run.  I need not refer to the increase which would occur in the price of delivered loose or bottled milk.</P>
    <P>I should like the people who are contemplating this action to reflect on these figures, to reflect on where, if the entire sum is to be met out of taxation, that taxation can be raised. I should like them to reflect on this fact, that the Irish people are well known to resist pressures or compulsions of any kind.  The Government are composed of Irish people who have, by and large, the same characteristics as the ordinary Irish people. Therefore, they might reflect on these things before this action is taken.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish referred to agricultural credit and criticised the Agricultural Credit Corporation for their lending policy in that they required certain securities and certain money-in-hand from people who sought credit from them.  It is only fair to say that the Agricultural Credit Corporation will lend up to two-thirds of the market value of the applicant's farm.  Within this limit, it is very rare for any applicant to have to put down any part of his own money in order to qualify for the loan.  There are, in addition, special arrangements under which farmers can get loans up to £500 without any security whatsoever.  I might mention, too, having regard to the general criticism about borrowing from the Agricultural Credit Corporation, that there is this year, as I explained in more detail last week, £3.6 million available for credit for productive purposes, which is £500,000 more than was availfor similar purposes last year.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish devoted much of his speech to industrial progress and an incomes policy.  He commented on the fact that I did not deal with employment, unemployment or emigration in the Budget speech.  I should like to refer him to the concluding part of the Budget speech where I said that in view of the recent documentation and the debate on the economic situation which we had here in November last and in January and February, I did not think it necessary to go into it again.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish, however, referred in <Col N="358" /> this context, in particular, to the rate of new industrial development and inquired what the progress has been. I have not got the complete, up-todate figures, but I should like to refer to the figures supplied by the Industrial Development Authority reports in the past three or four years which will indicate that the rate of new industrial inquiries, new industrial starts, is well up to standard.  In 1963, there were 148 inquiries, a slight falling off from the previous year.  Forty-one of these proposals were approved and £3.61 million grants approved, providing for an estimated 6,200 new jobs.</P>
    <P>There was a falling off in 1964 and there was a recovery again in 1965 when out of 124 proposals received, 37 were approved with grants up to £3.99 million, providing for an estimated 4,200 new jobs.  I can say that for the first nine months of this year, for which figures are not yet published, the rate of inquiries continues to show this solid improvement.  The rate of approval has even exceeded the total rate for 1964.  The rate of grants has considerably exceeded the grants for 1964, and the potential employment also.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I went to some trouble to get the figures for him.</P>
      <P>As well as that, I should point out that there was in connection with the negotiations in the British Free Trade Area a review of the projections in the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion.</i>  That review was taken in conjunction with management and trade unions and, at the end of last year, it was anticipated that the projections in the programme for industrial output and industrial employment in the transportable goods area would have to be revised upwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the matter of an incomes policy, <Col N="359" /> I was surprised to hear Deputy Corish say that the Government in trying to implement such a policy would implement it only in relation to salaries and wages.  The NIEC Report specifically pointed out that all categories of incomes would have to be taken into account.  The recommendation, as the Deputy is aware, has been accepted by the Government and that was made perfectly clear in the debate on the Report last January and February.  I do not think it necessary to discuss it in any great detail again.  Suffice to say that the Government reject any suggestion that in formulating and implementing an incomes policy, they will have regard only to wages and salaries. The suggestions contained in the NIEC Report on the implementation of an incomes policy bringing incomes other than salaries and wages within its scope are now being actively examined by the Government.</P>
    <P>Suggestions have been made in the course of the debate, and from time to time outside this House, that we ought to try to evolve a different tax structure.  I should like to examine this suggestion for a moment.  In considering changes in forms of taxation, two factors must be borne in mind.  First, we must avoid, as far as we can, making the tax burden harmful to the economy in general or unduly severe on any particular section of the community. Secondly, regard must be had to the gains or losses likely to arise for the revenue from any changes we might make.</P>
    <P>Taxation may be generally divided into two categories, direct and indirect. Direct taxation, such as income tax and surtax, is progressive in character and care must be taken that by making it too severe, we will not stifle initiative because higher earnings arising from harder work and greater enterprise would, of course, be diminished considerably by an undue burden of taxation. Such a development is clearly undesirable in our present economic situation and, as was stated clearly in the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion,</i> it is the intention that reliance will continue to be placed on indirect as well as direct taxation. <Col N="360" /> It has often been suggested that the rate of surtax should be increased, thus confining the effects of increased taxation to those who best bear it, those with the higher incomes.  However, it is as well to remember that the yield from an increase in this tax would be very low since there are only about 5,000 surtax payers in the country and the total yield at present is in the region of £2.7 million.  Further-more, I should like to point out&mdash; Deputies on the other side have pointed this out from time to time&mdash;that the incidence of taxation is more severe here than it is in the United Kingdom when one reaches an income somewhere between £3,000 and £4,000.  There is grave danger, therefore, that increasing surtax further might act as a deterrent to management expertise coming into this country, management expertise which we badly need; indeed, it might act as an inducement also to drive out some of the managers we have.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that the Commission on Income Taxation considered the question of substituting alternative revenue in whole or in part for income tax and came to the conclusion that no complete substitute was available. When we consider then whether there should be another form, or a transfer to indirect taxation, we can, I think, clearly reject that as being unfair since such a tax would take no account of the circumstances of the individual and would, therefore affect the ordinary wage earner more than the better off section of the community. The scope for major changes in the tax code is not as great as might be expected and for the present, at any rate, we must live with the overall code as we find it, trying to strike a fair balance between direct and indirect taxation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish mentioned the possibility of a capital gains tax.  This, again, was examined by the Commission on Income Taxation and is dealt with in considerable detail in that Commission's Report.  Chapter 4 reads:</P>
    <P>On the whole the disadvantages of a capital gains tax at the present time largely outweigh its advantages. It would create a good deal of <Col N="361" /> inequity, no matter what modificacations or safeguarding clauses were provided.  It would affect the marketability of investments and encourage the outflow of capital.  It would be difficult and costly to administer. The revenue from it would at best be doubtful, and for many years would probably be negligible.</P>
    <P>The arguments that can be adduced in favour of this tax certainly highlight some of the imperfections in our system of income taxation, but the grave disadvantages associated with a capital gains tax leave us no option but to recommend that it should not be introduced.</P>
    <P>Some of these disadvantages, of course, are the deterrent effect it might have on inducing industrial and other forms of investment into this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a deterrent, of course, and the same applies to profits, so far as corporation profits tax is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Suggestions were made about the possibility of increasing personal allowances.  As the House is aware, I did make one such increase in the child allowance for children over 11 years of £30.  I did so deliberately because Irish people are known for the sacrifices they make in order to educate their children.  More and more children are now going on to postprimary education because we are making greater facilities available for that education and I thought that increasing the allowance was the fairest thing I could do within the limits at my disposal.  If I might mention some of the other increases in allowances that were proposed, and what they would cost, the House may perhaps take a different view.  A single and widow allowance increase of £10 would cost £1 million in a full year. A married allowance increase of £20 would cost £700,000.  An increase of £10 in the child allowance would cost £400,000 and a similar increase in the dependant allowance would cost <Col N="362" /> £220,000.  To introduce such increases would, therefore, clearly involve raising extra taxation to a considerable extent.</P>
    <P>Attempts were made in the course of the debate and, indeed, outside the House, to disparage the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> and to suggest that the difficulties encountered in the past year invalidated the Programme and its targets.</P>
    <P>Some people have gone so far as to describe the Programme as a dead letter.  Such an attitude shows little appreciation of what a programme of seven years' duration is.  I do not think it is possible to state with greater clarity what the Second Programme is than is set out in the Programme itself.  In Part I, paragraph 5, it says:</P>
    <P>In a democracy the national economic programme cannot be authoritarian.  It proceeds on the assumption that there is widespread public agreement on making as much economic progress as possible and on the means by which such progress is to be achieved.  Objectives and priorities are outlined but the Programme does not in every instance specify how they are to be attained.  Rather is it educative and indicative, combining help and guidance from the State for private enterprise with direct State action where this is needed to ensure full use of productive capacity.  Targets may be set for the main sectors of the economy but it would be unrealistic to break these down into targets for individual enterprises.  The penalty&mdash;and it is no light one&mdash; involved by failure to reach a target is the slowing down both of individual and national progress.  Programming involves making the most reasonable estimate of the increase attainable in total production on certain assumptions about major factors such as population, individual output, exports, capacity to finance capital needs.  An attempt must be made to foresee the relative contributions of agriculture, industry and services to overall expansion and to define the economic and financial policies needed to secure maximum <Col N="363" /> output of competitive goods and services.  It is only if these policies are effective, and internal and external conditions are favourable, that the desired growth rate can be achieved.  A target is an indication of the progress the economy can make if certain assumptions and conditions are fulfilled; it is an aim, not a promise.</P>
    <P>There are certain matters that need to be understood in regard to the Second Programme and its targets. The first is that while selected targets were to be aimed at in 1970, it was never stated that this was only possible where the same rate of growth was maintained each year.  Indeed, it stated exactly the opposite when it said, and I quote:</P>
    <P>The actual expansion achieved may vary from year to year, reflecting variations in the level of economic activity, internal and external.  Fluctuations in the rate of growth are inevitable and, indeed, natural.</P>
    <P>The impression seems somehow to have gained ground that the 1970 targets have now somehow become irrelevant because growth in 1965 happened to be at a slower rate than the growth in the previous years.  In fact, the growth rate dropped from four per cent in the previous year to 2.5 per cent last year but that experience has been no different from that of many other OECD countries where there was a similar two per cent reduction in the growth rate compared with previous years.</P>
    <P>The Programme states:</P>
    <P>Flexibility is the essence of programming. At no point of time can it be said that estimates are final. There will be a continuous review of targets in the light of developments and of progress achieved.</P>
    <P>That continuous review is going on at the present time and is going on actively.</P>
    <P>I would now like to deal with some criticisms of foreign borrowing.  The Second Programme recognised that external capital would be necessary for the purpose of implementing home <Col N="364" /> investment.  Paragraph 9, chapter 14 said:</P>
    <P>It is considered appropriate to finance these deficits either by reasonable recourse to external reserves or by external borrowing, a general term which includes direct foreign investment in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Paragraphs 16 and 17 pointed out that as a result of capital inflow, external assets would increase and that it would be undesirable for a developing country to prefer to accumulate external assets rather than, at the cost of tolerable balance of payments deficits, to promote a much needed rise in domestic production and employment. It also pointed out that so long as the foreign capital inflow was sufficient of itself to finance a balance of payments deficit of the order envisaged in the Programme, it might not be necessary, except the inflow diminished or for reasons of flexibility, to contemplate any significant recourse to other sources of finance.</P>
    <P>Up to the end of 1964, this continued to be the case but in 1965 it became apparent that as a result of the increase in the balance of payments deficit, reserves were falling and direct borrowing would have to be considered.  That was in July of 1965 and it was proposed to issue a loan on the Eurodollar market and not on the New York market.  Since the imposition of the interest equalisation tax in the United States, no country subject to that tax has issued loans in New York.</P>
    <P>The negotiations commenced in July, 1965.  This was in the international bond market centered in Europe and consists in the main of dollar balances held by non-United States citizens.  A New York finance house was selected to be the principal managers of the loan for the purpose of getting a quotation on the New York Stock Exchange and also for the purpose that if the interest equalisation tax was removed, we would be known and familiar in that market if ever we wished to get a dollar loan.</P>
    <P>The interest rates on the Eurodollar market began to increase but that was <Col N="365" /> not the reason the loan was not issued. Towards the end of 1965, large United States concerns announced their intention of seeking funds for international development by the issue of debentures and they were encouraged to do this by the United States authorities. It was intended that these issues would carry rights of conversion into the equity capital of these United States concerns.  This would reduce interest in the international market for fixed interest securities.  As a result of this pressure on the market, the Irish issue, as well as those of other countries, had to be postponed.  We were in good company in that the European Coal and Steel Community was one of the issues that had to be postponed.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Sterling-Deutschemark loan, the terms of the issue are seven per cent at 97¾ giving a yield of 7¼.  These terms are high but they are the going rates.  A recent issue by the Federal German Government itself gave a redemption rate of 7¼ and even this loan was under subscribed. We were successful in getting that loan. It has been suggested that because we had recourse to external borrowing, this country is on the verge of bankruptcy. There is an impressive list of other countries who have had recourse in recent months to the international bond market.  These countries include Australia, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Norway, Japan and New Zealand.  All of these prosperous countries with large development programmes have used external borrowing.</P>
    <P>One of the most recent loans was by New Zealand which was an old customer of the international bond market.  It was a loan for 15,000,000 dollars at 6½ per cent issued at 96½ which gave a yield at redemption of almost 6.9 per cent.  Far from bearing out statements from the Opposition that our credit is not all right, what I have said goes to prove the fact that we were able to take our place with these other prosperous countries and establishes the fact that our national credit is sound.</P>

      <P>They were.  I think we can confidently look to a reduction of our balance of payments position, 1966, because of a number of factors &mdash;higher cattle and beef exports at good prices; the likelihood of improved industrial exports; increased exports of ore; restraint of Government expenditure and the continuing necessity to restrict capital for other than productive purposes.</P>

      <P>But, as soon as income increases make their impact, some, at least, of this year's gain in the balance of payments is bound to evaporate.  This can come about by reason of two important factors&mdash;(1) the extent to which pay increases make our products less competitive particularly <i>vis-á-vis</i> the British market and (2) because it is one of the facts of our economic life that, of every £ earned in this country, 8/- is spent on imported goods.  It is particularly noticeable in times of pay increases, I think, that a reasonably substantial increase in the import of consumer goods occurs.</P>
      <P>Therefore, the realisation of the gains in our general economic position and the gains in the balance of payments position to which I have just referred will depend, first of all, on the policy measures taken by the Government being effective.  But big increases in incomes, prolonged industrial stoppages, reduced tourist income or increased public expenditure can make these ineffective.  I do not intend to give a lecture to anybody this evening on industrial relations.  I know only too well the difficulties management and trade unions have in these matters: I have some experience of it.  However, I say that, if restraint is exercised in expectation of wage increases and profits in the current year, the more competitive we can become and the sooner we can return to job security, to greater progress and to industrial expansion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="367" /> Deputy J. A. Costello said last evening that the Budget came as a shock. I know that Deputy Costello is a busy man who is not always able to attend the House but I am sure he will remember major debates here on the economic situation in July and November of last year and in January and February of this year.  If I am not mistaken, I think he voted in the divisions following some of these debates.  The economic situation was fully discussed during these debates. Certainly, the Government did everything they could, both inside and outside the House, to make the position fully understood.  Deputy Costello must be aware of the steps the Government took&mdash;apart from the debates that have taken place&mdash;to remedy the situation. They included a reorganisation of the capital expenditure programme to keep it within the limits of the Second Programme; the restriction of current Government expenditure&mdash;which he alleged was not being done at all but I can assure him now, as I said at the outset of this speech, that Government expenditure was pruned more rigorously this year than ever before; the encouragement of internal savings, including a tax inducement and the limitation of avoidable imports by credit and hire purchase restrictions.  There were higher market development grants to encourage industrial exports.  Again, that was something he suggested last night.  Deputy Costello, apparently, did not seem to be aware of these things. He concentrated very much on part of my Budget speech last year when I said that the Department of Finance had roles other than that of being the watch-dog of the public purse.  He went on to disparage the watch-dogs. They do keep a watch on what is happening but they have no magic regulator.  Large deficits occurred before, even when Deputy Costello was Taoiseach, despite the vigilance of these same watch-dogs.</P>
    <P>Among his remedies for the present situation Deputy Costello listed the need for confidence and then he proceeded to dispense gloom.  He was unable to see how this Budget would <Col N="368" /> help to strenghten the economic position of this country.  I can assure him that it will do so by curbing inflation and reducing substantially the gap in our balance of payments.  There is, I think a much better prospect for 1966-67 provided, of course, we cease to wallow in gloom, as Deputy Costello and many other speakers want to do, and get back to producing steadily.  Deputy Costello was not the only member of the House who preached gloom.  Other Deputies seemed to revel in exaggeration to the point of not caring what damage they might do to the country and its progress. I might take, for example, the statement by Deputy Treacy here last evening that &ldquo;the country is in a worse position now than ever before since the inception of the State&rdquo;.  I suggest that such nonsense is the halfway mark to immaturity.</P>

      <P>There are people in Ireland who deliberately indulge in a self-destroying inferiority complex. It was difficult enough to clear away the air of gloom and despondency after 1956-57 but at least the long and sustained progress we have since then should show us what we are capable of as a community.  We should stop being so desperately introspective and insular and realise that upsets occur in the progress of all countries.</P>
      <P>Experts cannot foresee everything and make all assumptions come true. If we knew a bit more about contemporary Europe and the problems faced by other countries such as Belgium, Norway and Denmark, we could see our own in better perspective.  We should cease making &ldquo;crises&rdquo; and &ldquo;disasters&rdquo; out of the inevitable and, I might add, the curable vicissitudes of economic life.  We have to make adjustments but we are well on the way to recovery provided we stop moaning and bickering as we have been doing, particularly from the other benches.</P>

    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Minister for Health.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is unquestionably a very important Estimate which contains provision for some very substantial improvements in our health service.  The Labour Party, naturally, are pleased about these improvements. Our concern now is to know, in so far as the Minister can indicate, when these improvements will take place. It has been indicated in the Minister's White Paper that it will be some years before the improvements are brought about.  In the meantime, the people must continue to suffer under the archaic and outmoded Health Act, a Health Act ridden with an odious means test in respect of qualifications for a medical card, a Health Act which makes for anxiety and distress amongst the lower and middle income groups.</P>
      <P>I am availing of this opportunity to appeal to the Minister, pending implementation of the proposed improvements, to be good enough to indicate to county managers and the various local authorities responsible for the health services that managers should have regard to the spirit and intention of the Minister's White Paper and the pending legislation and should liberalise the rigid means test which they are continuing to apply to the populace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The improvements in respect of the lower income group are welcome.  The lower income group comprises some 30 per cent of our people.  They are now being conceded a choice of doctor. Heretofore, they had to endure the outmoded dispensary system whereby <Col N="373" /> they were obliged to queue up for the dispensary doctor and in very many instances the numbers attending dispensaries were such that no doctor, however dedicated and sincere, could possibly give to each individual patient the attention he or she merited.  Consequently there was a rather haphazard approach to the provision of health services in respect of the lower-income group.  There was also the problem of the patient falling out with his doctor or losing confidence in the doctor.  That unfortunate patient, who held a medical card, had no redress.  If he did exercise a choice of doctor, he had to pay.  To my knowledge, many holders of medical cards, in the lower-income group, have been continually exercising this choice of doctor rather than avail of the dispensary system and they are obliged to pay for it.  The choice of doctor is welcome and it is long overdue.</P>
    <P>The only other improvement in regard to the lower-income group is in respect of the maternity cash grants which are being increased from £4 to £8.  The most important aspect of the pending legislation is that it will clearly define the categories of persons who are designated as being in the lower, middle and higher income groups.  Up to now the situation was ambiguous. The administration was vague and unjust. An incomes test was never applied in the strict sense in respect of who was entitled to be placed on the medical register and entitled to a medical card.  All that the law stipulated was, to quote the Act, that any person who through his own industry or other lawful means was unable to provide a health service for himself or his dependants was entitled to be placed on the medical register and be conceded a medical card.  That kind of vague generalisation could clearly be interpreted in a thousand different ways.  The kind of test which was applied varied from health authority to health authority and each different county manager applied a different test.</P>
    <P>One of the tests applied was that the manager would take the wage rate of some of the lowest paid workers and use it as a yardstick as to who would get a medical card.  He would <Col N="374" /> take the rate for the agricultural worker, a county council worker, or a forestry worker, and reckon that that then would be the test&mdash;say, £8 for a husband and wife, and he would conceivably add 10/- for each child.  He might also take into account the rent being paid for the house.  Clearly a large proportion of our working-class people were excluded from getting medical cards by such tests&mdash;industrial workers, tradesmen and artisans who earned more than £8 or so a week, and which of course would provide only a substandard level of existence for a family.  I am very glad that the Minister now proposes to define clearly who will be entitled to a medical card.</P>
    <P>There was also the humiliating and distressing aspect involved in this means test.  At any time a means test is embarrassing and humiliating as it involves a prying and probing into the private affairs of a family.  The tests in these instances are carried out by home assistance officers.  I do not wish to reflect on the worth of these people, but, in my opinion, home assistance officers are not fit persons to carry out a test of this kind.  If there is to be a means test under the proposed legislation, I would ask the Minister to introduce some other means by which the necessary information can be gathered without having home assistance officers calling to the homes of decent people and not merely securing the information there but also securing it from neighbours and accepting it as factual and truthful.  Some of these men are honourable and are doing their job conscientiously.  Others, it seems to me and to my colleagues are prejudiced in many ways.  They are prejudiced in regard to class and status and unfortunately sometimes there is political prejudice as well.  We have seen injustices in many cases.</P>
    <P>These gentlemen provide assistance for the most destitute and helpless section of our society and their prime function is to dole out assistance to those who are in dire need.  Everyone knows the test applied in regard to the provision of home assistance must, of necessity, be rigorous.  Many of these men are influenced by the low standard of life of the people with <Col N="375" /> whom they deal most.  Unfortunately, they bring this prejudice to the homes of decent working classes.  I have said that they are prejudiced in respect of class and I said this because we have known them to take it upon themselves to say to an applicant, who might have requested an appropriate form for a medical card, that he was not entitled to a card and they would not consent to put that application through the proper channels in order that a proper investigation could be held and in order that the county manager, the final arbiter under the Minister, could make a decision.</P>
    <P>It is also a well known fact that if they see any signs of comfort or decent living standards in a home, if they see such things as a radio or television set, the applicant will be automatically ruled out.  These are no longer luxuries but everyday appliances which are to be found in the homes of all progressive people.  Likewise a car is an essential means of securing a living for most of our people today.  The fact that these things should be in any of these homes would seem to put paid to the possibility of their owners getting a medical card.</P>
    <P>The people of this country have been indignant and will continue to be indignant until this odious means test is done away with.  It is not sufficient to know that these categories of people will be clearly defined.  We want, above all else, a more humane, respectful and understanding approach by the people who will be defining them.  If there is to be a test, let that test be carried out with due regard to the dignity of the human person and the responsibilities of family life.</P>
    <P>One of the most serious defects in the White Paper is that there is not much improvement in it so far as the middle income group are concerned. They are the people who have suffered most under the present Health Act. They are excluded from free medical attention and have to pay all.  Many are borderline cases who could not provide the fees for doctors and specialists, for hospitalisation and for costly drugs and medicines.  Through <Col N="376" /> lack of means many were obliged to defer urgent medical attention, and it is my opinion that many of them have gone to their reward before their time because these facilities were not made available to them without £.s.d.</P>
    <P>In the White Paper certain concessions for the middle income group are proposed.  They comprise the biggest section of our community, 55 per cent.  The only concession they are getting is the possibility of free drugs and medicines, where they can prove there is an illness of a prolonged and costly nature in the household.  That is not good enough, and I sincerely hope the Minister will see fit to extend to a large proportion, if not all, of the middle-income group the same conditions as are accorded to the lower-income group.  It is all right to say in the White Paper that the middle-income group will be assisted in respect of the cost of hearing aids, spectacles and dental treatment, that the question of hospital fees may be looked into and possibly reduced and that they may get free drugs and medicine, if they can prove their case.  But surely it is degrading that these people must beg for these concessions or solicit the support of their local representatives or TDs in order to secure some amelioration of the hardships imposed on them by illness?</P>
    <P>When the previous Minister for Health announced this concession in respect of free drugs and medicine for those unable to provide them, it was disconcerting to realise that many of the health authorities concealed this information from the public.  Whether that was deliberate or not I do not know.  Certainly, the public representatives knew it, but it was only by means of Dáil Questions we succeeded in getting across to the public that this concession was there for them.  Whatever concessions are conceded now, I hope the Minister will not allow this to happen again.</P>
    <P>I believe the Minister is courageous and progressive.  He is certainly working along Labour lines.  We will support him enthusiastically so long as he carries out our wishes in respect of these matters.  I think he is sufficiently <Col N="377" /> courageous to stand up to any vested interests who might seek to hinder or impede him in the implementation of progressive legislation of this kind.  I feel certain he will not allow any vested interests, be they in the managers' association or in the medical profession, to conceal or withhold from the public the concessions there at present and those which we hope will be there in greater abundance when this legislation is enacted.</P>
    <P>It is true also that many people now regarded as in the higher income group are suffering great hardship and privation trying to meet medical costs. Those of us in public life have been appalled at being shown by men and women in high station, with what might be considered very good salaries, colossal bills for hospitalisation, specialists' and doctors' fees and for specialist appliances.  These people are virtually beggared by the cost of remaining reasonably well in this country.  I want to see concessions for them as well. A medical service should be available for all, irrespective of their status or of their salary scales.  In applying tests of this kind, it is not good enough to talk in terms of income alone, because one has to know intimately the domestic affairs of the families concerned. I sincerely hope, when the Minister is laying down these new demarcation lines between the three categories, lower, middle and higher-income groups, that the higher-income group, which now comprise some 15 per cent of our people, will be reduced considerably, down to at least ten per cent so that a greater number can be taken into the middle-income group and given some concessions in respect of the health services.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say to me it would not be justified at the present time.  The Minister will realise that neglect of this kind in regard to health must be met by someone.  If it is not met in part by the State, it must be met entirely by the individual.  The only concession at the present time to this category of persons is that they may get a subvention from the local authority for their maintenance in a local private hospital.  Unfortunately, <Col N="378" /> as the Minister will realise, the subvention to which I have referred, a sum of 22/6 per day for the maintenance of the patient in a private hospital, is for a limited period of time only. County managers usually stipulate a period of some six weeks.  They are humane enough to extend that period for another six weeks, making it 12 weeks, but it is extremely difficult to have this concession granted for a further period.  Clearly six to 12 weeks is not a reasonably sufficient period of time to permit of a full recovery to health.</P>
    <P>There are a few more aspects of the health services to which I wish to advert in the hope that the Minister may see fit to include these suggestions in his amending legislation when it comes before the House.  The school inspection services we have at the present time are not adequate.  These school inspections are not carried out often enough to take proper care of the children in our schools.  The inspections, in many instances, are carried out in such a haphazard and indifferent way that some parents have become prejudiced against the service. It is lamentable to realise that while we provide a health service in respect of children attending national schools, the children who go to a secondary or vocational schools are not provided with such a service.  The service stops at the national school.  Apart altogether from the fact that the children have this service while attending national schools, their parents may also possess medical cards.</P>
    <P>I am asking the Minister to take steps to ensure that the health service will be extended to cover all children, irrespective of class or creed, and that it will take care of them in all categories of schools.  I am sure the Minister will not allow class-distinction to enter into this matter or the prejudice of certain schools or managers.  It is quite a hardship on the parents of the middle-income group and some parents in the so-called higher-income group to provide the high fees to send children to these places of higher education without having to meet the recurring cost of dealing with their <Col N="379" /> health as well.  Many people have adverted to this problem, and many people are looking now to the Minister for Health to ensure that this anomaly in the health service which has lasted too long will be rectified in the present code of legislation.</P>
    <P>It is also true to say that chiropody treatment is not provided in the health service, even for those who are holders of medical cards and allegedly entitled to free medical services of all kinds. If I am incorrect in that statement, the Minister may pull me up here and now.  It is my experience that chiropody treatment, which is of such importance to the aged, is not provided for them. Many of these old people, perhaps living on the old age pension or the widow's pension or some small sickness benefit, even though holders of medical cards, are obliged to pay a chiropodist when they require to have ailments of the foot attended to, and ailments of the foot become progressively more pronounced as one gets older.  It is a serious handicap to a person in old age if such ailments cannot be attended to, and these have often resulted in lameness and inability to get out and about at all.  I want the Minister to have a look at that matter also.</P>
    <P>The problem of the mentally and physically retarded in our society is one which I hope is activating the mind of the Minister and his Department. This is surely the Cinderella of the health services.  It is saddening to realise that on the waiting list of every health authority there are large numbers of mentally and physically retarded children for whom we cannot provide proper institutional treatment. I appreciate that providing specialist staff and bed accommodation in the proper institutions is a problem, but it is one I cannot pass over lightly.</P>
    <P>It is a scandalous state of affairs that we have these children domiciled in their own homes, a source of great worry, anxiety and distress to their parents.  That is particularly true in the case of the mentally retarded who have been kept waiting for seven or eight years on the lists of local authorities <Col N="380" /> and as yet no bed facilities have been provided for them.  The Minister for Health is fully aware of the plight of our health services.  I sincerely hope he is taking all the necessary steps to ensure that institutional treatment will be speedily forthcoming for these categories in our society.</P>
    <P>Despite his difficulty in securing the necessary finance to meet the cost of all his proposals, I would appeal to him to make this top priority so that physically disabled and mentally retarded children can be properly institutionalised.  It is not good enough to leave them to their parents.  I am aware, and so are others, of the serious burden these children can constitute. They can be a danger to other young children in the family.  Despite repeated requests, local authorities have done nothing to provide the proper treatment. Were it not for the good work done by religious, the situation would be infinitely worse and a deep debt of gratitude is due to these religious for the care and devotion they lavish on these unfortunate children.  Theirs is a vocation, but the State also has a responsibility and the State must shoulder that responsibility now and ensure that the problem is dealt with as a matter of grave urgency.</P>
    <P>Another problem is the inadequacy of the present health services where old age is concerned.  It is sad to realise that when one becomes old, no one seems to want one.  That is true of families and it is also true of our health services.  It is becoming more and more difficult to obtain accommodation for the aged in local hospitals and, if the accommodation is forthcoming, the treatment will be of short duration.  The aged are promptly discharged and returned to their families. We know the difficulties of families in trying to care for them.  Many of them are tough nursing problems.  If it were nursing alone, families would try to provide it, but the question of geriatrics also enters into the picture.</P>
    <P>There are the chronically sick, those suffering from incurable diseases, cancer cases; in every case there is a reluctance to provide beds for these in local hospitals.  If beds are provided, <Col N="381" /> one can be assured, as I said, the stay will be of short duration.  The alternative is to transfer them to the county homes.  That is just not good enough. Decent old people should not be discarded in that fashion.  Treating the diseased in that fashion is to be deplored.</P>
    <P>I should like to see a certain number of beds made available in all local hospitals for these people.  I should like to see a geriatric ward provided for the care of the aged and incurable.  It is not good enough to say there is accommodation for these in the county home. I do not wish to cast any aspersions on county homes.  I am familiar with many of them.  They are doing excellent work.  They have been vastly improved. They have been modernised. They provide excellent health services. It is a well-known fact, however, that Irish people have an ingrained prejudice against going into county homes. Call them what you like, after saint or patriot, the people do not like them.  It matters not a damn what they are called.  Their origins were in the poorhouses of 150 years ago when our people suffered under oppressive foreign rule and countless thousands &mdash;millions&mdash;were denied the means of livelihood, rendered destitute and poverty-stricken.  The poorhouses were erected for no other purpose except to maintain life at the lowest level. There are many decent people who would prefer to die at home, or die in any other circumstances, rather than go into these county homes.</P>
    <P>An alternative must be found.  I should like to see a home for the aged in all our important towns where these old people will be in their own environment, close to their families and friends, where they could have frequent visits from these friends and relations, and where the local community could take a continued interest in their welfare. This is a serious blemish on our health service, this disgraceful way in which we treat our old people.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to incurables. Unfortunately many young people do fall victim to malignant diseases.  When this becomes known in the hospitals, <Col N="382" /> these young people are discarded and sent back to their own homes.  Then you have the serious problem of the family trying to deal with what may be a cancerous case, or with a person suffering from some other malignant disease, and the family is not equipped to do this.  This is not a case of nursing; this is a case of proper hospitalisation and proper medical attention.  Such a case may require the use of strong drugs, the giving of injections and dressings and other matters which the family could not be expected to do.  In these circumstances, it is reasonable to suggest that there should be proper hospitalisation for these people.</P>
    <P>Pending the realisation of the ideal of homes for the aged in each local area, I have suggested that there ought to be a number of beds reserved in a geriatric ward where these people would be entitled to go by right.  The present situation is extremely bad.  I know it to be particularly bad in some parts of the country and if that extends throughout the whole country, it is a serious blemish on our society.</P>
    <P>There is not much more I wish to say.  I am sorry the Minister was obliged to leave the House as I have one or two compelling matters to bring to his notice but I think I have said sufficient to call attention to what I consider to be the weakness in our present health services and the inadequacy of the proposed legislation. I do not think that any Party in this House can claim very much credit for improvements in our health services. These services were probably the worst in Europe and any improvements in them that are proposed or have come about have come through no great willingness on the part of the Government Party.  These meagre improvements have come about as a result of a vast volume of public indignation in this country crying out against these rotten health services.</P>
    <P>This Health Act must have lost Fianna Fáil a considerable number of votes in recent elections.  Public indignation has forced the Government to give these concessions, which are not sufficient as far as the Labour Party are concerned.  We want to see a health service for all our people, irrespective <Col N="383" /> of class or creed, not as a charity but as a fundamental right.  Our people are prepared to pay for such a service in proportion to their ability to do so. We want to see a health service on an insurance basis similar to the health service in Britain, under which all our people will be catered for, lower, middle and higher income groups, farmers, workers and business men. We have not got that.  We will keep on agitating until we get it.</P>
    <P>This Estimate has been lauded as a real mark of progress by some political pundits.  It is well to reflect on the struggles carried on inside and outside this House for improvement in our health services over many years and I avail of this opportunity of saluting the brave, courageous and progressive men who agitated in this House for a decent health service for our people. I have in mind particularly Dr. Browne who, unfortunately, is not with us.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Health, Dr. Browne achieved a lot in a short time in office.  To him belongs the great credit for the mother and child welfare scheme.  He would have done very much more if he had got support from this House.  In 1956-57 as a Minister for Health supported by the Labour Party, he would have given our people a health service far in advance of the present lauded legislation.  However, his proposals were doomed to disaster at that time and it is ironical to think that what was outlawed as immoral and illegal at that time is moral and legal now.  It is difficult to understand that his proposals at that time were deemed to be of such a controversial nature that they brought down a Government.  Many of the things he wanted to do then are being done now and there is not a tittle about it. I congratulate all these brave men who pioneered this legislation and made it possible for us to talk in terms of improvements in the health services and improvements which, it seems, will be coming into law without frustration of any kind from any section of our community.</P>
    <P>My concern is, as I said in my earlier <Col N="384" /> remarks, that much political capital has been made out of these improvements. The Minister has had his share of publicity in the press, on the radio and particularly on television.  It has been conveyed to the people that these improvements are being made but, unfortunately, it has not been brought home forcefully enough to the people &mdash;and probably this is deliberate&mdash; that these proposed improvements will not be implemented for some years, certainly not for two to two and a half years to come.  With the present state of our economy and the added revenue required, I sincerely hope that it will be found possible to do these things in that time.  One becomes anxious and concerned when we see that the financial resources of our country are becoming more and more limited. When we see a very limited cut-back on essential services, especially housing, we wonder if the Minister for Health will be in a position to secure the additional financial aid he requires to implement this legislation.  We sincerely hope he will.  We shall certainly support him in that aim.</P>
    <P>I want to advert briefly to my earlier remarks and to appeal to the Minister &mdash;however long or short it may be before this legislation becomes law and the people can avail of it&mdash;to advise those people who are administering the Health Act at the present time to lift the dead hand from it.  They should be told to be more liberal, more humane and more understanding of the needs of our people and to ease and liberalise this odious means test, in respect of who shall get a medical card, which they are still applying.  It is important that the facilities for free drugs and medicines, the subvention for maintenance in private homes, and all these other matters are made known to our people so that they may avail of them and so that they are not withheld or cloaked from our people by any of the vested interests involved.</P>
    <P>The Minister has probably missed a considerable amount of my speech but I hope he will read it.  I wish him every success in implementing these proposals, and implementing them speedily.  I hope he will do the things which we in the Labour Party would <Col N="385" /> like to do and which, please God, we shall be given the opportunity to do in this country as the peoples of other near nationalities have been granted in recent times.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a few brief references on this Estimate and, as I understand it, on the White Paper which we are supposed to be discussing as well.  Let me say at the very beginning that any discussion on health, in circumstances such as these &mdash;on an Estimate which makes no extra provision of any significant kind for the future and a White Paper that does not tell us how future health plans will be financed and neither the Estimate nor the White Paper being accompanied by any kind of logical proposals&mdash;must be of a speculative nature.</P>
      <P>Apart from the fact that the White Paper ignores the method of payment, it is, by and large, the policy of the just society enunciated by the Fine Gael Party prior to the last general election.  We base our health policy on insurance, too&mdash;one-third Government, one-third employer and one-third employee, that is, above a certain level. One has only to look at the success of the Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme, conceived and designed by Deputy T.F. O'Higgins, to understand how fundamental is this policy of insurance in the matter of provision for the rainy day, not alone in respect of health but in respect of several other matters in our daily lives.  In passing, now that it has been a considerable time in existence, I think one must compliment the Voluntary Health Insurance Board and their employees on the manner in which they conduct their business and the helpful nature of their attention to the problems of people insured with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Outside the realm of the confessional, there is, to my mind, no more sacred and secret relationship, based on mutual confidence, than that between the patient and the family doctor &mdash;and the family doctor can acquire that particular name only when there is a choice of doctor.  Our plan included a choice of doctor, which now appears about to be adopted.  I regret the <Col N="386" /> awkwardness of the future participles but future participles appear to figure very largely in these proposals for health.</P>
    <P>I do not propose for one moment to denigrate the efforts or the intentions of the Minister for Health but I must point out that the White Paper was introduced at a time when there was not any money to implement the proposals contained in it.  Furthermore, there is not any money now to do anything about it.  On the Minister's admission, it is not likely that anything of a significant nature will happen in this respect until the end of 1967.  One cannot, therefore, regard this effusion as anything more than an enthusiastic effort to bypass the immediate and pressing problems that beset us.  Health is something in the lives of the people not alone here but in any other country which cannot be and must not be made the plaything of politics. Human life and suffering are much too important to fall into that category and when the legislation comes in, with Deputy Treacy, I hope the categorisation of classes of people will be so clear that it will be taken entirely out of the realm of interference by politicians of all Parties.</P>
    <P>I know of cases in the administration of the Health Act where people who were perfectly well able to pay under existing conditions but who because they had the ear of the county manager, were able to get, in one instance that I know of, a hospital bill of some hundreds of pounds paid in respect of a patient who died and whose estate subsequently realised thousands.  That is how money can be diverted from the really deserving to the undeserving who happen to have the ear of the right people at the right time.  If we are to have categorisation, let it be done well, but it will not be easy to do that, having regard to the different kinds of terrain, different types of valuations and different sets of circumstances that go to make up the incomes of families in different areas.</P>
    <P>There is one classification, of course, which must be made immediately and that is a distinction must be drawn between illnesses of an instant nature <Col N="387" /> that are curable within a certain time and those illnesses that become chronic. There are not enough beds in our county hospitals and there is often difficulty in getting beds in private hospitals when these are urgently needed to care for people as they should be cared for and of necessity, people have to be brought or sent home probably a little earlier than if there was room for them.</P>
    <P>While I would be as concerned as any Member of the House with the old people, I do not share the view expressed that our people are anxious to get rid of the old members of the family and put them in institutions like county homes.  You will find that where there is a family, whether a married son or daughter, the old person is not in the county home.  The old person is either left alone in the world probably as a result of emigration or of the deaths of members of the family or for some reason associated with inability to get on with in-laws.  These are rather isolated instances, as, in my part of the country at least, I can truly say the care of the old is a paramount concern of the younger members of the family and the attention and kindness meted out to them must be seen to be believed.  I believe that is something that comes through paternal transmission at a time when the old people were young and dealing with their children.</P>
    <P>I can give no better example of what I am trying to state than to recite a true story.  Recently I was sympathising with a widow on the death of her husband.  A very old woman in her eighties and her husband almost ninety, they had given up their own house and had been able to travel around and stay with three married daughters whenever they liked and as long as they liked. In the course of conversation, I said: &ldquo;You were very lucky to be able to move around and stay with the different daughters and their families.&rdquo;&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;we expected that because we gave them a lot of loving.&rdquo;  That is where it comes in.  There must be that paternal transmission to the young which will be remembered as they grow <Col N="388" /> up and in turn, given back to the old people at the right time.</P>
    <P>I have no fears, generally speaking, about the care of the old but I have fears about the old who live alone and whose means are not as great as they might be or as we would all desire, but I subscribe to the view of Deputy Treacy that, particularly in the big counties like Mayo or Galway, Cork or Donegal that are rather scattered, and even Deputy Treacy's county of Tipperary, the county home is not the place to bring people from distances of 50, 60 or 70 miles and put them into strange surroundings with strange people.  There are many houses big enough but not too big which could be run by a housekeeper and visiting medical attention would be sufficient, where people could be visited by their own families and within easy reach, if they are distant relatives or if for any other reason, they must be kept in a house of this kind.  By and large, I have no fear that our people will treat the old in any shameful fashion; I have far more faith in them than that.</P>
    <P>I notice in the White Paper that it is intended to publish another White Paper on mentally retarded children. I do not think that can come soon enough and give us all an opportunity of discussing this terribly pressing problem.  Again I subscribe to the view already expressed that were it not for the religious orders who devote themselves entirely to the care of these people, I do not know what would happen because we are in no way equipped to look after them.  In addition, we have the voluntary organisations outside the religious orders who give their time and money with a generosity unsurpassed in very many fields where generosity is to be expected.</P>
    <P>I see that the Minister for Health recently met the nurses, or some of them, and they seemed to have got on very well together.  He seemed to think very highly of them and from what I can gather, they think very highly of him.  The way to deal with that situation is to see that nurses have proper hours and proper remuneration. A nurse's life is extremely difficult, as <Col N="389" /> is a doctor's, particularly a country doctor's or possibly a doctor's in the less well-off areas of the cities and towns.  They are at beck and call day and night.  It is really a dedicated service, with no nine to five business. That is something that should be always appreciated not only by the people but by the legislators when it comes to dealing with these matters.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister is interested in the ambulance service.  This is a service worth examination.  Certainly, I do not understand the system that enables people in small local hospitals to employ hackney cars keeping the ambulances there idle and standing by and saying that that is good economics. I do not know whether it is or not.  I cannot subscribe to the view that it is.</P>
    <P>Every Deputy, I suppose, is entitled to become a little bit parochial in a matter like this.  The Minister has not visited my constituency but he has been skirmishing Castlebar recently at a Press dinner and promised some considerable amenities.  I suppose I may speak for Castlebar hospital.  It needs to be enlarged and something should be done about appointing an assistant or two assistant surgeons.  It amazes me each time I see Dr. Bresnihan, the county surgeon, that he continues to be in good health and to look well, in spite of the enormous burden of work and responsibility that has been falling on his shoulders over very many years.</P>
    <P>We want X-ray and operating facilities of a minor character in Ballina. Deputy MacEntee, when Minister for Health, told me on one occasion that the cost of providing them would not be justified.  I hope that when the present Minister gets money, he will do something about them.  I hope money will be got soon, although things do not look so good.  In any event, if we may, temporarily, heed the exhortations of the Minister for Finance to forget about the gloom, may I look forward to a future in which health will be taken out of politics, full and adequate consideration will be given to every category requiring separate attention in the provisions of the new legislation which it is proposed <Col N="390" /> to bring in; a White Paper on mental handicap will be produced with all speed, so that we may discuss it, and then we can get down to business and be realistic about the whole matter?  Above all, it is necessary to take health out of the realm of politics because it is awful that TDs, Senators, county councillors and urban councillors should be dependent upon votes or pretend that they are depending upon votes by again pretending to people that they are in a position to do something for them when it should be the fundamental right of the people to have these amenities and to have their health problems looked after in a proper manner.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister well in regard to his intentions.  Certainly, as far as this Party are concerned, we shall give him every possible co-operation in order to bring about the situation which we envisage in our health policy as contained in the document, <i>Towards a Just Society.</i></P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>While Deputies wish the Minister well so far as his proposals in the White Paper are concerned, particularly if there is any possibility of these proposals becoming operative in the reasonably near future and while we all agree in this House that the provision of adequate health services should not be a subject of Party political claim or advantage, it is no harm to set the record right in that regard.  It appears from reading the White Paper and from a perusal of an earlier document issued by Fine Gael that both Fine Gael and the Government have, in fact, paid the Labour Party the very great tribute of taking over Labour's policy on health, as published prior to the issue of either of these documents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While again wishing the Minister success while he remains in that office in having improvements brought about in the health services, it is necessary, for the purpose of the record, to refer to the contribution made by Deputy Kyne as the principal spokesman for the Labour Party in the Select Committee on Health Services which was appointed by the previous Dáil.  After prolonged and frustrating experience <Col N="391" /> on the part of Deputy Kyne and his fellow members of the impossibility of getting the then Minister for Health to accept the point of view put forward on behalf of the Labour Party, they were compelled to make their protest by withdrawing from that Select Committee.  I hope the advent of the new Minister for Health and the publication of the White Paper will mean not just a theoretical departure from the approach of the previous Minister for Health but a complete and practical departure.</P>
    <P>The Minister is a very capable man and all Deputies recognise him as being a competent man in many respects.  He has already got an amount of credit for his action taken very recently in advising the various health and rating authorities that as far as the estimates of those authorities for health services are concerned, in certain circumstances the Minister would be responsible for any expenditure in excess of that for the year 1965-66. This decision, of course, had an effect on the demands which the various local authorities would be serving on the ratepayers.</P>
    <P>The Minister has got adequate recognition for this action but, of course, this action of the Minister, while admirable from one point of view, is reflected in the general Estimates and at this point in time&mdash;we do not know what will happen in the coming year&mdash;there has been a very serious increase in the Estimates passed by this House.  There has been an increase in taxation and we did notice at the time the Minister made his announcement that reference was made to the question of some system of equalisation of rates.</P>
    <P>It was not quite clear what was meant but there is a certain amount of nervousness, particularly in areas which I represent as a Deputy and possibly in areas represented by some of my colleagues, as to whether, in fact, this may mean just a shifting of a burden from one section or part of the country to people whom we as Deputies represent.  It was not quite clear what the situation would be.  However, <Col N="392" /> if these matters do not come out clearly in the Minister's reply to this debate, they possibly will come out in the course of the months that lie ahead.</P>
    <P>There is one matter, amongst others, which requires attention, that is, the cost of medicines for the normal member of our community.  Those in possession of a white card may be covered in this regard but there are thousands of families who have suffered very heavy increases in their normal domestic expenditure because of the cost of medicines and drugs.</P>
    <P>Nowadays, anybody who contracts influenza or bronchitis or some such illness and who goes to a doctor and gets a prescription for tablets or for a bottle of medicine will find that it will cost him £2 or £3 just for one week's supply.  Usually the dose for tablets is four a day, or a tablet to be taken every four hours, and the prescription covers about three or four days.  If the illness does not clear up, he has to go back to the chemist with another prescription and it is another 30/- or £2.  Those who are not specifically covered in this regard will either have to pay out this amount from their wages or salary or make a pilgrimage to their nearest Deputy or local representative to have him make a case for them.  I was glad to hear at least one Fine Gael Deputy talking about this undesirable exercise of public representatives having to go to the city manager or the chief executive officer or some representative of the health authority to make a case for the particular person.</P>
    <P>I do not think any Deputy will disagree with me when I say that no one who requires medicine, irrespective of the section of the community from which he comes, should have to go through this process of bearing this financial burden or having somebody make a case for him.  This is all too common in city areas.  Whether we like it or not, there will be, in some of the rural areas, a closer contact between the health authority and the person's family circumstances.  In the city areas there are thousands of families endeavouring to pay for their houses, with all that that entails, and they have either to put up with <Col N="393" /> economic hardships or get their local representative to make a case for them.</P>
    <P>In regard to institutional treatment, there is no doubt that any person who requires such treatment should have the right to it, without having to bear any direct charge in a hospital.  These matters may be covered in the White Paper but by the time the provisions of the White Paper become law, there will be many thousands of families who have suffered hardship in the meantime.  Therefore there should be some immediate effort to do something in regard to the problems I have mentioned, the cost of medicines and hospital treatment.</P>
    <P>While I am on the subject of institutional treatment, I want to refer to another aspect, that is, the increasing tendency, possibly because of a shortage of beds, to put people out of hospital on the grounds that the beds are needed urgently.  There have been cases of people who have undergone serious operations who have been discharged four or five days later.  Of course, if they had been in a semiprivate or private ward, possibly they would not have been so discharged. However, in the normal public wards in the voluntary hospitals, this practice appears to be increasing.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the surgeon in charge may take responsibility but I am afraid that there is pressure on the medical officers to discharge the patients earlier than perhaps they should be.  It has been noted in the city in regard to maternity cases that a woman who has given birth to a baby will be discharged on the fifth day. If that woman is in a position to go to a nursing home and pay the fees there, then in nine out of ten cases she will be kept in for a longer period.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the Minister will ascertain whether, in the case of discharge from voluntary hospitals in city areas of women with new-born babies, there is any inquiry about their home circumstances, whether they are such that these women will be looked after when they return home, or whether because they are home, they will have <Col N="394" /> to take up their full domestic duties again as housewives.  We in this country often express our admiration, respect and love for our mothers but it appears to me that sometimes we do not practise what we preach.  Anyone who has any knowledge in regard to the large percentage of local authority dwellings, particularly in the cities, must be aware that basically because of the cost these dwellings are kept to minimum standards from the point of view of the number and size of rooms. The statistics show that the average family in this country is much larger than the average family across the water.  Yet in Dublin thousands of dwellings consisting of only three or four rooms are occupied by families with three or four children.</P>
    <P>Do the authorities in the maternity hospitals ever consider the problem confronting a mother with a new-born baby who arrives home to a house that is not adequate by ordinary standards and is required to take up full domestic duties immediately?  These are matters in which the Minister should show an interest.  It appears that not much interest has been taken in them for some years past.  I recall the Minister's predecessor saying on one occasion that, in his view, mothers should not bear their babies in maternity hospitals. I have no doubt that his home was reasonably large and had reasonable facilities.  But he was not talking about the people in his income group, who can have their children at home or in private nursing homes as they desire. He was referring to the normal young mother living in fairly difficult circumstances.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of the health services that intrigues me.  The White Paper indicates a number of desirable things.  But before we can have a firstclass health service, apart from the question of money&mdash;which is in short supply at present&mdash;apart from the hospitals, apart even from the doctors, the question of the nursing and ancillary staffs in all our hospitals, both voluntary and local authority, must be considered.  The Minister must be aware of the widespread dissatisfaction among nursing and ancillary <Col N="395" /> personnel with regard to their salaries and conditions.</P>
    <P>Let me instance one or two anomalies existing at present.  In the Civil Service and the local authority service, there are salary scales for various grades of officers.  The clerical officer in the employment of a local authority, whether employed in Dublin, Cork, Limerick or some small town, is paid the salary appropriate to a clerical officer.  The nurses and doctors are also paid salary scales applicable to them.  But when we come to other people employed in these hospitals, we find a form of distinction.  I do not know whether I should call it class distinction or not.  That may be as good a word as any.  In Wexford, a fairly prosperous county by all accounts&mdash;I do not know whether this applies to Waterford, but if it does not, I know Deputy Kyne will pull me up&mdash; in many of the counties in the west, the south and the midlands, the porters in local authority institutions are paid £2 or £3 a week less than their counterparts in Dublin and Cork&mdash;and we do not say that the wage rates in those places are anything to boast about.</P>
    <P>In a number of these hospitals, there are male attendants who look after the geriatric cases.  Their wages in very few cases are in excess of the agricultural labourer rate.  In some cases there are people with a wage of £7 or £8 10s. a week, while their opposite numbers in Dublin are being paid £2 or £3 more. If a clerical officer down the country is paid at the same rate as a clerical officer in Dublin, how can we justify paying these people £3 a week less than their counterparts in Dublin, although they work the same hours in the same onerous conditions?  Part of the answer may lie with that esteemed body, the City and County Managers' Association. However, the Minister is responsible to this House for the health services.  I am sure he is concerned that because of the existence of this kind of thing there is dissatisfaction in the various hospitals.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lindsay referred to the dissatisfaction in regard to the working hours of nurses.  That is quite true. <Col N="396" /> Various organisations which represent them have applications in to remedy the position.  Nevertheless, the situation existing in respect of the nursing personnel in these institutions, the attendant personnel and the most depressed class of all, and without whom none of these institutions can function reasonably well, must be considered.  I refer to the domestics whose hours are very often 90 hours a fortnight, 45 hours a week, spread over a seven-day week.  Surely the Minister would not be averse to conveying in his inimitable style, quietly and definitely, to the county managers concerned that this is a situation that could bear examination. If it is proper&mdash;and it is proper&mdash; for clerical workers, industrial workers, commercial workers and, I think, medical workers, except when they are called out in an emergency, to operate on the basis of a five-day week, these people who are concerned with looking after the ill, looking after the aged and the mentally ill, should get a square deal.  A rate of pay of £8 for an attendant who has such onerous duties in caring for geriatric cases, a rate which is £2 or £2 10s. a week less than the current rate, is surely inequitable.</P>
    <P>I am a Dublin Deputy but I am saying this to the Minister because I am concerned about health services. No scheme of health services, institutional services, no matter how perfectly designed, has any hope of serving the needs of our people adequately and properly unless the people who spend their lives in these institutions at that work are treated as human beings and paid adequate remuneration for their efforts.</P>
    <P>In regard to the aged, a joint committee has been established recently in this city representing the various voluntary bodies concerned with old people.  The problem of the aged is a growing one.  The percentage of people over 60 years of age is increasing fairly steadily.  It will continue to grow due, to a great extent, to the advances in medical science and to some extent, in spite of all the efforts, to some small advance in regard to standards of <Col N="397" /> housing, the standard of living, and so on.</P>
    <P>I doubt, however, whether the establishment of large institutions provides any satisfactory answer.  Except for people who may need to be treated for acute sickness in an institution where the most modern operating theatre and highly qualified doctors are available, we should have another look at this problem of institutions for the aged.  One of the difficulties for the aged is that they are lonely. They are not less lonely if they are in an institution where 40, 50 or even up to 100 people are kept in two or three wards.</P>
    <P>I subscribe to what Deputy Lindsay has said, that, by and large, the members of the community would be happy to look after their parents in their own home.  There are exceptions to that, but as their families grow up, many people would be quite happy and willing to contribute as far as they could.  There are a number of practical difficulties.  As people get old, they sometimes become a little difficult to deal with.  When people reach 65 or 70 years of age, they do not, of necessity, become more equable in temperament or more patient.  When they become increasingly subject to rheumatism and various other ailments, which are very wearing on the nerves of the average person, it may be a source of annoyance to them if four or five children, who naturally want freedom to exercise themselves, are making noise and jumping around.  There is this problem in the small dwelling.</P>
    <P>There is also the very difficult problem of finance.  While it is true that pensions have been adjusted, many men and women with growing families who are willing to look after their parents find it is going to be at an economic sacrifice.  In his examination of this problem, perhaps the Minister would consider the possibility of making an allowance in such cases. This would be good economics.  Every old person who is maintained at home by a son or daughter and who would otherwise be in an institution saves the State a considerable amount of money.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="398" /> The living conditions in the county home are almost at the minimum.  It means minimum meals, a bed, maybe a bed with 20 or 25 other people in the one room.  Sometimes the room is painted but very frequently there is not a very cheerful atmosphere.  It means that when they are visited by their families, the visit takes place in the presence of other patients and other visitors in the ward if they happen to be bed patients.  The cost comes to at least £12 per week.  Some of them may be reasonably happy but many are neither happy nor comfortable. From the point of view of a social and human approach, it would be good business to think in terms of some form of payment.  I am not suggesting that people should be paid to look after their parents.  There is no doubt whatsoever that families are prepared to look after their parents but that does impose an economic burden on them. If, then, it is necessary to have some form of institutional treatment, surely it should be possible to design an institution to cater not for 200 or 300 patients, not even for 50 or 60 patients, but something on a smaller scale altogether.</P>
    <P>I am reasonably familiar with the city of Dublin.  If the children live on one side of the city and the parents live on the other, visiting can be an expensive matter, to say nothing of the the time involved.  In the country, of course, visiting is much more difficult. We should have smaller units in which the requisite medical and nursing care can be given and to which families and neighbours of the old people can have free access.  Sometimes a neighbour with whom one has grown up is more important to one than, perhaps, one's immediate family. It is very edifying to see old friends, themselves in poor circumstances, sacrificing time and money to visit a neighbour in the geriatric section of one of our hospitals.  I recommend these two approaches to the Minister. He may have considered others.</P>
    <P>The Minister did indicate that he is preparing a White Paper on mental illness.  In the past 15 or 20 years, there has been an increasing awareness of the need to treat mental illness as an <Col N="399" /> illness and to treat the mentally ill as just as much in need of care and help as the physically ill.  There is at the moment large-scale investigation into mental handicap.  The problem of the retarded child is a serious one.  It is not getting attention.  The best method of dealing with it is as a matter for expert examination and analysis.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Minister is satisfied with the ambulance services. From time to time there has been some complaint about these services.  The crews and staffs, it is only fair to say, work in many cases under the greatest difficulty.  Again, they get very little recognition.  Their hours of duty and their rates of wages vary from one county to another.  There is no common approach.</P>
    <P>I should like to stress once more the urgent necessity of doing something about the cost of medicines.  We have a shortage of hospitals and more problems will inevitably arise if the health services are not developed to the point at which they will become effective from the point of view of those who are prepared to make the necessary sacrifices to man these services.  It is no good improving the services, if they are manned by cheap, underpaid labour.  No matter what practical improvements are made, there will always be need for the same devoted attention and care now being given under very adverse conditions indeed by those employed in our health services.  From these a contribution in excess of that normally given in other employments will always be required.  These deal with the people who are ill, physically and mentally, with the aged, with the mentally handicapped and the mentally retarded, and all the time they work under continual strain.  If we are going to have a charter for health services, written into that charter should be a special provision, as a prerequisite, governing proper conditions for those employed in these services.  The anomalies, the inequalities and the injustices should be removed.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to consider these points and the points made by <Col N="400" /> other speakers.  In his own confident fashion, he should indicate to the city and county managers that he has clear, strong and definite views, and that he is anxious than any injustices should be remedied without delay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is a good thing to have this discussion here this evening on this White Paper but it seems to me that it is a discussion which should have taken place in this House at least five years ago.  The Fianna Fáil Party, as a Government, and I do not pin the responsibility for this on the present Minister because he was not in that post at the time, had very concrete and comprehensive proposals regarding the health services put before them by the Fine Gael Party as far back as 1961.  Since then, there have been five wasted years so far as the health services are concerned.</P>
      <P>As a result of the proposals placed before the Dáil by this Party in 1961, there was established by the then Fianna Fáil Government a Select Committee on Health Services.  I do not think it is necessary to deal in any detail with the subsequent history of that body but the point I want to make, and it is a valid point to make. is that if the Fianna Fáil Government at that time had considered the matter and adopted the same procedure as the present Minister for Health, we might have been enabled to have this discussion on the state of our health services five years ago.  Instead of a Minister coming into the Dáil with a White Paper in 1966, that discussion could have taken place in 1961.</P>
      <P>Even if it were thought desirable then to frame a White Paper in as vague a manner as many of the proposals in the present White Paper are framed, all that would have been done five years ago and whatever hurdles of a financial or other nature required to be overcome, they could have been dealt with and we might have had, even under a Fianna Fáil Government, some more adequate health scheme in operation now.  Instead of that, we have the Minister coming in with this White Paper in 1966.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the second paragraph of the introduction to this White Paper, the Minister <Col N="401" /> makes it clear to all and sundry that there has been no particular thinking on his part, that even with the benefit of the advice he and his Party have received over the years from this Party, even with the results, such as they were, of the investigation of the Select Committee before them, the Government have not yet been able to make up their minds or come to any decision with regard to the detailed development of our health services.</P>
    <P>The second paragraph in the Minister's introduction to the White Paper reads:</P>
    <P>The Government would wish that the various proposals in the different parts of the White Paper should be the subject of wide public discussion before any final decisions are taken on their detailed development. The Minister for Health will be available to discuss them with appropriate representative bodies.</P>
    <P>I want to express the hope at this stage that it is not going to be the design of the Government when the discussion in this House has been concluded to put this matter again on the shelf and to justify that action by that paragraph in the introduction to the White Paper.  I hope it is not going to be the Minister's purpose to come back to this House even in a few months and tell the Dáil that he has been holding himself in readiness and available to discuss the contents of the White Paper with any representative bodies who wish to discuss it with him.  It does seem to me, and I hope the Minister will disabuse me of this, that there is inherent in the very introductions to this White Paper the machinery whereby the Minister can justify placing the whole health question in abeyance again.</P>
    <P>In the commencement of the third paragraph of the introduction, the Minister states this:</P>
    <P>The changes proposed are complex and fairly costly.</P>
    <P>And later on he refers to a considerable financial problem.  He says:</P>
    <P>Their complexity rules out any question of their introduction in the <Col N="402" /> immediate future, as it will take some time to prepare and consider the legislation which will be needed to give effect to them.</P>
    <P>That is five years after many of the proposals which have now been apparently adopted by the Minister were shoved under the noses of the Fianna Fáil Party.  Five years after we are told that they have not yet considered the legislation necessary to implement these proposals.  We are told that the proposed changes are complex and that their complexity rules out any question of their implementation in the immediate future.</P>
    <P>I do not think that is good enough. Again let me acquit the present Minister of any culpability in this matter because he was not in his present post at that time.  I do not think it good enough in 1966, after long drawn out consideration, taking up practically the entire lifetime of the last Dáil that we should have that kind of statement in the White Paper now introduced by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The White Paper then goes on to review, and review well, the growth of the health services, their development throughout the years and to indicate the services at present available.  It is not until we come to page 30 that the White Paper comes down to practical matters.  We in the Fine Gael Party have, for many years, urged on Fianna Fáil Ministers for Health not only the desirability, not merely the feasibility, but the urgency of tackling the question of our health services.  We pointed out, and every Deputy who has spoken in this discussion has pointed out, the flaws they see and that their constituents have experienced in the operation of the health services as they now exist.</P>
    <P>Five years ago and more, we were impressing on the Government that this was an urgent matter that required their immediate attention.  That urgency has not diminished in the intervening years.  It has been common for Deputies on these benches and on the Labour benches to point out that had this job been tackled even two or three years ago not to mention five years ago, the Minister responsible for <Col N="403" /> endeavouring to set up changes in the health services, and to carry them through, would have found himself in a very much easier position, financially. This job could have been tackled and should have been tackled before the present economic and financial difficulties came upon us.  Many of the proposals in this White Paper are worthwhile.  Many of them are clearly taken from the advice tendered to the Government from these benches. But those proposals could have been in operation if that sense of urgency which we felt, and which we urged on the Government, had found a response in Government circles.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael Party proposals involved the extension of the idea of health insurance to the entire field of personal health.  I think I am entitled to deal briefly with this matter because it has to do with the question of the financing of a health service.  It is significant, but it is also disappointing, that, apart from the reference which I have read out in the second paragraph of the introductory statement and a reference later on, on page 59 of the White Paper, to the magnitude of the question of the finances, neither the Minister nor the Government give any indication in this White Paper as to how it is proposed to finance the proposals they are putting forward.</P>
    <P>In their comprehensive health proposals, the Fine Gael Party were very detailed regarding the financial arrangements which they thought would be necessary.  While we proposed a comprehensive national health service, we proposed one that would be based on the principles of social insurance and, basing a comprehensive scheme on the principles of social insurance, we proposed the provision of a full medical service, without charge, based on a doctor of choice and, so far as drugs and other requirements from chemists are concerned, based also on the chemist of choice. We said quite clearly in our policy statement that that should be financed by the ordinary recognised system of contributions payable as to one-third by the State and, in the case of employed persons, one-third by the employer and one-third by the <Col N="404" /> employee.  We recognise that, in endeavouring to bring in such a service covering not merely 29 or 30 per cent of the population as at present and as envisaged to be continued under the Minister's White Paper but 80 per cent or more of the population, provision had also to be made for the self-employed person, the farmer and other type of self-employed person.  We proposed that there would be contributions from them and that this insurance basis would be compulsory. The calculations were made from the best sources of information we could get as to the probable cost of that scheme and it did not vary very greatly from the increased cost envisaged by the Minister in his White Paper&mdash;and that was a scheme which, as I say, was to be a comprehensive one.  Our scheme was a scheme which would provide a very full medical service for up to 80 per cent of the people.  It did entail, as the Minister's proposals entail, the disappearance of the dispensary system, but, in the Minister's White Paper, there is no indication given as to how his scheme is to be financed.</P>
    <P>On pages 58 and 59 of the White Paper, the Minister deals with the question of cost.  At paragraph 115, on page 58, he says that the estimated total cost for a full year of the specific improvements and extensions referred to in the preceding parts of the White Paper is £4,265,000.  On the next page, he gives the breakdown of that figure and, in the middle of the page, there appears the sentence &ldquo;It will be seen that there is here a financial issue of considerable magnitude&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to deal with this question in his reply as fully as possible: Is he considering or has he in mind, in connection with the financing of even the limited proposals dealt with in this White Paper, doing that on a basis of insurance contributions? The Minister has been silent about the matter; the Government have been silent about the matter.  I know that when we originally made the proposal, and in one or two discussions here in the House, Fianna Fáil speakers endeavoured to knock the idea&mdash;but it was not the first time they swallowed <Col N="405" /> the policies to which they had apparently been opposed.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to deal quite frankly with the question of the system of finance to be adopted in connection with these proposals.  Is the reason for his silence the fact that he does intend adopting another portion of the Fine Gael programme in relation to health and that he is considering the Fine Gael insurance principle as the basis for financing these proposals? It is certainly disappointing, in a White Paper as thoroughly and as fully written as is this one, to find in, roughly, the middle of it, the admission by the Minister that, so far as the classes of persons to be covered are concerned, so far as the percentage of the population to be covered is concerned, there will in fact be no extension whatever.</P>
    <P>At the moment I think&mdash;the Minister will correct me if I am wrong&mdash; approximately 30 per cent of the people are covered by the existing health services.  On page 35 of the White Paper, the Minister says:</P>
    <P>As a wide extension of State operated or State organised general medical services has not been demonstrated to be necessary, the Government would regard it as undesirable and would not, therefore, propose that the limits to be fixed by the regulations mentioned in the preceding paragraph would be such as to include a high proportion of the population.  Before the limits were decided upon, it would be proposed to survey all available statistical material on medical costs and, perhaps, to conduct some further sample statistical surveys of such costs, so that the limits could be related in a broad way to the present incidence of expenditure on general medical care.</P>
    <P>The opening phrase of that paragraph 53 of the White Paper makes it clear, I think, that the Minister has had under examination in relation to the White Paper the Fine Gael proposals to which I have referred because the paragraph opens with the words:</P>
    <P>The Government are aware of <Col N="406" /> proposals recently made for the extension of the general practitioner service, with a choice of doctor, to the whole population or to the entire middle income group.</P>
    <P>Then it goes on to knock the idea, on the ground that the Government are not satisfied that it is necessary and, not being satisfied, that they would regard it as undesirable to do that. But the salient point in all this is that the services are not going to be extended in any dramatic way so as to include a wider area, a greater field, taking in more people than are catered for at the moment.</P>
    <P>The financial provisions are certainly not clear: they have not been dealt with in the White Paper and it may be that before the Minister's consideration of the subject is concluded, he will see the merits of the proposals in that regard which we have been urging.  The Minister when in Opposition was a person who showed, certainly on one occasion&mdash;I have forgotten the particular quotation&mdash;very great concern for the overburdened ratepayers.  I remember the picture he painted of the increase in rates and the necessity for economy at the top. I think his solution at the time was that the Government should set the example and amalgamate two ministerial posts, Justice and Defence.  The Minister nods, so that my recollection is not too bad but the Minister's recollection will probably follow mine when I remind him what in fact happened when the Fianna Fáil Party got back to office was that, far from amalgamating those two offices, they gave the Minister for Justice a Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
    <P>That is beside the point and the point I want to make for the Minister's consideration as a person who has demonstrated an interest in the question of rates, is to suggest that the financial proposals made by us do have the attraction of holding out a real prospect of a reduction in the rates on the score of health.  In the White Paper, the Government have now come around to the view that it would be a good thing to allow a choice of doctor.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing that would fascinate me more than to see the Minister fascinated. The proposals of the Fine Gael policy in regard to finance were based on the insurance principle of one-third each way.  Our estimate&mdash;and I think the Minister will not disagree with it&mdash;is that the cost of the Fine Gael proposals would be in the neighbourhood of £10 or £11 million a year, but that figure includes the £5 million-odd already being incurred in connection with these services.  The cost of our proposals, as I have explained to the Minister, was to be met on the accepted social welfare basis of a contribution from the State, from the employed person and from the employer.  We proposed that those who would be unable to make a contribution such as small farmers with a valuation, for example, of under £15 would not have to contribute anything and we provided that others, such as old age pensioners and unemployed persons, equally would not be required to pay a contribution.</P>
      <P>As I had said when the Minister intervened, we calculated at that time that the net result of financing our proposals in that way would enable an attractive reduction to be made in the rates.  The Minister will have to take this on faith for the moment: our calculation as to the amount by which the rates would be reduced by financing the scheme on an insurance basis was that the rates would be reduced overall by no less than £1 million a year.  I think the Minister as a person interested in the question of rates reduction, at least would do well to look into that question.</P>

      <P>If there are increased services when it is being done on the insurance principle, it is the people who are insured who will make the contribution.  The State would have to make a contribution but the State contribution by and large, should work out at possibly a bit more than one-third of the whole because one-third was to be paid each way, employer, employee and the State.  I concede this to the Minister: the amount to be paid by the State would obviously be slightly more than one-third because in the case where the small farmer in the category I have mentioned or the unemployed person or the old age pensioner or widow pensioner was not able to pay his or her own contribution, that contribution would have to be borne by the State.</P>

I was quite prepared to accept the ruling of the Chair in the matter, although, indeed, I might say I made vigorous efforts but, unfortunately, unsuccessfully, to find a copy of a newspaper of the week before last because I wanted to deal with certain strictures passed by Deputy Carter on the Minister for Health with regard to the Longford Hospital.  However, possibly before I finish we will get those.  I do not know whether it was the Minister's object to take me off the line I was on. However, I propose going back.</P>

      <P>If I am not permitted under the rules of order to ask the Minister questions, the Minister, surely, is not permitted under the rules of order to have asides directed at the Chair?  Before the Minister perked up and started to interrupt, I was pointing out that one of the proposals which the Minister has now adopted in his White Paper, a proposal that, again, has been urged from these benches time and time again, is the provision of a choice of doctor.  Under the Minister's scheme, there is to be a choice of doctor, as I understand the proposal, where possible, for persons in the lower-income group and, as a consequence of that, medicines, drugs and appliances would be supplied to the people entitled, in the lower-income group, through a chemist rather than through the dispensaries.</P>
      <P>I do not think it is necessary to emphasise the fact that that proposal, as I say, is one which has been urged on the Government from these benches for a considerable time but it is clear that the class distinctions which exist as present, the division of the people into categories, lower-income group, middle-income group, and so on, is to be continued under the proposals outlined in the White Paper.  The people are still to be divided into different groups, into different classes, depending on their means and, instead of arranging and organising the health services so that the bulk of the people will be covered by a comprehensive programme, we are still to continue under this White Paper with the kind of public charity approach.  However, to the extent that the Minister has accepted the idea of free choice of doctor, obviously, we are not going to criticise his conversion in that regard.</P>

      <P>In fact, I think it might have a salutary effect on the Minister were I to quote <i>in extenso</i> some of the Fine Gael proposals which were put before him and his Government so often and until now, with such little apparent effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In paragraph 42, page 31, of the White Paper, as I pointed out, the Minister gives his first concrete proposal and that is the one which, in <Col N="412" /> the words of the White Paper, involves substituting for the dispensary service the service with, he says, the greatest practicable choice of doctor and the least practicable distinction between private patients and those availing themselves of the service.  Again, even in that proposal, which is at least a reasonably concrete one, we have the air of vagueness incorporated.</P>
    <P>I am glad that in the White Paper the Minister deals with the extension of both the district nursing service and home help services.  It is made clear in the White Paper that the proposals regarding the extension are to be limited, in the case of home nursing, to the aged and the chronically sick. I assume that the reason for that is a financial one.  It seems to me that one matter which requires attention is the greatest possible degree of domiciliary welfare service.  The Minister does deal with a domiciliary welfare service and I hope he will agree with me when I say that I do not think there are any politics involved in this.</P>
    <P>The views expressed by various speakers have demonstrated that there is a degree of unanimity on the matter. Again I should like to remind the Minister that this also was one of the matters with which the Fine Gael policy document dealt at considerable length when we emphasised that it was necessary to have such a service available for families so that sick members of the family would be adequately looked after in their own homes rather than in institutions.  The Minister makes it clear that this is to be tackled to a large extent by the district nursing service.  He has made it clear that no final decisions have been taken, that he wants this matter to be discussed and that he will hold himself in readiness to discuss it with representative bodies&mdash;for how long is not clear but I hope it will not be too long.  I would therefore commend the thought to him for study that we have urged that a domiciliary welfare service be operated from a community welfare centre which would replace the dispensary as we know it and that that centre should be manned by trained social workers working in cooperation <Col N="413" /> with the local clergy, the local doctor and local nurse and also with such officials as the home assistance officer, together with any voluntary charitable organisations in the district, of which, as other Deputies pointed out, there are many.</P>
    <P>It is true to say that a home help service of that kind is necessary, particularly for old people so that not only can they stay at home but feel that they are encouraged to stay at home rather than go into institutions. In the White Paper, one of the matters dealt with is the tendency for increasing numbers of people to seek treatment as in-patients in hospitals rather than as out-patients.  I am not able to put my finger on the precise page but my recollection of the White Paper is that the Minister sets out a number of reasons why that state of affairs has come about but is not by any means certain that the reasons advanced are conclusive.  He goes on to point out that the average stay in hospital is being reduced.  I suggest that one of the reasons why there has been an increase in the number of people staying as in-patients in hospitals rather than seeking either out-patients treatment or home treatment, is the framework of our health services at present.</P>
    <P>One of the results of the present system, particularly in relation to the middle-income group, is that it was bound to lead to overcrowding in our hospitals.  The position is that if a member of what is known as the middle-income group stays at home for treatment, and if he attends his family doctor, he must pay for each visit. Depending on the charity of the doctor, but assuming that in the ordinary case he gets a bill, he has to pay his bill for each visit to the doctor or by the doctor.  I think I am also correct in saying that he will have to pay for the drugs and medicines he gets from the chemist.</P>
    <P>I am not clear about the extent to which he has to pay, for example, for surgical appliances: I think the health authorities are entitled to render some assistance in that regard and it may well be that they are entitled to supply them free of charge.  I know <Col N="414" /> of some cases in which they are so entitled but if the person in the middle-income group chooses to stay out of hospital to be treated either at his home, or by visiting the doctor's home, then he has to pay for it.  On the other hand, if he is admitted as a patient to a hospital, then his position is that he is liable only for a maximum charge of 10/- a day while in hospital. Any surgical appliances or equipment of that sort he requires are supplied free and there is no delay in supplying them.</P>
    <P>The contention I would make to the Minister in this regard is that the present health services encourage people to go into hospital.  Partly as a result of that, we have created overcrowding of hospitals and a shortage of hospital beds.  At the same time as there is that overcrowding, I think the Minister will agree, there is no adequate ambulance service to convey patients either on a daily or weekly basis from their homes to hospitals to be treated as out-patients. The provision even on a small scale of a more adequate service of that sort&mdash; it need not necessarily be an ambulance service as we know it but some type of transport service specifically for the conveyance of patients from their homes to hospitals to be treated as out-patients on a weekly or daily basis&mdash; would make some contribution towards making our hospitals less crowded.</P>
    <P>On the question of a child welfare service, which is also dealt with in the White Paper, the position at present is this.  I am nearly afraid to quote from the White Paper.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is all right.  There are only 20 minutes to go.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>At present local authorities are only obliged to provide child welfare clinics in towns with a population of 3,000 or more. That is their obligation.  It does not mean a local authority may not decide to provide a health clinic in a town with a lesser population.  We proposed again in the policy document we produced in connection with the health services that there should be a child welfare clinic in all areas which would deal with children from birth to the <Col N="415" /> age of 16.  Judging from the White Paper, I do not think the Minister requires any urging regarding the necessity of a child welfare system based on clinics.  I think he will appreciate that if we had sufficient clinics throughout the country, a remarkable amount of work could be done by them, notwithstanding the other services that already exist or would exist in proposed extensions.</P>
      <P>Child welfare clinics of the sort I talk of and which we visualised in our policy document would deal, for example, with the immunisation and vaccination of children.  They would be concerned with the prevention, discovery and diagnosis of disease.  They would be concerned in a particular way with the question of advice and education for the children's parents.  In relation, for example, to milk for mothers, it should be concerned with the distribution. In the White Paper the Minister has referred to the existing services but he does not propose any extension of them.  A child welfare clinic of the sort visualised by us to be staffed properly should have attached to it probably the district nurse and a trained social worker, as well as the ordinary medical staff.  I do not think the Minister has dealt with this aspect of the matter in his White Paper.</P>
      <P>I should like to give the Minister the present of an idea well worth considering. It is on the question of child welfare education.  We have on Radio Éireann at present a talk by a doctor once or twice a week of a general medical nature.  I have heard it on a number of occasions because I think it comes before one of the news bulletins.</P>

      <P>I think it is interesting, instructive and well worthwhile. The suggestion I want to make to the Minister is that it could be extended both on radio and television into the child welfare education field. There might be frequent radio and television programmes for the assistance of mothers.  In addition, the Minister's <Col N="416" /> Department at present produce some pamphlets.  I am not quite clear whether I am right in this or not.  I know the Department of Agriculture are fairly prolific in the number of pamphlets they have.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>There are one or two other matters which I should like to deal with and to have the Minister's view on, when he is replying.  I referred earlier to the question of the domiciliary welfare service, to the question of a home help service which would, to my mind, be part of any comprehensive domiciliary welfare service. I want to make some serious suggestions to the Minister in regard to it.  I hope the Minister will agree that if there were not merely a home help service for old people or the chronically ill, because that is envisaged in the White Paper, but a general home help service&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is in the White Paper&mdash;&ldquo;not only for the aged but&rdquo;&mdash; even for the middle-income group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not disputing that.  The point to which I want to direct the Minister's attention is the necessity for the organisation of a home help service to assist in dealing with the problem of children in care. I do not know&mdash;the Minister will supply the details if I have not got them&mdash; if there is a calculation made in the White Paper of the number of children in institutions and in industrial schools, on the one hand, and the number of children in care, on the other hand, that is, the number of children boarded-out and found foster homes. I understand that as between the two categories, there are roughly 5,500 children and that the breakdown of that figure is about 3,400 in industrial schools and a little over 2,000 boardedout.</P>
      <P>With a properly functioning home help service, it would be far easier to have proper foster homes found for children rather than have them sent to institutions or industrial schools.  The tendency to place children who need care in industrial schools rather than in foster homes would be lessened if there were available a skilled home help service, manned and staffed by trained personnel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="419" />
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">

      <P>We shall examine that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to hear that because again, if I may be serious despite the Minister's interruptions&mdash;and I hope that one was not intended facetiously because I should like the Minister to examine it&mdash;it would have a bearing, which would not be unimportant, on the question of the financing of the health services.  I do not think this calculation is made by the Minister in the White Paper: the cost of maintaining children in institutions works out at something like £2 5s 0d a week per head as against something not much over £1 a week, the average paid for boarding them out to foster homes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to mentally handicapped children&mdash; I note that it is dealt with in only a cursory manner in the White Paper&mdash;one of the difficulties at the moment is the absence of any unified <Col N="420" /> authority.  Some of the functions in relation to mentally handicapped children have to be discharged by the Department of Education.  The overall responsibility rests on the Minister for Health and, of course, the local authorities are concerned in the question. I would suggest to the Minister that he should consider, as a first step in dealing with the problem of mentally handicapped children, that there should be a single statutory authority charged with the responsibility of providing all necessary services.  It would seem clear to me that if such a single, unified statutory authority is established, it must be under the general control of the Department of Health.</P>
