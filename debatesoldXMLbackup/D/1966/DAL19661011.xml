      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether membership of the European Economic Community will involve this country in regular discussions for the purpose of a common European policy on foreign affairs, defence, education and research, and other matters of common interest; and what are the precise political commitments to which this country will be bound by becoming a full member of the Common Market.</P>

      <P>Membership of the European Economic Community will naturally involve participation by Ireland in all aspects of the Community's deliberations.  The precise political commitments of membership will depend on the progress which the Community can make towards realisation of its political ideals.  The Community in the present stage of its evolution is committed only to the terms of the Rome Treaty which, as the Deputy may be aware, does not in itself contain any commitments in the political field.</P>

      <P>It is not possible from the available data to state what percentage of gross national product is accounted for by State and semi-State organisations, boards or companies, since, with the exception of a few large public enterprises, separate particulars of wages and salaries and profits of these bodies are not extracted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

      <P>The information sought by the Deputy is not shown separately in the Accounts of CIE furnished to me in accordance with section 34 of the Transport Act, 1950.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="881" /> CIE is required to the provide a public transport service throughout the country and to conduct the whole undertaking so as to ensure that, after taking into account the annual subsidy of £2 million payable to it, its expenditure shall not be greater than its revenue.  It would be invidious, therefore, to prepare and publish separate accounts, receipts and expenditure for different areas of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. P. Byrne Mr. P. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister seriously suggest that he does not know the revenue earned by CIE in the city of Cork?  If that information is not available to him in the accounts submitted to him, is it made available to him in any other form?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>There are accounts presented in the Pacemaker Report giving an analysis of the profitable and unprofitable services for the provincial cities of Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford.  These figures are also distinguished in the annual report.  This is sufficient indication to the House of what the general profit position is to enable them to analyse the CIE accounts to see how far the separate sectors are making or losing money. Separate accounts are given for rural bus services and for Dublin city bus services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. P. Byrne Mr. P. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it not be courteous and reasonable to expect the Minister to furnish information reasonably requested of him by a responsible Deputy and to analyse the figures made available to him rather than to ask the Deputy to do it himself?  Obviously, from the Minister's supplementary reply, the Minister is in possession of the information sought and is being excessively discourteous in withholding it from the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>It is obviously unnecessary for me in my general supervision of CIE to know the separation of expenditure and receipts from all the sectors of CIE.  If I had reason to believe there was some fearful distortion in the running of the Cork city services, I would naturally make inquiries, but I have no such information to lead me to believe that.</P>

      <P>Deputy Barrett is now asking the Minister to make such inquiries.  The information sought is in the possession of a junior clerk in the accounts department of CIE.

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power if he is aware that during the recent bank strike, when it was difficult for ESB consumers to pay accounts, service in certain cases was disconnected; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>It is provided under section 99 of the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1927 that whenever a person fails to pay charges due to the ESB for electricity, the Board may cut off his supply and may, until such charges and the expenses incurred in cutting off such supply are paid, discontinue the supply of electricity to him.  This provision gives to the Board a power that is essential to the carrying on of its business on a commercial basis but it leaves entirely to the Board, as a matter of day-to-day administration, the extent to which and the manner in which this power should be exercised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Board has exercised its powers in this respect with good sense and restraint. Electricity accounts are issued each two months and the account form contains the following notice: &ldquo;This account is now due and should <Col N="883" /> be paid within 30 days but if it includes arrears the total amount due must be paid at once.  Otherwise the supply may be withdrawn without further notice&rdquo;.  In effect this means that the Board does not give notice of its intention to disconnect supply until an account for four months supply is outstanding.  A decision to disconnect is taken in the case of very few consumers and then only when the amount of arrears and the previous record of the consumer are taken into account.</P>
    <P>The bank strike was of three months duration and while it lasted, the Board were prepared to accept cheques, including manuscript cheques, in payment of electricity accounts.  I have been informed by the ESB that during that period the number of consumers who allowed their electricity accounts to fall into arrear was above average. As a result the number of consumers who were in danger of having supply disconnected also rose.  However, there was no increase above average in the number who were, in fact, disconnected. In the circumstances, I consider that the Board continued to act during the bank strike with its customary good sense and restraint.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that, even in areas where the Board have connection within a few yards of houses, they now say they cannot give connection for quite a considerable time because of lack of finance?

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already explained that to the Deputy on previous occasions.  The only way it is possible to do it, with a reasonable degree of economic saving, is to connect people in an area so that the work can be done all at once in a specific area.  The work has been done on a regular basis throughout the country.</P>

Is it not a lot of cod, therefore, for the Minister to talk about giving the people in Connemara a connection inside the next two years?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance the amount paid to <Col N="885" /> date by the Voluntary Health Insurance Board in income tax; and if he is prepared to grant them an exemption from income tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that statutory obligations as to secrecy preclude the Revenue Commissioners from disclosing the income tax affairs of a particular taxpayer. However, the Voluntary Health Insurance Board, in their Ninth Annual Report and Accounts, published recently, include a summary of income and expenditure for the nine years from the 12th February, 1957, to 28th February, 1966, which indicates that income tax paid by the Board for those years amounted to £34,783.</P>
      <P>With regard to the second part of the question, I would refer the Deputy to section 5 of the Finance Act, 1964, which exempts the trading profits of the Board from income tax for the year of assessment 1964-65 and subsequent years.  I might add that the exemption does not extend to investment income received by the Board.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he is aware in relation to the new wholesale tax that representatives of the Revenue Commissioners, in consultation with representatives of firms engaged in the wholesale trade, gave to the trade generally an option of paying the tax either on cash received after October 1st or on sales effected after that date; that subsequently particular firms were permitted to pay the tax only on their purchases from manufacturers after 1st October; and that as a result large stocks of goods, purchased prior to October 1st and on which no tax is payable, are now competing with goods which are subject to tax thereby causing considerable loss and damage to smaller traders; and, if so, what steps he will now take to restore fair trading conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The option to which the Deputy refers applies to certain firms carrying on a large retail business <Col N="886" /> in taxable goods which are obliged to register for the wholesale tax either because they are also carrying on a wholesale business or because their purchases of taxable goods are made on a very extensive scale.  Some of these firms find it impossible to segregate their taxable retail sales from their exempt retail sales at the point of sale.  This difficulty was foreseen, and, under statutory provisions, these firms may be allowed to account for tax on their retail sales by reference to their purchases instead of their sales; but this option is applied to wholesale sales only in very exceptional circumstances. The purchase prices are uplifted by a certain percentage to ensure that the firms gain no tax advantage. In other words, they are put in the same tax position in relation to their retail sales as their competitors who are not obliged to register for the tax.  I can see nothing unfair about this arrangement.</P>
      <P>It is true that for some time after 1st October there may be stocks of goods in the hands of retailers in respect of which no tax is payable.  The vast majority of the retailers concerned will be unregistered.  This state of affairs also was foreseen from the beginning, and I referred to the question of forestalling in my statement of the 14th June, 1966, when I introduced the tax.  The only way of mitigating loss due to forestalling would have been to impose a tax on stocks of taxable goods in the hands of all retailers on the 1st October.  The alternative was to accept that there would be some loss of tax due to the opportunities for forestalling equally available to all retail traders.  I chose the second course as the more reasonable and practical one and I can see nothing unfair as between retail traders in the resulting situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact, so far as the officers of the Revenue Commissioners and others are concerned, that the effect of this tax was not understood?  Is it not also a fact that, in the discussions with the trade, only two forms of payment were suggested&mdash;payment on cash received or on sales effected&mdash;and that, in these <Col N="887" /> discussions, no third method was suggested, until later on, with larger concerns?  The Revenue officers of the Minister found they could not operate the tax unless they made a concession to large departmental concerns engaged in retail and wholesale trade, with the result that there is now unfair trading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It was a new measure. Certain complications were foreseen and others that may not have been foreseen subsequently arose.  In order to avoid any disadvantage accruing to a particular firm by these complications, every effort was made by the Revenue Commissioners to consult with the trading firms concerned and, in so far as it was possible&mdash;I think it was almost completely successful&mdash;any adverse effects as to retail trading were eliminated by the arrangements come to.  If difficulties have been encountered by certain firms and if they suggest that, by reason of the operation of the tax, they are put in a disadvantageous position <i>vis-á-vis</i> competitors, the Deputy might ask them to consult further with the Revenue Commissioners who would be glad to investigate to what extent, if any, there is unfair trading or undue loss of trade accruing to particular firms.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if the Minister has understood what I suggest is the effect.  As a result of what has happened, whether it was contemplated or intended, the position of the small trader is now seriously jeopardised. He is trading in goods upon which he must pay tax and he is competing with the larger traders who are selling goods which, in fact, are not subject to tax because they were purchased before 1st October last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I can see the distinction to which the Deputy is referring.  There were opportunities for forestalling which had to be envisaged and taken into account and which, to a large extent, could not be provided <Col N="888" /> against.  That forestalling was foreseen. I do not know if anything can be done to offset whatever disadvantages have occurred.  Again, I invite the Deputy to suggest to these people, if they have particular difficulties which they think operate unfairly against them, that they should get in touch with the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister not aware that, in fact, the Revenue Commissioners indicated to a large number of traders in the city&mdash;perhaps in the country, as well, but certainly in the city&mdash;that there were two methods&mdash; and only two methods&mdash;in which the tax could be dealt with but that subsequently, because of the difficulties to which the Minister referred in his reply, a third method was evolved? Does the Minister not consider it grossly unfair that the people who had been told earlier that there were only two methods should not have been told later that a third method was to be put into operation so that they could utilise that method instead of the methods read out and explained to them by the Revenue Commissioners in the early discussions?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Why were they not foreseen?  The result is that the larger organisations and traders have now secured an advantage over small traders because they have been able to purchase ahead in relation to a very busy selling period and they are now in a position to sell their goods without being subject to tax while the small traders will have to pay.

      <P>Will the Minister explain why, when people went as a representative group to see the Revenue Commissioners&mdash;the Minister would not see them; he passed them on to the Revenue Commissioners&mdash;they were then told the tax would be levied in either of two ways, and only two ways, and there could be no other way, and then, subsequently, when a third way was evolved for the purpose of meeting certain difficulties, why that third way was kept secret and was not transmitted back to the people who had been with the Revenue Commissioners earlier?  In consequence of that the people who knew of the secret third way have been able to build up an immense advantage over the small traders.  The gravamen of my charge is that a third way was evolved, that it was not announced publicly and, particularly, was not announced to the people who had already been with the Revenue Commissioners for an explanation of the methods to be adopted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Governey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister fully aware of the position?  Am I correct in saying, with regard to wholesalers, that the wholesaler pays his five per cent on his purchase plus his mark-up price whereas the supermarket pays its five per cent on its actual purchase?  A supermarket on a purchase of £100 pays five per cent whereas a wholesaler pays five per cent on the £100 plus his mark-up in profit.  There is an unfair differential there.  Again, is the Minister aware that this will leave the small business man in a much more shaky position?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>If I understand the Deputy correctly, I may be able to explain what is happening in this respect.  People who are registered do not pay tax on the purchase of goods as between themselves.  For example, a registered wholesaler does not pay tax in respect of purchases from a registered manufacturer.  The tax is payable at a subsequent stage.  There are many registered wholesalers who are also retailers and they can sell goods <i>qua</i> wholesalers to themselves <i>qua</i> retailers. In that respect, the sale price as between the wholesaler and the retailer is adjusted by a certain percentage to take account of the advantage that might otherwise accrue to a person who was both a wholesaler and a retailer.</P>

The Deputy is assuming that the Government should take away the rights of a private company to close down.  If the Deputy wants to argue, we must have a framework in which to argue.  Is he promoting the idea that the Government should prevent a firm from closing down or does he want to make whipping boys of Ministers?  I am aware that if a firm is extending or closing down, they have every right, in our economy, to do so.  Is the Deputy suggesting that the Government take the right of preventing them closing down?</P>

      <P>Payment from the British Government in respect of support on imports of Irish carcase beef and lamb into the United Kingdom during the months of July, August and September will be received after the end of the current United Kingdom fatstock year in March next.  The amount can then be calculated as the rates of support to be received are the <Col N="908" /> average rates of deficiency payments made during the year to United Kingdom producers of cattle, sheep and lambs.  So far as can be estimated at this stage the amount in respect of our exports during July, August and September will be approximately £400,000.  The money will be applied towards the cost incurred of supporting our exports of carcase beef and lamb to Britain.  As already announced, the Government will meet the cost of supporting any exports of eligible beef and lamb to Britain in excess of the quantities to be supported by the British Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 35 and 36 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Decisions regarding the operations of individual factories are entirely a matter for the principals of these factories and there is no way in which I can compel private interests to continue in business if they consider that it is not commercially feasible for them to do so.  I have been in touch with the management of Robert Perry &amp; Son Ltd. and I have been informed by them that there is no possibility of altering their decision to close the brewery.  I am, however, keeping in touch with the situation at Rathdowney and I understand that two entirely separate business interests have sought information from the management regarding the purchase of the Rathdowney Brewery and Maltings with a view to establishing an industry there.  I can assure the Deputies that any sound industrial proposal which may be formulated in relation to the Rathdowney area will receive all possible assistance from me <Col N="915" /> and from the Industrial Development Authority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that from the very outset of this big take-over by Arthur Guinness and Co. the parent company actually set about the deliberate destruction of the Perry's Ale Brewery?  This was deliberate policy on the part of Arthur Guinness &amp; Co.  Is the Minister now saying that arising from the Government's close relationship with Messrs.  Guinness the Government cannot ensure that this company will not go about the country taking over small family concerns in small towns and closing them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that there is any foundation for the allegation in the first part of the Deputy's question. With regard to the second part of the question, the Deputy is as well aware as I am that neither this Government nor any other Government in this country have ever claimed, or ever will claim, the right to force a firm to keep open when it decides to close.  What we can do, and what we do, is urge the firm not to close and we can, in certain circumstances perhaps, make arrangements with the people to keep a firm open.  As the Minister for Labour said earlier, the schemes which he is getting under way will help to alleviate some of the difficulties involved but no matter what schemes are available, so long as firms close down their business like this there will be hardship involved.  We can only try to mitigate the hardship arising from such a situation.  I suggest that it is being less than candid with the people for Deputies to suggest that the Government can prevent happenings such as this or that there is any ulterior reason for our not taking action which we could take.  Any action open to the Government to take has been taken and is being taken.</P>

Secondly, would he indicate whether the decision on the part of Messrs.  Guinness is irrevocable and whether he has any immediate plans for the initiation of a new industry and, thereby, the continuance of industrial activity in Rathdowney?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the first part of the Deputy's question, discussions took place at my direction between the firm concerned and officials of my Department.  With regard to the second part of the question, the Deputy is aware of the fact that the Minister for Industry and Commerce, as such, cannot have proposals for industrial activity in a particular area.  I cannot say that there will be an industry starting up in Rathdowney almost immediately.  I cannot say that.  But I can say that there is a reasonable prospect that an industry will start there in the not too distant future.  I do not want to mislead anybody concerned by giving the impression that this is something that is definite and fixed.  It is not so.  But there is a reasonable hope that it will be so.  I am aware of the fact that as this is the only industry in Rathdowney, there is grave hardship involved and for that reason I am particularly concerned to try to mitigate the effects of what has happened.  I do not think I can usefully add anything further.</P>

I am not aware that any Party in this country advocates that the Government should take the power to compel them to stay open either at their own expense, which presumably is unenforceable, or by way of subsidy from the Government.

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Dáil adjourned on Thursday evening last, I was making a general comment on the housing situation as I see it in my constituency.  I was referring to some of the difficulties the Minister for Local Government has and trying to bring pressure to bear on him, possibly from a political agitation point of view, inasmuch as I am his opposite number in that constituency but, primarily, to ask him to make sure that in this ensuing year more <Col N="922" /> money will be made available for building more houses in the constituency of North-East Donegal.  The Minister is very much alive to the great need there and, no doubt, over the past few weeks has received many representations from that part of Donegal which used to be in his constituency but which now he has described as South-West Donegal in his 1961 Electoral Act.  I refer to rehousing in the town of Stranorlar.</P>
      <P>The father and mother of one family there&mdash;to give the House an idea of the gravity of the situation&mdash; called on me very disappointed the morning after the new tenants were appointed to this scheme.  They informed me they had three teenage children: 13, 15 and 16 years of age. I cannot remember whether they said there were two boys and one girl or two girls and one boy but this family is living, without sanitary facilities, in two rooms in a house occupied by two other families.  They could not understand why they were not appointed to this new scheme in Stranorlar.  They claimed they had a very good case for rehousing.  I might add that they had in their possession a copy of a section 4 requisition signed by three members of the local authority, directing the county manager to allocate them the next available house in that district, which I declined to sign.  I explained to them why I declined to sign and promised I would look into their case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the aspects they mentioned to me&mdash;and since then I have asked for more evidence of this&mdash;was that trickery took place in the allocation of houses in Stranorlar.  I do not for a minute suggest that the methods used by any person applying for a house are methods any lower than I or any other person would use in trying to get tenancy of a cottage or house because people, living in the conditions they must live in today in Donegal, will try everything and anything which appears to be fair to establish their claim to a particular house.  But this particular family could not understand why they were overlooked. I might add that both are very firm supporters of the Government <Col N="923" /> Party and at no stage during the conversation did they ever say they would withdraw their support. Indeed, it was with a certain amount of suspicion that they accepted my opinion that the reason they did not qualify for rehousing and had not been successful in being appointed as tenants of one of the cottages, was purely and simply that there must have been more people living in worse conditions than themselves.</P>
    <P>One can imagine the conditions which exist in this part of Donegal, and I refer to one part of Donegal only at the moment, where a father and mother with three teenagers in their family are living in two rooms for the past 15 years, without sanitary facilities, and yet they did not qualify for a house&mdash;one out of 18.  What must have been the conditions of the other tenants when this family did not qualify?  If the Minister wants the name and address of these people, I will willingly give him all the information available to me, or I suggest that he ask his civil servants to communicate with the manager of Donegal County Council who will verify everything I have now stated.  That is the most recent incident, spotlighting the great need for rehousing in Donegal which comes to my mind at this time and that is why I have mentioned it.  I would ask the Minister to give very deep thought to this particular applicant when more houses are being built in Ballybofey, as no doubt more houses will be built in the not too distant future.  I would ask him to give every consideration to the provision of more houses in every town in the constituency because I do not have to bring to his notice all the letters I receive day in day out asking for advice on how constituents should go about staking a claim for rehousing; how they can go about applying for loans and grants to rehouse themselves and their families, or indeed letters asking: &ldquo;What is the delay in having our particular cottage erected, which was sanctioned some 12 months ago&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>There are many aspects involved here and no doubt if it were my responsibility to iron them out, it would <Col N="924" /> be quite a difficult task.  But there are many administrative matters involved in this rehousing procedure in respect of applications for rehousing between the local authority and the Department of Local Government which could be eliminated completely.  As I said here on Thursday evening last, when speaking on this Vote, this has been described by the Labour Prime Minister of Great Britain as being &ldquo;non-productive effort&rdquo;.  I agree wholeheartedly and by &ldquo;non-productive effort&rdquo;, I mean to say that many civil servants&mdash;I do not make this statement out of personal spite towards any particular civil servant; I generalise my remarks&mdash; employed by the Department of Local Government spend a lot of time going over business attended to most minutely by officials of the local authorities.  Many things have to be repeated when they come to the Department of Local Government for examination.</P>
    <P>When it comes to a major scheme, I am with the Minister and the Department in making sure that every point is raised and every dark corner looked into, but I cannot understand why when Donegal County Council apply to the Department for sanction to build one cottage at a cost of anything between £1,750 and £2,000, it has to go through the same rigmarole as went in the previous post and in the post prior to that.  This happens day in day out.  In this day and age and with communications as they are, the manager of the local authority should have complete power to decide when a person is entitled to a house, to negotiate there and then with a contractor, and have the house erected. This would eliminate a lot of the delays, which cost money&mdash;money which could be used towards the provision of extra houses.</P>
    <P>The main problem confronting this nation at the moment is the rehousing of our people.  I do not think I could paint a darker picture than the one I painted of a family of five in the twin towns of Stranorlar and Ballybofey. The conditions which that family has <Col N="925" /> to tolerate until the Department deem it necessary to provide the money so that the county council can provide a house for that family, are a condemnation of the Government.  The Department must take note of and recognise the seriousness of the situation.  They must pay particular attention to this application.  They must not forget that there are probably many families who are worse off or as badly off.  When this Estimate is being debated next year, I hope I will be able to compliment the Minister on having provided more houses in Donegal.  I have no doubt that, with the local elections coming, lots of promises will be made, and if only half of them are kept, I will be content.</P>
    <P>The final point I want to raise is in relation to town planning and derelict sites, particularly derelict sites owned by the local authorities&mdash;in my case, Donegal County Council.  We have regional development; we have amenity plans; we have all sorts of plans being put forward by the local authorities. We have experts coming from the Continent and from the United Nations, and seminars are being held all over the country at which we are told how we should plan our future.  This would be easier if some of the derelict sites owned by the local authorities were cleaned up.  This would help us to forget the past.</P>
    <P>A direction should go from the Department to every county engineer or county manager, as the case may be, instructing them that every derelict site which is an eyesore in a town or village should be removed immediately. The Minister is aware of some villages in County Donegal that cry out to heaven because the local authorities ignore derelict sites.  I have discussed this on many occasions with the county manager, the former county secretary, and the county engineer, and they tell me that the definition of a derelict site is a very peculiar thing indeed, and that there are many legal points which do not meet the eye but which must be dealt with before any derelict site can be acquired.</P>
    <P>That may be the case.  If it is the <Col N="926" /> case, the local authorities have the privilege of applying a compulsory purchase order and acquiring that derelict site and, having acquired it, putting it into a proper state.  They may then, if they wish, offer it back to the original owner.  This can be done.  No doubt the Minister will say that it costs money.  If it does cost money, it will be money well spent and money spent in giving employment to men who have to provide for their wives and families.  It will also probably help to keep a few more families from emigrating.</P>
    <P>I want to wish the officials directly involved in regional development and town planning in Donegal every success. This matter is so involved that I do not propose to discuss any detailed aspect of it.  Not as much attention should be paid to the rural districts of Donegal as is being paid at the moment.  I am in full agreement that absolute attention should be paid to applications coming in from urban areas and from towns and small villages, particularly on our main highways running through the country and to the seaside resorts.  When it comes to the erection of a haybarn, or a farmer re-designing his farmyard, or some person proposing to erect a house for himself far from a main thoroughfare, there should not be any great delay so long as the plans meet the requirements of the local authority and the Department.</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister to examine carefully the road tax now being collected on heavy duty vehicles, tipping lorries and heavy lorries or trucks which do business on both sides of the Border.  I may add&mdash;and while it is not in order on the Estimate for the Department of Local Government, it is necessary for me to say so&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The customs regulations permit Donegal-based lorries to collect and deliver loads of material of any <Col N="927" /> description in Northern Ireland.  Like-wise a British-registered lorry in Tyrone or Derry can deliver a load of materials in County Donegal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to say this much: lorries pay much more road tax in County Donegal and the cost of the vehicles is much higher and therefore there is unfair competition between lorries doing similar work.  The road tax on this side of the Border is much higher than in Northern Ireland and lorry owners living along the Border find things very difficult. They are in the position now that the only type of business they can do is collect goods in Donegal for delivery in Donegal.  Whenever goods from Donegal are to be delivered in the Six Counties or <i>vice versa,</i> the Northern Ireland lorries can be more competitive. This is a point to which the Minister should give particular attention.</P>
      <P>Last Thursday I spoke of the speed limit signs at Ballyrain, Letterkenny, and I would ask the Minister, when replying, to state exactly why such delay has taken place in having these road signs resited.  He should also give an undertaking to the House that the laws which prohibit him from sanctioning the application from Donegal County Council to have these signs resited will be abolished or amended to allow him to sanction such proposals when they are made to him by responsible people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the seventh day on which this Vote for the Department of Local Government has been before the House.  That indicates the interest taken in the debate and also the importance attached to this Department which covers a very wide field.  I do not propose to go into every facet of it but I should like to comment on the activities of the Department during the past few years and particularly on the efforts made by the present Minister to activate housing <Col N="928" /> authorities all over Ireland to come to him with plans and get the building programme going.  Unfortunately, it would appear that there must have been bundles of red tape at county council level and they did not seem to get it unravelled until 1966-67 and then they all came in together, which is neither helpful nor progressive.</P>
      <P>The housing programme for this year will again be as large as last year's and last year 11,000 houses were built, a substantial increase on the previous year.  I have no doubt the number built this year will be as great.  There is, of course, more money provided this year.  Despite all the clamour for money and all the allegations made to county councils and county borough councils, I hope they will have spent it all and that it will not be lying in their respective accounts at the end of the year as money not absorbed.  That had become a feature in the past, that allocations had always been taken up but had not always been spent.  I hope that the allocation of £25.5 million this year will be well and fully spent at the end of the year.  The Minister's plans and the Government's plans give a target figure of 14,000 houses by 1970 to fit in with the Second Programme for Economic Expansion. That appears to me to be fairly adequate, having regard to renewals and some expansion in the stock of houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have heard it said that we have something like 600,000 family units.  At 10,000 a year, this would give the life of a house as about 60 years, but at 14,000 houses a year this would bring the life of a house closer to 40 years. In the past, houses probably gave a lifetime of about 100 years, with due allowance for proper maintenance. With a target of 14,000 houses, one could reasonably hope that the housing problem would ultimately be solved as far as possible.  It is sheer nonsense to think that any problem will ever be finally solved because we are planning and changing every day.  Human nature itself is changing and development taking place daily.  Movement of population is taking place, and in all these <Col N="929" /> circumstances, it cannot be said that any particular plan can ever be finally battened down and finished with.  The problem of housing will be just as great, I am sure, 100 or 1,000 years from now as it is today.  It is a pity we could not make a perfect man and woman and have them all absolutely equal.  We might then approach a Shangri-La of some kind but I am afraid we shall never succeed in doing that.</P>
    <P>A tremendous fillip was given to housing by the passing into law on 12th July of the new Housing Bill.  I hope the Minister will shortly issue the order making it effective.  One of the good features of the Bill was section 5. I can see the benefit of this very clearly, especially in Counties Sligo and Leitrim, where the county councils are adopting this scheme and have made it work.  Up to date I think some thousands of houses have been repaired under the scheme and I know that hundreds&mdash;even up to 1,000&mdash;are being prepared under the scheme.</P>
    <P>It is a good scheme in so far as it provides minimum accommodation for old couples living in backward areas or in small holdings where there is little likelihood of succession by way of family or children afterwards.  Ultimately, such a holding would pass away.  This legislation was necessary because the particular type of people covered could not be catered for even by reconstruction grants.  Sometimes they did not have the wherewithal to provide the money required in addition to the grant for reconstruction. Section 5 caters for them very well.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to consider giving a slight increase and also urging the county councils to give a little more.  At present the Minister gives £80 and Sligo County Council £120, as does Leitrim County Council. I should like a little more, because in most cases work should be done to give a more homely atmosphere. Standards are at a minimum and though some of the old houses have the roofs taken off, the ceilings are already there and all the houses need is an asbestos covering.  I should like <Col N="930" /> to see the Minister extending this work as far as possible.</P>
    <P>Progress made in housing throughout the country since 1932 has brought about a transformation.  Here and there one can see the passing away of the old thatched houses and the slated houses which up to recently had no plumbing or drainage are being replaced by modern new homes.  Anybody associated with the building industry knows that large numbers of our people are making every effort to instal the most up-to-date amenities, including central heating.</P>
    <P>All this in the years ahead will put tremendous pressure on the Department because as the standard of living rises, people will either want to renew their homes by building new ones or to modernise them by the installation of plumbing, drainage and in many cases central heating.  Therefore, in the future there will be heavy demands on the Minister and the Department as the standard continues to rise.  It is a sign of the times that these vast changes are taking place.  Our desire to raise the standard of living has come to reality.  This will not decrease as the years go by.  It will become more and more a part of our lives and this demand for higher standards will react on the Department of Local Government who will need to be particularly vigilant in their reviews of the whole housing programme.</P>
    <P>There are approximately 600,000 family units in the country.  During the next 40 or 60 years, the programmes set by the Department must include provision for an increasing population because the family unit pool will change radically.  During that period also, many of the 600,000 homes now in existence will become obsolete. Indeed many of them are already so. There will, therefore, be an increased urgency to replace homes quickly.  This will apply particularly to small towns and cities because in the hearts of our cities already there is a high proportion of obsolete houses which must be replaced in the very near future.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the problem will not get easier with the passing years and in this connection there have been complaints <Col N="931" /> about the red tape at Departmental level and the consequential delays in approving housing schemes. Anyone with any idea of the planning of housing schemes or their design, even in the case of private enterprise, knows that the Department must be satisfied at all times that the standards are good and that the plans are good and that irrespective of the time it takes, Departmental officials must insist on certain standards being maintained. I must concur in this.  It is necessary that care is taken in the field of local authority housing as well as in the private sphere and any Minister who, to satisfy demands by Deputies, tends to be less careful in the matter of either local authority housing or private housing would be very foolish because he would be laying himself open ultimately to accusations that he did not do his job.</P>
    <P>On the suggestion that the Minister should intervene in the matter of tenancies, I should like to point out that this is purely a function of local councils.  Though I do not like red tape, I am afraid that in future years we shall get more instead of less of it. In spite of red tape and the complaints about it, last year we built 11,000 houses and that is quite a good record. We have not got a pool of labour in this country to build many more houses in a year.  In the category of skilled labour particularly there are shortages everywhere, not in the Gaeltacht alone.</P>
    <P>Against that background, it is important that before releasing housing schemes for public tender, the Minister and the Department should satisfy themselves that they will not throw a glut of work on the market, thereby causing an escalation of prices.  The Department must ensure that the volume of building at any stage will not be allowed to cause a glut and a consequential escalation in prices. There is always a danger of this in a rising economy where people want homes quickly.  As well as in the field of local authority and private development programmes, the Minister must keep an eye on office and hospital building.  He must, in conjunction with <Col N="932" /> the other Departments, keep a wary eye on the pool of skilled labour available so that prices can be maintained at a competitive level.</P>
    <P>On the question of finance, as I pointed out in my opening remarks a sum of £25.5 million is being provided this year.  Of this, local authorities will get £11.75 million.  In 1964-65, the allocation to local authorities was £6.8 million.  Last year it was increased to £9.9 million and this has been increased this year to £11.75 million. Still we hear the clamour that there is no money for housing.</P>
    <P>For private housing, including SDA schemes, the allocation in 1964/65 was £4.6 million.  In 1965-66, it was increased to £6 million and in the current year, the allocation is £7 million. That is in addition to the funds available from building societies, insurance companies and other lending bodies. More money, of course, is being allocated for reconstruction and repairs of old houses.  When the year has finished, I doubt if any local authority will be inclined to say it was a period in which they were held up for lack of money.  I submit that if any complaint arises, it will be primarily attributable to the fact that the money available will not be fully spent.  I believe that some schemes will be held up because of a shortage of skilled workers.  Because of this, I foresee that many of the schemes will not be completed within the contract period.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see the Minister is asking for a housing survey.  I heard him mention this on many occasions, that every local authority should set down its needs in the short term and in the long term.  I would like to see the Minister pursuing this vigorously because if he does not the local authorities will blame him for not doing their work.  When this information is available what is needed is a phased plan for the building of houses in every county.  These things cannot be done tomorrow or in a couple of years.  The public are well aware of what can or cannot be done.  If they show any anxiety it is to get somewhere in the queue.  If every county council put forward <Col N="933" /> a plan of development for housing requirements people would be satisfied. We all know people who are living in bad conditions.  We also know people who are living in even worse conditions and who have a higher priority than others.  The local authorities in letting houses must have regard to the worst cases.  The people living in poor conditions would be well satisfied if they knew that in two, three or even five years' time they would become entitled to a house.</P>
    <P>It has occurred to me for a good number of years now that the Minister ought to examine whether or not the building of houses at county council level is the best way of doing the work. It is an expensive business involving the engagement of architects and quantity surveyors by all of these bodies.  The Minister set up the National Building Agency, and I believe this organisation should be developed to take over all housing from local authorities.  I would not wish to see it done half and half; either do it 100 per cent or not at all, or maintain it on a limited basis for certain cases in respect of which it has proved useful up to now.</P>
    <P>The Minister brought about the creation of a building advisory body some months ago.  I understand their job is to examine the building industry, to establish continuity, as far as possible, to assess the needs of the industry and to consider methods of construction.  This is welcomed.  Any new method that can reduce the cost of building or advance the prefabrication of components is all to the good. The only difficulty I see in this kind of mechanical building is that it can take place only in respect of large groups of houses.  From conversations I have had about this I understand these groups range from 100 up to 5,000 houses, in order to make it economic.  This makes the position most difficult because in Ireland, with few exceptions, we do not build even 100 houses at one time but a much smaller number and the popular method of building at the moment is the traditional one.  Whether people in need of houses are too conservative <Col N="934" /> or builders are too conservative it is hard to say.  I expect the builders are supplying the demands of their customers and probably the customers are reluctant to accept something they know nothing about.  However, I wish the bodies I have mentioned success and I hope they will soon bring to the Minister and his Department their schemes and plans for building houses as quickly and as efficiently as possible.</P>
    <P>There is a need even in traditional housing for improved design.  There is a need for improved layout of estates. Sometimes I feel this improvement may be inhibited by the rather strict regulations laid down in the Housing Acts, but I am assured by some people this is not the position, that a lot can be done.  I wonder what is the case for sticking to rigid room sizes.  In some countries I have been in, particularly Germany, the main accent in homes is on living space, a good-sized kitchen, a good-sized sittingroom and diningroom, and less accent on sleeping apartments. When I asked them why they said: &ldquo;One only sleeps there.  One does not live there.&rdquo;  Perhaps we could look at this matter again.  In regard to the forthcoming standard building bye-laws, I hope these are advanced to the stage that the Minister can tell us something about them.</P>
    <P>One hears much criticism these days in regard to the question of estates not being taken over by local authorities, and I understand this is the subject of an amendment to a Bill at the present time.  It is most unfair to blame the Department of Local Government or the Minister for the situation in regard to these estates.  Local authorities have all the power they need under section 35 of the Town Planning Act to ensure that developers hand over estates in proper condition.  This is nothing more than the developer contracts for and undertakes to do.  If this is not done, then it is for some other reason, and I suggest the reason is probably that the developer or the builder has no money to do it, or else he has died or has disposed of his interest.  However, if local authorities sit back and do <Col N="935" /> nothing about it, they are neglecting their responsibility.</P>
    <P>Members of local authorities who may care to acquaint themselves with the requirements will see that there are no further laws that can be passed to improve the position.  All that can be done at present is to push things as far as possible in order to get the job done.  There is no point in pushing a person who has no money to get him to spend money.  To leave estates in an unfinished condition for 50 years is a disgrace.  I do not think the Minister can strengthen the hand of the local authority more than has already been done under the section of the Town Planning Act.  However, I am satisfied that responsible builders and developers in the city of Dublin do finish estates and hand them over.</P>
    <P>I know from personal experience that the difficulty is very often in getting local authorities to take over estates.  Even when the work which they stipulate must be done has been carried out it is difficult to get them to take over the estates.  They like to leave the matter for another couple of years to see if anything else might require to be done.  The local authorities do not show any sense of urgency even where the developer is willing and anxious to hand over an estate.  I would ask the Minister to see if he can do anything to ensure that estates are quickly finished and handed over.</P>
    <P>Now I come to the matter of estate planning, having regard to the high price of land at the present time.  It can be said that any kind of approved building land in Dublin today will command a price in the region of £3,000, if not more.  The density figure of six houses to the acre tends to increase the cost of houses.  Under the town planning regulations of Dublin Corporation, a builder can build 20 houses to the acre in zone A and 80 houses to the acre in zone B but, when one carries out all the bye-laws, one is lucky if one can get eight or nine houses to the acre.  This problem, as many Members of the House <Col N="936" /> know, is tied up with the front building line, the minimum size of back gardens and so on.  It is most difficult to get the density up.  The Minister and the Department could usefully consider this matter.  There is also the question of the rigidly enforced 20 feet frontage for a building.  The only way in which this can be got over is by special permission of the Minister. There should be some flexibility in regard to this rule so that the density may be increased.  This can be done without cluttering an area.  It is done successfully in other countries whose standards are fairly high and I cannot see why it cannot be done here. I should like to see more flexibility in regard to the density regulations.</P>
    <P>One meets county engineers who take their office very seriously but without utilising their powers.  There is only one county engineer who insists that every road in an estate shall be 24 feet wide.  I agree that 24 feet would be necessary for a road that is carrying buses and lorries.  For a road carrying residential traffic on which a couple of houses would have a car on each side of the road I suggest that 16 feet, the width adopted in other places, would be adequate.  In some cases there is a 30 foot building line, a 24 foot wide road, two paths of six feet wide and grass margins six feet wide and 30 feet on the far side.  There can be a distance of 90 to over 100 feet between the houses on either side of the road.  Having regard to the pool of land available for housing, this means an escalation in price.</P>
    <P>An Foras Forbartha comes under the Minister for Local Government.  As far as I know, this body is responsible for physical planning, which I understand to mean physical planning and development in the country generally.  At present An Foras Forbartha is working on schemes for Waterford and Galway.  I hope its activities will extend further west, into Sligo.  There is a great deal of responsibility resting on the officers of the Institute.  Their task will not be an easy one.  There are many towns and villages which are not in a position to accept or to accommodate an industry, because of lack of services. <Col N="937" /> That is why I welcome the activities of An Foras Forbartha.  It will be able to pinpoint the areas that can with safety be developed immediately and, also, the areas that are inhibited because they have not the necessary services for development.  There is a small town in my constituency where the county manager threatened to cut off a water supply from an industry on the grounds that it was taking all the water.  Notice was served on them to the effect that they must have their own water supply.  An Foras Forbartha is in an ideal position to deal with such problems.</P>
    <P>Problems arise not alone in relation to the placing of industries but, also, in relation to the provision of services of all kinds, including housing.  There cannot be industrial development unless the housing needs of the potential workers are met.  There must be simultaneous planning of industry and services. It is not enough to provide employment. Amenities must also be developed so that the leisure time of the workers will not become boring. It is as important to cater for leisure as it is to provide employment.  There is an increasing demand for amenities at all levels.</P>
    <P>The planning of industrial development in certain areas will, I am sure, follow certain lines.  For instance, certain areas are more suitable for light engineering than others.  There might be a nucleus of a light engineering industry in an area which could be developed.  When similar types of industry are developed together, they become complementary to each other and this has the effect of accelerating development in an area.  When the pool of knowledge is concentrated in an area, it can be useful all round.  I am sure the planners will bear this in mind.  The same applies to the textile industry, heavy engineering, cabinet-making, furniture and so on.  The grouping of industries tends to make them stronger and give greater hope to the worker.  He is no longer isolated.  If he becomes redundant, he does not find himself without another job to walk into.  He feels freer, less a prisoner, in an industrial zone than an <Col N="938" /> isolated industry.  He become a better worker.  Any worker who feels free to walk out of one job into another is, by and large, easier to handle; although people may hold the view that if he has no alternative but to work in a particular industry, he will work better.  I do not agree.  Men work better when they are free in mind and body.</P>
    <P>In certain rural areas, the pool of labour may be great but it is not always suitable labour.  In many towns and rural areas, you find a percentage of people who say they are available for employment, but if you check their age and background, you find the age level is high and their previous experience is confined to work on small farms, roads and relief schemes.  They are not always adaptable to new types of training and work. The idea ought to be to phase-develop and absorb the younger boys and girls coming from the school so that they can be trained for industrial work. Farm work and relief work on the county council is often of a fairly lethargical type&mdash;easy come, easy go&mdash; and if the worker is friendly with the ganger, he might have his job held open for him.  This cannot apply to industrial development.  Any well-organised industrial firm either needs you for a job or it does not.  If you are going to stay out for the day, you had better arrange a substitute to take up your job while you are away.  This is something the planners will have to face up to.  Perhaps it is too early yet to expect any report from the county planning teams which were set up some time ago.</P>
    <P>The Minister has shown tremendous interest in the need for the provision of swimming pools throughout the country. When the Minister asks for anything to be done, everybody wants to do it at once.  Then they complain they do not get the money immediately. Swimming pools can be provided in every area requiring them but it should be a phased development.  This should be put to local authorities in concrete terms.  To provide amenities of this kind everywhere overnight is impossible. These people should be put in a queue and told: &ldquo;You will get it such <Col N="939" /> a year&rdquo; and &ldquo;You will get it such a year.&rdquo;  In that way they could lay their plans accordingly.  I welcome the development of these amenities.  Not alone should every child be able to swim, but swimming provides healthy exercise for them and helps to develop their minds and bodies.</P>
    <P>Somebody mentioned derelict sites. I cannot say I am excited about the use being made of the derelict sites grant and the amenity grant that goes with it.  The Minister ought to circularise local authorities again urging them to use their powers of acquisition. If people do not clean up those unsightly ruins quickly, let the council take over the site and clear it.  While on the subject of amenity grants, many of our seaside resorts of the west are a disgrace during the summertime.  I would ask the Minister to request local authorities to provide at least minimum toilet requirements near bathing places.  There are resorts I would be ashamed to go to because they have no toilet facilities whatever.  Here is a further point.  I have never seen any effort made to provide a simple fresh water shower in which one can wash off the salt water on returning from a swim.  This is something which would improve the reputation of any of our seaside resorts.</P>
    <P>We welcome the realistic approach of the Minister to the question of rents. We hear complaints in this House day in and day out about the rise in taxation. We hear the general litany of hardship.  We are aware of people living in local authority houses for rents as low as 3/6d or 5/- a week.  We are aware that many of those tenants have quite large incomes.  But nothing has ever been done about it because of a Landlord and Tenant Act passed 20 or 30 years ago.  Today their children are getting married and have to face the reality of an economic rent, which could well be £3 or even more.  When fixing rents, local authorities have regard to people's means.  I do not want to impose on any person of small income or limited means a tremendous rent, but we must be realistic about <Col N="940" /> this.  It is disgraceful to find an artisan putting down a deposit of £400 or £500 to buy a house, taking on the responsibility for a mortgage over 30 or 35 years and then being faced with a bill for rates of £40, £50 or £60.  That man goes out each morning to his job and may well sit down to work with a man living in a subsidised local authority house who is getting more wages than he gets.</P>
    <P>Wherein does our responsibility lie? What type of social justice do we seek? Local authorities must look at this realistically.  If there is this increase in rates and taxation each year, surely it was brought about because we failed to face up to the responsibilities we are charged with and to meet our problems? In the life of every public man, he can run before the tide for so long but ultimately he must face up one day to his responsibilities, too.  There is a day of reckoning coming for a lot of members of county councils and others who come into this House and go to county council meetings and complain about justice, while supporting injustice.</P>
    <P>The Minister is now asking and urging local authorities to increase those rents and to help to reduce the new rents for the new home-owners and, indeed, to try to keep taxation down by making those pay who can afford to pay.  Anybody who cares to trouble himself to go around some of the old housing estates in Dublin will notice the number of cars parked outside the homes and in the streets and can be in no doubt as to the position.  I think, indeed, that local authorities should go farther.  They should make it mandatory on the tenant fully to declare his income and, indeed, any changes that might arise in his income, either upwards or downwards. If his income goes up he should notify it and if it goes down he should notify it.  We could have the position that when a person became unemployed his rent would immediately be subsidised or reduced by the county council.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the point at which I might say that house ownership <Col N="941" /> should be encouraged.  The owner of a house has a stake in the land, as the saying goes, and is a much more responsible person.  I know that the Department and the county councils have been pushing this for many years now.  From the Minister's speech, I gathered that something like 72.5 per cent of the houses are already vested representing something like 63,198 houses.  I should like to see vesting accelerated.</P>
    <P>The person who owns his house removes even the charge of its maintenance from the county council. Furthermore, he becomes a ratepayer and subscribes to the general rate of the city or of the county.  Altogether, he becomes a more responsible and settled citizen.  A person who becomes a tenant of a house may not alone not maintain it but it costs the local authority quite a lot each year to maintain it.  Furthermore, he does not even tend to be house-proud.  It is very important that every person should develop, if he has not already got it, this quality of being house-proud. One factor, above all, which encourages it is ownership in this particular field.</P>
    <P>In the matter of road safety, the Minister has been carrying out a campaign of propaganda and indeed has been bringing in new legislation.  I shall not say anything more about it except to mention that trends would indicate that strong rules and regulations must be brought in about the mechanical conditions of road vehicles, not alone of cars already on the road but of new cars coming on the road.  I think a lot of new cars ought to be brought up to certain standards and that steps should be taken to ensure that these standards are adhered to without any question. One hears a general blaming of inebriated drivers for being the main cause of accidents.  I think it is possible that over-tired drivers, people driving cars who have not been to bed the night before, people driving cars who have been working hard all day, contribute to road accidents.  I know myself, from experience of driving, the number of times I have had to stop because sleep started to overtake me <Col N="942" /> and I started to nod off, as it were. These are far more dangerous conditions, probably, than a person who might have taken a drink in moderation. However, all of these factors contribute to accidents.  It is important to bear in mind the mechanical condition not alone of old cars but of new cars, too.</P>
    <P>With regard to planning and urban renewal, I think this problem of urban renewal will have to be tackled and it will be a mansized job.  In our major cities, it is already a problem.  In Dublin, property will have to be acquired, demolished and rebuilt and that will call for greater planning, imagination and a tremendous amount of money.  I have seen what has been done in other countries.  I know that in parts of America the city authorities are urged to buy property, where urban renewal is desirable and then to sell the property to a developer and any loss that is suffered between the cost and the selling price is made up by a Federal grant.  We may have to do something of that nature in relation to the centre of Dublin city.  It may well be necessary to bring in special legislation so as to have a more rapid rate of urban renewal.  Most of the grand old streets of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, for which Dublin has rightly been famous, are now pretty well worn out and obsolete.  Probably they could be preserved for a few more years with the aid of some further money but ultimately they must change and the whole of the centre of Dublin city will have to be renewed.  This is a matter that will face the Minister in a few years' time.</P>
    <P>I want to compliment the Minister on the legislation he has piloted through this House during the year and on the work he has done in his Department.  I want also to say that the recent award to him of membership of the Town Planning Institute is a well-deserved tribute.  We know that the Minister has taken a deep interest in town-planning and has gone to great lengths to acquaint himself with all aspects of it.  I have a word to say for a former member of the Department <Col N="943" /> who, until recently, was the Secretary, Mr. John Garvin, who has retired.  I want to take this opportunity of wishing him success in his retirement and, at the same time, to welcome the new Secretary of the Department and to hope that he will have many years of progress and success.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to delay the House but I want to deal with a couple of aspects of the work of the Department.  Apart from the actual volume of money made available by the Minister's Department to local authorities, one of the troubles at the present time is that there is no forward planning or forward allocations in relation to it.  It is quite absurd for anyone to attempt to make plans or to plan any real progress if they know only from year to year the exact capital allocations.  In March of this year, the Minister for Local Government made the allocations for local authorities for housing, road works and other purposes.  When doing so, he did not give to the authorities concerned any indication of where they would stand next year. In these circumstances, it seems to me quite impossible to suggest to local authorities to plan on starting schemes this year without knowing whether they will be able to finance these schemes, as they go on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that, to some extent, there is an improvement compared with the position which obtained 20 years ago. Up to 1954, the position was that the Department of Local Government made no effort at all to make any plan or estimate of capital expenditure by local authorities.  There has been some improvement up to the present, an improvement initiated during those years; but we shall have to go much further than that.  We will have to make it quite clear that the amount available to a local authority will run to a particular pattern for at least three or four years ahead and it will then be the task and the responsibility of the local authority concerned to ensure that those funds are utilised in the right way and the proper priorities kept.  As the situation <Col N="944" /> is at present, it is a question of living from hand to mouth over a 12-month period.</P>
    <P>Apart from the fact that this impinges on those who would hope to benefit by local authority works, there is the added disadvantage that it has a most depressing effect on productivity in the building industry.  Again and again the Minister has repeated that the amount of money which will be made available for building this year will be more than was made available last year.  The real facts are, of course, now beginning to emerge.  Whatever amount is made available this year, a large part of it must have been committed on 31st March last, and a large part of the money being made available this year, and the Minister has adverted to this, is necessarily purely for the purpose of clearing up the backlog that was there at the end of March last.  The figures available for each month in respect of the completion of houses under State-aided schemes show in each single month in 1966 a reduction over the similar period in 1965.  The total in each of the first eight months of this year up to the end of August, the latest date for which figures are available, is approximately 20 per cent down on last year and about one-fifth fewer houses have been completed this year than there were last year, notwithstanding the fact that one takes into account in that the building strike last year.</P>
    <P>In those circumstances, it is difficult to see how the Minister can be said to be approaching the problem realistically. It would seem to me he is approaching it politically rather than realistically and economically.  Apart from the Ballymun scheme, I do not know whether any consideration has been given to the possibility of ensuring, by long-term planning, the bringing down of ordinary building costs. The method of allotting small contracts here and there and even allotting large contracts in stages inevitably prevents the advantages of large-scale production and is one of the reasons why the cost of building remains so high.</P>
    <P>I might add that, apart from the statistics showing a reduction in new <Col N="945" /> houses in the final eight months of this year from 5,242 last year to 4,239 this year, there is other evidence from the analysis produced by a firm of stock-brokers in relation to ten Irish companies serving the building industry here.  That analysis has arrived at exactly the same conclusion: the only reason the Minister is able to say that the amount of money made available this year is slightly more than was made available last year is the large part of that money necessary to complete the commitments there at the end of 1965-66.  It is clear that the sums available to finance new building activity in the current financial year are unlikely to be anything like sufficient to maintain building activity at the 1965-66 level, and the sooner we face that fact the better it will be for everybody.  The prospects for the building industry&mdash;we all accept this&mdash;must of course depend on the prospects for the economy as a whole.  It is, I think, true to say that the time-lag in relation to the industry as from the deflation in 1965 has now built up very badly indeed and it is difficult to see any fair prospect of improvement in the current year.</P>
    <P>Whatever may be the position in relation to local authority building, the position in relation to private building depends entirely on the amount of money available to finance new house purchases.  The amount available under the SDA in the county about which I have the greatest knowledge, Kildare, is infinitesimal compared with the amount required and every day public representatives are coming up against cases of people who want to make arrangements to build their houses with SDA loans and the county council is not in a position to tell them they can safely undertake that burden.</P>
    <P>I can understand the Minister having difficulties in relation to increasing the amount that is available.  He can hand out only that which is made available to him by the Minister for Finance.  If only a more realistic view were taken and people were told clearly that they cannot get the money they require but that the capital to service the loan will be available on such-and-such a date, <Col N="946" /> then they could make some plans for their future homes.  The present situation is most unsatisfactory.  Local authorities have to write to individual applicants, to solicitors acting on behalf of applicants, and to public representatives making representations on behalf of applicants, saying they have no funds and they do not know what they will get next year; that is something that is causing uncertainty. It is doing very great damage not only to the building industry but also to applicants, since it inflicts a very great hardship on them.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance some time back did say that efforts would be made to ensure that allocations would be made and it would be for Departments to decide how they would sort out the various allocations within the figures granted.  Now that must be taken a step further and basic allocations must be made not only for one year but for two or three years ahead. The people concerned will then know where they stand.</P>
    <P>For example, in the town of Naas there has been great anxiety in relation to a sewerage scheme, the Sallins Road Scheme.  Pressure has been brought by representatives of all the political Parties on the Minister to sanction the scheme sent up.  It is a scheme which I fear is necessary because of the inadequate technicalities of a previous one.  However, the sanctioning of that sewerage scheme itself is not going to do anything in that area without a proper planned programme of moneys to be made available under the Small Dwellings Act for the people who naturally want to buy the houses to be erected and in which they will spend a large part of their lives.  The frustration and the lack of propriety that arises in relation to schemes of that sort, the lack of order, is something that has to be changed.</P>
    <P>In relation to roads, I fear that our allocation in relation to their development is being unnecessarily strained by the lack of driving sense in our people.  It is such a rare thing as to be a matter for wonder to see anyone driving on the left of the road.  People always drive on the left centre and the effect of that is that there is a large <Col N="947" /> part of the left-hand side of the road that is not being used at all and it is not being used even though very large sums have gone into its construction and maintenance.  I think the recommendation of the Minister to local authorities that they should always have a white line down the middle of the roads, even though the road may be normally a three-lane road, is something that encourages this, because drivers tend to drive with the white line immediately on their right.</P>
    <P>I would earnestly ask the Minister to consider whether it would not be for the better utilisation of road space, and the expense that has gone into it, to ensure that roads which are in fact three-lane roads would be marked out as such and not have a white line down the middle which leaves a lane and a half, so to speak, on each side. It is unfortunate that that does happen and it is equally unfortunate that many of our drivers do not give signals of what they intend to do.  The lack of notice of intention in relation to driving is a greater cause of accidents than anything else.  Of course, where accidents do occur, the higher the speed the worse the accident, but I would suggest that the number of accidents that arise because drivers will not behave as ordinary people and give notice of what they intend to do, is extremely high.</P>
    <P>The Minister also indicated in his introductory speech that he proposes to introduce a system of clear-ways in Dublin.  The one-way street system that has been adopted in Dublin has undoubtedly improved the flow of traffic but it is all set at naught if you are going to have indiscriminate parking in some of those one-way streets.  I mention particularly Charlotte Street which is a one-way street for the purpose of getting a roundabout at the traffic junction and yet it is regularly blocked by lorries in such a way that traffic cannot get through it.  While a great deal of unnecessary trouble is caused by parking of that sort, there is also a good deal of unnecessary trouble caused to a driver by not knowing where he is entitled to park or where he is not entitled to park.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="948" /> I would urge the Minister to bring in the same system as operates on the Continent whereby parts of the street which are prohibited as parking places have the edge of the pavement painted in red and white.  It is thus simple to see where parking is prohibited and there is no excuse in those circumstances for people parking there, as there is at present.  It is often impossible to know whether a place is a permitted parking place or not.  The lack of discrimination in dealing with streets in that way has undone much of the improved flow of traffic which was brought in with the introduction of the one-way system which has been adopted in Dublin.</P>
    <P>I would also ask the Minister to urge local authorities to provide some sort of forward warning so that a motorist approaching a turn will know that he is not allowed to turn one or two particular ways.  As it is, unless people know the area, they will not know whether a right turn is prohibited or not until they actually arrive at the crossing.  By that time they are probably in the wrong lane and getting back into the right lane only causes a great deal of unnecessary confusion all around.  There should be a forward warning notice to the effect that at the next junction, a right-hand turn is prohibited. Without that, a person cannot have any real idea of how to go, unless he or she knows the area.</P>
    <P>It was a pity that the Government some years ago dropped the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  I do not for one moment suggest that it was perfect but it was an Act under which local authorities did a good deal in many areas throughout the country to improve the lot of those in the most backward parts and who were in consequence, I would suggest, the people who were deserving of assistance and development.  I know that the Fianna Fáil answer always is that there was no provision for maintenance.  It would have been quite simple to provide that local authorities would be offered grants under the Local Authorities (Works) Act in any case where they were prepared to agree to accept an obligation to provide maintenance on that work at the normal maintenance <Col N="949" /> rate, which I think is about four per cent.  That was not done and I feel that it is more likely that the scheme was dropped because of the financial implications rather than because of the expressed statements that it was not as it should be.</P>
    <P>Regardless of all that, the Minister has had to listen to a long debate on this and I think he must make up his mind that unless he is going to be able to tell local authorities what they are going to get under their various headings for capital expenditure over a period of at least two years, in addition to the current year that is being considered at any one time, he will not get any reasonable planning by local authorities and, indeed, will not get any responsible local government.</P>

      <P>There is an amendment which I should like to bring to the notice of the House.  It has been brought to my notice that in introducing the Estimate, following the practice of previous years, I moved that a sum not exceeding £2,324,090 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the charge coming in course of payment during the year.  This took into account the amount already made available under the Central Fund (Permanent Provisions) Act, 1965.  I am informed that under the new financial arrangements covered by this Act, the motion should, in fact, cover the full amount required for the year and I should more correctly have moved that a sum not exceeding £8,581,450 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on 31st day of March, 1967, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Local Government, including Grants to Local Authorities, Grants and other expenses in connection with Housing, and miscellaneous grants including certain Grants-in-Aid.</P>

      <P>My opening speech was probably rather lengthy, but on the other hand, it was deliberately so for the reason that I felt the House are entitled to a fairly full review, particularly as we have already got through half of the year in respect of which this Estimate is now being provided.  I have been criticised, of course, because I said so much and also accused of not being frank with the House.  This trend was taken up by Deputies T.J. Fitzpatrick, O.J. Flanagan, M.P. Murphy, Dillon, O'Hara, Casey, Tierney and S. Collins. I did not, in my introductory speech, in any way attempt to conceal any difficulties we are facing in regard to my Department.  I did not attempt even to hide any misgivings which I may have had in regard to the difficulties with which we are now confronted and which may confront us for some considerable time to come.</P>
      <P>I said:</P>
      <P>The overall capital position, while still far from what I would like it to be, represents a considerable improvement on the position obtaining this time last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This cannot be regarded in any way as other than factual.  I would like those who have stated otherwise to reconsider the situation and to be frank with themselves.  They should compare this with the performance and the availability of moneys in the past. If, after that, they still feel as they have stated they feel, all I can say is there is no help for them.  You cannot <Col N="951" /> do anything about them except to let them go their own wilful ways.  I was very frank and open with the House.</P>
    <P>At least Deputy Larkin did not join with those other Deputies: not only that, but he departed from it.  In fact, he was perturbed by those things which I had to say, which others complained about as misleading.  Deputy Larkin apparently read the script and he expressed astonishment that not alone was I being frank by making very serious statements but also about the difficulties we had to face.  Deputy Larkin and I do not always agree. On the other hand, I am rather inclined to take account of what he said and note his astonishment at my frankness as against the charges of lack of frankness made by other Deputies.  I would say to those who have been astonished at my lack of frankness: &ldquo;Go and have a look at the facts and revise your opinions accordingly.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I just want to get him on the rails.  I accused the Minister of being less than frank with the House when he introduced last year's Estimate and said that everything in the garden was rosy and that we might expect bigger and better things.  I said that within a matter of a few months a shortage <Col N="952" /> of money was disclosed.  Reference to my speech will prove that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree, taking the amended version into account, that I was less than frank then as to the knowledge that was available to me at the particular time.  What I said then was as frank and as open as what I said on this occasion.</P>
      <P>Now, to get back to the Estimate, that is, the present year's Estimate, the fact is that £25 million is being made available for housing and sanitary services generally.  This shows a growth over last year.  I should like, to prove this point, to give some figures from 1960 onwards.  These figures show that in 1960-61, £9.03 million of State capital was expended on housing.  In 1961-62 this figure had risen to £9.67 million; in 1962-63, it had risen to £11.19 million; in 1963-64, to £12.12 million; in 1964-65, to £15.33 million; in 1965-66, to £20.05 million; and in 1966-67, to £21.84 million, plus £.9 million, a total of £22.74 million.  Those are the figures for the past seven years.  I know it may be argued that costs have risen during this time and that an article bought seven years ago would cost considerably more today.  Everybody must agree, despite their bias and prejudices, working out those calculations, that £22.74 million would, without doubt, provide a great deal more, even at today's costs, than £9.03 million could possibly have provided back in 1960-61.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It can be seen that, despite all the difficulties we have to face, the increased money being provided in the present year is capable of doing more than has been done in any other year, under any Government whatsoever, in the history of this country.  Lest we might run away with the idea, as some people seem to do, that it is all very well to say we are giving an extra £5½ million for the present year but that it is not being provided by the local authorities, the amount provided from the Local Loans Fund to local authorities, for the first six months of this year, was £8 million, as against the figure of £7.5 million for the same period of last year.  It will also be <Col N="953" /> agreed that there was a bank strike this year, which amongst other things, probably slowed down the issue of money from the Local Loans Fund to local authorities.</P>
    <P>I can see no reason why there should be a continued hold up at this stage of any issue by the housing authority people.  It is through their own fault. I say this deliberately because of the fact that misrepresentation is so rife and misunderstanding is being projected so ably by so many people that this is injuring the minds of our people in regard to local authorities.  As I go along, I shall be replying to the various points.  The House will agree that to attempt to reply individually or in detail to all the points made by all the Deputies who have spoken during the course of the past seven days on this debate would not alone be impossible for me, but would be practically impossible for the House to tolerate.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Last week in this House there was permitted a disgraceful series of irrelevancies which had nothing whatsoever to do with this Bill.  The purpose of that procession of ridiculous statements, the perpetrator of which has just left the House, Deputy Dowling, was, it is known, to prevent discussion on another matter which has no relation to the subject matter of this Bill.  I want to protest against this group obstruction of the proceedings of Dáil Éireann.  If it were done with some degree of finesse, one would not complain.  I shall not comment upon the mental acumen of the person responsible for it.  We are open to that kind of criticism but one expects there should be some commonsense in the remarks made in the House. <Col N="956" /> The stream of rubbish to which we were subjected by Deputy Dowling, coupled with a great degree of what could be regarded as no more than personal insults to people like Deputy P.J. Burke, must be condemned.  If nobody else in this House will defend Deputy P.J. Burke, I will.</P>
    <P>It is not right to say that people put down questions in this House in a pretence that they are concerned about their constituents, in a pretence that they are concerned about unfinished estates.  Deputy P.J. Burke is concerned about unfinished estates and about his constituents.  I know, and I shared that concern with him for 30 years.  Therefore, I regard it as a mark of the deterioration of what was once a solid united Party&mdash;the soldiers, the army of destiny&mdash;that members of it, especially the younger members, come in here and make statements of a derogatory nature such as those made last week by Deputy Dowling which could only be applicable to Deputy P.J. Burke.  I want to condemn this action and to suggest to people such as Deputy Dowling and other first-termers here that they should have some respect for their elders, particularly in their own Party.</P>
    <P>This Bill was designed for a very simple purpose, that was, and is, to remedy a long-standing grievance which has been voiced on innumerable occasions by people who are purchasing houses in estates in the suburban area of this city.  I would add that it is a grievance no doubt shared throughout the country wherever houses are built in groups with the aids under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts.  This complaint of the people concerned is very simply stated. It is that developers and builders induce people to purchase houses and they are usually young people who have recently got married or young people about to get married.  They are not always but they usually are in that particular social group.  The rest are settled people who have saved laboriously over the years.  The developers and builders induce such people to purchase houses on the proposition, very often unspoken, but none the less implied, that the estates into which <Col N="957" /> they will move to live will be completed in such a fashion as will leave them with no complaint, as will leave them satisfied that every civilised amenity available to their neighbours throughout the city will be available to them.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy Clinton who listed the number of estates which existed in the suburban area of Dublin &mdash;a list supplied to him, I understand, by the planning authority&mdash;I think it was 30 in all&mdash;in which the developers and builders, either or both, have not carried out the basic requirements of putting the estates into such a condition as will enable the local authority, either the county council or the corporation, to take them over and maintain them.  Now it may be asked why do the local authority insist on this provision.  Why do the local authority not do whatever work is to be done, such as the completion of pathways and roadways or laneways, the piping of ditches, the clearing of open spaces? Why do the local authority not do all this work themselves and put such estates into a satisfactory condition for the people who live there?  The simple answer is, of course, and has been down the years, that this is an obligation which was originally undertaken by the developers of the estate and if the developers are permitted to depart from these estates without fulfilling these obligations then the expense of the completion falls upon the ratepayers with a consequential increase in the rates and this is unjust.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his reply suggested that it would not be equitable that in all such cases the original developer should be sought out and made to do this work because he instanced cases wherein there was no specific provision in the original planning permission that such work should be done.  He acknowledged the fact that there were many cases wherein it could be said that the obligation to complete estates was implied rather than written.  But in any event this whole problem was discussed pretty fully, I think, on the occasion of the introduction and the passage of the last Planning Act.  During that discussion the Minister assured <Col N="958" /> the House that in his view there was provision in the Act, legal power in the Act, to enable local authorities to pursue guilty developers who had not fulfilled their obligations and in the event of such developers still refusing to carry out what they had undertaken to do that local authorities, in the Minister's view, by reason of the 1963 Act, could move into the estate, do the work themselves, and proceed for recovery of the costs against the developer who had neglected to do it.</P>
    <P>This refers mainly to Dublin city. No doubt there are other areas affected but no area is affected to such an extent as Dublin city by reason of the fact that it has the largest population and that building of this kind has gone ahead over the last score of years in a fashion which cannot be paralleled or equalled anywhere else in the country. It is mainly a Dublin city problem and when you look at it you find that it is a Dublin County Council problem. The members of the county council whom I have had occasion to refer to for their, to my mind, not always great attention to the matter of housing and indeed whom I have had to criticise in fact for their inattention, to my mind, to this matter over the years, the members of the county council in this particular matter sought, following the Act, to make it effective and relieve the concern and the worry of the people living in these suburban estates by making section 35 of the Act work to have the estates completed.</P>
    <P>At this point the law agent of the county council advised that, whereas the Act seemed quite a suitable instrument for ensuring that such neglect on the part of the developer would not occur in the future, he could not feel certain that the provisions of the Act enabled the council to pursue developers or builders who had been neglectful in the past.  The Minister's answer to that in the course of his intervention on this Bill was that he still clung to his original view that section 35 did provide and does provide the power to enable the local authority to do what needs to be done, that is, to get the developers to fulfil their obligations or for the county council to come in and do the work <Col N="959" /> and then proceed against the developer for the cost.</P>
    <P>But, in fact, what is the position of members of a local authority?  Is their legal position not controlled and directed, if not by a specific regulation, certainly by custom and usage? Is it not a fact that members of a local authority must accept the advice of their law agent?  Or, on the other hand, if that is not so, is it not at least a fact that if the members of the local authority defy their law agent, reject his advice and instruct their legal representatives to proceed in court&mdash;and, if the local authority loses its action in court, there is an obligation on the Local Government auditor to impose a surcharge upon the members of the local authority and make them pay whatever loss there may be?</P>
    <P>This is the position, in my view, at any rate, and I have been a member of a local authority in Dublin and in Wicklow in other years&mdash;Dublin Corporation, Dublin County Council, Wicklow County Council and urban councils as well.  That has always been my belief and I have heard this fact stated many times.  That being the case, how can the Minister in conscience say, as he has said in answer to our arguments on this Bill, to Dublin County Council: &ldquo;Go ahead and bring a test case into court&rdquo; when, in fact, that must mean that the members of the local authority must act in defiance of the advice of their law agent?</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is quite right about provisions in some of our Local Government and Management Acts, that in regard to advice and warning notice by the manager, he has a statutory right in similar or in other circumstances.  He has the statutory right to say to the members that, in his opinion, if they do this it could involve cost over and above what it might have cost in any other shape or form and in this way can warn them that they may be surcharged.  If, after the manager's warning, they proceed to do what he has warned them against and the cost does arise, then it is up to the auditor, and the surcharge would fall on the members voting for a particular course. <Col N="960" /> If they were agreed unanimously, this would follow, but it does not follow in regard to the law agent, county engineer, architect, CMH or any other officer of that council.  It is the manager, and the manager only, who may warn you about that and prevent you from doing it by so warning you.</P>

      <P>Leaving aside the nonsense, the irrelevancies, the stuff that went on from people who do not know really what this is about and, leaving aside the begrudgers who say: <Col N="961" />&ldquo;We sympathise but this is not the way to do it&rdquo;, it seems that the difference between our position and that of the Minister's is that he says he has the power in the Act and a test case should be proceeded with.  I put the point of view, which I think is a very logical one, that members of the local authority will inevitably, in this situation, be told by the manager they have got to face the risk of surcharge if they go ahead with a test case, and the very word &ldquo;surcharge&rdquo; has a frightening effect upon all members of a local authority.  There may be some members who would be prepared to take that risk but I think the majority of members of any local authority would not.  Therefore, we find ourselves in what is called an impasse&mdash;an impossible position, at any rate.  We have asked the Minister to do a simple thing, to take the very simple intention of our Bill, and to alter, where necessary, the wording of section 35 in such a manner as to give it retrospective effect.</P>
      <P>A fear has been expressed by the Minister that there might be some injustice in our going after developers who may no longer be with us and whose legal heirs may not know the position of those who went before them and what they have done.  But this, I would suggest, does not really arise because, from what I know of the cases which we hear most about, as Deputies for the county, the developers and the builders in question &mdash;as far as one can discover&mdash;far from having departed from the earthly scene, are healthier, richer and happier than ever they were before.  We do not feel we are acting in any unjust way.  On the contrary, the burden of injustice lies heavily upon the unfortunate people who were induced, in the first instance, to buy these houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had a long tortured contribution by Deputy Davern here last week in his effort to keep the discussion going. He referred to a widow in Tipperary who, apparently, was a developer down there and who, if what we sought came about, would be harshly dealt with.  Of course it is a well-known political ploy that when in <Col N="962" /> doubt, you reach for a widow.  I do not think there are many widows really involved in this question.  On the contrary I think the people whom we are seeking to bring to a realisation of their obligations are people who are well fit to discharge these obligations.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Minister has left me or my colleague in this motion, Deputy Clinton, any choice but to put it to the issue.  We know, of course, what the inevitable outcome will be, but it should go on the records of the House that there is a very strong feeling in this matter, a feeling that it cannot be left, and should not be left, in this unsatisfactory condition, where-in the county council are adjured by the Minister to take legal steps in the courts.  This may prove costly and unsuccessful and may lead to a surcharge, if the advice of the law agent is rejected.  Of course, we must always remember the law's delay, that infuriating thing which has not changed very much since Shakespeare referred to it.  Allied, needless to say, with the insolence of office, the law's delays are sufficient to drive anyone into a condition of frustration.</P>
    <P>These are the things we have to think about.  Are they to be left in that way?  Even supposing the county council decided to flout the advice of the law agent and to go ahead to the courts, from the little experience I have had in dealing with those institutions, it would seem to me that at least a year would pass before it would come to a hearing.  God knows what vagaries the gentlemen on the Bench would take when dealing with the thing itself, and how much longer it might take to bring it to a final conclusion.</P>
    <P>The function of the Dáil in this situation should be to act to protect the many thousands&mdash;this matter does not affect just a handful of people but literally thousands&mdash;of very excellent citizens who are struggling against great odds and great difficulties to meet their obligations, to purchase their houses, and to educate their children, and who have to do those things surrounded by evidence of neglect on the part of the people from whom they bought their houses <Col N="963" /> in the first instance.  That is not good enough.</P>
    <P>We are the Parliament&mdash;allegedly democratic and I suppose as near to being democratic as it is possible to get in the kind of world in which we live, and at the stage of evolution at which we have arrived&mdash;and if Parliament has any meaning at all, it is there for the redress of grievances. Unfortunately, my experience has been that far from effecting the redress of grievances, its function has been interpreted very often by a majority of its Members as being the entrenchment of grievances, the justification of whatever the existing situation is, and resistance to change.  That is a misconception of Parliament and one to which we cannot subscribe in any circumstances.</P>
    <P>The Minister has given a very obvious display of this mentality in what he has said.  It would be quite simple to solve the problems of these people.  We could solve the problems of the people on whose behalf we are talking quite simply by amending the Bill.  The Minister says: &ldquo;No.  Go through the lengthy process of the law and at the end of it all, if I am proved <Col N="964" /> wrong, I will consider amending the law.&rdquo; Surely he realises that even if it were feasible to do that against the advice of the law agents of the local authorities, a considerable time would have elapsed&mdash;I would estimate it at anything from 12 months to two years &mdash;before it would be decided.</P>
    <P>God knows where we will all be in 12 months or two years.  I hope everyone will be here, but things are liable to occur to prevent that, as those of us who are in politics for some time well know.  The Minister may no longer have much concern with this problem two years from now: he may well have other concerns.  His horizons may have broadened to a far greater degree or they may have contracted. Who knows?  These are mere speculations, but one thing is certain: while we are here tonight, and for another week or two anyway, we bear the responsibility for this condition of affairs among our constituents.  It is our duty to try to remove this grievance, and with that in mind, I once more urge upon the Minister the acceptance of the Bill, and I ask him to put it into effect by amending section 35 of the Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are endeavouring to deal with a number of social and <Col N="967" /> economic evils and we shall deal with them all.  As I was attempting to explain, the purpose of my Bill is to deal with a serious social evil which has its roots in the Rent Restrictions Act of 1960 under which, for the first time, it became possible for wealthy land grabbers, rich entrepreneurs, builders with unlimited resources, to evict from their homes people who were in possession under tenancy or lease agreements for rents which, under our rent restrictions code, could vary from 5/-, 10/-, 15/- or perhaps 20/- a week.</P>
      <P>In many parts of the country people are living in such homes, small but suitable for their purposes, two, three or four-roomed dwellings, and paying rents of 5/-, 10/-, 15/- or 20/- or thereabouts, people who had every reasonable justification for believing that they could end their days on this earth in such homes having, under our socially enlightened legislation, a security of tenure in those homes.  However, the Rent Restrictions Act of 1960 abolished security of tenure for many people living in small homes under weekly tenancy agreements if the landlords' interests in the properties were purchased by property developers who could then evict the tenants by paying compensation set out in the Act as being not less than three years' rent.</P>
      <P>One does not have to be a higher mathematician to appreciate that three years' rent for a person paying a weekly rent of £1 will provide him with only £156, an utterly useless sum to secure alternative accommodation.  The courts have interpreted the clause in a variety of ways but even the most generous members of the judiciary have not been able to extend the permissive compensation clause in the 1960 Act beyond a figure for total compensation of £700 and it is only in extremely rare cases that compensation in the region of that figure has been paid.  In most cases the figure awarded has been from £300 to £400.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of this has been that many homes have been broken and that many people, most of them elderly, have been evicted from their homes and no provision has been made for them by way of alternative housing accommodation. <Col N="968" /> In 1960, the housing situation generally was bad.  During the past six years it has become intolerably worse.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Within the rules of order and the scope which I am permitted to justify asking the House to <Col N="969" /> give a First Reading to the Bill, I am setting out the reasons why there is an obligation on the House to give a First Reading to the Bill.  The housing situation now is totally different from what it was in 1960; it is now very much worse.  If in 1960 the House had regard, as I believe it had, to the housing situation as it then existed, there is an obligation on the House to have regard to the housing situation today.  In 1960, when the 1960 Rent Restrictions Act was passed, it was possible for people who were being evicted in Dublin city and elsewhere by developers to get alternative accommodation from the local authority, even though they might also get some monetary compensation from the landlord.</P>
      <P>Now the situation is that nobody will get alternative accommodation in Dublin city unless there are at least four persons in the family being evicted.  Indeed, at the time I tabled this Bill, no person could get alternative accommodation from Dublin Corporation if he were being evicted by a developer unless there were six people in the family, and until a month or so ago, there had to be five people in the family.  The present situation is that for the next two years no person being evicted by a private developer under the provisions of the Rent Restrictions Act of 1960 will get alternative housing from the local authority.  The result is that unless the Minister amends the 1960 legislation, we shall have further people rendered homeless and given as compensation an amount which would not even build them a garage, which would not even purchase them a caravan, in which to live for the remainder of their days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most of the people who are being evicted without alternative accommodation are elderly people, and there are many Members of this House&mdash; some of them I see opposite me&mdash; who are keenly aware of this great social problem.  It is many months since I first table this Bill.  Since then, unfortunately, many more people have been evicted.  Even with the best of goodwill and with efficient discharge of business, the Rent Restrictions Bill <Col N="970" /> which the Minister has introduced to the House cannot hope to be passed and come into law for at least a year, and even the Minister's Bill does not provide what I seek to provide with my Fine Gael colleague in this Bill.</P>
    <P>What we seek to provide is that no developer, no property owner, will be able to put a person out unless the court is satisfied that alternative accommodation reasonably suited to the residential and other needs of the tenant and his family is available in a dwelling at a rent similar to that of the dwelling out of which that person is being put.  Any member of this House who seriously and conscientiously considers the problem will agree that what we seek in this Bill is no more than what is reasonable, that if developers are to be permitted to develop&mdash;and it may be socially and economically desirable that they should&mdash;it should not be at the price of human misery and we should not entitle developers or anybody else to impose unnecessary hardship and unnecessary suffering. All we seek to do is to preserve the <i>status quo</i>.  We believe this is such a compelling matter, is so crucially urgent, that the Minister and the Government ought to accept this Bill.</P>
    <P>I think it is also fair to say that as a matter of principle, Deputies introducing Private Members' Bills ought to be allowed to have their Bills printed and circulated.  We are all here as equal members of a sovereign Parliament, whether we are Ministers or in the distinguished office of the Chair.  We are all here as equal representatives of the people and we ought to have equal right to have our proposals considered by Parliament. Therefore I urgently petition the Minister and the Government to permit this Bill, which is a simple one-page Bill, to be printed in order that it may be debated.  I believe that if the Whips were removed, this would be passed and that we would restore some degree of fair play to the less privileged members of the community who are deserving of the little protection which we are trying to give them here.</P>
    <P>If, on the other hand, the Minister and his colleagues refuse to give a First Reading to this Bill, refuse to <Col N="971" /> have it printed and refuse to have the principle which we seek to enshrine here put into practice, then they may as well themselves put their weight behind the crowbar and behind the sledgehammer and join with the developers in evicting those unfortunate people and destroying their homes in the autumn of their days.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I deplore very much the rather hysterical note introduced by Deputy Ryan into what should be a sensible discussion in regard to the possible reform of the rent code with a view to dealing with a problem which does exist to some extent but certainly not to the extent suggested by Deputy Ryan.  The reason the Government have opposed the Private Members' Bill is that we have a comprehensive piece of legislation involving substantial amendments of the Rent Restrictions Act, 1960, and that this legislation, the Rent Restrictions (Amendment) Bill, 1966, has been circulated and is on the Order Paper for Second Reading in the very near future.</P>
      <P>In my view, the introduction of this legislation renders it a rather futile exercise to have any full-scale debate on Deputy Ryan's Private Members' Bill, which, however well intentioned, deals with just one aspect, although it may be important to some people, of the whole rent code.  More particularly do the Government take the view that Deputy Ryan's Private Members' Bill should be opposed because we have gone to some pains to remedy to some degree&mdash;I will not say what we have embodied in section 9 of the Bill, which will be discussed shortly, meets his case completely but it is the most practical way of dealing with it&mdash;the problem with which Deputy Ryan has dealt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his remarks here this evening, Deputy Ryan has sought to suggest that in some way we could, by legislation in this Parliament, place the burden on the courts to obtain houses for the displaced tenants, such people who may lose accommodation in the interests of good estate management.  I do not think this is a practical proposition. <Col N="972" /> The point of view adumbrated by him was put to me by deputations whom I received in connection with the drafting of the Bill which is before the Oireachtas, but I cannot see in practice how the courts themselves could ensure that the alternative housing accommodation was available in the case of such dispossessed tenants.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister would allow me: that is a quotation from a previous Rent Restriction Act which had such a provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>In my view, the most practical way to approach the matter is contained in section 9 of the Government Bill before the House, which is an amendment of section 29 of the 1960 Act.  The reason why this amendment has been inserted is to go some of the way to meet the point made by Deputy Ryan.  I agree with him to this extent, that the compensation paid in many cases of possession being given in this type of case was not as adequate as I think it should have been or might have been.  It is with that end in view that we are now placing the onus on the court that in any such case where the house is being acquired in the interest of good management the tenant must now get such compensation which, without incurring hardship, will enable him to secure appropriate alternative accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The weakness in the 1960 Act was that it did not sufficiently define the amount of the compensation which would be paid to the tenant in the type of case mentioned by Deputy Ryan. We are now ensuring by this amendment in section 9 of the current Bill that this compensation which must be paid will be such compensation as will enable the tenant, without incurring hardship, to secure appropriate alternative accommodation as the court thinks proper.  So that we now place squarely the onus on the court to compensate the tenant to such extent that he can secure appropriate alternative accommodation elsewhere in the city. I take it that in that event it will be proper evidence to adduce the housing costs, the price of houses, the level <Col N="973" /> of rents, and so on, and that all of these valuation factors which can be adduced by an auctioneer or estate agent will be taken into consideration by the court and that the compensation which will enable the tenant to move from the house from which he is being dispossessed to equivalent accommodation&mdash;the sort of compensation which will mean to him that he will be able to obtain such alternative accommodation&mdash;will be taken into consideration by the court.  As the wording of my amendment to section 9 puts it, the tenant, without incurring hardship, will be able to secure appropriate alternative accommodation.  I think that this is a more practical way of dealing with the problem than Deputy Ryan's way.</P>
    <P>The original purpose of section 29 of the 1960 Act was to ensure that development would not be impeded. I agree that development must go ahead side by side with regard for the rights of the individual but, at the same time, this Oireachtas, and I think rightly so, in section 29 of the 1960 Act, decided to provide for a situation where possession of the dwelling is required in the interests of good estate management or for the erection of further dwellings or for the erection or extension of premises used for any business, trade or profession and in that sort of case it was decided that the landlord when he was prepared to pay compensation to the tenant, should get compensation precisely in the interests of development, precisely in the interests of providing further housing accommodation and in the interests of urban renewal, which is so important in this and every other city today that is bursting at the seams due to the modern way of life, congestion of traffic and housing generally.  That is the case in every big city in the world.</P>
    <P>The purpose of section 29 is to facilitate the housing redevelopment and renewal that will enable development to take place.  The only hardship that was done under that section &mdash;and this was adverted to by Deputy Ryan&mdash;was that the courts were not sufficiently obliged to compensate the tenant more fully so that he could <Col N="974" /> secure &ldquo;appropriate&rdquo;&mdash; as the phrase is&mdash;&ldquo;alternative accommodation&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We are now in the course of the present Bill before the Dáil rectifying that situation and ensuring that while development will continue under section 29 of the 1960 Act such development must have regard to the rights of the individual and that the individual tenant must be protected. This is a weakness that arose due to narrow court decisions, if you like, since 1960, whereby the fullest compensation that should have been paid in the case of each individual tenant was in a number of cases that have come to my notice not given and in my view the amendment incorporated in section 9 of the Bill which will be debated shortly goes the whole way to rectifying that situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>You may have more narrow court decisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Not if regard is had to the full reading of the amendment which, I think, is specific enough, that compensation to the tenant shall be such sum for the purpose of enabling the tenant, without incurring hardship, to secure appropriate alternative accommodation.  That is a much more practical way to go about it than placing the onus on the court actually to secure a house for the tenant or to ensure that alternative accommodation is available.  This, in practice, would not work out and I think Deputy Ryan, as a practising lawyer, should be aware that if in practice you are to get the court to do the work envisaged in section 29 of the 1960 Act, to be amended, and if the court is to do this work properly, you cannot have the onus placed on the court actually to secure the accommodation.  The court is not the Housing Section of the Dublin Corporation or a section of the Department of Local Government.  The only practical way in which the court can make any order in this sort of situation is in providing a monetary sum of compensation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If you think about it in depth, you will see that this is good commonsense, and that the wrong, the harm, the difficulty or the problem caused by <Col N="975" /> reason of an order which is in the general interests should be rectified by the fullest possible compensation which will enable the tenant, in the wording of the amendment, to secure appropriate alternative accommodation.</P>
    <P>If the Deputy thinks in depth about the matter and gets away from what one might call an over-hysterical approach to it, if he reasons it out rationally, I think he will agree, as I think the House will agree, that there is good sense in the Government's approach in asking the House to reject the First Reading of Deputy Ryan's Bill.  There is no point in a fruitless exercise, going through the Second, Committee and Report Stages in both Houses of the Oireachtas, when the very point made by Deputy Ryan can be dealt with when we are debating section 9 on the Committee Stages of the more comprehensive measure which the Government have placed before the House.  Deputy Ryan, in the Second Reading of that Bill, can give <Col N="976" /> notice to the House that he has the view which he has set out towards the Bill.  I do not think it is a practical view, I do not think it is possible to ask the courts to bear the burden which he suggests they should be made to bear. To put it bluntly, I do not think it would work.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ryan has the right to raise the point on the Second Stage of the Government Bill.  Further, he has the right to suggest an amendment to section 9, to suggest that, instead of amending section 29 of the 1960 Act as I am doing in section 9 of the 1966 Act, I should amend it in the manner set out by Deputy Ryan in his Private Members' Bill.  I do not think we should duplicate the work of the House to the extent of asking that we have a full-scale debate on a Private Members' Bill, which can be easily met by a Committee Stage discussion of section 9 of the Government Bill before the House.</P>

    <P>That a sum not exceeding £8,581,450 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1967, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Local Government, including Grants to Local Authorities, Grants and other expenses in connection with Housing, and Miscellaneous Grants, including certain Grants-in-Aid.&mdash;(Minister for Local Government.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney) Neil T. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I was saying when the debate adjourned, I can see no reason why there should be any continued hold-up at this stage of the issue to any housing authority of moneys except it be through their own fault. Many individual points were raised on this matter.  I shall attempt to reply to them although to try to cover in a detailed way all the points raised by each individual Deputy who spoke on this matter would probably take too much time.  If there are left, when I have finished, any points that any Deputies feel they should have got a reply to, but did not, I should be glad if they would let me know and I shall give them a written reply in as much detail as I can.  The point I think I should also make in a general sort of way is that there have been cases of local authorities being over-rigid in their outpayments of moneys under the various heads of housing, whether it be loans, grants, or what you will. Some local authorities were withholding payments, even though in some cases, they had money to their credit, apparently, under other accounts.  They were withholding money, and rigidly and over-rigidly saying, in effect: &ldquo;We do not have any money in that account and, therefore, we cannot pay this account,&rdquo; although they had money in other accounts which was not used and was not working.  This we have tried to eliminate where we came across it and I think it can be said that we were successful in some cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other general comment I should like to make is that there are no tenders for housing schemes before my Department&mdash;none whatever&mdash;held up at this moment.  I also have, despite that, some reserves of money on hands which will be used in the best possible way, as the demands may arise of which I yet have not the details.  However, having said that, I think it must <Col N="979" /> be recognised by all &mdash; despite Deputy Larkin's fears that I was raising too many difficulties I think in a certain way&mdash;that the demand for housing is such that, in the circumstances of today, we have not enough money to do all the building we should like to do as quickly as we should like to do it.</P>
    <P>It is, without doubt, an essential requirement and prerequisite, indeed, to the getting of moneys for housing in the future that there must be prepared and should be prepared a proper short-term and long-term building programme. I know that some Deputies have scorned this idea.  They have asked what is the point when we are not getting built what we need to build at the moment.  However, unless local authorities, in which many Members of this House have great influence, in an orderly way survey and draw up a realistic building programme then our case and the case of all of us in local government housing is weakened in so far as our just demands for money out of the central pool are concerned unless we can show our needs realistically and the necessary speed of such a programme to liquidate these needs.  Then we can make a real effort to establish our claim for whatever share of money is justly due to us for the rehousing of our people.</P>
    <P>I appeal to all Deputies who are members of local authorities, where these local authorities have not been doing this surveying and programming up to the present or have been lacking in any way in getting on with the work, to encourage these local authorities to do this very necessary exercise which will be far better and pay far better dividends and house far more people in the long run than going around and telling the people that there is no money for anything when, in fact, that is not the truth.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is a typical example of the kind of case I am talking about.  I have already indicated the facts to the Deputy and to the House.  The facts and figures are there.  For those who have the <Col N="980" /> belief which Deputy Murphy has expressed, I advocated earlier that they should examine the facts and figures. If they have not done that, then God help them if they still feel as Deputy Murphy just now indicated he feels.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given the facts tonight to bear it out that there is more money going into housing this year than ever went into it, in any other year, under any Government since the State was founded.  This is a fact.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It would fit Deputies far better, who have this notion, to go to their local authorities and help them to get their programmes and surveys done and to send them to me when we can utilise them to build up our case for the fair share of money that will be available in this and in future years to build more houses more quickly for more of our people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mention has already been made of lack of confidence.  Indeed, great play was made, even tonight and this afternoon of the lack of activity in the building industry.  This is a matter about which I have very great concern for the simple reason that if we do not maintain building activity at a fairly reasonable level and try to wipe out the ups and downs of building, which is something we have known for very many years, then what will happen is what we have already experienced after the 1956 debacle in so far as housebuilding was concerned and it will take us years to re-establish building and win back the building contractors who have fled from us or gone out of business.  It is necessary for the well-being of housebuilding in the future that we try in every way we possibly can to maintain the building industry in a fairly good state, even though the difficulties of finding the money to do all the work we want to do are still with us.  If we allow the <Col N="981" /> building industry to disintegrate, as it did ten years ago&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>To come to the specific points made, there were charges that successive Fianna Fáil Governments have been lacking in progress so far as house-building is concerned.  Carefully selected statistics were quoted, selected to suit the arguments advanced.  That, of course, is a freedom enjoyed by every Deputy sitting in this House and I am sure the House will not take it amiss if I find now that there are statistics to support the opposite argument that Fianna Fáil have a record going back to their first appearance as a Government in this House which is second to none, a record that the much-lauded and much-vaunted Governments&mdash;no matter by what name one describes them, there is bound to be someone who will take exception but, for want of a better name, I will identify them as the two Coalition Governments&mdash;never came near to achieving.  As I said, carefully selected statistics are trotted out designed to convey the impression that Fianna Fáil <Col N="983" /> Governments have not been doing their share in relation to housing.  If we look at housing activity as a whole, which is what we must do, we find that in 1965-66, the year of the great blight in building, according to the Opposition, the number of buildings completed, reconstructed, or improved by the installation of water, sewerage, etc., totalled 27,717.  Compare that with 15,498 in 1953-54, 15,724 in 1954-55, and 16,791 in 1955-56.  In relation to the latter figure, it was Fianna Fáil who had to meet the bill when they returned to office in March, 1957.</P>

I have been honest in all my statements in regard to this matter, and I will continue to be honest in the future, as I have been in the past, notwithstanding Deputy Fitzpatrick's interjection earlier when I included him in the litany of those who said I was not being frank and honest; Deputy Fitzpatrick excused himself then by saying it was not this year's statement he was criticising but last year's.</P>

      <P>The Deputy and I can have our own little rows, but this is a question of being charged with being untruthful, with not being frank with the House on this year's Estimate. When I said that earlier, the Deputy interjected twice to clear himself of any such charge in respect of this year and I have now quoted four extracts from his speech which cannot be taken to mean anything other than that he joins with those who say I have not been frank with the House.</P>

      <P>The overall figures I have already quoted of 27,717 houses built, reconstructed or having had services added for 1965-66, can be compared with the figures for as recently as 1962.  Do not mind the other disastrous years which I quoted, when everything was supposed to be well and when, according to Deputy Dillon, we had more houses than people in Dublin. Leaving those years aside, I think we can really get from 1962 the picture that under a Fianna Fáil Government, with the help of the community at large, and through the local authorities, and despite the bad taste of ten years ago left by the then Coalition Government, we have been making very good progress, but it is progress which is <Col N="986" /> not sufficiently rapid to satisfy the Fianna Fáil Government, the Fianna Fáil Party, or the present Minister for Local Government.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon said that we had more houses than there were people and this would seem to indicate that the Coalition had overbuilt, that they had built ahead of the needs and had been going out into the highways and by-ways saying: &ldquo;Come on into town; there are houses for you and work for you&rdquo;.  Of course, that was not the case. During these three years, culminating in the 1956-57 episode with which we are all too familiar, the people fled out of Dublin in such numbers that there were more houses than people.  In other words, there was a scarcity of people.  Nothing that Deputies on the opposite side can say can take away from that.  The situation today is that we are short of houses, that there is a scarcity of houses, but we have more people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I told the Deputy that if I answered the charge of getting them not to spend money and said that I had not had them in the Department, I knew the Deputy would make the charge that I should have had them in.  I knew I could not be right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point was that housing finances were held up because no money was available this year.  The money allocated for new housing proposals was allocated on the basis of tender proposals.  There is no doubt that where no tender proposals were before us, and in some cases where no new tenders were proposed, there was no carry-over of commitments of work in progress, it was quite obvious we were not going to allocate money to those who had no proposals and who had nothing in train.  It is not only true that I held up money to those local authorities but I am continuing <Col N="988" /> to hold it up and will continue to hold it up so that I can divert it to local authorities who are building or have plans on tender to build and to whom we say: &ldquo;Go ahead.&rdquo;  Is it not much more sensible, when the amount of money is not unlimited, that we should use it for building and not for promises to build, where local authorities have no proposals and no work in progress from last year?</P>
    <P>The amount of money available for local authority houses, believe it or not, is £11¾ million approximately and &mdash; this is something Deputies should take note of &mdash; this is in addition to the £4.6 million already issued in respect of the first five months.  That is despite all the claims that there is no money going out for houses and despite the fact that the banks were closed for three months out of those five months. That is not bad against the charge that we were giving no money&mdash;&mdash;</P>

In that year of no shortage of money and when, inside and outside this House and in every way possible, my Department and I pushed the local authorities to build, there was no lack of enthusiasm and yet the amount of money in that year was £6.8 million, and it will be £11.75 million this year of shortage and in this year of blight <Col N="989" /> about which we have heard so much in the past fortnight.</P>

      <P>Other charges made were that housing work to the extent of £81,000 in Cork could not start, that there is a serious problem in the towns of Laois and Offaly, that the Portarlington scheme was not going ahead, that only eight out of 12 houses are going ahead in Cashel, that a bad situation exists in the town of Cahir.  One would think this was a sort of bad weather report before a hurricane.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I will arrive at West Cork in my own time.  The position in regard to the Portarlington housing scheme, which has been criticised here, is that, not through any action of mine, but through unforeseen circumstances, the contract for the scheme has been withdrawn and the scheme has had to be re-advertised.  I did not get after the contractor, in case anybody should suggest it, to withdraw the scheme: he pulled out of his own accord.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Cashel proposal, it was said that only eight out of 12 houses had been sanctioned.  It would be hard to sanction the 12 houses when only proposals for eight were received.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Probably Deputy Hogan is a bad influence.  Deputy Davern has not been long here.  I did not hear him, but I know Deputy Hogan criticised this scheme and said that I sanctioned only eight out of 12 houses for this very historic town.  I could only sanction eight houses because only proposals for that number of houses were sent up.</P>
      <P>Bad conditions in Clonmel and Cahir were mentioned.  Clonmel, as far as housing in this bad year is concerned, is going well.  If I may say so, without being smug, if every other town were going as well, they would be doing very well.  There are 38 houses in progress here, a further 24 are planned, plus 44 houses through NBA schemes.  If you add those figures up, you will find that Clonmel is getting on very satisfactorily with regard to the 90 estimated at the moment.  That figure of 90 will go up as the town of Clonmel continues to expand.</P>
      <P>As regards Cahir, a major scheme is planned there.  The lay-out was submitted on 20th September, 1966.  It is being examined at the moment.  Therefore, do not tax me with over-delay there until we have over-delayed it. We are examining it and it has been in only since 20th September.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, with regard to Tipperary South, we were told we built only 15 cottages this year, that they needed £300,000 and only got £30,000.  My information is that the council estimated for 38 houses in South Tipperary this year, although, according to the statement made in this House, they built only 15.  Tipperary South were allocated £39,000 this year, not the figure of £30,000, as has been mentioned. A figure of £9,000 of that was already in respect of work committed and £30,000 in respect of new work. A supplementary allocation of £20,000 was given to them in respect of tender <Col N="992" /> proposals on hands at that particular time.  Might I add that there is no question, even in the mind of the most rabid house builder in South Tipperary, that £300,000 is in fact needed.  That is a fairy tale, wherever it came from. Taking everything as it stands, we have all the tenders on hands disposed of and cleared.  What more could any county want than to have all their tenders in and cleared?  They are in the process of starting to build many more than the 15 houses which the Deputy complained about.</P>
    <P>As regards Waterford, Deputy Kyne stated that 68 needed re-housing.  I would like to say, for Deputy Kyne's information, that in so far as housing money is concerned, they may not be able to spend all the money they have got.  They still have £70,000 to spend on this very necessary work this year. My only fear is that they may not spend it.  It still does not add any more houses there but it indicates that they are incapable of spending the whole allocation they have got.</P>
    <P>It was mentioned that North Cork cannot go ahead with four cottages in Buttevant.  There is good news for this group in Cork.  A supplementary grant will be given for this scheme and also for two rural cottages.  Therefore, their claim will be met.  The Swords housing scheme was mentioned and also a scheme in Drogheda and Dundalk.  The Swords scheme is doing very well.  I am sure Deputies who speak about the lack of money in Swords, and who bleated loudly about this for months last year, will be very gratified to know that the scheme is going ahead so well and that there will actually be 40 houses completed for that group in this financial year.  The county council are to start, or have started, on all approved schemes this year.  I cannot go further at this juncture than to say that all the approved schemes are about to start or have started in County Dublin during this present financial year.</P>
    <P>The suggestion of slowing down work in the schemes in the Falls Road area of Dundalk is not borne out by the facts.  There was a carry-over in the March estimate of £29,000 and £60,000 in Dundalk and I should imagine these <Col N="993" /> are normal features of the yearly workings of any of our local authorities. Records are there to show the carry-over of moneys from the last day of March to the first day of April and that local authorities should start work that costs money.  It is possible that they need more money.  We might be able to provide it, particularly if the local authority are showing signs that they will spend their allocation. If they have any other proposals within a local authority then this money would find its way from one part of the country to the other, to give to one and take from others who are not, in fact, playing the ball.</P>
    <P>There are no building proposals, despite the charge made, from Carlow. It is alleged that Carlow local authority are awaiting sanction for 60 to 70 houses.  I have no building proposals in respect of Carlow.  Tenders have been submitted for 54 houses in the Carlow urban area and 26 in the Carlow rural area and, again, a further allocation will be considered if further tenders are submitted.  Granting sanction for proposals for a grants scheme for 60 to 70 houses in Carlow is at present under examination.  So, the activities in Carlow are not only going at this present pace with 60 to 70 houses, but it is quite possible that the tempo will improve rather than diminish.  I am sure that the Deputy who claimed that we are holding up 60 to 70 houses in Carlow will be happy to know that this is, in fact, somewhat of a fairy tale and is not borne out by the facts.</P>
    <P>It has been said that there is shuffling up and down between the Department of Local Government and the local authorities.  Many Deputies dealt with this aspect and are blaming the Department of Local Government for this.  Not only are some of them blaming the Department but they are saying it is purposely manipulated by me and by my Department in order to delay schemes because, otherwise, we would be embarrassed because we have not the money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to this very general allegation, we find that, rather than adding to red tape, in recent years in the Department of Local Government and strangling the local authorities' activities by manipulation of the so-called red tape procedure, the reverse, in fact, has been the case as is known to those who are sufficiently well versed and interested in their local activities in their county councils.  They know that, in fact, we have been cutting down what was traditionally regarded as a procedure through which these various schemes had to go up and down several times to my Department.</P>
      <P>Sanction is not required for the acquisition of suitable sites.  Maybe this is information for the Deputies who complained.  If so, I hope they will take note of it.  Sanction is not required for the advertisement of tenders. This, again, is probably somewhat new but some of the Deputies who are new may not yet have caught up with it. Sanction to tender is a formality these days, unless the amount of the tender exceeds by 10 per cent the amount of the estimated cost, the normally accepted average price.  If it exceeds by 10 per cent, then I can say that particular tender is in trouble and will be held up and is not backed unless there is reason given for this disparity in prices in regard to that particular tender.  I have not upheld that sort of tender but I should add that the number of tenders that exceed the estimated amount by more than 10 per cent is not a big percentage of the total numbe we have in a year and, therefore, the existence of delay in this regard is not great and it has not caused this trouble, which has given rise to all the criticism I have had, of shuffling up and down to the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Local engineers should be able to cope with the provision of services such as for housing, and so on.  Local <Col N="995" /> engineers are, by and large, coping with the situation and the records of my Department this year, and for some considerable time past, are cut, and have been cut to the minimum. There has been a drastic reduction and I think the best thing to do if you do believe it is to go to the local engineer and ask what are his instructions in regard to acquiring sites in a particular locality.  He does not have to come to me with facts and satisfy me that there are 50 houses needed in a particular town.  This is something that is his prerogative and which he is entitled to determine.</P>
    <P>In so far as the selection of sites is concerned, the local engineer, the county engineer, the assistant engineer and all the technical people in the local authorities do not have to say they were looking at a bit of land, that it would be all right and would I send somebody down and tell them what I thought.  If they send a proposal regarding the extent of a scheme on a site which they have duly selected, and are satisfied with, and the manager indicates there is need for 50 houses in that particular site the visits by my Department there and the documentation are cut to the minimum.  We only have to see them once if they are in order.  We go down no more.</P>

What I would like to say is that if Deputy Fitzpatrick, amongst others, did not really say what he meant when he spoke, and I have shown that what he did say he did not mean, or, rather, could not have meant, and the evidence just disproves that he could possibly have meant it, the only motive I can attribute to him and those who now want to make my speech is that they want it to suit <Col N="1000" /> what they said even though the facts disprove what they said.  This is only human nature.  It is natural.</P>
      <P>At any rate the situation in regard to this red tape is vastly improved compared with previous years, including the years we hear boasted of, the years of the great activities in building. In those years there was an abundance of red tape, if that is what we want to describe it as.  There was an abundance of it ten, 20 and 30 years ago.  Yet we hear Deputies boasting of the great activities in those ten, 12 or 15 years, despite the fact that red tape was in very much greater abundance than it is now.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>There was this other matter, then, of alleged delays in clearing housing proposals and the delay in a 28-house <Col N="1001" /> scheme at Douglas &mdash; that is Cork, too. The Douglas scheme is an experimental one, for those who may not be aware of it, and being an experimental type of scheme, it needed much more careful consideration than the ordinary, normal, orthodox scheme.  Therefore, if there has been what would appear to be a greater delay than usual in this case, it was not a usual thing.  The scheme was experimental and those who sent it up would be the last to deny that.</P>
    <P>Kilbrogan &mdash; sanction of tender for two rural cottages.  Sanction of tender was held up by the council who decided to have the work carried out on the basis of their allocation.  It was they who held up this until they decided what they were going to do in relation to all the various schemes. I did not hold them up.  We could go right on down along the various schemes.  The Borris scheme in Carlow &mdash; we find that plans for this scheme are approved and that money will be considered to be made available when we get the tender proposals.</P>
    <P>We could go on and on following these little hares or rabbits raised by various people in the House, but when I have finished, I am sure that I will still have made no impression on a certain hard core of prejudiced, biased people who will not see, regardless of what is in front of them.  I would have hoped that by referring in brief to the few cases I have mentioned, and probably omitted a great number I might talk about, to a reasonable few in the Opposition, we will have indicated to them that they need not pay a great deal of heed to the story of the diehards.  They need not mind the diehards so much.  In fact, things are not at all as bad as the diehards say; not nearly as bad as the diehards would like them to be, and that indeed things are going ahead.</P>

    <P>Dublin city housing&mdash;this is a matter <Col N="1002" /> in which we should all be interested, whether or not we belong to the city. It is our capital city.  It has been stated here that it will be seven to eight years before the corporation can get the 7,000 to 8,000 houses now required built and that during each of those seven or eight years, 3,000 to 4,000 families will go on the waiting list.  Of course, there were references to the appalling housing conditions in Dublin. This was the general trend of debate, particularly from Dublin Opposition Deputies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>And I would say I do not actually believe the statements made here, the gist of which I have just quoted, despite the fact that I do not want to minimise the situation.  I do not agree with these figures, that it will take the Corporation of Dublin seven or eight years to house 7,000 to 8,000 families and that there will be 3,000 or 4,000 added to the waiting list during those years.  These are exaggerated figures, no matter under what heading one considers them.  But while saying they are exaggerated, again I do not want, by so refuting those figures, to be taken as indicating that we have not a housing problem in Dublin.  We have a big housing problem in Dublin and it looks as though we are going to continue to have a sizeable housing problem in Dublin for as many years as we can see ahead, for the simple reason that, regardless of how we may proceed and succeed in housing those who are in need of it today and try to cater for next year and the year after, this city&mdash;according to all the predictions and projections we are now hearing from various learned people&mdash;will grow very fast in the next 20 years and this growth will add seriously to the burden already being carried by the local authorities in Dublin city and county.  It will put <Col N="1003" /> all of us to the pin of our collar to wipe out the backlog of bad housing which undoubtedly exists in Dublin, and has existed in Dublin over a great number of years, despite all that has been said about having too many houses at one time.</P>
      <P>Houses have a habit of getting worse each year.  This is something we cannot control.  We can arrest the decline of houses; we can arrest the growth of obsolescence; but we cannot prevent it and, therefore, we have got to build for a backlog which already exists.  We have to build for higher standards than are now being demanded; we have got to build for an influx of people from outside this city and we have got to build for the natural growth of population within this city.  All of these things will confront this city, the county of Dublin and the Government of all these years ahead with a very heavy recurring annual problem of putting more and more millions into housing in order to do this job really effectively.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be an increasing demand for these houses, which is a very big factor in any programme or in any provision of funds or capital we may decide to provide.  We have to realise that the moaning and groaning being done by certain Deputies in this House about the situation in Dublin city is not helping the position; it is probably not harming it to any great degree but it certainly is not helping the provision of houses in this city.  It is sad to listen to; in fact, it becomes somewhat boring after a while, and indeed it could well&mdash;if it continues in the volume we have been hearing &mdash; cause certain people in the public service today, elected members and others, to say: &ldquo;We have had enough of this; we cannot listen to this any more; let the moaners and the groaners take over and let them moan and groan together&rdquo;.  Of course, the more that happens the fewer houses will be built.  I have a message for those <Col N="1004" /> people, that is, that they should stop moaning and groaning and get around and do something useful.</P>

      <P>It is true that there is a serious housing situation in Dublin and that there will be a serious housing situation in Dublin for a considerable time to come.  Even if we met the present backlog and the estimated demands, there will still be a big demand for houses in Dublin in future years.  Dublin, any more than any other part of the country, could not <Col N="1005" /> have escaped to some degree some discomfiture in its building programme as a result of the credit squeeze and the shortage of credit of which we are all quite well aware.

I do not think that Deputy McAuliffe's assessment of the situation in regard to such a statement by me is correct, and in any event I do not regard mentioning it for the first time as a condemnation of what I may have said.</P>
      <P>The situation is that the discomfiture so far as Dublin housing activities are concerned is fortunately cushioned to quite a considerable degree&mdash;in fact, I would say to a full degree &mdash; by the operations now in progress at Ballymun. I am not suggesting that I foresaw this cushioning in Ballymun for an event such as this.  Ballymun started under far different circumstances.  It is true to say that the operation in Ballymun will, during the present financial year, relieve the discomfiture in the Dublin housing situation to a very considerable extent and, in fact, I would say, will relieve it completely. They are lucky in this respect, despite the fact that the situation is tough so far as housing demands in the city are concerned.</P>

    <P>Capital allocation to Dublin makes very interesting reading.  It is somewhat similar to the overall figure I <Col N="1006" /> have already given, starting off this year with £11,750,000 for the country as a whole, and tapering back to £4.6 million or £6.8 million five or six years ago.  In regard to capital allocation in Dublin, in 1966-67, we have allocated £6.365 million compared with £4.932 million in 1965-66, compared with £3.13 million in 1964-65, compared with £1.8 million in 1963-64.</P>

      <P>The complaints about lack of progress in regard to Dublin city housing which were made by various Deputies were common to the debate and were the same complaints of a general kind as were made in regard to housing as a whole.  I mentioned this earlier and I should not have done so because I meant to deal with it when I was dealing with Dublin, but it was mentioned by Deputy Dillon and Deputy Dunne.  I do not know how Deputy Dunne came into this. Probably it was not Deputy Seán Dunne.  It is likely that there is another Deputy Dunne over there somewhere, when he is here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon and Deputy Dunne, Deputy Dunne and Deputy Dillon, between the two of them, said there were more houses in Dublin than there were people in 1957.  As I said, I mentioned this earlier and I did not intend <Col N="1007" /> to deal with it until I was dealing with Dublin but Deputy Dillon's flamboyant statements sometimes come into my mind.  However, let me repeat that scarcity of people to fill the houses in 1957 was what we suffered from then. Perhaps other members of the House do not agree, but I believe that was not a good situation.  Deputy Dillon made it sound as if so many houses were provided by the Coalition Government in their three years that they really had the housing problem in Dublin city, of all places, solved.  Of course, that is not a true reading, as any sensible, sane and reasonable person must agree.  Scarcity of people was really the cause, rather than a surplus of houses.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon and those who support him should not hold out as a line of reasoning&mdash;if you can call it a line of reasoning &mdash; that so many houses were unoccupied in Dublin in 1957 that to all intents and purposes, they had overtaken the housing problem, solved it, and had houses to spare. That is what we get from Deputy Dillon ten years after the event.  He does not learn.  Age does not help him in any way.  In fact, if anything, it would seem to have the reverse effect on him.  I do not hold that to be a good solution and therefore I am not going to follow that line.  I want to put that on record, lest it might be thought that I was bamboozled by one of the statements which he has a peculiar habit of making and repeating until he ultimately believes them himself. I want to make sure that I can go back and read that I have committed myself as being against that sort of thing, against clearing the people out of Dublin city in order to solve the housing problem.</P>

The Deputy's Party was then in Government with the housing position solved to the degree that they could have devoted the money surplus, which obviously they must have had, to the preservation of houses, taking people out of dangerous ones and putting them into good ones for which they had no tenants and they could have knocked down the old ones.  That is what the Deputy's Party should have been doing then.  Houses just do not become bad overnight&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I want to warm all Parties, aspiring to Government, to keep clear of this folly in which Fine Gael participated: let them not be misled by the propaganda of Deputy Dillon today who boasts of having solved the housing problem in Dublin when the facts are that they cleared the people out of it and then had too many houses.  At the same time, they did not spend their spare time, when they had no more houses to build, in looking after houses that were already aged at that time and becoming decayed and obsolete to the degree that they did fall down and they did kill people.

Before then and on every Estimate&mdash;God knows I have been concerned in quite a few Local Government Estimates in succession&mdash;I have been, and am, on record both in opening and closing Estimate debates times without number up to 18 months ago, as advocating a greater speeding-up by local authorities of all housing programmes and emphasising the need that was there to be met and that they should assess this need in the detail required to frame proper programmes both in the long and the short-term.</P>
      <P>For Deputy Fitzpatrick to come in and upset the train of thought aroused in me by Deputy Tully's interjection is inclined to be confusing.  I know it would not be his intention to confuse through the interjection of another Deputy but to talk in this way about telling the House of the number of houses started this year as against the number of houses in progress and the houses completed, one must know the number of houses finished last year, the number in progress this year and at the beginning of last year, the number of houses in progress at the beginning of this year and at the end of the year and the number of houses completed at the end of this year.  When you get all those figures, I can tell the Deputy he will see that there is more to it than asking smart questions and trying to get answers that could ultimately be used against the factual argument I am making in regard to the actual programme of housing for this city of Dublin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>We have over 4,000 houses in progress and a completion rate that is the highest since 1956-57. That was the year about which we are all forced to hear a lot in regard to housing.  That was the great year, to use the Opposition phrase.  I now tell them that this year we have completed <Col N="1013" /> more houses than in any year since that great year.  Despite that, we hear complaints that the bottom is falling out of the housing industry, that everybody in it will be out of work.  If that is so, how, in relation to housing, are we back to the position of 1955-56? If that is so, we should have more houses than people for them because if what the Opposition say is true, the people would have gone from the city and more houses would be available for those who stayed.</P>
      <P>This has not happened.  It is entirely a story of the Opposition that the building industry has collapsed, that the tradesmen have gone away.  This is not true, and the Deputies well know it.  I think they are slightly disappointed that it is not true and that it will not come true, simply because we in Fianna Fáil are concerned not only about building houses but about keeping the people here to put into them and are also concerned to ensure that the building industry, which is vital to the economy, is kept in operation to the best of our ability by the importation into it of the capital with which to build new houses and to reconstruct existing houses.  So long as we can do that, we shall not lose out as the Government in 1956 lost out when the people who occupied houses in this city had to flee.</P>

Deputy Maurice Dockrell, a very sane, sensible Dublin man who knows what he is talking about, pointed out that Dublin has done more to re-house its citizens than any other capital city in the world.  Dublin certainly has done a great job during the years, despite the criticisms we may make from time to time.  It has done a terrific job, measured against the efforts in any other city of comparable size in Europe or elsewhere.</P>

      <P>In 1932, there were 18,000 families of six to 14 living in single rooms.  Surely we must congratulate Dublin City Council on the work that has been done since then, not only to reduce greatly that figure but to get to the stage, in these allegedly very bad times of shortage of money and high demand for housing,  <Col N="1019" /> that we can generally rehouse the family of five persons to a room?

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>At the same time, when successive Fianna Fáil Governments are criticised for lack of progress in housing, all the factors must be taken into consideration.  It must be realised that Dublin city has grown almost 100 per cent since 1932, that with nearly only half the population now to be served, there were then 18,000 families of six to 14 to a room living in the city.  Standards in housing accommodation have improved tremendously since then.  They are not to be compared with what was good enough for the working-class people in those days, but we have got to the stage at which we are dealing with families of five to one room.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a great deal of abuse here from some of the Cork and Limerick Deputies to the effect that the Minister had broken faith with the corporations of Cork and Limerick in regard to the building of houses.  I am supposed to have put those projects on the long finger.  There was criticism from Deputy Barrett about the Glenryan-Assumption Road scheme and the completion of the St. Finbarr's Avenue scheme.  I went down to Cork and Limerick to meet the members of the two city councils to try to impress on them that the pace at which they were then building houses in both of these cities was not a rate or in numbers sufficient to satisfy me or them or, above all, to satisfy the needs of the people of Cork and Limerick.  After discussing the matter, first in Limerick and later in Cork, with the members of the two corporations, it was agreed in Limerick that the number of houses then estimated to be needed that were surplus, but only those that were regarded as surplus, to the total number that they themselves by traditional means could provide, should be undertaken by me in a joint scheme with Cork, if we got Cork to play ball. <Col N="1020" /> Either before I left Limerick or subsequently, we found that the estimated surplus which they themselves could not build by traditional means was about 800 houses.</P>
    <P>I went to Cork and found that the Cork Corporation were not at all as quick on the ball or, indeed, might I say, on the uptake, in this matter of getting their surplus requirements built by an outside agency, while they themselves were fully occupied with what they considered they were capable of doing by traditional means.  There were lengthy discussions in Cork with the members of the corporation at that time.  It was six months later that Cork Corporation agreed that they would take from me, provided for them through some agency, 1,800 dwellings if we could provide them, in addition to the 800 I had hoped to provide in Limerick.  The 1,800 and the 800 represented 2,600 houses stated to be surplus to what the two corporations admitted they themselves were capable of providing by normal traditional methods and which if we did not do them, would not be done.</P>
    <P>Now I am charged with falling down on this job, with bad faith, with letting Cork and Limerick down.  It is charged that I never had any intention of doing anything about it, that I went there to keep them off my door by diverting their attention by suggesting that I would build these houses for them and that I foresaw that there would be a shortage of money in 1965 and 1966.  Those who attribute foresight of that nature to me really do me an honour I do not deserve because, not only did I not foresee that when I went to Limerick and Cork, but there is not a man in this House who foresaw it, nor is there anybody outside, in financial or other circles, who foresaw it and gave any warning of it. Therefore, this argument that I went down there armed with this foresight that we would not have the money and would be embarrassed by Cork and Limerick in 1966 is all eyewash.  The least one can say about it is that it is eyewash.  One could say more and be uncharitable possibly by saying that it is dishonest criticism and a dishonest construction put on a situation <Col N="1021" /> that was in fact as I have indicated up to the point that I had left off.</P>
    <P>To go further, far from these schemes being put on the long finger, these schemes were brought by me to the point of advertisement for proposers to do both jobs in those two cities, whether by system or industrialised methods, and that advertisement was drafted and is still waiting, but not put away, for the Government's approval when they see that the situation is such that money can be got for this particular project, additional to all the other money that we are now spending on housing and all the other services in this State.  So soon as the Government believe that that situation has arrived, this advertisement will go into the papers and we will get under way in Cork and Limerick so surely and as well as we got under way, despite all the doubts, in Ballymun, in regard to the 3,000 houses there only a short couple of years ago.</P>
    <P>Of those people who say that I am hindering housing, that I have done various things to slow down housing, I ask: would they ever take a clear look at themselves, take a clear look at the situation, compare my performance in this Government with that of any other Minister in any other Government?  While I may have my shortcomings and badly compare in many respects, the one thing that no other Minister can ever say or have said of him is that he went out of the Custom House to build houses for the local authorities over and above the number they themselves were able to provide.  This is a fact and the better the Deputies opposite know it, the less stupid will they sound when they charge me with obstructing housing in this city or this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already done that.  To get back to this matter of Cork and Limerick, let me say again that, just as in Dublin, so soon as I can get the clearance of the Government, in their wisdom, to go ahead and to do this supplementary building work in these two cities, so soon will I go. Believe me, it is no pleasure to me that I cannot go.  It is not my wish that I have not gone.  Indeed, I only wish that I could now go but the fact is that we must face the situation as it is, that we are not in a position to say &ldquo;Go&rdquo; at this stage in respect of these supplementary schemes and that we are doing everything we can to ensure that the ordinary normal traditional building operatives of this country will continue to be employed here at home in whatever building operations we can make available to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is terribly important.  Any diversion of any of that money beyond what has already been diverted into Ballymun should not take place until we can do it without endangering traditional building and the work of <Col N="1024" /> building operatives in this country. That is only commonsense.  While people may wish to charge me with bad faith and putting things on the long finger, I want to put it on record that that is the overall situation.  If they want to do that, they are welcome to do so, but anybody who stops to think will not believe them.  The ultimate situation will be rectified.  I hope, by me as Minister for Local Government.  I hope I will be around to do this job when the money becomes available in sufficient quantity to allow it to be done without jeopardising the traditional builder and building operatives.  I hope that will not be too long delayed.  Do not go away with the idea that I deliberately misled Cork and Limerick.  That is not true. It is absolutely unbelievable to say that I did it in order to prevent them building houses.  It is not sustained by the facts.  I will carry out what I agreed to do as soon as the money becomes available in a quantity that will not jeopardise traditional house building operations.</P>
    <P>Limerick city has its problems; Cork has its problems; Dublin has its problems.  There is not a county that has not got housing problems.  Lest anybody might think the Parliamentary Secretary, who was taken up on this statement the other day, may have been taking a line I do not agree with, I want to say we will always have housing problems in this country.  I hope we will because as soon as we reach the point where there is no longer a housing problem so sure will we have reached the point where we are on our way out as a nation.  It is when we are growing, and when the pains of this growth are making themselves felt as is happening today, that our housing problems become acute and there are difficulties for us to meet.  There will always be housing problems in this country until we are on our way out.  That is the only time the housing problem will ever be completely solved in any country.</P>
    <P>To Deputy Dillon and those who would jeer at what the Parliamentary Secretary said, those trying to give the impression that this was an entirely wild statement, I want to make that <Col N="1025" /> qualification.  Not just tonight but 100 times already I have made this qualification. I have done so so often that Deputy Dillon or any other Deputy should be under no illusion as to what was the full implication of the statement I made.  The Parliamentary Secretary would have made the qualification except that Deputy Dillon in his usual astute Parliamentary way interjected something and diverted the Parliamentary Secretary from qualifying the statement I had just made.  This is not a bad situation to be in.  It is better that we should have a housing problem on our hands as a result of the growth of our economy and of our activity in the country than have the situation of stagnation and a constricting population.  In regard to the situation Deputy Dillon so proudly boasted of, only in the reverse way to us, a scarcity of people in Dublin and too many houses because there are too few people&mdash;when that happens we shall have the housing problem solved in Deputy Dillon's way but not the Fianna Fáil way or the way of any progressive thinking person in any Party in this House or outside.</P>

      <P>It was said here last Thursday that three or four years ago it was estimated it would take 250 years to solve the housing problem.  It is now said the housing schemes planned by the county council have failed because the Department and the Government have not provided sufficient money.  The August 1966 assessment of needs in Donegal was 2,387 houses in all.  There were 798 dwellings or the makings of them&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is only the well-off ones who can march off to Dublin. Other farmers are working.  As I was saying there are 798 houses at various stages or the makings of them; 45 are in progress, 185 in tender, 132 planned and 436 with sites acquired or being acquired.  But this is not enough.  It has not been possible in Donegal to avoid some effects of the shortage of capital which has hit our overall progressive programme during the present year.  Nevertheless, the planning of schemes is being pushed ahead with in Donegal, as I have advocated it should be in every other local authority.  If you do not have plans you cannot get on the wagon when it comes with more cash, as it assuredly will.  Then the blame will be thrown on the Department that they are holding things up, whereas, in fact, it will be due to the ineptitude and stupidity of certain people and certain councils influencing them to the point that they will not plan for tomorrow and the day after which is the wise thing to do in housebuilding at any time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Donegal County Council are not held up at this moment on any scheme for the lack of money.  This is the situation.  It is not the only county with that situation.  I will go further and say the programme they have adopted, and which we were told <Col N="1027" /> about in this House, was to a large degree pressed upon them by the Minister for Local Government, that is myself.  We took the unprecedented step not very long ago of sending to the council offices in Lifford officers of the Department to try to help them assess their own needs, prepare what might be regarded as a reasonable annual building programme and to advise them of the administrative and technical personnel that would be required to enable them to carry out this programme, which, to say the least, we had a little bit to do with.</P>
    <P>As far as a hold up in the work is concerned, this is not borne out by the facts.  Indeed, the reverse is true. Were it not for the Minister and his Department there would be fewer houses built in Donegal than at present. It was because of the downward trend in the output of houses in that county, of which I have intimate knowledge, as to housing needs and many other things, after trying to get them to adopt a programme, I took the unusual step of getting my officials to try to help them to assess their needs, to adopt a programme of a reasonable size related to that and to set up a working organisation, administrative and technical, capable of carrying out the programme of the size that had been decided upon.  Several little points were raised in regard to this: I am sure they were not raised in criticism only.</P>
    <P>It was said that only £1,000 was allocated to the urban district council of Letterkenny and that only £2,000 was allocated to the Buncrana Urban District Council for local authority housing in this present year and that only £36,000 was allocated to Donegal County Council for their entire local authority housing programme for the present year.  In so far as the £1,000 and the £2,000 allocated to the urban district councils of Buncrana and Letterkenny are concerned, this is true. The allocations were made (1) on the basis of the commitments in regard to work already in progress coming in on 1st April from last year and (2) on the basis of the new work proposed by way of tenders in my Department. There was no new work from either. <Col N="1028" /> of these two urban district councils and the £1,000 and the £2,000 were allocated in respect of commitments already entered into or spent in the previous year.  In regard to the £3,000, therefore, to the two urban district councils, there is no question that this is the only money we would give them. It is the only money for which they themselves, on the housing side, had in fact fulfilled the obligation by way of demand in having specific tenders before us.  Therefore, they did not come in for new works moneys and therefore it was £1,000 and £2,000 respectively, in respect of previous works.</P>
    <P>The sum of £36,000 was complained of as being an inadequate provision for the overall County Donegal local authority housing scheme in this year. The total capital allocation to Donegal County Council for local authority housing is almost four and a half times £36,000, standing, as it does, at a figure of £158,500, which I think the House will agree is fairly far in advance of the figure of £36,000 complained of. It is four and a half times the amount which was allegedly coming in.</P>

There are no building proposals from Donegal County Council before my Department at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>If and when other proposals are received, consideration will be given to some supplementary allocation, as I promised in all other cases, to try to meet any of these new proposals. It has been stated that there was in the Donegal County Council one Fianna Fáil councillor who objected to the Lifford housing scheme which, incidentally, is scheme No. 3 or <Col N="1029" /> No. 4 since I started walking around Lifford and first came to it.  Nevertheless, it was said that there had been objection to this scheme being done there and that, in preference to it, instead of building a scheme in Lifford, there should be built scattered isolated houses throughout the country for the farming community.  As far as I know, in fact, the council tendered proposals for the 12 houses and the 14 sites for Lifford were approved as long ago as 18th August, 1966.</P>
      <P>The scheme complained of as having been held up by me, on the one hand, or by the attitude of the Fianna Fáil people on the council, on the other hand, has been approved since 18th August, 1966, and I presume should have started and, if it has not started, it is not my fault, nor is it my job to go there and blow the whistle to get the boys to start work.  This is the job of the local authority and the Deputy who made the complaint in this House is a member of that council.  He now knows that the scheme has been approved for almost the past two months and no doubt he will see that the necessary steps are taken to start it forthwith and not to have us in the position that money may be unspent in Donegal, particularly in Lifford, in regard to houses they badly need and for the erection of which they have been given the green light to go ahead. Let us hope they will go ahead with it now and that Donegal Deputies will ensure that whatever steps are necessary to get the contractor going on the site will be taken, and taken forthwith.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Now, in so far as the indication and the direction are concerned, it is also very near the truth that there was shown in Milford at that time a possible layout of up to 50 houses on a site that had been purchased by the National Building Agency in the town of Milford at my request because the council up there had great difficulty in finding a site for more than 16 houses.  They had, at that stage, a compulsory purchase order before me for over a year for 16 houses.  The general consensus of opinion was that it was a bad site and inadequate to the degree that there were at least 36 or 40 houses needed rather than 16.  When this particular site became available through the building agency it was offered to Donegal County Council.  The display layout&mdash;and it was only one of a number which I am sure was capable of being done on the same site&mdash;was also indicated ultimately to the council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The site was offered to the council. The offer of the National Building Agency was that here now is a site, here is a specimen layout and we, the Building Agency, are prepared to build the houses on it for Donegal County Council.  Between one thing and another, Donegal County Council came to accept that this was a fairly good arrangement.  For the benefit of the Deputy who, I know, is most interested in this particular scheme, I should like to say that, at this moment, there are under active consideration tenders for this scheme of 36 houses in Milford on this site, by and large roughly as outlined in the sketch seen in Milford before the last election.  I do not think there is anything wrong with this.  The performance will match the promise.  The Deputy was complaining that the promise was great and that the performance was not.  I hope that, before the next election, the promise will be quite evident to have been kept and I have no doubt: that it will.  Therefore, I am sure, again, that this news will make happy <Col N="1031" /> the Deputy who had the grave misgivings that the promises of Fianna Fáil in the last election will not be lived up to.  They are, in fact.  I can assure the Deputy that they will be and that the concrete evidence by way of houses will be there before the election next June, not the one after that.</P>

    <P>Procedural delays have been complained of in Donegal.  It has been said that the sending of an inspector to a site and the examination of the plans are a waste of time.

That is one change that has been made and what the Deputy complained about is no longer the case.  If any Deputy becomes aware that this is not being practised or, for some reason, cannot be put into practice in Donegal, I should like him to get in touch with me so that I may discover the cause of the trouble <Col N="1032" /> because it is not of my or my Department's making, and we have taken every opportunity to try to cut down in Donegal, and in every other county, a procedure that has been the subject of complaint for very many years. We have got rid of a great deal of it and those who complain about it, if they are not already aware of the change, will be glad now to learn that it has been changed.</P>
    <P>I could say, however, that in 95 per cent of the cases in which a site is suitable in the opinion of the housing authority&mdash;not in my opinion, or my Department's opinion, or the engineer's opinion, but in the opinion of the housing authority&mdash;no inspection is made by my Department at tender stage, which is the only stage at which rural cottages are submitted to my Department.  If the housing authority is satisfied as to the site we do not go out to inspect.  We are quite happy to let them go ahead.  The tender examination is normally only a formality, except in cases where the price is greater than ten per cent over estimate.  In such cases we have to take note that there is something abnormal.  That may be explained away on investigation.  In other cases, it may be high pricing, or lack of competition, or something like that. Obviously we cannot pay exorbitant prices no matter how deserving that might seem to be because, if one does it in one case, one will have to do it in all.  That would not be fair. We have to be careful.  I am sure the House appreciates why we have to be careful and it is not for the sake of delay we hold things up.  In fact, we hold very few up because the number is not very great.</P>
    <P>It has been said here that local authorities would be the better of more committees.  I do not tend in any way to advise local authorities on the breakdown of their functions. Different counties have a different approach and different methods of operation.  Committees are not always called by the same name in different counties.  However, if the setting up of committees would mean greater participation by elected representatives in the work of the local authority, then I am all for having anything that brings <Col N="1033" /> local elected representatives into more intimate and greater contact with the work of their authority.  The greater detail the local councillor can participate in the better I should like it.  If, at any time, I might have any function in regard to the setting-up of such committees, I can assure the House that I shall not be hard to persuade, if the decision rests with me as to whether or not a committee should be set up. I cannot see committees doing any harm.  Committees have done a great deal of good and are doing a great deal of good today.  If an extension of committees is thought wise I do not see any reason why that extension should not occur.</P>
    <P>It has been argued that houses should be provided for newly-weds. I fully agree with those sentiments but we cannot abandon those who have been condemned to live in unfit conditions for many years.  We cannot forget those who have suffered long because of bad housing conditions.  We cannot jettison these in favour of newly-weds.  I am all for building for newly-weds, but we must keep our priorities right.  By all means let us do what we can for these brave young people but we must always remember that those living in unfit and condemned homes today were in their turn brave young people ten, 15 and 20 years ago.  We must attend to their needs before we grow too emotional and come to care too much about the chap who got married yesterday or proposes to get married tomorrow. We must keep a balance.  Let us have a care for those who, perhaps still young, have already put in a fair purgatory in unfit and condemned housing.  Our primary function is to clear the unfit housing.  When we have done that we can begin looking around.  We will not have very far to look if it is a case of providing more housing.</P>
    <P>Let us do the job properly.  It is not yet complete.  We should make up our minds now not to dissipate our resources but to concentrate in greater degree on the eradication of the unfit homes we have.  The sooner we do that the sooner we will be able to get around to catering for other categories.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1034" /> There have been allegations of delays by Donegal County Council in regard to payments.  I am reluctant to talk about the county council when the person who makes the allegation happens to be a member of that council but, from the information I have, all I can say is that the council at this moment say there is now no delay in payments.  That may seem rather empty coming from me, when I am no longer a member of the council, to a Deputy who is in fact at present a member of the council.  There are no delays in payment.  Over £57,000 has been paid in grants from 1st April of this year to 31st August last.  The actual figure is £57,880.  Undoubtedly there has been some activity in payments.</P>
    <P>A further £65,000 issued in the same period from the Local Loans Fund. Deputy Fitzpatrick will be interested in this.  He asked if any money was coming.  In that same period in Donegal, £68,000 issued from the Local Loans Fund to the county council. There is an allocation of £115,000 in this year and £90,000 was issued from the Local Loans Fund in the last financial year.  Take note of that&mdash;£115,000 in this financial year and £90,000 issued last year.  So far as I can ascertain, no payment is outstanding in the Office of Public Works at the moment. In other words, there is nothing awaiting payment in the Office of Public Works so far as I know in respect of any claims made for loans or instalments of loans in respect of the Donegal County Council.  I have also sanctioned recently the raising of a £50,000 loan by the council from the Royal Liver Society.</P>
    <P>Taking all these together, things are not quite so bad as when the Deputy last inquired about them, although I have no doubt that the Deputy has up-to-date information, as he is quite near the council offices.  At the same time, his figures are not borne out by the information supplied to me by the same council.  All I can say is that if in fact he finds that the information is not true, he can come back to me and I will try to find out why it is not true.  Until that happens, I will take it that that is the truth of the story.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1035" /> It has also been asserted by a Deputy from Donegal that the manager up there should have the authority to decide who needs a house and to carry on the negotiations.  The fact is that the manager has this power. The manager decides on the need and he need not come to my Department until he has negotiated a price and has got tenders.  All this is open to the manager to do at the moment. If it helps by saying it again, I have said it, and the Deputy will probably relate it back, and if it is not happening, as I believe it is happening&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is only coming back to me now.  I remember what is at issue in Cavan.  It is true that a CPO was confirmed on 31st March last and apparently it was proposed to build 22 or 28 houses but the needs in Cavan are very much more than that.  Despite the fact that things are in a bad way down there, they do need more houses for more people. What they are doing I do not know.</P>

      <P>The site had to be compulsorily acquired, the order was confirmed and the number of houses which it was proposed to build appeared to my inspector, to whom it was referred, to be inadequate and to put it bluntly, a wasteful use of a site which is a commodity which is not too plentiful in Cavan and certainly not too plentiful on a voluntary basis.  We thought there was a possibility of utilising this site to accommodate 15 further houses and that this was not only a useful way <Col N="1036" /> of providing 15 additional houses but a way by which the overall cost of the total development works, because of the greater number, would have a lesser impact financially on the cost of each house related back to the taxpayer and ratepayer and would save us all money.  There have been further negotiations in Cavan and the Deputy will agree with me that it was a good thing that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There are cases in which, through no action on anybody's part, we come to know about things.  We get to know about things which it is not strictly the duty of any officer to find out.  It is also true that certain local authority officials, both technical and administrative, believe at times that it is a good thing and a help to them to contact my Department, if they are in some difficulty or doubt about something they are proposing to do.  I do not know whether it was for one or other of these reasons that this matter came to my knowledge but it is a very good thing that it did come to our knowledge, having been looked at by an inspector who reported back as he did, subsequent to the submission of the proposals on 12th July last, in regard to the inadequate number of houses on that site.  I do not know how it happened but I probably could get the details for the Deputy.</P>

On the other hand, it could be that a local official or technical official employed by the council felt that something might be done some other way and may have got in touch with one of my officials.

      <P>That is right.  As long as they are satisfied that the site is good and about the manager's opinion as to the need which exists, then they may send that up to us and that is all right.  Remember, the local official's reputation is based on his selection of the site and the manager's reputation is based on his calculation of need. However, I have no doubt that both will do their jobs well in ninety-nine cases out of one hundred and better than in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another allegation against me is that I am supposed to have complained that some plans for housing were too large and too elaborate.  What I want to do now is to clarify this outlook rather than to deny that I said it because I did say something to this effect but I may have put it in a rather unfortunate way.  It may have been taken up as meaning that we should fob off the public with any sort of standard house and that anything we <Col N="1038" /> could do at the moment could be drastically reduced and that anything was good enough.  This is not my intention and never was.  I would like it to be clear that no such inference as this should be drawn from the remarks made by me in my Estimate speech.  I have no intention of reducing standards or cutting back on the size of houses. Indeed, I am rather inclined to go in the opposite direction and probably would do so and would raise standards if it were possible to do so at the moment.  However, this is not the time for this upgrading of standards or upgrading of the size of houses in that the more we did of that today the fewer units we could produce.</P>
    <P>At the moment if we could produce more units of the standards and sizes we have been producing, we would be happier.  As I said, this is not the time to upgrade standards but nothing I have said should be taken to mean that I would be against the upgrading of standards.  We must get the best available from our resources.  I have always sought that large families should be catered for by large dwellings in proportion to their numbers. In other words, I want a proportion of bigger houses in all housing schemes, so that we can have different-sized families adequately housed.  We can then make the greatest utilisation of the resources we may have by providing big houses for big families and smaller houses for the smaller families. This is what I should like to see done. There is no wish on my part to cut down the size of houses.</P>
    <P>In recent schemes submitted for local authority dwellings for areas outside Dublin, it has been said that the costs were up to £3,300.  I do not think we can afford costs like that.  I do not believe that the tenants, ultimately, can afford to pay the rents or that the ratepayers who contribute from the rates, or the taxpayers who contribute from taxes, would be able to pay that sort of price for the standard house we normally build at the moment.  We have got to curtail that sort of exorbitant expenditure.  I am sure we will get the odd proposal which has costs as high as that.  I am sure the House will agree with me that when I get <Col N="1039" /> such proposals, if the costs are exorbitant, and even if those costs are justified by knobs put on the doors of the houses, we will take the knobs off and reduce the price.  This cannot be said to reduce the standard of the houses.  This is, in fact, the context in which I made the remark which may have been misinterpreted, and which I would like to correct.</P>
    <P>The rents of local authority housing have certainly become quite a topic in recent months.  I would like, at the outset, to take some of the outstanding criticisms that have been made and directed towards me in regard to this matter of increased rents.  We have Deputy Larkin, never a man to mince his words, coming out and saying that the Minister directed local authorities to increase rents.  Then we have Deputy Treacy who finds various ways to go about it, unlike Deputy Larkin who heads down and charges.  Deputy Treacy goes round and about; up and down, back and forth, in and out, but eventually comes right round to say that the Minister was trying to blackmail local authorities to increase rents, that rents were being used as a revenue-earning device.  He said a lot more which I shall quote later.  We then have other Deputies who also complain about this matter.  I do not agree with Deputy Treacy's statement that rent increases were regarded as a revenue earner.  People are entitled to take that view if they wish but I disagree when they attribute that view to me.</P>
    <P>The actual position in so far as rent increases are concerned is that I did not issue a direction to increase rents. I flatfootedly stand over this and shall continue to do so until such time as I issue such an instruction.  I have not issued any such instruction to increase rents.  I have asked for rent rationalisation, which is a different matter.  Rent rationalisation can mean rent reductions as much as rent increases.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister does not mean that usually.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Why does the Deputy not let the Minister decide what he <Col N="1040" /> means?  I know far better what I mean by what I say.  I would say the same thing with regard to the Deputy.  We will leave it at that and say that the rationalisation of rents means rent decreases as well as rent increases and it is the rationalisation of rents which I have called for.  Why have I done that?  I have done so because of the fact that on more than one occasion in this House I have indicated that there is a steady belief growing outside this House that there are people getting away with murder in the rents they are paying.  When rents are related to the incomes which those people and their families earn, there is certainly good reason for increasing them.  The people contribute towards the cost of those houses through rates and taxes, in order that those people, who are much better off in many cases, should not have to pay increases and can have houses at such low rents.</P>
      <P>Some of those people are living in houses which were never intended for them, even though they may be direct descendants of people who were the type for whom those houses were built in the first instance.  Their circumstances have changed so much since then that in many cases they should not be living in such houses at these low rents.  The changed circumstances have no doubt been caused by the improvement in the national economy over the years.  We must realise that some of those people are very well established and that they are far better off than those who have had to pay rates and taxes for those houses and also provide their own houses.  They should, therefore, be asked to pay rents at a much higher rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have said before that the local authorities should come in and examine the rents of those people and rationalise them.  They would then be able to reduce rents for some people who are unable to pay the rents asked of them.  In many cases the rents are not low enough for such people.  This, in my opinion, is the cause of some of our housing problems, which have not been eradicated after 34 years of very hard work.  This is one of the main reasons why our housing problem has not been solved, and this, in my opinion, warrants the rationalisation <Col N="1041" /> of rents.  In many towns some of the lowest rents are still too high for some poor people who have continued to live in unfit houses for the past couple of generations.  Those people cannot afford to pay higher rents.  The taxpayers and the ratepayers are unable to carry any more burdens.</P>
    <P>The local councils should, in my estimation, be able to say whether tenants, who are well off in their estimation, can be asked to pay more in order that those who cannot pay what they are being asked to pay can have their rents reduced.  My scale would be from zero to full rate.  This would mean that some of the very poor people would have to pay nothing while some of those who are very well off would have their rents greatly increased.  Where the people are poor, they should not have to pay.</P>
    <P>Until this is done by our local authorities and until it is done by rationalising the rents, making those who can afford to pay, pay, the local authorities are not doing their job or making a decent attempt to do their duty.  This is what I mean by rationalisation of rents and the people in the Opposition who want to make political Party capital can put that in their pipes and smoke it.  We are definitely neglecting the poor of this country who are still in some of our worst housing conditions.  The ratepayers will not be asked to pay more this year, and, as far as rents go&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I fully agree, and I would say that, pending installation of this desirable service, this particular type of house should not go on a differential rents scale.  Related to its lack of facilities, it should be on a different scale.  The overall principle of differential renting should apply and this should be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy M.P. Murphy amazes me: he is an amazing character anyway. We are all finding this out and every day we are finding out a little more. Deputy M.P. Murphy has one view; <Col N="1043" /> Deputy Larkin has another and, believe it or not, Deputy Treacy has a third view, and all put across to this House as being the Labour Party view.  If I am confused, forgive me, but I remember Deputy Treacy's opinions and I think he is a classical example.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party are a group of confused men.  Let us look at Deputy Treacy's contribution.  Deputy Treacy came down on the side of the principle of differential rents and&mdash;I am speaking from memory&mdash;made some claims about how useful he has been in getting the quality of the differential rents system in his town smoothed out, made better than it was before, made more streamlined than before&mdash; and full credit to Deputy Treacy for that.  However, a year ago Deputy Treacy attacked the differential rents system vehemently.  He could not say enough against it, and he has been converted in a year.  Not only that, and this is where Deputy M. P. Murphy and Deputy Larkin would help me a great deal&mdash;and indeed Deputies James Tully and Pattison as well&mdash;but he said that not only was he for differential rents at a rate different from that which I would apply but that this whole concept was something which I and Fianna Fáil were stealing from Labour, because years and years ago, before I came to this House, somebody in Labour had enunciated this type of scheme. I accept that you are not yes-men but you are confused men.  I am not criticising confusion, but I am being confused by the confusion of those over there.</P>
    <P>I have not got Deputy James Tully on my list but I am sure he is slightly at variance with the last version.  It is heartening to note Deputy Treacy's view now, he having been an out and out opponent of differential rents in <Col N="1044" /> any shape or form.  It would be worth noting what he had to say in last year's debate.  Within a year he has turned turtle, believes that it is the proper approach, that it is the right sort of system and that the way I would have it applied is wrong, but over and above that, away back somewhere, this was a Labour policy, a Labour scheme.  I say that Fianna Fáil are really the true Labour Party in this country.  While Labour claim to have initiated Labour policies, it is Fianna Fáil who put them into operation.  We are happy to do this, if Labour are happy and, if Labour are happy, Fine Gael are happy and that suits us all.</P>
