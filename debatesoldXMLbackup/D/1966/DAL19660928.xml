      <P>As regards the recent Ministerial meeting in Brussels with the EEC Commission, I would refer the Deputy to the reply I gave yesterday to questions about this meeting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The primary object of the recent visit to Rome by the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries was to discuss with the Italian Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Ireland's export trade in cattle and beef with Italy.  Since his return to Dublin the Minister has discussed with Irish cattle exporters the possibilities for exporting cattle to Italy, and with the Irish Fresh Meat Exporters' Society the possibilities of resuming exports of beef there.  Livestock exporters are now exploring further the commercial prospects for sending fat cattle and <Col N="174" /> young cattle to Italy and Irish meat exporters are sending some beef to test the Italian market again.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if the Government have any special steps in mind to assist western areas in view of the continuing decline in population as disclosed in recent census figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As from the beginning of November, there will be an increase in the rates of unemployment assistance, including the payments being made to smallholders in western areas under the new method of assessing means arising out of occupation of land in those areas.</P>
      <P>Small farmers in the western areas will benefit from the following measures introduced during the year by the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries: (a) the provision of extra farm building grants for piggeries, (b) the payment of a headage grant of £5 on sows, (c) a new scheme to help sheep-farmers, through payment of subsidies as an incentive to improve the quality and productivity of mountain flocks, (d) the launching of a special experimental scheme to investigate how far it is possible to establish viable farming systems in areas where extreme conditions prevail and (e) a scheme of loans at a specially subsidised interest rate of 2½ per cent to enable farmers to purchase dairy cattle, as well as interest-free loans for the purchase of nitrogenous fertilisers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The higher scale of grants available for industrial projects in the underdeveloped areas is a strong inducement towards the setting up of industries in the counties on the western seaboard. <Col N="176" /> An Foras Tionscal are putting in hands an industrial estate at Galway which will provide factory premises for renting or for sale in advance of specific industrial proposals.</P>
    <P>In the course of forthcoming debates on the Estimates for Departments, the Ministers concerned will detail other plans whereby, in conjunction with those I have mentioned, it is hoped to maintain and extend the improvement in population trends disclosed for certain western areas by the recent census.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Taoiseach realises that if the present depression in agricultural prices continues, those small farmers will have nothing to put into the buildings about which he is speaking?  They will not have a beast left because they will have to sell their cattle.</P>

    <P>4.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power if he will state the reason for increased ESB charges; and if from the increased revenue he will now take steps to abolish special service charges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers) Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>The reasons for the increased charges for electricity are given in the Electricity Supply Board's annual report for the year ended 31st <Col N="177" /> March, 1966 which was laid on the table of the House on 27th July, 1966. As the Deputy is aware, costs of materials and labour are mounting and because of these the Board consider that an increase in charges is necessary to enable it to fulfil its statutory obligation to balance annual revenue and expenditure.  In the circumstances, on 25th May last the Board applied to the Minister for Industry and Commerce under the Prices Acts for permission to increase prices by 7 per cent.  That Minister has now provisionally authorised the increase in prices, subject to review when the Prices Advisory Body, which he proposes to set up, has submitted its report.</P>
      <P>The question of special service charges for electricity has been dealt with by me on several occasions in the House.  I would refer the Deputy to column 21 of the Dáil Debates for 20th October, 1965 in which I gave a very full reply to a question on this subject. Charges of this kind are a universal feature of electricity tariffs and the Government have already gone as far as is reasonably practicable in reducing their incidence in this country.  The increased charges sought by the ESB are intended to bridge the gap between revenue and expenditure.  They would not, therefore, provide the Board with any surplus which would make it possible to abolish special service charges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to the fact that the Minister says that this increase is provisional from the information available to him, does he anticipate that there may be a decrease in this allowable percentage at the moment after the inquiry has taken place?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to prejudice the work to be done by the Prices Advisory Body.  There evidently is a <i>prima facie</i> case for raising charges.  In view of the fact that the vast majority of the population are electricity consumers, the Government consider that it would be a good thing for the Minister for Industry and Commerce to make an inquiry into the necessity for the increase.  I do not propose at this juncture to give any <Col N="178" /> further details or enlarge on the reasons already stated by the Board whereby prices had to be increased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the special service charges, would the Minister not agree that the imposition of these charges is a factor in reducing the population trend we have at the moment in rural areas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister also indicate why the procedure adopted was to allow the increase before the investigation by the Prices Advisory Body?  Why was the investigation not carried out before sanction for the increase was given?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>It was perfectly clear that there was a <i>prima facie</i> case for increasing the charges and also because the ESB make no profit and therefore there was no question of having to investigate the profit.  The ESB are directed by this House to bring revenue and expenditure into line, taking one year with another.  For this reason it was considered that there was a <i>prima facie</i> case for the increase.  That can be checked by the Prices Advisory Body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the special charges mainly hit people in remote districts, that is, the poor people of this country?  How does the Minister justify those special charges down through the years? Surely he will agree that this is a most unfair imposition on such people just because they happen to reside in remote or isolated areas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The loss incurred on rural consumption is £1,346,000.  It is affected by a subsidy from the urban areas.  There is already a contribution <Col N="179" /> enabling the price of electricity to be kept down.  Of 385,000 rural consumers, some 22,500 are paying the special service charges.  That is not a very large proportion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that he might be doing a good thing to keep the 22,000 in the areas they now reside in, if he made his contribution by abolishing the special service charges?</P>

The provision of electricity is now confined to such people.  Is the Minister aware that local residents who are clamouring to get this service to which they are entitled are left over until the foreigners have got supply?  Has the Minister any answer to that?</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Gibbons)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Central Bank could only replace soiled notes according as they were presented by the commercial banks.  The withdrawal from circulation of soiled notes was resumed by the commercial banks immediately they reopened and proceeded at a fairly rapid rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="180" /> Legal tender notes of the denominations of 10/-, £1 and £5 account for 90 per cent of the notes in circulation. In the month following the reopening of the banks, 7.3 million soiled notes of these denominations were withdrawn from circulation.  Of these, 4.3 million were not required to be replaced as they were surplus to normal circulation needs.  The remaining three million notes were replaced as to 58 per cent by new notes and the balance of 42 per cent by clean used notes.</P>

      <P>I am aware that the bridge at Cloonacanna has been closed to traffic for some years.  Plans for its replacement were approved by my Department in November, 1964 and the Mayo County Council have been free to proceed with the invitation of tenders for the carrying out of the work since then.  The council, who had been considering the possibility of financing this work by borrowing, decided in June last to revert to their original intention of undertaking the work with the aid of their annual <Col N="182" /> county road improvement grant, and a proposal to allocate a portion of their current year's grant to the work was formally approved by my Department on 4th August last.  The invitation of tenders for the work is a matter for the county council and I understand that arrangements are at present being made for the issue of the necessary advertisement.</P>

Their original allocation of £75,000 for 1966-67 in respect of supplementary grants and house-purchase loans was increased by £10,000 last month, and the council propose to spend £61,400 on supplementary grants in addition to a substantial credit balance which they had on hands at the end of March last.

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands if he will state in view of section 45 of the Land Act, 1965 whether it is now contemplated that the Land Commission will be retained as a permanent body; and, if so, what steps he proposes to take to consolidate the Land Purchase Acts, the Land Law Acts and the Congested Districts Board Acts at an early date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Moran)</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 45 was enacted to regulate the purchase of non-urban properties by non-citizens, in a situation of intense activity by the Government to improve <Col N="190" /> agrarian structures.  Progress at structural reform together with international developments generally may call for the review of section 45 after a period, and I would not wish to rely on it as an index for determining the duration of the Commission.</P>
      <P>While I readily concede that the consolidation of the various Land Acts would facilitate legal practitioners, this is a very specialised and complex code, the consolidation of which would absorb much time for which requisite specialist staff cannot be spared at present. The matter will be kept in mind, however, for attention when circumstances permit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose taking Questions Nos. 29 and 30 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The weakening of market prices for cattle recently as compared with the particularly good prices of the past year or two has been brought about by a number of special factors operating together which are outside our control and which have aggravated the normal seasonal decline in prices at this time of the year.  These factors are&mdash;slower demand for store cattle in Britain attributed partly to credit restrictions, the increased supplies of beef on the British market and the effects of the general economic situation there on consumer demand for beef, and the virtual closing of all the EEC markets to imports of cattle and beef because of seasonally heavier domestic supplies and higher import levies.  In addition, there have been <Col N="199" /> the after-effects both of the abnormally late Spring here which delayed the finishing of livestock and of the disruption of shipping facilities due to the British seamen's strike which left us with a substantial back-log of cattle to export.  None of these factors are, however, permanent, and it is important that they should not be allowed to cause any lack of confidence by farmers in the future of cattle production. While it is not possible to avoid fluctuations in an industry which is so dependent on exports as our cattle industry is, there can be no doubt but that the long-term export market outlook for the industry generally is basically sound.</P>
    <P>The Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement, which came into operation on 1st July, has provided an assured market outlet and put a floor under cattle and beef prices.  First there is the reduction in the waiting period for which Irish store cattle have to be held on British farms before qualifying for the British guarantee payments.  If the waiting period had not been reduced from three months to two months, Irish stores would certainly have to contend with a weaker demand from British farmers.  Also, the support by Britain for 25,000 tons of Irish carcase beef, which is provided under the Agreement and which the Government has undertaken to extend to any quantities of eligible beef in excess of that amount exported to Britain, has been supporting fat cattle prices here. Without these arrangements there can be no doubt that cattle prices here would be substantially lower under the present difficult conditions on export markets.  In order to help further to stabilise the market I introduced at the end of August, a special temporary scheme of headage payments on fat bullocks and heifers exported to Britain for immediate slaughter.  This scheme had an immediate effect in steadying the market.</P>
    <P>As regards the value of the Agreement with Britain in providing an assured market outlet for our cattle and beef, I would point out that our exports of cattle and beef to EEC <Col N="200" /> markets have been brought almost to a complete standstill by high duties and levies imposed by the EEC countries. On the other hand, as a result of the Agreement our exports of cattle and beef are guaranteed free entry into the UK market.</P>
    <P>Every effort is being made to stimulate exports of cattle and beef to markets abroad.  Some markets have been found to offer possibilities, especially for young cattle for further feeding, and these possibilities are being fully explored.  In the case of Britain, the assurances given last week by the British Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food regarding the availability of credit to British farmers should prove valuable in strengthening the demand for our stores.</P>
    <P>As I have already stated it is the view of international authorities that the long-term outlook for beef is sound and that export prospects are good. While there have been depressions in the cattle trade in the past, on no occasion has such a determined effort been made to cushion our producers against the effect of a downward cycle in external prices.  I wish to assure the House that I am very conscious of the difficulties which the present situation has created for all producers, that I have taken every step open to me which seems likely to improve the situation and that I shall keep the whole position under constant and anxious review and shall take any other additional measures which appear to be feasible and likely to improve matters further.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not now admit that the claim he made in January of this year was most extravagant, when he said that the Free Trade Area Agreement between this country and Britain would mean an extra £10 million per annum at the outset?  Does he still stick to that estimate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I would remind the Deputy that the Free Trade Area Agreement is only in operation approximately two months.  Furthermore, at that time I said that this Agreement would have a stabilising <Col N="201" /> effect on the market.  The thing to be borne in mind, in the present situation, is that the price of our cattle would be considerably worse, were it not for the operation of the provisions of the Agreement at this time.</P>

Does the Minister now <Col N="202" /> appreciate that as a result of that impression, which we now know to be false, many farmers withheld their cattle during the past months and now coming into winter are faced with the position that they must sell their cattle at greatly reduced prices, mainly as a result of our discussions here and the false impression created of the benefits &mdash;the so-called benefits&mdash;of the Free Trade Agreement?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries the amount paid in subsidies to meat factories this year under the guarantee scheme; and if he will arrange to have this subsidy paid to producers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose taking Questions Nos. 31 and 32 together.</P>
      <P>The amounts paid in subsidies from 1st January to 23rd September this year on exports of carcase beef, mutton and lamb were: carcase beef, £135,834 and carcase mutton and lamb, £6,646.</P>
      <P>When the operation of the subsidy system was being considered in July last in the context of support extended by Britain under the Free Trade Area Agreement to both beef and lamb, I had the system very fully reviewed and I decided to continue it on the basis operated for beef since February 1965. My reasons were&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(i)  an elaborate and expensive administrative organisation would have to be provided for making payments direct to producers and this would have to be maintained during periods when <Col N="206" /> no subsidy would be payable as happened in 1965 from early June to the end of November in the case of the guarantee payments on cattle and from late May to mid-July in the case of the guarantee payments on sheep.  This costly organisation could also be engaged for lengthy periods in sending out thousands of payments of very small sums to producers, especially to producers of sheep and lambs.</P>
    <P>(ii)  A high proportion of cattle and lambs, which on export as meat qualify for subsidy, is not sent direct to meat factories by producers.  The factories acquire much of their supplies at markets and from dealers and, in such cases, it would not be possible to arrange for payment of subsidy to the original producers.</P>
    <P>The subsidy can, of course, be obtained by any producers or groups of producers who themselves export fat cattle to Britain.</P>
    <P>The bulk of our cattle exports still consists of stores, which after fattening on British farms qualify for the full British deficiency payment.  I am of opinion that the combined operation of the three types of subsidy on our cattle, that is, on store cattle finished in Britain, on carcase beef exported to Britain, and on live fat cattle exported to Britain, works out to the direct advantage of our cattle producers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not making this suggestion more complicated than it actually is and making it appear more expensive than it would be in fact?  The Minister is aware that the Grain Board arranged for the return of the wheat levy to all farmers who produce wheat and this was done in a very short time and very inexpensively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the £4 headage.  What would be the difficulty in returning that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>We have to make sure it is paid on export cattle only and we can only do his at the point of export.  I want to assure the Deputy that I would much prefer to have these <Col N="207" /> subsidies paid direct to producers, and if I could devise some simple expedient or administrative machinery for doing so, I would be happy to adopt it, but I have examined the matter as carefully and thoroughly as I can and I cannot see any alternative to the present system for the reasons I have given.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy appreciate that we would need very elaborate administrative machinery to do this and throughout most of 1965, for instance, it would have nothing whatever to do because there would have been no payments to make as there was no subsidy payable?  At other times you would have this elaborate machinery paying out infinitesimal sums to individual producers.  Unless the present system turns out to be completely unsatisfactory, I think we should stay with it, but I have said to representatives of the producers who discussed the question with me many times that what we should do, I think, is allow the present system to operate for about 12 months and see how it works out in practice and then consider whether we should change.  We have in fact set up a working committee representative of all interests concerned to review the working of the subsidy scheme from time to time in this first trial period of 12 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that all this subsidy is finding its way back to the producers here because he will never get the producers to believe it is?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe it is; I have no reason to think otherwise.  If there is competition between meat factories for the supplies available, then the subsidy must be finding its way back to the producers.  The dead meat factories assure me they would much prefer a system of direct payment.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose taking Questions Nos. 33 and 34 together.</P>
      <P>I would refer the Deputies to what I said in replying to the debate on the Vote for Agriculture on 26th May last. I pointed out then that I consider there is a good case for the establishment of a suitable form of board in connection with meat export marketing.  The establishment of such a board, however, raises many issues, covering livestock as well as meat.  These issues are, at present, being examined and I shall announce my conclusions thereon in the near future.</P>
      <P>As Deputies are aware, I appointed a study group some time ago to investigate all aspects of our store cattle trade and the recommendations of this group will, of course, have a considerable bearing on what should be done in regard to that trade.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries if he is aware of the very serious fall in cattle and sheep prices which has adversely affected the farmers of County Mayo to the extent that many more families are forced to emigrate, and that as a result several homes have closed; and what steps he proposes to take to remedy this situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards cattle prices, I dealt fully with the position in my reply to Questions Nos. 29 and 30 by Deputies Corish and T. O'Donnell.</P>
      <P>While the market for sheep and lambs has been somewhat affected by the present export market situation for cattle and beef, fat lamb prices are only marginally below prices at this time last year.</P>
      <P>I would remind the Deputy that a number of important measures to benefit the sheep industry have been introduced in recent months.  The Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement provides for extension as from 1st July, 1966 of the British fatstock guarantee payments to 5,500 tons of Irish carcase mutton and lamb per annum and the Government have undertaken to support to the same extent any quantities of eligible mutton and lamb exported to Britain in excess of that quantity.  In addition, the Agreement provides for the reduction in the waiting period for which Irish store sheep and store lambs have to be held on UK farms before qualifying for the British fatstock guarantee payments and also for the abolition of the ¾d per lb. deduction from the guarantee payment in the case of store sheep and store lambs imported from this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a further help to sheep owners <Col N="212" /> including those in Western areas I introduced the Mountain Sheep Subsidy Schemes on 1st August.  The Wether Lamb Subsidy Scheme provides for payment of 10/- each on Blackface Mountain or Cheviot wether lambs sold off the hills and the Hogget Ewe Subsidy Scheme for payment of £1 each on Greyface and Half-bred hogget ewes produced from crossing Border Leicester rams with Blackface Mountain and Cheviot ewes.</P>
    <P>In conjunction with these schemes my Department undertook a comprehensive scheme of organising, advertising and promoting sheep sales.  Both of these schemes for this year were due to end on 30th September but I extended the period of operation of the Wether Lamb Subsidy Scheme to 15th October in order to assist flockowners in the marketing of their lambs, some of which have been backward because of the harsh spring.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that these various measures have contributed significantly to helping sheep and lamb producers in a difficult market situation and I think I should remind the Deputy that they are the first positive steps ever taken in this country to supplement the income of the sheep producer by direct Government action.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McLaughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I was dealing last night with the question of roads and particularly with the condition of our byroads and accommodation roads. Very often we as public representatives are approached by people anxious to get rural improvement scheme grants to enable them to make passable roads and laneways to their homes.  The result of the present failure of this scheme is that people are unable to repair their homes and consequently many of them are moving off to England.  That is a common picture in the west of Ireland.  As well, the collapse of this scheme has led to unemployment.  The scheme gave considerable employment to young men during the winter months, helping them, perhaps, to pay their rates and small debts.</P>
      <P>Only last week a young farmer called on me.  He lives on a small farm with his wife and family.  His rates are £34 a year and he is at his wits' end to know how he will pay his rates and at the same time maintain himself and his family.  Last year, that man could go to Manorhamilton or to some other local fair and get £30 to £35 for a young calf.  Today, the chances are that he might get £8 or £9 for a similar beast.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JosephMcLoughlin" hpid="Mr. McLaughlin Mr. McLaughlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McLaughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The chances are that he will get nobody to bid for it. That is the sad situation, despite all the Minister for Agriculture tells us about the cattle situation.  He said there is nothing to panic about.  There is a lot to panic about, as he would soon find out if he spent a short time in the west of Ireland.  He would see the number of young people leaving and would agree that the situation is not being exaggerated by us.  In order to keep our <Col N="215" /> young people at home the Government should concentrate on getting back the rural improvement scheme grants.  The loss of these grants has been the biggest blow to the farming community since I came into the Dáil.</P>
      <P>As I have said, our population in rural areas has been dwindling.  The recent census figures prove that the rural population is going down steadily and because of the way things are drifting, I am afraid it will decline further.  After nearly 50 years of native government, it is sad to have to admit that we are unable to provide homes for the destitute.  One of the things that will encourage our young people to stay at home is the provision of grants, small though they may be, to enable them to render passable the roads leading into their homes so that they will not have to travel on roads covered with potholes as their forbears had to do.  One could not take an ass and cart over some of these roads.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister to send his officials down to the west of Ireland to find out if what I am saying is true. It would be good business for the Minister to do what the Minister for Health did recently&mdash;to go into the country and hear the opinions of public representatives on the spot.  It would bring him more closely in touch with the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are approached often by people looking for driving licences and they say to us: &ldquo;Of course, we know we are not going to pass the first time anyhow&rdquo;.  It seems to be a well-known fact they are not going to pass the first time.  A young boy or girl is bound to be a bit nervous going before one of these inspectors.  Indeed, if many of us were put to the test, after our years of driving and while we are able to get by in traffic in our own way, we might find it difficult to pass it.  A boy or girl with a good record who shows reasonable proficiency in the test should get a licence.  It would give them that extra confidence when they go out driving on their own.  It is a further strain on them to have to travel to Sligo or some other centre and go before this inspector again.  I would ask <Col N="216" /> the Minister to consider giving a licence to a person who has made a reasonably good attempt in the test.</P>
    <P>As I said last night, it is time, after about 15 years, that there was an increase in reconstruction grants.  The farmer recently got a substantial increase in grant for a new house, but the man in the town, the cottier or whoever he may be is as much entitled to be considered at this stage because he must have a home as well as the farmer.</P>
    <P>We must face the fact that the cattle and sheep trade is very bad.  Not for a long time have calves and sheep had such low prices offered for them on the fair greens throughout the country. In any of these rural towns people will be seen hawking their few lambs or calves and trying to get somebody to take them away.  Since they have enjoyed better conditions heretofore, that is a sad thing, and in view of that the reconstruction grants should be improved.  It would also take a heavy burden off the councils, who have countless numbers coming before them under section 5, people who, if they got any encouragement in the ordinary course, would certainly not be appearing under section 5 but going ahead to the Department and getting their two grants.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister and his advisers have presented us with a very bulky document in introducing this Estimate, but, unfortunately, this document gives us no new information. Before we ever got it we were just as wise as we are after reading its 43 pages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having regard to the position in which the Department of Local Government found itself in the past year, one is inclined to sympathise with the Minister in the barrage of questions he had to face in this House from Deputies all over the country seeking money for housing grants, water grants, sanitary services and other services provided by the Department, and the poor Minister having no money to meet these demands.  Deputies in their turn were bombarded by constituents and by groups anxious to get services provided <Col N="217" /> in their localities.  Therefore, I would have genuine sympathy for the Minister were I not inclined to believe that to a great extent he is the author of his own misfortune.</P>
    <P>If the Minister had been more truthful and said here 12 months ago when all these questions were coming before him: &ldquo;Be easy with me.  I have not got the money.  The Government have not got the money.  The financial plans drawn up by the authors of <i>Closing the Gap</i> and all the other leaflets and booklets we have issued have gone haywire. We have made a mistake and we cannot give you the money.  Would you ever ask the people making representations to you to hold their hand until moneys become available?&rdquo; possibly the Irish people, being generous, would have agreed to hold their hand.  However, the Minister, instead of saying: &ldquo;I have not got the money,&rdquo; in conjunction with the Minister for Finance issued statements indicating that moneys would be available and implying they would be available in the very near future, when such moneys were not available and when both Ministers knew they would not be available in the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>Looking back over a few years we have the position of the Minister issuing circulars not only to all the local authorities in the country but to individual members of the local authorities, urging them to build houses, to proceed with their plans for the erection of houses, to proceed with their plans for piped water schemes. Incidentally, in regard to the circular submitted for piped water schemes, if I were to bring some of the circulars with me, which I do not usually do, I think the most notable one would be that showing the woman drawing two buckets of water from the well and indicating that that system was obsolete and that local authorities should go ahead and provide the modern service, a piped water supply.</P>
    <P>As a result, the local authorities, at great public expense, having regard to consultants' fees and other huge incidental expenses, drew up a number of major and minor schemes and had them ready for implementation, to find from the Department that no money <Col N="218" /> whatsoever was available.  Therefore, during the past year we have employed by local authorities a number of technical advisers who, due to the lack of money, have in my opinion, little or no work to do.  When the schemes cannot be implemented due to the shortage of money, even though these technical advisers must be paid, some of them must have a great deal of time on their hands.</P>
    <P>From listening to the various questions that have been asked in the House during the past 12 months, we know the position does not change very much, so far as shortage of funds is concerned, from one county to another.  We have had here from the 26 counties questions addressed to the Minister week after week from various Deputies seeking money for this or that scheme administered by the Department, with the same result, that they have to be put on the long finger.</P>
    <P>Cork County Council had a very anxious time in recent months owing to a shortage of money and the fact that local government grants could not be paid in time because the Minister for Finance would not release loans from the Local Loans Fund.  One would assume that the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Local Government in administering this fund would work jointly as a team and that one Department would help the other to go ahead with its programme of loans to approved borrowers for the erection of houses.</P>
    <P>In Cork&mdash;and I believe the position is no different there from the position in other districts&mdash;we had a very difficult time.  We had numerous letters from the Minister telling us that funds were not available and implying that they would be available in the near future but time has proved that that implication was completely false and incorrect.</P>
    <P>For the purposes of housing and sanitary services, Cork is divided into three districts&mdash;the northern, southern and western districts.  While I am in general conversant with the position in Cork county as a whole, I am sure there will be other speakers more conversant with the position obtaining in North and South Cork.  Therefore, I <Col N="219" /> do not propose to deal with these districts; rather will I confine myself to West Cork.  The position there is typical of that to be found in similar local authority areas throughout the country.</P>
    <P>In pursuance of the Minister's advice to provide water, sewerage and housing schemes, we set about the task as diligently as possible.  We promoted four relatively small housing schemes for execution this year.  There was one scheme at Ring for four houses, one at Timoleague for six houses, one at Dunmanway for eight houses and a scheme at Schull for six houses, with 16 rural cottages and 15 prefabricated houses. We felt that in view of the pressure on funds that relatively small demand for this year would meet our obligations in the matter of housing.  We considered that it was a small demand to make on the Department&mdash;24 non-municipal houses, 16 cottages and 15 prefabricated houses.</P>
    <P>We invited tenders for the four houses at Ring, to be told there was no money to build them and not to invite tenders for the others.  However, seeing that we were committed, we decided out of local sources and moneys on hand and on the basis of some rather distant promise obtained from the Department, to go ahead with the erection of the four houses at Ring but we had to abandon the others because there was no money there, as the Department made quite clear to us.</P>
    <P>The Cork County Council and the Western Committee and the other committees of the county council, jointly and individually, decided to meet the Minister and a deputation was formed by the council to meet the Minister to discuss local government services throughout the area.  The Minister would not meet a deputation from the premier body in Ireland, Cork County Council.  The request that the Minister should receive the deputation was renewed on no less than two occasions and each time the Minister refused.  Surely, the Minister was not justified in refusing to meet the deputation which desired to discuss the <Col N="220" /> housing and sanitary position in the county?</P>
    <P>In West Cork, at a great deal of expense, a piped water scheme, the Clonakilty regional scheme, was drawn up.  The estimated cost was more than £½ million.  Tenders were invited in anticipation that the money would be made available to implement the scheme.  These tenders were before a meeting in February of this year but we were informed by the Department that it was useless to accept a tender because we would get no money to meet the cost.  The council committee decided that no useful purpose would be served in opening the tenders when money was not available.  There were a number of subsequent discussions in connection with this scheme and special representations were made to the Department because it was appreciated that a number of contractors had been put to a great deal of expense and inconvenience in drawing up the necessary documents for a scheme of that magnitude, costing £½ million to £600,000.  We were put in that false position as a result of distorted statements emanating from the Minister and the Department of Local Government.</P>
    <P>There was another regional scheme for a district contiguous to Skibbereen, to cost about £¼ million.  That scheme could be ready for implementation now but it had to be deferred because no money was available for it.</P>
    <P>There was a scheme known as the Caheragh water scheme, at an estimated cost of £80,000, which had to be shelved owing to lack of funds. There were schemes sanctioned for two seaside resorts, the Goleen sewerage scheme and the Crookhaven water and sewerage scheme.  The desirability of these schemes was urged very strongly on the council but they had to be held over and have been held over for the past 12 months because of shortage of money.  In the Berehaven Peninsula, the Adrigole water scheme had to be held over.  In the Schull-Ballydehob area, the Rossbrin group scheme has been held up for want of money.</P>
    <P>It is clear, therefore, that the position in West Cork is that we are not <Col N="221" /> building any houses other than the four non-municipal houses this year, for the very good reason that we have no money to build them.  It has to be borne in mind that during the past eight or nine years the housing programme had nothing to commend it. Very few houses have been built.  In fact, within the past four or five years the only houses built were the 36 rural cottages.  That is a relatively small number.  Having regard to the overall position, we felt we were entitled to obtain the necessary grants and the necessary go ahead signal to carry out the schemes.  Unfortunately, the position is otherwise.  Despite all the speeches the Minister may make at dinners or festivities of one kind or another, the plain fact is that money is not available for housing and water and sewerage schemes, except to a very limited degree, at the present time.</P>
    <P>It was completely out of place for the Minister to exhort local authorities some few years ago to plan costly schemes when it was unlikely that money would be available for them. Possibly, at that time the Minister thought the money would be available. I believe this country has been plagued by economic experts, most of them resident in the Dublin area, who are able to draw up plans and to see into the future so far as finance is concerned and the Government have been misled by a number of what one might term these infallible persons.</P>

      <P>I have given briefly and concisely the position in West Cork.  I say, briefly and concisely, that the same position obtains in North and South Cork.  We had to get additional money there within the past few months in order to pay the debts due on last year's schemes, not to mind embarking on schemes for the coming year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Supplementary grants were referred to.  Deputy O'Hara mentioned that applicants in Mayo were waiting a year for these grants.  Despite the Minister's denial I agree that Deputy <Col N="222" /> O'Hara's assertion is likely to be true. The same position applies in Cork. In West Cork supplementary grants have not been paid since October, 1965, almost 12 months ago, for the very good reason that we could not raise any money to pay them.  Grants paid by the Department subsequent to 1st March last have not been met by the county council.  Indeed, it is only within the past six or seven weeks that we paid supplementary grants outstanding for almost 12 months.</P>
    <P>The position in respect of local authority and private housing, reconstruction and the provision of water and sewerage, whether public or private, has not been a rosy one during the past year.  We have a large number of schemes still awaiting execution.  If the Minister were present I would like to know from him, in a more truthful manner than the information he gave us during the past year, when we are likely to get money for these schemes. Is it likely that money will be available for schemes that have been approved this year after 1st April next?  Or are we going to get at the conclusion of this debate, because we are facing local elections, more rosy promises that more money will be made available this year for the hundreds of schemes awaiting completion? Are we going to be told that in order to placate the voters?</P>
    <P>I suggested at Cork County Council that in view of the magnitude of the problem in respect of housing and sanitary services, the Government should consider raising a public loan for the execution of the schemes already approved.  I know this Government do not lag behind in the matter of raising loans.  I have great sympathy for them.  They are not to be whipped on so far as loans are concerned. They have applied for loans in Ireland, America, Germany and some other little island I cannot recall, somewhere contiguous to Canada&mdash; Nova Scotia or somewhere.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard <Col N="223" /> to increased costs, I believe if we were to raise a public loan of £20 million to carry out these schemes, we would be justified.  This money would be made available for such work at a cost of 7½ per cent per annum.  But if we offset against that interest the amount which the Minister for Finance told us recently is recouped to the Exchequer by way of income tax, the net interest payable for such a loan would be less than five per cent.  The Minister indicated that of the interest paid on State loans, at least one-third is channelled back to the Exchequer through income tax or surtax.</P>
      <P>Another aspect is that it is likely in 1967, 1968 or 1969 that the cost of providing these schemes will increase. Indeed, it is likely we will have a four per cent or five per cent increase each year.  Since the plans are already prepared and ready it would be just as well to face the task today, even though we would have to pay tomorrow.  I am not against paying tomorrow for schemes of that kind.  If we provide houses which are likely to last for 70 or 80 years, if we provide much-needed facilities such as water and sewerage in rural districts which are likely to last for years, I cannot see anything wrong in asking future generations to pay their contribution towards such schemes.  The day of drawing water from the well is gone, or at least it should be gone.  The day of living in inadequate housing should also go.  As the Minister said about the British market, it should be gone and gone forever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is widespread discontent about the inadequacy of the estimates submitted by the Department's inspectors in respect of reconstruction grants.  If you take the average case, where, say, the inspector estimates it will take £400 to do this reconstruction job, the applicants in my part of the country cannot get any contractor to carry out the job without an increase of at least 20 per cent in the estimate.  Either the estimates are too low or the contractors are inclined to rake off grant applicants and overcharge them.  I am satisfied from the most minute examination I <Col N="224" /> can make of the position that the estimates submitted by the inspector are too low.  They should be examined in the light of the increased cost of materials and the increases in wage rates and other incidental expenses that have taken place in recent times. I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to revise the Department's standard estimates.  For example, they allow so much for external plastering, for internal plastering, for flooring and so on.  It is about time such estimates were reviewed and brought in line with present day costs.</P>
    <P>Twelve months ago I mentioned a case here that has not yet been closed. My advice to applicants for local authority housing is to try to get them, if at all possible, to provide their own houses with the help of the State grants and subsidies available. It is a much more healthy situation where the circumstances warrant it that people should build their own houses rather than wait for local authorities to help them.  The only people local authorities would be obliged to help are those who cannot house themselves from their own resources or those who because of low incomes are not creditworthy enough to secure loans.</P>
    <P>Two people from the same district, who are about to get married and anxious to get a house, called on me. Seeing that they were in the building trade in a small way, as employees, I advised them to build their own houses so as to qualify for the additional grant which became available in October, 1963, that is, the extended grant to £450 from the State and £450 from the county council for people who build their own houses and are certified by the county council as qualifying for local authority housing. Both submitted their applications.  The Act was quite new at the time.  Both were approved by the State for grants of £450 and approval by the State for a grant of that amount automatically carried approval for payment by the county council of a similar amount.</P>
    <P>Both erected their houses.  One man was paid his £450 from the State and the £450 from the county council. After a number of weeks, the other <Col N="225" /> man got a letter saying that the allocation of the higher rate of grant was made in error as he was living in a district which precluded him from the benefit of that grant and that that matter was overlooked originally.  His grant was reduced by £150 and, as a result, the council grant was proportionately reduced.  I contended here 12 months ago and I do so again today that the Department made a mistake having regard to the fact that these houses were built in a place which precluded the applicants from benefiting from the higher rate of grant. Normally, the men would be entitled only to £600.  The Department blundered when all the facts were truthfully and correctly put before them.  This regulation was then in its infancy and the Members of this House did not know what regulations would be made. The higher rate of grant was allocated in error to both applicants.  The higher grants should be paid because, when they undertook the work, the houses were erected on the understanding that the applicants would get £900.  One of the applicants got the £900 and the other applicant has not yet been paid. The Department made the blunder and they should now abide by their mistake and honour their original allocation. When it was paid in one case, it should be paid in the other.</P>

      <P>I am sick of sending names.  Any of these officials over there with the Minister knows the name in this instance.  I am saying here to the Parliamentary Secretary that a mistake was made.  I am referring to the increased grant for the erection of houses for persons who would qualify for local authority housing.  These were the first grants approved by the Department in West Cork and then they found that the houses were erected in a district which precluded the applicants from benefiting under the Act.  These people built their houses in good faith and, therefore, the State should honour the allocations they originally agreed to.  I hope, then, that the Parliamentary Secretary <Col N="226" /> will review that position and pay the full £450&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not think there is much use in labouring the point further except to express the hope that the position will right itself and, of course, to remind the Minister that, so far as Cork county is concerned, we shall be renewing our representations to get more money for the schemes we have ready for implementation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure the matter of road grants has been referred to by a number of Deputies.  Unfortunately, like housing and other schemes to which I have referred, the position is not bright and has not been bright during the past year.  Local authorities have had to meet increased costs of materials for road building, increased wage rates and other increased incidental expenses. What help did they get from the Department of Local Government? They got reduced grants.  Consider the additional moneys accruing from motor taxation during the current year&mdash;a 25 per cent increase.  Instead of placing them in the Road Fund they were placed in the funds of the central Exchequer. That has been referred to here time and time again and it was a very unfair action by this Government. Some years ago, when an inter-Party Government was in office and there was a shortage of money, the then Government borrowed from the Road Fund and there was a good deal of noise about it by the Fianna Fáil <Col N="227" /> Party who were then in Opposition.</P>
    <P>This year, despite the increased costs on local authorities, the Government and the Department of Local Government have made a right raid on the Road Fund with the result that our expenditure in Cork County for county road improvements is down by £49,000.  We have £49,000 less to meet extra costs such as the ones I have referred to&mdash;wages, materials and so on.  Naturally, therefore, the volume of our work is reduced and, as a result of reducing the volume of work, the volume of employment by the county council is reduced.  A number of workers, particularly workers casually employed from year to year, have to stay on at the labour exchange for this year, provided they can get anything there, instead of having this casual employment from the county council.  It is a scandal and a shame that the Department should take away this money and reduce the grants available for road improvement works.</P>
    <P>We all appreciate that county roads serve an important purpose.  We all like to see good county roads and dust-free county roads.  It is the aim and object of the different county councils, and particularly of Cork County Council, to provide dust-free surfaces. The blow we got this year, however, will not help towards the finalisation of that policy.</P>
    <P>I agree that the work carried out on main roads is good work and sound work.  Main roads are entitled to big grants and to having large sums expended on them.  I disagree with the view that we are putting too much into main roads.  I appreciate that these roads, such as the main road from Dublin to Cork which carries a huge volume of traffic, must be maintained in a most elaborate way and the funds expended on that type of maintenance are expended wisely and well.</P>
    <P>We must have a clear-cut distinction between main roads carrying a large volume of traffic and county roads carrying local traffic.  We do not, however, in West Cork agree with the Department that none of the roads in that <Col N="228" /> area should be designated an arterial road.  None is so designated and we do not therefore benefit from the arterial road grants.  There is no justification for not deeming the road from Cork to Bantry or from Cork to Skibbereen an arterial road and I would ask the Department now to review the position so far as arterial roads are concerned. We should have an extension in the number of arterial roads and a greater spread-over of the grants available under that heading.</P>
    <P>The Minister had a great deal to say about the desirability of providing swimming pools.  We have had several circulars from him.  I agree that it is desirable to provide swimming pools, particularly in inland towns.  Unfortunately, owing to shortage of money and lack of funds for housing and water supply schemes, I cannot see local authorities implementing the Minister's plans for the provision of swimming pools.  We are particularly interested in providing such a pool in Dunmanway and I should like to know from the Minister, if the county council were to approve of such a pool, will grants be available in the current year?</P>

      <P>Is this all so much guff?  There is a great deal of talk about swimming pools.  There is a great deal of public interest in swimming pools.  They are very desirable.  I am quite sure, however, that the money is not there but, once more, we have the implication that the money is there. In view of the credit restrictions, I do not see any need for providing swimming pools in coastal areas.  Any money provided for such pools should be provided for pools in inland towns and districts.  They should have priority.  I say that despite the fact that I myself live in a coastal town.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to town and country planning, it was alleged here yesterday by, I think, Deputy L'Estrange, that some appeals were determined on the policy and qualifications of the parties concerned.  I am sure that is not so. Unfortunately a number of people think it is.  The Minister ought to <Col N="229" /> address himself to one particular aspect of the matter: why does he take so long to determine appeals? Are these appeals the subject matter of widespread political representation? Is it a case of Johnny Murphy, who has appealed against a decision, and who is a good friend of ours, getting a sympathetic hearing because of that? Is that type of representation helpful in determining appeals?</P>
    <P>Town and country planning regulations are vitally necessary, but, once we decide appeals on the particular qualifications of the party concerned, then the Town Planning Act is killed. In my opinion, at least a few appeals have been upheld by the Department against the decision of the local authority; if these appeals had been determined fairly and squarely, they would not have been so upheld.  I am rather doubtful, though I do not go so far as Deputy L'Estrange went, as to whether everything is aboveboard in the determination of these appeals.  I would have difficulty in substantiating that statement, though I am not one of those, and never have been, who makes statements he cannot substantiate outside.  I have a few cases in mind.  Perhaps there were other factors which were overlooked originally by the county council, but I am surprised that the Department rescinded the decision of the county council.</P>
    <P>Deputy McLaughlin was interested in driving tests.  The Minister told us that 49 per cent of the applications are disallowed.  We all appreciate the desirability of having driving tests. They are essential, but I think the most dangerous driver is the man who thinks he knows too much, who is overconfident of his capabilities.  When an applicant makes a small mistake, I do not see why he should be turned down just for that if the tester is satisfied he is fairly competent. That small error may be due to nervousness.  I understand the testers are extraordinarily aloof. They never say &ldquo;Good day&rdquo; or &ldquo;Good morning&rdquo;, or anything like that.  They seem to be a race apart. That is not the Irish way of life.  Just because they are successful in being <Col N="230" /> appointed to a certain job, they should not adopt that aloof attitude.  They would do just as well, and put their clients more at ease, if they adopted a more civilised approach.  I do not like that kind of attitude.  The Minister should tell these people to adopt a different approach and have a discussion with the prospective candidate before the test, apart from a discussion on the rules of the road.</P>
    <P>I am sorry I have had to be so critical of the Department but, in order to be factual, one has to be critical.  I join with other Deputies in pleading with the Minister for more money from the Department of Finance for the provision of schemes administered by his Department.  We are all aware of the financial difficulty that exists and we regret that schemes mooted by the Government quite some time back are lagging far behind, like the targets set in the successive Programmes for Economic Expansion, but we all hope that the position next year will improve and that those of us who are here 12 months hence will have a brighter picture to paint.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I should like to congratulate the Minister on the feeling and understanding of the various problems of the different sections of the community which underline his speech.  He outlined in great detail the position as it is at the moment and followed that with a forecast for the future.  He dealt with the question of rents in relation to the lower income groups and with the necessity for providing housing for the old and for the itinerants.  Anyone who heard or read his speech could not but be fully aware of the different aspects of administration of his Department and the problems that confront him, together with the programme devised for the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall deal now with planning for the future, planning on a long-term and on a short-term basis.  There is no doubt there is confusion in the minds of many Deputies who have spoken with regard to long-term and short-term planning.  Local authorities draw up schemes for long-term planning and submit them to the Department.  They <Col N="231" /> are approved by the Department on the basis of long-term planning.  It is just not good enough that Deputies should come in here and complain that money is not available to put these schemes into operation immediately; that is a dishonest political manoeuvre but that is what has been happening here since I came into this House and for a considerable time before that. I would appeal to the people who are concerned about the future of the nation, and planning the future development of the nation, that they should examine this on the basis of long- and short-term planning.  Matters which are of a short-term nature should take first place.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated that the Government, with the necessary means or whatever means are available to keep the building industry alive and to have stability in the building industry for many years to come, instructed the various local authorities to submit the necessary plans to the Department.  In some cases these plans have been submitted but in other cases there has been complete neglect.  It is absolutely necessary that these plans should be submitted.  It would seem, from what the last speaker said, that is is ridiculous to plan at all for the future just because plans are drawn up which we are unable to fulfil for one reason or another.  He indicated that plans had been drawn up some years ago and had not been fulfilled.  On this aspect of planning, it is very necessary that the various public representatives and the representatives who are members of the Dáil should influence their authorities to give a complete picture of the state of their towns and cities so that a general view can be taken at an early stage, and if adjustments have to be made, if certain projects are to be brought forward and others delayed, they can be examined on that basis.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the increase in building costs.  This is a very serious matter and it has been investigated, but I feel that it has not been investigated <Col N="232" /> thoroughly enough.  There is considerable laxity in the construction and erection of some housing schemes and much could be done to effect savings in this particular sector.  He also indicated that his Department, in co-operation with the National Building Agency and other agencies, are seeking a new housing design.  This is a very good thing but I would suggest in regard to any new design for local authority houses that it should be examined in great detail by responsible people.  I am quite sure that the planners, the architects and the draughtsmen know their job but they have never lived in a local authority house which they have designed.  I suggest that those concerned go into local authority areas and select a number of housewives who have been living in local authority houses for a number of years and ask them to suggest improvements.  I am quite sure they will be able to come up with suggestions for a better designed house which will assist the planners, who are far removed, and have been removed, from local authority houses.  These women spend 90 per cent of their time in their kitchens and in some of these kitchens you cannot even turn around. These people will freely give of their advice; they will provide the authorities concerned with expert advice on future construction.</P>
    <P>Much has been said about the housing position in Dublin and throughout the country, and I should like to deal briefly with the housing position in Dublin because some statements were made which are completely erroneous and some statements were made in order to confuse the people who are on the waiting list at the moment.  Last year a number of scare-mongering campaigns were carried on in various parts of the city and various meetings were called in order to distort the situation and to terrorise the people into believing that there was no hope for the homeless.  On Friday, 20th of May, leaflets were distributed in the city indicating that three Dáil Deputies of the Labour Party, together with other prominent speakers, would address a meeting.  At this meeting the Minister for Local Government and <Col N="233" /> his Department, and the Government, were condemned because of their blunder in Ballymun.  It was indicated that this was &ldquo;Blaney's Folly&rdquo;, and that none of the houses would be handed over in the foreseeable future and that the whole thing would collapse.</P>
    <P>However, many of the people who spoke critically of this scheme at those meetings at the GPO and at the corner of Abbey Street, are now saying that it is a great scheme.  Any credit which is due is due to the Minister for his initiative in getting the Dublin Corporation to divert their attention from the normal types of structure in order that the people would be housed in the quickest possible time.  The Minister introduced this system building and, as I say, the people who were so critical about it 12 months ago are now applauding it and congratulating the Minister.</P>
    <P>Great credit is definitely due to the Department for their foresight and also to the responsible members of Dublin Corporation who backed this project and who had confidence in it because they saw it working elsewhere.  Now the fruits of this project have arrived and over 1,200 houses were handed over in the past 12 months.  As the Minister indicated, it will measure up to expectations.  The people who have been housed in Ballymun have no one to thank but the Minister and the same applies to the people transferred to fill the vacancies in other schemes.  It has been estimated that 3,000 people will have been housed in the Ballymun area within the next three years.</P>
    <P>A distortion of the future prospects in Dublin was expressed here last night and I should like to give the most up-to-date figures in regard to these prospects.  There are under construction 987 houses and in regard to &ldquo;Schemes in Formulation&rdquo;, the details are as follows: (1) schemes awaiting entry of contractor on site, Constitution Hill, the erection of 90 flats; (2) tenders under examination: Howth&mdash;erection of 22 houses; Coolock/Kilmore&mdash;erection of 20 houses; (3) tenders to be invited in September 1966: St. Finbarr's Road, <Col N="234" /> Cabra&mdash;erection of six flats and one house; (4) site development&mdash;work in progress &mdash; Coolock/Kilmore &mdash; development of 390 sites; Coolock/ Kilmore&mdash;development of 760 sites.</P>
    <P>This indicates the position for the future.  One thousand sites are being prepared for future development and with 1,000 houses under construction, together with the Ballymun scheme, they measure up to the prospects that we hoped for not so long ago.  We must all applaud the Minister's desires and feelings in regard to the allocation of houses and flats in the various areas for the old people.  On page five of his brief, he states that local authorities should make the housing of elderly people, who are able-bodied, a much more economic proposition than accommodating them in county homes or similar institutions.  In addition, it would be much better for the morale and well-being of these people.</P>
    <P>Dublin Corporation in their schemes have a number of houses for old people.  It is a distinct problem which needs a great deal of attention and it requires that attention in every single Department because every Department, in one way or another, affects the lives of the old people.  We have throughout the country many old people who have very callous relatives.  I will just quote one case.  Quite recently a daughter sent her mother to one of our hospitals.  After some time the hospital was so overcrowded and the woman was so well from the point of view of her general health that they asked the daughter to take her home. The hospital got no reply from the daughter and due to circumstances, an ambulance was sent out to the daughter's home.  That daughter said: &ldquo;That is not my mother&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We have this type of individual but we also have others who do their best for their aged parents.  They assist them in every way.  Sometimes because of family problems, old people are cast on one side and so have to be catered for by Dublin Corporation, the Dublin Health Authority or various health authorities throughout the country.  It is necessary that we give this matter some attention.  It is necessary to build suitable accommodation for these old <Col N="235" /> people and to have people to staff those places and look after these aged people.  It is useless constructing large blocks of flats, maisonettes or chalet type buildings for housing old people if the other necessary services are not available.  We should provide suitable services in all those places to cater for the needs of those aged people.</P>
    <P>I would like, at this stage, to pay special tribute to the various local and voluntary organisations who are doing such good work in looking after those people in Dublin city.  I would appeal to Deputies in areas where no provision has yet been made to ensure that some provision will be made in order that those aged people may live out the last few years of their lives in the comfort they deserve.</P>
    <P>The question of swimming pools has been mentioned.  This, to me, is a very vexed problem.  The Minister has appealed for assistance in connection with the development of swimming pools.  My experience of them has been a very sad one indeed.  The first time the Minister issued a circular many years ago indicating that a 50 per cent grant would be available from the Department for the construction of swimming pools, I immediately put down a number of motions and questions to various departments of the Corporation asking them to stimulate interest in the development of swimming pools.  The result was the development of a pilot pool in the Crumlin area.  I followed this up for a number of years.  The Department of Local Government were aware of the plans.  They examined the plans and where it was necessary to improve them, they did so.  One would assume that after the alterations had been made the Department of Local Government would then give the grant. Those plans travelled back and forth between Dublin Corporation and the Department of Local Government for a period of three years.  After that time the necessary finance was not provided.</P>
    <P>We diverted some of our planning experts in Dublin Corporation from various jobs in order to ensure that the plans were available for the Department <Col N="236" /> of Local Government and that the objections of the Department were met. Despite this, we found, when the scheme was about to go into operation and when sanction was required, this sanction was not forthcoming from the Department.  This, to me, is a very vexed question.  The Department will have to make up their minds that when a plan is submitted in the first instance and when it takes three years to develop that plan and is then accepted, they must honour their responsibility and pay the grant when the times comes.  There are some people in the Department who have a bias against Dublin.</P>
    <P>The question of swimming pools in Dublin city has been discussed for a number of years.  Before I came into Dublin Corporation, a number of other members tried to stimulate interest and have a swimming pool established.  I want to make a point to the Minister. I am quite sure from statements made that the position of Dublin is not understood. We want, instead of swimming pools in Dublin, suitable swimming baths.  That is what was designed for Pearse Park in Crumlin.  We also want swimming pools.  We are with the Minister all the way in that matter. We want proper swimming baths suited to the needs of our capital city.  A swimming pool costing £16,000 is not suitable for the requirements of Dublin city.  We want something larger.  We are aware of the vast concentration of the population in the area where this pool was planned, that is, Drimnagh, Crumlin, Walkinstown.  A pool costing £16,000 would be useless there. The number of people who would gain admittance to the pool at any time would be very small in comparison with the number who would gain admittance to properly-controlled and properly-constructed swimming baths.</P>
    <P>During the past year two swimming pools have been erected in Dublin.  On one occasion the decision was two against one in Dublin Corporation, which shows the small interest some people have in swimming pools in Dublin.  I would ask the Minister to reconsider the decision of his Department in relation to the Crumlin pool. <Col N="237" /> A swimming pool is very necessary in this area.  I would like the Minister to indicate whether a 20 per cent, 30 per cent or 40 per cent grant will be made available.  If the Minister gave an indication of the type of grant which would be made available, I am quite sure the citizens of this city would rally behind Dublin Corporation to erect suitable swimming baths.  We are prepared to go ahead and build them and I am quite sure when the final solution is arrived at, we will have five or six pools of the type agreed on by the Department and by Dublin Corporation.</P>
    <P>The Road Traffic Bill was mentioned by the Minister.  Road safety has also been mentioned.  The representatives of Dublin city, the citizens of Dublin Corporation and those who come here for a few days or a few weeks, know what the traffic problem is, particularly in the centre city area.  This area is monopolised by CIE and the parking space is monopolised by the few spivs who take up parking space.  This space is reserved for them by some of the attendants.  The position with regard to CIE is that you are taken for a ride by them.  They must take you to the centre of the city.  That must be abolished.  I do not know whether it is to obtain extra revenue or some other reason that you must be taken to O'Connell Street.  People travelling from Ballyfermot to Crumlin, a distance of nearly seven miles, have to travel into the centre of the city and then back again to reach their destination, and the same thing applies throughout the city area.</P>
    <P>The question of a perimeter service, a service that will take a person from one centre on the perimeter to another, is absolutely desirable and essential if we are to reduce the traffic congestion in the centre of the city.  This is a matter that has been suggested to CIE on a number of occasions and I think the Department, if they are serious about this traffic problem, should take the matter up seriously with CIE.  I am quite sure that if CIE decided to give a group of areas on the perimeter a trial it would pay them well.  Probably CIE would not get the same amount of revenue at the end of the <Col N="238" /> year but the traffic would flow much more freely from the centre of the city.  That would certainly please everyone, and would meet the requirements the Department are seeking. The question of stopping adjacent to the centre of the city is something that needs further attention also and I would once again ask the Department, if they are really serious about this, to take up this particular matter seriously.</P>
    <P>The question of road safety is one that is very near to the Minister's heart and certainly is one that any responsible organisation or individual will support fully without hesitation. Possibly much more can be done with this road safety campaign in conjunction with the various local authorities and by contact with the various schools and school managers in regard to the necessary instruction that could take place possibly after school hours. The Rules of the Road are not generally known to many people until they apply for a driving licence.  The Rules of the Road should be known by children leaving school and much could be done in this direction at a very early stage.  I know from experience in the past week of an adult of 32 looking for a booklet on the Rules of the Road when applying for a driving licence.  That is a ridiculous situation.</P>
    <P>With regard to the south side sewer, the development in Dublin city is lopsided. At the moment the north side of the city is being developed.  All the housing estates are being developed on the north side.  For six or seven years to come it will be impossible for a local authority to build a single house on the south side of the city.  This is a situation which must be faced immediately. The sewerage service on the south side will take five, six or seven years to complete.  During that period the city is bound to expand enormously. It is time the Department of Local Government gave the Corporation a prod, or <i>vice versa,</i> so that they will tackle this problem with the amount of vigour necessary to ensure that development will take place in a reasonable and orderly fashion in the city as a whole.  This lopsided development <Col N="239" /> creates numerous problems. Enormous problems will arise in the north city in the years to come and this is a position that has not been tackled with the vigour and understanding that is necessary.</P>
    <P>The corporation place proposals beforce the Department from time to time but they go unheeded.  One which went unheeded was the proposal to allow a sewer to run at the base of the canal bed.  There was serious opposition from all types of water lovers, duck lovers, boat lovers and all sorts of individuals. I hope the Department are not yielding to this kind of pressure.  It is important that we lay sewers and provide houses for our people.  Even if there is temporary disruption in the provision of boats to the Shannon and elsewhere by individuals who can afford to use the canal, I think it is absolutely necessary at this stage to take a realistic view and ensure that in the shortest possible time sewerage facilities will be available.</P>
    <P>If, then, the base of the canal is used it can be closed in again as a proper waterway.  At the moment it is in a filthy and disgraceful condition.  It is nothing short of a foul polluted cess-pool. If the view of the Department of Local Government is that is should not be used, or that there is some impediment there, the whole thing should be revised.  Whether the matter is revised or not, if the sewers were to cost £5 to £6 million more it is necessary to ensure that our people will get houses in time to come.</P>
    <P>The services on the north side of the city of Dublin will be exhausted in a short time and we will be left with a city unable to cope with any type of development.  We would probably find ourselves transporting people from Kildare, or Wicklow to their work.  I foresee a serious problem in our city if these matters are not tackled soon.</P>
    <P>I should like to say a few words about the itinerant problem.  This is a very vexed question.  A number of responsible people, and irresponsible people, are fostering the cause of the itinerants at the moment.  Some of these responsible people know what they are doing.  They have a definite reason and purpose&mdash;the betterment of this unfortunate <Col N="240" /> section of the community.  There are others who are trying to divert the itinerants from their own front doors to the doors of other people and they have other motives for the diversion of the itinerants to certain encampments.</P>
    <P>The position in Dublin city is that two areas have been picked out&mdash; Bluebell and Ballyfermot.  These areas are adjacent to each other and I think it is highly undesirable that two areas close to each other should be chosen for itinerant encampments.  We have the north side and the west side where there should be a spread-out of this particular problem.  I represent the area in which both of these itinerant encampments are proposed.  The City Manager is a reasonable man.  He has examined the problem of the local representatives and has met the local people to explain fully and comprehensively the outline for the provision of these itinerant encampments.  It is however, difficult to get people to understand and believe that it will be possible to control the itinerants, when for so long it was impossible to do anything about begging or the destruction that took place in many areas due to the presence of itinerants.</P>
    <P>I think something should be done about this problem at this stage.  It is necessary to say that these people if they have rights have also responsibilities and it is up to the Department to ensure that they meet their responsibilities. The local authorities are asked to meet their responsibilities, and where there are rights, there are responsibilities.  It is necessary that the people who are fostering the problems of the itinerants will ensure, if they are fostering them for a good motive, that the itinerants will meet their responsibilities.  I have every confidence that the Dublin City Manager will ensure that as far as the responsibility of Dublin Corporation to the citizens adjacent to this encampment is concerned, it will be fully met.  However, there are problems with the local authority in relation to the itinerant encampments.  There are the views of the local representatives of the particular area and the views of the people who have lived adjacent to the particular sites for a number of years who have a stake in that particular <Col N="241" /> sector and who have lived in peace and contentment.  It is necessary to ensure that they will live for the remainder of their lives in the comfort they enjoyed heretofore.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister and the Department every success in the future in tackling the problems with which they are confronted and I assure them of my support when I feel it reasonable and of my opposition when I feel they deserve it.  Once again I would ask the Minister and his Department to reconsider their objection to the development of the Crumlin pool and to let us know at the earliest possible moment if they are prepared to allow it to proceed, even at a reduced rate of Government subsidy.  I am quite sure that if they do, people will respond in a wholehearted manner.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is interesting to hear Deputy Dowling's conscience trouble him as he was speaking on the subject of housing in Dublin.  In order to soothe his conscience, he proceeded to catalogue the housing that was in contemplation and, in the process of that catalogue, he moved from house-building to contracts authorised until he eventually arrived at sites approved.  Tough as his conscience is, he felt it requisite to count into accommodation available the sites approved.  The facts are very different from what Deputy Dowling would have us believe and it is very important that this House should keep these facts before it.  We are now with our backs to the wall for money.  We are borrowing in foreign markets at interest rates which amount to the equivalent of 11 per cent on money borrowed at home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the inter-Party Government handed over the housing situation in 1957 to the present Government, the position was that the housing problem in rural Ireland was substantially settled and in the city of Dublin there was a surplus of houses available; there were more houses available than we had tenants to put into them.  I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary who is here present will agree with me that that was substantially the case.  What is the case today?  At a time when we are being warned by the Central Bank <Col N="242" /> that the utmost circumspection must be used in the raising of further loan moneys; at a time when we are being warned that the burden of the service of the public debt threatens to exceed our capacity to meet it; at a time when it is highly problematic whether the Government will be able to raise money by way of loan at all &mdash; and mind you, there are a lot of Deputies in this House who forget that but we ought to remember because it is of vital importance to this country that we should&mdash;do not let us forget this country offered a loan of £5 million sterling in the London market at over 7 per cent but the Royal Liver took up £¼ million of it and the entire additional sum offered us by other potential lenders was of the order of £500,000.</P>
    <P>That is the situation we ought to bear in mind when we come to review the true housing situation in the city of Dublin.  So far as I know, from the last figures available to me, there are approximately 700 families living five in one room in the city of Dublin.  I do not know how many are living four in one room and three in one room. That relates to overcrowding of individual rooms but this House very frequently conveniently forgets that since 1963 not one single residence in the metropolitan area of Dublin has been condemned as unfit for human habitation.  It is perfectly true that since the houses began to fall on the people, that section of the corporation responsible for the safety of housing has been in operation, with the result that in large areas there are huge gaps where houses have been pulled down on the ground that they were in danger of falling.</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera has described his constituency in the city of Dublin as being like a bombarded city because so many houses have been pulled down on the ground that they were in imminent danger of falling on the people. But what a lot of Deputies forget is that over and above the houses actually being torn down on the ground of danger to people, there are thousands of homes in this city inhabited by families which ought to have been condemned as unfit for <Col N="243" /> human habitation but which have not been condemned because the corporation cannot contemplate their replacement.  I do not know how Fianna Fáil have the brazen-faced audacity to face the people of this country at all.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies may say: &ldquo;How could this come about; how do you blame Fianna Fáil for this?&rdquo; It is important to understand what happened.  Everybody who knows anything about urban housing knows that there continually proceeds in every old city a deterioration of old buildings.  Therefore, you have not only to provide for the continual influx from rural Ireland, which is taking place to the city of Dublin&mdash; as is taking place in other cities&mdash;but you have to make provision, in addition, to replace the deteriorating housing which is either collapsing or becoming unfit for human habitation. In 1957 the inter-Party Government found itself in the happy position that in the city of Dublin there was a surplus of houses and they accordingly stopped building them.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason I blame Fianna Fáil for the appalling situation in the city of Dublin is that they were given a situation in 1957 in which there was actually a surplus of houses, as the records will show.  They stopped <Col N="244" /> building houses in the city of Dublin, quite oblivious of the fact that old houses continued to deteriorate, and that the steady influx of people from rural Ireland was continuing.  That stoppage continued until houses began to fall down, and children were killed in the collapse of houses at the back of Westland Row.  That department of the corporation which was concerned with houses which were unsafe for human habitation acted.  As Deputy de Valera said, parts of his own constituency assumed the appearance of a bombarded city.  Thousands of houses were instantly condemned&mdash; and note the speed with which it was done.  Suddenly, overnight, gaps appeared in the streets while we were being reassured by Fianna Fáil that there were abundant houses for all.</P>
    <P>Neither Deputy de Valera nor any other Dublin Deputy told us that the other section of the corporation whose function is just as important and, indeed, possibly more vital, that section which deals with houses which are unfit for human habitation, was told to stop, because the corporation were in a position in which they were already refusing to put families living four in a room even on the waiting list.  They dared not allow people living inimical to their health to be added to the list or to take precedence over others.</P>
    <P>The horrible thing, to my mind, is that we sit in affluence in this House and we do not think of the people who are living in conditions of which we know.  I will be told by some purists: &ldquo;Deputy Dillon is making the same speech for the fifteenth time.&rdquo;  I will go on making this speech until Fianna Fáil wake up to the horrors for which they are responsible, just as I went on making a speech for two years warning of the financial and economic typhoon which was descending upon them.  For two years I tried to make the empty heads of the Fianna Fáil Party, led by the rogues of the Fianna Fáil Party, realise that they were marching into a typhoon, in the eye of which this country at present stands.  Do not imagine that we have seen the end of the economic typhoon into which Fianna Fáil led us.  We <Col N="245" /> have passed through one side and are now recovering from the first shock, but that was nothing compared with what the country will have to endure when the other side strikes.  We are already weakened; we have our backs to the wall; but we have appalling economic problems still awaiting us.  It is true that 15 and 20 times I have warned the House of the inevitability of that. Some of the more imbecile of the Fianna Fáil Deputies wag their heads and say: &ldquo;Indeed you did&rdquo;, as if that were a rebuke.  I deem it my duty to continue to warn Fianna Fáil so long as I cannot penerate their thick skulls.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil must wake up to the fact that you cannot leave people to rot, and expect them to accept that peacefully, docilely and patiently.  I say that to deliberately leave a family in a house which is unfit for human habitation because you are afraid to face the fact that it is unfit for human habitation is almost worse than to leave them in a house which is threatening to fall down.  At least they have a hope of escaping before it falls down.  Picture a mother or father who watches a child grow delicate, as we used to say, in a house which is damp, a house which is rat-ridden and verminous, until eventually the child is brought to the Crumlin Children's Hospital and thence to a sanatorium.  Fortunately there are sanatoria because we provided them.  We provided them in the teeth of Fianna Fáil opposition.</P>
    <P>Are we happy that a situation should exist in which our own fellow-citizens should have to watch their children wither away in houses that are notoriously unfit for human habitation because we have not got the means to provide them with proper housing? I agree with some Deputies who said it would be contrary to justice to upbraid the Minister for Local Government for this default.  The Minister cannot take blood from a turnip or water from a stone.  He has not got the money, because he, as a member of the Fianna Fáil Government, helped to squander it.  We have comfortable offices; we have lifts and wall to wall carpeting.</P>

      <P>We built them for ourselves.  We are taking whole floors in skyscrapers all over the city for the accommodation of the Civil Service. We are paying for it.  We spent public money to get it, while we knew perfectly well that our neighbours were living in conditions which a veterinary surgeon would prohibit for the accommodation of livestock.  Let us not run away from that fact.  We recently took a whole floor of a skyscraper erected here for the accommodation of the Civil Service and undertook, to boot, to spend £60,000 redecorating it, in addition to the rent we undertook to pay.  But in County Monaghan&mdash; to leave Dublin for a moment&mdash;we have not sixpence to lend to anybody under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act with which to build a house. The local authority there has gone to London to try to borrow £60,000 from a firm of London financiers because they cannot get a penny from the Local Loans Fund.  Is this a record of which we can afford to be proud?  If not, whose fault is it?  It is the fault of the present Government and those members of Fianna Fáil who represent Dublin city ought to hang their heads in shame because they have not the courage to speak here on behalf of those who elected them to this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I admire Deputy Dowling for the manner in which he batters along making the best case he can.  He talks of 1,000 sites and says that 1,000 sites are almost as good as 1,000 houses.  He is a great old warrior.  Any other man in the circumstances would be ashamed to show his face in Dáil Éireann but he keeps battling on.  The only positive matter he had to deal with in his speech was the Crumlin swimming pool and in regard to that he has been sent from Billy to Jack in the last few years.  God knows when the Minister will make up his mind to do something about it.  But there was the usual Fianna Fáil alibi.  He was sure it was not the Minister's fault but that there was some civil servant in some dark corner of the Custom House who was frustrating the noble heart of the Minister for Local Government who <Col N="247" /> wanted to give joy to everybody and would do so if he were not frustrated by that wicked villain who was poking holes in the bottom of the Crumlin swimming pool.  That is fraud and Deputy Dowling knows it is fraud. He is a courageous old fraud.  He is trying to cover the Minister's flank as best he can but the real reason there is no swimming pool in Crumlin is that they have no money.  It is all spent and on purposes which reflect little credit on them.</P>
    <P>I do not know how Ballymun will turn out.  I admit the Minister had bad luck with the weather.  I went to see Ballymun and I was nearly lost in a quagmire.  That was not the Minister's fault.  I do not know how the whole theory of what they call system building will turn out.  It is wonderful how calling a rose by some other name is meant to change it.  I heard this type of building described as pre-fab and when they were pre-fabs, they were regarded as the appalling expedient to which the British people were driven as a result of the German blitz and the whole hope was to get the people of London out of the pre-fabs. Now we start building larger pre-fabs in Ballymun and we are all meant to stand up and give three cheers and regard this as a most revolutionary discovery and believe that whereas the one-storey pre-fab was the lowest thing you could have, the four-storey pre-fab is heaven.</P>
    <P>I am told by architects in this city that the pre-fabs at Ballymun will cost more and last a shorter time than ordinary houses built by conventional methods which any contractor would be glad to undertake.  I am not an expert in these matters and not in a position to judge, but I am certainly not fascinated by the aesthetic amenities of Ballymun, such as I was able to see there, and I discount the fact that the site was covered by a foot of mud which was nobody's fault.  I do not know if any other Deputy would give us an appreciation of the aesthetic qualities of Ballymun or tell us what the houses or the scheme will look like.  We must wait and see.  I understand there are £9 million committed there and I hope we get value <Col N="248" /> for our money, but in the meantime let us not forget the thousands of families &mdash;not hundreds&mdash;who are living in the city three and four to a room.  Let us not forget the families living with their parents-in-law and let us, above all, not forget the families and the old people who are living in houses with rats, vermin and damp for their constant companions.  There are too many Deputies who are ready to do so.</P>
    <P>That refers to Dublin.  I wrote a letter today to the Department of Industry and Commerce on behalf of a constituent in County Monaghan asking for a licence to import dutyfree a dismantled pre-fab from a back street in Belfast.  The reason for that was that these people have no home: they cannot get a house from the local authority and there are no funds to provide them with a Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act loan.  They have no place to lay their heads if they cannot import a pre-fab.  The duty assessable on it is only £25 but they are poor people.  I do not say that when I wrote to the Department on this matter I did not have some qualms but the people have to cover their heads somehow. They cannot get a house from the county council because the council has no money.  They cannot get a loan under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act.  What else can they do?  They cannot live under a tent.  Deputies are closing their eyes to the facts in rural Ireland at present.  Monaghan County Council are negotiating with London financiers to borrow £60,000 because they cannot get it from the Local Loans fund and, so far as I know, that £60,000 is to meet liabilities they have undertaken.</P>
    <P>These matters are the responsibility of the Minister but they are not primarily his fault.  The fault is with the Government and principally with the ex-Minister for Finance who is now elsewhere.  In my considered judgment, there is no immediate prospect of any substantial mitigation of the financial stringency which lies at the root of this whole problem.  I wonder how many Deputies realise that on Friday week last a widow woman brought her cow to the fair in rural Ireland not far from <Col N="249" /> where Deputy Reynolds and I live.  She sold the cow, she paid her rates and she had fifty shillings left over.  It is insane for Deputies to consider the matters in this Estimate divorced from the facts of life relative to the people on whom this Estimate impinges.  The Minister for Local Government, of course, has no responsibility to the House for the price of livestock but he ought to keep constantly present in his mind the incomes and the resources of the people who have to pay rates for the services which the local authorities are required to provide.</P>
    <P>I warn this House that west of the Shannon and north of the Boyle we are rapidly reaching a point at which the rates are rising at such a rate and the incomes of the small farmers are declining at such a rate that it will be no longer possible to make both meet.  I am warning the House now that in so far as the part of the country which lies west of the Shannon and north of the Boyle is concerned, if the price of livestock remains at the level at which it at present stands the people will not have the means to pay their rates. There are many Deputies in the House who know that as well as I do but they try to turn their eyes away.</P>
    <P>Heretofore, if we saw a deficiency looming up in the rates the remedy was to turn to revenue and say: &ldquo;Let the Government make up the difference&rdquo;. The Government are already raising every penny that taxation will yield and I prophesy that revenue under certain headings in this year will show evidence of the law of diminishing returns.  I prophesy that the revenue from spirits, one of the mainstays of annual revenue, will show a diminishing return.  Let us not console ourselves with the idea that if the incomes of the people in the congested areas fail to meet the rates demand it can be met from other sources.  There may not be any other sources.  I warn the House that we are at last coming in sight of the real possibility of the public services of this country breaking down.</P>
    <P>Mark you, in some degree already the public services have broken down. Is it not a public service properly to house our people?  I suggest it is and I <Col N="250" /> suggest that our failure to do so, by almost unanimous agreement in this House, is not due to any illwill on the part of the Minister or to the illwill of any local authority.  It is not due to any hyper-conservative approach in the Oireachtas or at local administrative level.  It is due to the fact that we have no money.</P>
    <P>We can sweep that problem under the carpet by pretending the houses are not unfit for human habitation and leaving the people in them but there comes a time when the estimates are made and the rates struck and the rate collector goes out and the widow woman says: &ldquo;I will bring the cow out and sell her.&rdquo;  She sells the cow, as in the case I have given.  In that case she had fifty shillings left over.  If the present trend continues the situation could easily arise in which when she had sold her cow she would be fifty shillings short.  I warn the House that that day is not impossibly distant.</P>
    <P>None of us has ever known of anything like that to happen; none of us has ever come within sight of it.  If the situation is as grave as that how come it was not so after the economic war when prices of cattle were much worse than they are now?  The difference was this: we had conserved our resources adequately, and I beg of the younger Deputies to wake up to this fact.  This country of which we now constitute the Oireachtas entered into the world catastrophe of 1929 to 1931 and came out of it virtually unscathed. Austria was in chaos, Germany was in chaos, France was in chaos, the United States herself was in chaos and the astonishing fact is that Ireland was on an even keel because we had accumulated reserves to meet that situation. Fianna Fáil came in in 1932 and within 12 months they embarked on the economic war and we survived five years of that because we had accumulated then substantial reserves.</P>
    <P>We are entering into a far more critical situation now and we have no reserves.  We have scraped the bottom of every barrel and that is the heart of the problem with which the Minister for Local Government is trying to grapple at the present time.  Most of <Col N="251" /> us see his problem crystallised in housing. That is as it should be but wait until the services themselves break down, or what we have come to think of as the services.  The health services have never started to function.  I know a child who went to get a pair of spectacles.  I saw her trying to read and she could barely read with the print up against her nose.  She was three months waiting for an appointment and she has now been waiting a further month for glasses which she has not got yet.  It may be due to circumstances of scarcity of money but this is part of the health services which are breaking down.  Picture what will happen if that paralysis extends.</P>
    <P>You, a Cheann Comhairle, will remember that I warned this House many times of the economic situation in which we find ourselves at the present time and it was a matter of cheerful derision among some of my colleagues on the far side who would not even listen.  I am warning you again of another danger which is imminent and you had better face it because it will have to be dealt with if we are not to face a very grave crisis in the life of the State.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to some specific matters that have been referred to by the Minister and some that have not. The first thing I want to mention is water pollution.  Perhaps the Minister would indicate to me that water pollution comes particularly within his bailiwick.  I do not want to trouble him with matters that should belong to the Minister for Health.  Can the Minister inform me?  I think, a Cheann Comhairle, matters relating to water pollution come within the ambit of the Minister for Local Government. At any rate I shall proceed on that assumption if he does not deny it.</P>
    <P>This is a very gave problem for every community.  It is a very dangerous problem if it is allowed to get out of hand.  I do not know if Deputies are familiar with the system of the Great Lakes in America.  There you have Michigan, Superior and Huron, which are practically three inland <Col N="252" /> seas.  The United States of America, with the onrush of their industrial development and during the past two wars, simply closed their eyes to the problem of water pollution.  I think it is Huron which has now become a dead sea.  There is no water life left at all in it.  The waters of that lake have become so contaminated that nothing survives in it or can survive. In a populace like London, I think it is true to say that no one ever died by drowning cast of Tower Bridge; they are dead of poisoning before they have time to drown if they fall into the Thames.</P>
    <P>Those are the extreme cases of water pollution, but I want to warn the House that we are in grave danger in this country of developing a water pollution problem which would become uncontrollable.  What many people forget is that the problem of water pollution is a complex one.  If you once allow pollution to take place uncontrolled, powerful vested interests grow up to maintain the pollution. The Swiss have perceived this problem and they, depending as they do so largely for their income on the tourist industry and the amenities of scenery, lakes, rivers and waterfalls, have provided an extremely stringent code.  In Switzerland, water pollution is a major offence, and they have not hesitated to say that no matter how powerful or how wealthy the source of pollution may be, having been twice made amenable to the law for pollution, on the third occasion the business is closed down, and I think they are right.  They give an offender ample time to mend his hand, and impose an appropriate penalty.  If, having met the penalty, he then fails to set right the source of pollution, a further and heavier penalty is provided under the law.  However, if after two offences the same pollution is perpetrated for a third time, the business is liable to be closed down.</P>
    <P>I want to put it to the House that there are large areas in Ireland threatened with the same thing, partly from unprocessed sewage and partly from industrial waste.  It is quite controllable now.  In five years' time there <Col N="253" /> would be vested interests so powerful that no local authority would be able to control it, and in ten years' time, if it continues as it does, there would be vested interests so powerful in pollution that the Government themselves would not be able to control it.  The tragedy is that, if these matters are taken in time, I know of no form of urban or industrial pollution that cannot be controlled at reasonable cost provided measures are taken to control it before alternative processes are employed which involve pollution as an inherent part of their operation. There is no process in the disposal of waste that cannot be related to a process of purification in any industrial activity or in any urban development plan, but there are dozens of cheaper methods for disposing of polluting materials than processing them before discharging them into public waterways.</P>
    <P>This problem is spreading not only throughout towns and cities but in rural Ireland, and it is spreading in some of the loveliest parts of Ireland.  Wherever the tourist industry, particularly the transient tourist industry operates, you will find abundant sources of obnoxious pollution, and the tragic thing is that it is not infrequently created by people who imagine they are providing an amenity for transient tourism.  Far from that being the case, they are providing a source of derision and condemnation for a tourist population who are directed to accommodation only to discover not only shocking pollution of streams and lakes but grotesquely primitive accommodation of a kind that should not be tolerated in any civilised country which purports to cater for the tourist trade.</P>
    <P>Here again the Minister is up against the problem that he is harassed for money.  I put it to him that the correction of pollution is very largely a matter which should be a charge on the source of pollution and should not involve either the Minister or the Government in any material charge whatever.  I fully understand that it is not reasonable to ask the Minister for Local Government to call on his colleagues in other Departments to introduce <Col N="254" /> Draconian laws to operate as of tomorrow, but what I do say is that Draconian regulations should forthwith be made with notice that they will come into operation in annual stages, and that we should fix a period not more than five years distance from today at which all sources of pollution will be categorically prohibited under the heaviest possible penalty.  If we do not, we have no one but ourselves to blame if we see some of the loveliest amenities this country can boast about reduced to the desert which is represented by a lake like the one to which I have referred, or the Thames which disgraces the heart of the city of London.</P>
    <P>There is another matter which, I want to warn Dáil Éireann, should now be brought under control.  In five years' time it will present an almost insuperable problem, that is, the problem of the abandoned car chassis.  In the United States and in Britain, this has reached a problem of such immense dimensions that State governments in the United States and local authorities in England appear to be paralysed by it.  In the United States, in certain areas, it has reached such a dimension that it has become possible to instal huge crushing machines which, in some mysterious way, can reduce those chassis bodies to scrap of small compass which is acceptable to smelting mills.  But the trouble is that to do that you have to have a very large volume of these abandoned chassis to justify the capital involved in installing such apparatus and it is not to be contemplated that you can instal a central plant in a country like Ireland to which the chassis bodies can be drawn from all parts of the country, because the transport costs would be utterly prohibitive.</P>
    <P>Therefore, we are faced with the danger which any Deputy must himself be witness of of travelling rural roads and seeing accumulating, gradually emerging from behind ditches, dumps of abandoned motor chassis. Here again the problem is of a dimension which can easily be brought under control at the present time but, unless it is, it will reach dimensions at which <Col N="255" /> it will be virtually impossible to control it.</P>
    <P>Although it is none of my business to tell the Minister how to overcome difficulties of this kind, I suggest that, at present, immediate and urgent steps should be taken that every individual should be required where such debris is deposited upon his property either to remove it himself or to be liable to have the local authority remove it to the town dump at the cost of the person on whose property it is found. It is up to each individual to prevent his neighbour dumping chassis on his field if he does not want to make himself liable.  Alternatively, if somebody dumps chassis on his field, <i>nolens volens</i> he should be given the right to recover from the depositor of the abandoned chassis whatever cost or charge the local authority has made for removing the vehicle from his land to the appropriate town dump.  Unless you do that, you are going to face a growing problem which in a small country such as this could be extremely intractable and, I can assure the House, is a growing cause of scandal not only to ourselves but to tourists whom we invite to visit the country.</P>
    <P>All that I have said in regard to abandoned chassis applies also to industrial waste and rubbish.  That is pretty generally accepted by everybody. Few people recognise the magnitude, the growing size, I should say, of the abandoned chassis problem and it ought to be dealt with on the lines I have suggested.</P>
    <P>There is another matter to which I want to refer, not for the first time. It grieves me to recollect that I have been mentioning it for 25 years in this House.  I propose to go on mentioning it as long as I am a Member of the House.  There is a lot of claptrap talked here about the housing of the aged.  The aged want to be left at home so long as they have their own homes to stay in.  They do not want to be housed by anybody.  They would much sooner have their own room with their own things around them. But, we have to face the fact that some old people who are left alone <Col N="256" /> in the world reach a time of life when they are unable to look after themselves. They fall in the fire or in the kitchen and maybe break a hip and their neighbours and friends worry for their safety.  I want to point out to the House that that is a problem of quite limited size in rural Ireland. If you were to ask me about the five principal towns in my own constituency or the town in which I live in the west of Ireland, I do not suppose I would be able to name 20 persons in the six towns who fall within that category but because you are old and feeble and alone is no reason why you should be treated like the abandoned chassis of a broken down motorcar and collected and dumped in a central dump for human refuse.  To go into the home&mdash;it may be the humblest room in the town&mdash;and take an old person out of it on the ground that they are too feeble to cook themselves a meal or too feeble to get about the house in safety without running the danger of breaking a limb or maybe no longer able to get out of bed, and carry them 30 miles off and plank them in the county home 30 miles away from their friends, 30 miles away from the place they are accustomed to, and forget them, has always seemed to me one of the most inhuman features of the society to which we belong.</P>
    <P>I have often told the story in this House, and will tell it again, about an old personal friend of mine who grew old and had no relatives and I well remember we all of us, neighbours, would send him soup one day and a pie or something the next day and drop in and out to see him but eventually the time came when it was no longer possible to leave him alone because you were afraid he might fall in the fire or break his hip in the night and die on the floor. We decided that the only thing to do was to send him to the county home. He went to the county home.  Three or four years later I had occasion to visit the county home on other business.  I was walking down the old men's ward when a man hailed me from the bed and I turned round and, lo and behold, there was my old friend.  I thought he was dead and <Col N="257" /> buried and I think everyone else thought he was dead and buried. Suddenly it struck me, the tragedy of that old man alone in the county home ward and there was not a living creature who even knew he was alive, except, indeed, the nuns who were looking after him.  Good as they were to him, they were not his family, his background, his neighbours.</P>
    <P>All that could be resolved if we had a parish charity.  If anybody wants to know what a parish charity is, let him go to Castleblaney.  There are a good many of them scattered throughout the country, some of them of medieval origin, endowments left in the 16th and 17th century.  They have been used to build a group of flats. Some of them have an endowment actually for the people put into them &mdash;10/- or 12/- in addition to the old age pension.  Others have no such endowment but may have a small flat, maybe only one room and a kitchen. There is provision also for a warden who may be a lady or a man who looks after them.  They call in on one another and if one gets bedridden the neighbours who live in the parish charity all lend a hand to keep the room clean and give him a drop of tea in the bed and help him in any way they can.  At all times the housekeeper or warden or whatever you like to call the person, who is usually a retired nurse or a retired jubilee nurse or somebody of that kind who is glad to get a comfortable apartment and a modest stipend, helps to look after these old people and they are as happy as larks.  They have the right to invite a friend in.  If they meet him down the town they can ask him in for a cup of tea.  It gives them a pride. They are not always accepting hospitality. When they meet a person down the town, they can say: &ldquo;Come up and have a cup of tea.&rdquo;  Then they are not ashamed later on to visit their friends and spend an evening by the fire in their homes.  They are still members of the community.  They are not forgotten or abandoned.</P>
    <P>I understand the Minister for Health or the Minister for Local Government is spending hatfuls of money rebuilding all the county homes.  I believe it <Col N="258" /> would be disastrous if we burdened ourselves with a whole lot of elaborate county homes into which the aged poor of rural Ireland are to be from time to time shovelled when there is nobody left to look after them.  These people have votes, but they do not use them&mdash;they are too old.  They have no families.  They have no influence.  They are largely forgotten.  They are the people who have the most obvious right to depend on us, the elected representatives in Dáil Éireann, to ensure that we do not forget them. If we continue to shovel them into the county homes, it is because we are forgetting them deliberately or it is criminal carelessness.  If we remember them, if we intend to see them justly treated, we will find a better way of providing for the few years that are left to them.  I can say with a clear conscience that it is not autumnal leaves that have made me so suddenly solicitous for this class of citizen.  I was talking on this topic in the green wood as well as in the dry.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see, Sir, one confession at least made in the speech by the Minister for Local Government at page 29 of the verbose document with which he supplied us.  I thank him for his courtesy in circulating a copy of his speech for the convenience of Deputies.  He said:</P>
    <P>As regards the changes in motor tax law effected by this year's Finance Act, I think it only right to remind the House that, while it became necessary to draw extra revenue from motor vehicles for general Exchequer purposes, the full income of the Road Fund from 1965 rates of taxation has been preserved for road purposes.</P>
    <P>Have ever so many words been used to conceal the simple fact that this year the Government raided the Road Fund?  I advise Deputies to note a difference.  Whereas heretofore any Government who raided the Road Fund came into this House and said so openly, we are borrowing this year from the Road Fund to meet the exigencies of the taxation situation.  I want to suggest to Deputies that this is a formula which has been employed <Col N="259" /> for the first time.  Unless I am greatly mistaken, the purpose of that formula is to prepare the House for the entertaining news that the raid introduced in 1966 is to be a permanent feature of Fianna Fáil taxation.  I shall wait with interest to see if that is so.  If it is, it is a very shortsighted economy.  If the tourist trade is to develop, everybody says from all sides of the House that the road system is an essential part of the infrastructure of an expanding community.  The paragraph I have quoted from page 24 of the Minister's statement augurs ill for the maintenance of that infrastructure of roads.</P>
    <P>The last paragraph I want to refer to is something to which the Minister referred at page 32.  He said:</P>
    <P>During the year, an agreement was entered into for aerial surveys, at State expense, of built up areas of 1,000 population and over.</P>
    <P>Again, 25 years ago I urged in this House that the time was long overdue, not only for the purpose of urban planning but for the Ordnance Survey, for the purpose of archacology, for the Board of Works, for the Department of Agriculture and now, lo and behold, for the Department of Local Government, for an aerial survey to be carried out.  What is going to happen, what always happens when you have incompetence running the Government, is that we are going to have about seven aerial surveys, all independently conducted by seven different Departments, all of them from a different height, all of them from a different angle, all of them at a different season.  It will have occurred to nobody that, if you do not do an aerial survey at approximately the same season, the same height and the same angle, it is impossible to integrate it at all and it becomes virtually useless except for a specific purpose in the strictly limited area where it is conducted.</P>
    <P>In the name of commonsense, if the Department of Agriculture or the Department of Local Government require a survey, if a variety of other Departments are all agreed that an aerial survey is necessary and desirable, <Col N="260" /> is it impossible to get the Departments to sit down together and agree to have it done over the whole country once and for all?  In this way it can be placed on the records of the Ordnance Survey where anybody, instead of getting the map of the peripatetic survey to which he is confined at present, could apply for an aerial map of his own holding or any other area in which he has a legitimate interest.</P>
    <P>Is that commonsense and economy or is the procedure of which the Minister's proposal forms part the sensible way of going about it?  I suggest to the Minister the proposal he envisages in page 32 of his speech is a fragmented, uneconomic and futile effort; but if he approaches the other Minister's to whom I have referred, he may find that by combining resources, not excluding the Department of Defence, it will be possible to get an integrated survey of the whole country which will be of value to all.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with a number of minor issues but I come back to the issue which dominates them all.  That is the knowledge present in the minds of all of us that there are thousands of our neighbours at this moment living in intolerable conditions because they have no homes.  I want the Government to awaken to an appropriate sense of guilt so that they may be actuated with a sense of emergency correctly to marshal our resources in order to remedy this horrible state of affairs.  I draw the attention of the House to volume 194, No. 11, of the Official Report of Dáil Éireann for Wednesday, 11th April, 1962, from which I quote:</P>
    <P>It is true that for some years&mdash; 1957, 1958 and 1959&mdash;we had reached a situation in which housing needs had been almost completely, if not completely, met over the greater part of the country.  In Dublin and in the other cities, the problem of housing had been greatly reduced by emigration.  There was a stage two or three years ago.</P>
    <P>&mdash;when this speech was made in 1962&mdash;</P>
    <P>when Dublin Corporation had 1,500 empty dwellings available for people who needed them...</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="261" /> But the people were not there to occupy them.  The alibi is then advanced that, with the rapid return of the population from Britain to Dublin and the substantial reduction in emigration, the picture has changed completely.  He had not the census figures before him at the time because the author of that paragraph which I have read to the House was Deputy Seán Lemass, the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>Compare the housing situation in 1957, 1958 and 1959 with the situation that obtains today in this year of 1966.  Remember that, in the meantime, we have doubled taxation and, since that speech from which I have read an extract to the House was made, have borrowed between £200 million and £300 million.  Deputy de Valera's constituency is still looking like a bombarded city, to use his own words.  There are thousands of families living four and five in one room and there are uncounted hundreds living in dwellings that ought to be condemned. The Minister may forget all else I say if he remembers that horrible <i>debacle</i> and realises that if he has not a personal responsibility to hang his head for shame, he has joint responsibility, with the other members of the Government who disgrace this country at the present time, to do public penance.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dowling asks what are the Government to do, then&mdash;he does say that, you know&mdash;and he asks me emphatically not to find fault if I am not able to offer them a remedy.  There is only one remedy and that is to go away and to make way for other men who could not be worse than what we have got and I give it as my considered judgment that they would be good for this State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>On page 21 of the Minister's speech on the Estimate for his Department, he mentions the whole question of rents.  This is a particularly controversial subject at local authority level but it must be faced up to in a realistic manner.  Many of the rents in local authority housing were introduced as long ago as 20 and 30 years in some instances.  The Minister states very clearly that the situation <Col N="262" /> must be reassessed, and I agree with him but I would appeal to him to tread with a considerable amount of caution in this controversial area.</P>
      <P>The instances in my view where rents need reassessment are in those families where the children have now grown up and are unmarried and are wage-earners.  Is there any reason why such families, which were subsidised so many years ago, should not now assist in some way those people who are now in need of housing?  I think that is the whole kernel of the problem. Is there any reason why those people who could not afford housing ten or 20 years ago and who now have families earning money should not now be asked to assist young married couples with families of two or three children?  I want to make it quite clear that I am speaking at all times about families who can now afford higher rents.</P>
      <P>People who cannot afford higher rents or increased rents should not be required, in any circumstances, to pay increases.  Let me say, without the unctuous air of the last speaker, that there are many families in this country who will not be in a position to afford rent increases.  At the same time, there are quite a number who can afford them and who should pay increases in rent and these are the people the Minister should keep in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the area I represent, there is speculation as to the possibility of rent increases.  The best way to deal with this type of rumour and speculation is to inform the people of the position by issuing a pamphlet in the areas which will be affected by such rent increases.  The pamphlet should set out clearly particulars as to the people who may be affected and the people who will not be affected by prospective rent increases.  One of the great lacks generally in relation to Government Departments is that the documents or pamphlets they issue are couched in language which is not in general everyday use.  If a pamphlet or document in relation to rent increases is to be produced I urge that it be set out in clear and concise terms so that anybody who reads it will have no difficulty <Col N="263" /> in understanding its precise meaning.</P>
    <P>Deputies are elected to represent, not to misrepresent, and it is on this proposition that I bring before the House particulars of housing conditions and the housing situation in the constituency which I was elected to represent. In many cases&mdash;at local authority level, at any rate&mdash;a married son or a married daughter is living with his or her parents and their family.  This, of course, represents overcrowding.  Now overcrowding, as the last speaker said, brings about a number of situations.  It brings about ill-health; it brings about depression, and worst of all, it brings about broken marriages, admittedly in isolated cases.  It brings about mothers suffering from nerves.  These are the iniquities of overcrowding.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, you have families which are not the subject of local authorities from the point of view of housing until such time as they cannot either pay the rent or the landlord decides for one reason or another he is going to knock down the premises in which they reside.  Until that happens, these do not come under the jurisdiction of local authorities.  I have some experience of these tenants.  I have seen people living in damp basements for which they pay rents which, in some cases, represent a third of the total income coming into that particular family.  On average, it is £3 10s. and £4 10s. a week out of an average wage of £10 or £12 per week.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon says we are unaware of this situation.  We are very much aware of it, but the difference between this Party and Deputy Dillon's Party is that we are doing something about it.  I do not like going back but, if I must, I will go back to 1957.  Deputy Dillon speaks about the number of vacant houses&mdash;1,500.  The real truth is&mdash;Deputy Dillon avoided the issue&mdash; that these 1,500 houses became vacant through emigration and the present housing crux in Dublin city has been brought about because of the number of people coming back to the country and the number of people migrating to the city from the rural areas.  We, on <Col N="264" /> this side of the House, are not trying to avoid the issue.  The Minister has set out concisely what the position is.  He has faced up honestly to the situation. He has not suggested that everything in the housing field is great; it is not and only a fool would delude himself into thinking that it was.</P>
    <P>Another example of overcrowding in the private sector is that in one large house&mdash;I have personal knowledge of this&mdash;a landlord has some nine families living on top of one another in small rooms.  I counted certainly 30 to 35 people.  The income to the landlord is some £30 to £35 per week.  The condition of the house is indescribable, a clear indication to me, at any rate, that the landlord is taking £30 or £35 out of the house and putting nothing back into it.  In my view, this is Rachmanism in its lowest form.  This is a situation this Party is trying to overcome, without, I may say, much help from our friends across the floor.</P>
    <P>The reason for the slow progress in housing in the constituency I represent is patent.  It is brought about primarily because of lack of planners in the town hall.  I am glad the Minister covered this aspect in his opening speech.  He told us that An Foras Forbartha are training young people to planning level.  The moment these people are trained, I appeal to the Minister to assign some of them to Dún Laoghaire where they are badly needed.</P>
    <P>We have in Dún Laoghaire the rather unusual position of a housing officer with one assistant trying to cope with some 3,500 local authority houses. This man's job is very involved.  He deals with repair complaints, rent collection, house transfers, the reallocation of families when new estates are ready for occupation.  The latter does not happen too often unfortunately in this area.  There are not very many new housing estates.  The housing officer does a first-class job, but he needs help.  On the other hand, we have a number of councillors who have been critical of the Minister from the point of view of housing.  I should like to remind these people that the Minister cannot sanction housing for which <Col N="265" /> plans do not exist.  We have three or four pieces of land quite adequate for our housing needs for the next 20 years and my information is that plans have not yet been formulated for these areas.  Councillors should remember that they too have an obligation to do their part of the job.  These plans should be formulated and brought to tender stage.  The Minister cannot do something when he has nothing on which to work.</P>
    <P>One of the great problems in urban areas with regard to private enterprise housing is the taking in charge of the estate subsequently by the local authorities.  In fairness, I should point out that local authorities are governed to a certain extent by out-of-date legislation in this respect.  The Local Authority (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, came into operation in October, 1964.  It is a grand piece of legislation but of course it is not retrospective in effect.  It governs new housing estates after October. 1964. What happens to the estates developed before October, 1964?  In some instances estates developed ten and 15 years ago have yet to be handed over by the developer to the local authority. I would appeal to the Minister to hold an inquiry into this matter of the taking in charge of estates in suburban areas.  It is a matter of urgency now. The tenants are paying rates and other local charges.  They get very little in return.  On the Dromartin estate all they get is a haphazard bin collection once a week.  This estate is ten or 15 years old.  It has not yet been taken in charge.</P>
    <P>There should be an obligation on all developers and on the local planning authority to ensure that there are proper recreational facilities available on new estates.  Road safety receives considerable coverage in the Minister's speech, and rightly so, and I believe that if these recreational centres were available in built-up areas, they would keep children off the streets and roads and there would be fewer accidents involving children.</P>
    <P>I really feel strongly about this.  If you take any area in the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown constituency, <Col N="266" /> from Clonskeagh, Bird Avenue, Clonkeen Road, right up through the constituency, you find magnificent housing estates with no recreational facilities. We talk about the age of computerisation and of machinery coming in to replace the individual.  In 20 years look at the amount of time people will have on their hands and what will they have to do?  There are no tennis courts and no swimming pools and there is no provision in these areas for these recreation centres about which I am speaking.</P>
    <P>I should like now to deal with the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, and I want to reiterate my complete satisfaction with the Act.  It is good legislation but in my view, Part V is not being operated or administered properly and in some instances it is not being administered at all.  As the House is aware, Part V of the Act deals with amenities and section 44 deals with hedges, their alteration or removal. One takes a trip in the country&mdash;and I will just give an instance because I like to give examples to illustrate what I am talking about.  One goes from Renvyle, in Connemara, across to Leenane and from Leenane up to Killary Bay and on to Killary Harbour, and on that trip there is a total blockage of the view on the left-hand side from Leenane and Killary, in the Maam Cross direction, as a result of the hedges.  It is all very well if you are travelling on a CIE bus on a coach tour because then you might possibly be able to see over the hedges, but if you are travelling by car, as quite a number of British tourists do, then you are not high enough.  I am not blaming the Galway County Council for this but I am merely giving an example of what happens.  The same thing happens in Tipperary.</P>
    <P>We have a first-class operation going now with the car ferry in Dún Laoghaire and tourists are entitled, and it is good from the country's point of view, to have these hedges cut down so that they can get a proper look at our scenic views.  We have a lot to be proud of in that respect.  Section 50 of Part V deals with the planting of trees or shrubs.  Again, people do not know <Col N="267" /> about this section.  Residents' associations and other interested bodies should be made aware of it.  I am not sure if I read the section correctly but it refers to &ldquo;land&rdquo; and I assume that land is land in front of people's houses, fields, etc.  It does not define &ldquo;land&rdquo; but one assumes that grass verges would be included.  Here again, if people were made aware of their entitlement to the grant under this section for the planting of trees or shrubs, we would have the beautification of various drab estates around Dublin city and county.  It is a simple matter of asking, but in the first instance people should be told.</P>
    <P>Section 52 of the Act deals with litter and it is interesting to know that there is a fine not execeeding £10 for anybody caught throwing litter&mdash;and litter is described in the usual legal terms and includes waste of all sorts&mdash; on the ground.  I should like to ask the Minister if there are wardens to ensure the implementation of this section, and if there are not, why not?  Another suggestion which I should like to make is that the Department of Local Government, in conjunction with Bord Fáilte, should organise some type of tidy streets competition in the city of Dublin&mdash;I can speak for no other area. One of the main entry points into the city, coming from Dublin Airport, is the route by Gardiner Street.  I am not criticising Gardiner Street because it is a poor area&mdash;far from it&mdash;but because it happens to be a street in Dublin which is one of the most littered streets in the city.  Why cannot the corporation ensure that these points of entry are kept tidy by setting up competitions among the various streets?  After all, we have soccer leagues working very successfully in the city and this is a co-operative effort.  There should be some inducement to keep the streets tidy on the same lines as the Tidy Towns Competition.  Look at what it has achieved.  It has done an awful lot for many towns and villages.  This competition is one of the best schemes ever introduced.</P>
    <P>The Minister dealt at length with arterial roads, main roads and county <Col N="268" /> roads, and one of the suggestions I would make is that a major roads policy should be formulated and the arterial road scheme should be taken over by a committee representative of the local authorities.  The committee should be a small one for the purpose of cohesion and the making of quick decisions.  My reason for making this suggestion is very obvious.  In some instances, driving across one county boundary to another, you may find yourself driving from a magnificent arterial road on to a boreen representative of an arterial road.  This is where co-operation between two counties comes into play.  A policy should be formulated by the Department of Local Government to ensure continuity on arterial roads between county and county.</P>
    <P>Again, to give an example, take the Dublin-Stillorgan-Shankill-Bray Road. Dublin Corporation is involved up to some place after Donnybrook, where the boundary ends.  Then you go on to Stillorgan and touch on the so-called arterial road&mdash;it is not an arterial road; it is a joke&mdash;and you touch on the Dún Laoghaire Borough area and then you come back into the county.  You go on to Bray and you come to the Bray Urban District Council area and possibly you go on into the Wicklow County Council area.</P>
    <P>Here you have six different local authorities involved.  I understand that Dublin Corporation will begin to complete their section in the very near future.  What happens to the other five local authorities?  When will they complete their sections?  When, in fact, will we have an arterial road?  This is why I say those six authorities should come together and give a date for the beginning and completion of that particular scheme.</P>
    <P>There has been a lot of criticism of the Ballymun scheme.  I went up to see that scheme and I really think the Minister has a lot to be proud of. We have there 3,021 houses, the replacement of 3,021 Dublin families. This means that on top of those 3,021 Dublin families you have another 2,000 coming into the vacuum created by the replacement of those houses, so in <Col N="269" /> effect, you have a total of 5,000 people being rehoused in a small number of years.</P>
    <P>Again, I may say, it does not complete the picture.  The picture has yet to be completed.  The document presented to the House by the Minister comprises 43 pages and we have all read it pretty thoroughly.  The Minister has left nothing unsaid.  He has presented it honestly.  He is not trying to hide anything and this is why criticism, generally, of this Estimate has not been at its highest or its greatest from the Opposition.  He recognises that in some instances no money is available but he gives an assurance that when money becomes available, he will implement what is in this particular document.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to one final point in Deputy Dillon's speech.  He cites a rather invidious case.  He states that in this House we built new Party rooms.  I would like to remind Deputy Dillon that while he goes into those Party rooms and also while his Party go into them, his Party acquiesce in the building of that particular skyscraper, as I think he called it.</P>

      <P>The housing situation in the city of Dublin seems to have dominated this debate up to now.  I come from a constituency <Col N="270" /> which also has a serious housing situation.  Over the past few years, I have, time and time again, in the debate on the annual Estimate for the Department of Local Government referred to the housing situation in the city of Limerick.  The housing situation in the city of Limerick is still bad.  It is as bad as the housing situation in Dublin and the housing situation in Cork, as outlined last night by Deputy Barrett.</P>
      <P>The position is that we have roughly 900 to 1,000 applicants waiting for new houses.  In the financial year 1965-66, Limerick Corporation provided 239 houses.  This, let it be said, was a big improvement on the output of houses in the previous nine years. In fact, this figure of 239 is approximately the same figure as the output of houses in Limerick during the period of office of the inter-Party Government. Unfortunately this output of 239 houses, which was reached in the last financial year, does not seem likely to be maintained in the present financial year or in the coming financial year. As well as the number of applicants running up to 1,000, new applicants are coming on the housing list every other day.  On the basis of an annual output of 200 houses, it will be five years, assuming this figure is maintained in the coming year, before the present applicants are housed and by that time many hundreds more new applicants will have come on the housing list.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a particularly serious problem in Limerick city in the matter of sub-tenants in corporation dwellings who will not be given consideration for new houses by virtue of the fact that they are sub-tenants.  This is a deadly situation.  Much of the gravity of the Limerick housing situation arises from the problem that many corporatin dwellings have two and three families residing in the one building.  I have personally examined the situation in hundreds of those houses in recent years.  In most cases those so-called sub-tenants are living with their in-laws because when a son of the household or a daughter of the household married, they were unable to get <Col N="271" /> any other accommodation.  Therefore, they had to take up residence in the parental homestead.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health represents the same constituency as I represent. The Minister for Local Government, in a letter to him, referred to this question of sub-tenants.  I quote here from the <i>Cork Examiner:</i></P>
    <P>Limerick's housing problems will be eased.  Limerick's big backlog of sub-tenants in corporation houses who are looking for houses of their own may be eased as a result of a communication received by the Minister for Health from the Minister for Local Government.  The Minister for Local Government pointed out that the scale of preferences for new houses does not distinguish between sub-tenants of local authority houses and others.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley, the then Minister for Health, now Minister for Education, said:</P>
    <P>Reading the Minister's letter it is quite obvious sub-tenants of corporation houses had the right of consideration for new houses.  Mr. O'Malley expressed the hope that Limerick Corporation would have a full discussion on this particular question in view of the fact that there were so many people living as sub-tenants in overcrowded conditions in corporation dwellings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>You have me caught out but I venture to say it was within the past month.  Anyway, the Minister put forward a suggestion for solving the housing situation in Limerick city and, peculiarly enough, he puts forward the obvious answer. He puts forward the obvious answer, the answer I put forward here on numerous occasions summed up in three words: &ldquo;Build more houses&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the figures I quoted in regard to Limerick Corporation relating to the houses which have been built in the last financial year, 239, and the <Col N="272" /> number of houses on hands at the present time and the number of houses at the planning stage, I see very little likelihood of Limerick Corporation achieving over the next three or four years an average annual output of 250 houses.  I was very glad to see within the past week that tenders had been invited for the erection of houses in a scheme which has now become famous, and a household word in Limerick, by reason of the fact that the proposals for erecting houses on this particular scheme have been discussed time and time again over the last ten years.  I refer to the Watergate housing scheme.</P>
    <P>I want to urge on the Minister the importance of getting this particular housing scheme under way as quickly as possible and I would also ask the Minister, when he is replying to this debate, to please clarify the question of the right of sub-tenants in corporation dwellings to consideration for new houses.  It is an extremely serious situation and it is something that will have to be faced.  Are they entitled to consideration or are they not?  Is this just a rule imposed by Limerick Corporation or is it a Departmental rule?  There is complete chaos and complete confusion regarding this particular question and a recent letter from the Minister for Local Government to the Minister for Education did not throw any light on this question. I think Deputy Barrett referred to it here last night in relation to Cork. As I said, the number of houses built in Limerick by Limerick Corporation in the last financial year showed an improvement but we still have a terrible and a very deplorable housing situation in Limerick.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his brief referred to certain meetings held in recent months and he mentioned that he had carried out a special investigation in the Limerick city area in response to allegations of a crisis there in the building industry.  He said that he was glad of the full co-operation of the housing authorities and all concerned who worked out a solution which would guarantee the continuance of a reasonable level of building in this city.  As one who is involved, and who has <Col N="273" /> attended these meetings, I, too, agree with the Minister that this co-operative approach was a good one.  Unfortunately, an atmosphere of crisis had to prevail before steps were taken and the Minister did act pretty promptly when pressure was put on him.  In fact, all concerned in the provision of housing were brought together, the housing authority, public representatives, building contractors and the trade union to work out a solution and I, too, join with the Minister in expressing a hope that this will lead to the continuance of a reasonable level of building in Limerick city.</P>
    <P>We as public representatives are particularly concerned about the continuance of building at a reasonable level, not merely by virtue of the fact that we have a tremendous backlog of housing applicants&mdash;we have numberous problems and many families live in the most deplorable conditions&mdash; but also by reason of the fact that the building industry is a considerable source of employment in our particular region and I do hope the Minister will see to it that nothing happens between now and when we come to discuss the next Estimate for this Department to disrupt the building industry.</P>
    <P>In addition to the provision of houses there is another problem to which the Minister referred in his opening speech and which applies also very much to Limerick city.  It is the question of the maintenance of existing corporation dwellings.  I am glad to know that the Minister is getting tough with the various local authorities in the matter of ensuring that corporation or local authority dwellings are kept in a reasonable state of repair.  I am also concerned about what is perhaps the most vexed question of all, the question of rents in corporation dwellings.  We had a state of war in Limerick regarding the recent increases in the rents of corporation houses.  I concede it is a difficult problem.  It is not easy to work out a formula which would be entirely equitable, but I think the situation will have to be faced up to and that a formula will have to be arrived at which will ensure that the very poorest families will enjoy the best possible housing accommodation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="274" /> I think rent increases will have to be spaced out and we must not have a situation such as happened in Limerick in the past year of substantial increases being piled on at the same time.  Of course, also on the question of corporation housing schemes.  I believe it is vitally essential to provide proper amenities, particularly in the matter of playgrounds and so forth.</P>
    <P>There is another matter which arises on this particular Estimate in which I am particularly interested and to which I referred on a number of occasions before.  The Minister mentions it here.  It is the question of the provision of water supplies in rural areas in particular, the question of group water schemes where groups of people, through co-operative effort, have provided a water supply for themselves. As one who has been involved in at least six of those schemes in my constituency, I am an enthusiastic believer in this approach but I regret to say that certain problems can arise, and have arisen, in some of these schemes.</P>
    <P>I believe it is vitally essential that the Department of Local Government in administering these grants should take great care to ensure that these schemes are organised in the best and most economical way, and that when the tap is turned on, the source of supply is adequate to meet the needs. There have been a number of cases, I understand, where the water supply was found subsequently to be inadequate. I am glad to say that from inquiries I made, there are only very few cases.  Another thing which can happen, and has happened in my constituency, is that the type of pump used to pump the water to the various dwellings may not be good enough to maintain an adequate supply at all times. However, despite these sangs which have arisen, the group water schemes have proved very successful.  In fact, they could be pushed with much greater vigour than heretofore.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>During the whole of the last Fianna Fáil speaker's remarks, outside of the few congratulatory words to the Minister at the beginning. <Col N="275" /> he spoke of the want of swimming pools, the want of arterial roadways and the want of everything apparently. I wonder does he forget that a Fianna. Fáil Government have been in this country since 1932, with two exceptions of approximately three years each and that for the past ten years a Fianna Fáil Government has been in office.  Is he in the wrong Party, I wonder?  Should he be over with Fine Gael?  I know he would never fit into the Party to which I belong.  If he has all the grievances with the Minister of his own Party he has paraded here this evening, anyone reading his speech in the Dáil Report&mdash;not in the newspapers, because I am quite sure the newspaper people have too much sense to pay attention to a lot of it&mdash; would think he belonged to the Fine Gael Party and not to his own Party at all.  It is a very small point but it just struck me to remind him of the fact that he is in the Fianna Fáil Party. I do not think it reasonable to say that the Minister was a great boy and even with regard to the new building, that Opposition Deputies who went out of their own quarters into it were responsible for the expenditure.  Surely the people in Government are the people who decide to have a new building? I am all for the new building; I do not think there is anything wrong with it.  We need a lot of extra things here but to blame the Opposition for things done is stupid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Minister's speech, he seems to make the point that money is the obstacle.  I do not know whether he is right or wrong.  I accept the fact that the present Minister, or any other Minister of any Party, is as anxious as I am to see adequate houses provided for the people, but that is not enough.  It is his responsibility to see that the money is provided.  It is no use telling those of us who have experience of local authorities&mdash;it does not matter what your politics are or what county council, urban council or other body of which you are a member&mdash; otherwise.  For the past year money has not been available for housing.  I can give facts and figures and there is no point in saying there is money <Col N="276" /> available for the tenders sanctioned, because it is very easy not to sanction a tender, very easy to submit 100 tenders in the year from the county council and find fault with every one of them. Very often the estimate will not comply in some way or other.  You can keep doing that indefinitely and I suggest that is what has been done for the past year deliberately.</P>
    <P>To come to my own county council, where I have knowledge of the needs in housing, of over 60 approved cases for rehousing and passed through all the fine meshes, we have got sanction for the building of eight houses in this financial year, and eight only.  We have been allocated £16,000, not a halfpenny more, and we are not to expect a halfpenny more after next March.  Notwithstanding that, there are 100 other applicants going through the mesh, and what will happen to them?  Is it possible that the Minister can stand up here in the House and say : &ldquo;There is no financial stringency, we will give more money than was ever given before&rdquo;.  He knows he is talking nonsense, I know he is talking nonsense and I am quite sure the public in this country know he is talking nonsense.  You cannot build houses on promises and all we have got from the Minister in his 43 page speech are promises.</P>
    <P>If the Minister has the money, I challenge him to direct it to Waterford city, where there are hundreds upon hundreds of families craving for houses, to Waterford county, where there are at least 160 people craving for houses and to my own region in Dungarvan where there are 100 families craving for houses.  I can assure him, on behalf of Waterford Corporation, Waterford County Council and on behalf of the urban council, there will be no delay in implementing such building.  Give us the right to go ahead.</P>
    <P>I would suggest to the Minister that he should take a tip from the practice of the first Labour Minister for Local Government, the late T.J. Murphy, and go down to Waterford, Cork and Tipperary and meet the local people at local level and ask them, as Tim <Col N="277" /> Murphy asked them: &ldquo;What are the difficulties; what do you want?&rdquo; If he has not the money and cannot do that, at least let him be honest enough to stand up here in Dáil Éireann and say: &ldquo;Look, the country is in a bad state for a time; we will have to tighten our belts; you will have to do without&rdquo;. We will understand that, but I do not understand a Minister giving a 43 page speech and pretending that everything is fine.  It is not fine and the Minister knows that.  I know it; the members of my Party know it; the Opposition know it.  Bluff will not get us anywhere.</P>
    <P>If we have to make a sacrifice, if there is a crisis in this country, the Opposition are as good as the people in government in understanding this. We are able to take that and, if it is necessary, we can criticise the Government for bringing us into that position but, in a national emergency, we are as prepared as the Government to stand behind this country because we do not want it to go down, any more than they do.  We have to live here and I feel the Minister has done a disservice to the country by appearing to say : &ldquo;Everything in the garden is lovely&rdquo;, rather than saying: &ldquo;The position is such that we have not got the money at the moment and you will have to wait&rdquo;. As I have said&mdash;and I am delighted to see the Minister come in&mdash;you cannot build houses on promises and the Minister's promises do not get us in Waterford anywhere; neither do they get the people elsewhere anywhere.</P>
    <P>In the new circular we have got from the Minister, it was suggested that we increase the rents of well-to-do people in local authority houses.  The county manager is the local authority, the executive power.  Is it suggested that the county manager would use that to reduce the rents of people on low incomes.  Is there any guarantee that that would be done?  Can the Minister guarantee that it would be done?  The county manager is the executive power; he is the local authority.  Once we on the local authority agree to an increase, we have no further function as to what happens the money.  I seriously suggest that the increased contribution coming <Col N="278" /> in should be put to reducing the rates for the man of property.  I suggest that it would end with the ordinary working class people paying higher rents to reduce the rates of landlords and people with business concerns, and of people with factories and firms where they do not live.  It would bring down the rates and compel the workers to subsidise industry and business.  I decline to agree to that until I get some satisfaction, and until the Minister signs a circular and an Act of Parliament compelling the county managers to do what he suggests they should do.  I have not all that much confidence that the county managers will obey a direction from the Minister.  I have too much knowledge of them and I know the heed they give to a direction from the Minister.</P>
    <P>The same applies to town planning. The local authorities must adopt the Town Planning Act within three years from a certain date.  That is the law which was made by us.  What happens when a local authority do that?  They adopt the Act and from that day on they have no further say.  It is the manager and his officials who decide everything.  I suggest that is neither democracy nor fair play.  The local authorities elected by the people for five years should have at least some control and some say over what the manager decides.  I challanged the manager on this.  He is easy going and co-operative.  He pointed out the law to me.  Once we passed the Town Planning Act, the members of a local authority have no further say as to what he does.  It is only by courtesy that he will accept any recommendation we make.  I do not think that is good enough.  It is completely wrong.  It is against the spirit in which the Act was passed.  The Minister should have a further look at that.  There should be some safeguards to prevent a county manager from ignoring recommendations made by local authorities who, after all, are living in their own areas and are in touch with the people and should be better judges of what is good for the area than the county manager.</P>
    <P>I am tried of hearing the slogan about death on the roads.  I remember attending a safety first meeting about <Col N="279" /> three years ago at which I made a statement that every year more people would be killed on the roads.  I say it again.  Every year from this year on more people will be killed on the roads because in direct proportion to the car population increase, deaths will occur.  There is no doubt about that. I do agree with the Minister that we should make every effort to reduce the number of deaths.  Does the Minister seriously suggest that this farce of a driving test will do that?  It is not a question of whether you are capable of driving a car.  The first question you are asked is: what colour is the signal on a traingle at a junction?  What does it matter what colour it is?  If you know what it means, is that not enough?  I have listened to people being tested and it has given me a pain in my stomach.  Another question is: what does a red light with green on the side mean?  In Dublin it means a filter, but you do not have filters in the country.  What is the smart alec of an inspector trying to do?  The result is that 49 per cent of all applicants fail the test.  On what?  It is a test of memory.</P>
    <P>I saw on television that the Minister took the test and passed.  I should like to take the Minister out on a driving test with me as the examiner and ask him the rules of the road.  I wonder would he pass.  If I were Minister for Local Government, I could take the test tomorrow and I am sure I would pass it, but if I as Deputy Kyne took the test, I am pretty sure I would fail it, and I am pretty sure every one of us in the House who has had a licence for 20 years, and no accidents, would fail the test as now administered.  This is not keeping death off the road.  It is bringing misery and trouble to the applicants.  I know what I am talking about.  I know competent drivers who failed the test.  For what?  Was it to prove that someone was doing his job? The Minister should see to it that it is a test of driving and not a memory test.</P>
    <P>It does not matter whether a sign is in red, green, white or black, but before your driving is tested, there is <Col N="280" /> this oral test.  Whether a sign is in red, green or blue does not make any difference.  If you can read, you can read and understand it.  I suggest to the Minister that he should advise his 12 examiners to be ordinary human beings and to turn down only those persons who are a danger to the public.  If the tests were applied to the 144 Deputies here, as it has been applied to my knowledge, only the Minister for Local Government would get through, and then only because he is Minister for Local Government.</P>
    <P>Suggestions have been made during the course of this debate as to the causes of deaths on the roads. Drink has been mentioned as a main cause.  I want to refer now to controls on the main roads.  I do not think that speed limits are the answer.  I know this is not the Minister's function but I hope I will be permitted to suggest to him that he should advise the Minister for Justice to consider patrols on the main roads by policemen on motor cycles.  A policeman patrolling the roads between towns would prevent more accidents than anything I know of.  On my trips to Dublin every week, I find that the biggest danger is a lorry or a car parked as you come up to a bend, so that you have to swerve out to the right with the danger of crashing into an incoming car.  The fact that a person knew there was a policeman on a motor cycle patrolling the main roads, and the fact that he knew he was in danger of being found out doing something wrong, would be more effective than trying to enforce a speed limit of 30, 50, 60 miles an hour, or whatever the figure might be.</P>
    <P>Gardaí are very often occupied in doing small things, seeing whether you are one foot out from the kerb or going over 30 mph in an urban area.  Anybody who goes over 30 mph in a built-up area is not a case for prosecution but a case to send to the mental hospital.  Anybody except a mental case found doing more than that speed in a built-up area should not be fined but should be banned completely.  I have driven in towns and I have never done even 20 mph, more often 15 or <Col N="281" /> ten, because one drivers according to the traffic.  But when you give local authorities powers you give the chief of police in the area, the local engineer and perhaps a Department inspector powers also.  Naas was a typical case where the 30 mph signs were almost 1½ miles from the built-up area.  You had it also in Athy.  These signs are now revised but I have seen a 30 mph sign two miles from my own town. Surely that is crazy.  That is not intended to achieve anything.  It is a question of giving a little power to local authorities and they carry it to the fullest extent.  The Minister should have all signs re-examined and only erected where they will achieve some purpose.  Although he may not like it he should go to the north of Ireland where they have done this job intelligently and where signs are found only adjacent to the built-up areas.  Outside Youghal you find the first 30 mph sign and you must drive for five miles before you get out of the controlled area because the signs are so far outside the town and Youghal is a long straggling town.  The Minister would be well advised to examine such cases.</P>
    <P>There are some small points to which I want to draw the Minister's attention.  Under the new Housing Act I understand a farmer with a valuation of £60 or under could now qualify for a Small Dwellings Acquisition loan if a regulation to be made by the Minister were brought into force.  I understand that regulation is not in force notwithstanding the fact that the Act has been passed for some time. There are many farmers of a valuation between £50 and £60 in urgent need of housing and they would qualify for a loan if that regulation was brought in. The Minister should examine the position and, if possible, put the regulation in force as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I do not want to start a controversy on local government but I should like to know the Minister's opinion as to the effect on his Department of the closing of the Fermoy-Dungarvan-Mallow line. Will we in the Waterford-Cork area where all traffic must be diverted from the railway, when it is closed, to the roads, get special consideration? <Col N="282" /> Apparently a different Minister has decided the railway will close.  Will we get increased grants to align the roads and reconstruct bridges and also to cope with maintenance?  Does the Minister not feel that he is interested in this closure and that he should have some say or should have been represented either personally or through his officials at the closure meeting when we met CIE?  As the Minister responsible for roads and the charges imposed through his Department he has at least some responsibility but apparently he stands by and is quite happy that all this traffic is being diverted to the roads.  That may be all right for him: he gets the money from the taxpayers but in my constituency the people must pay up as ratepayers and as taxpayers and suffer the loss of service.  I am beholden to the Chair for permitting me to go that far and I have no intention of going beyond that as I know I was sailing close to the wind in bringing up this subject but I felt I had to make the point.</P>
    <P>I should like to conclude by suggesting that the Minister would be well advised to take a leaf out of the book of the late Deputy Tim Murphy who was Minister for Local Government and come down to the country and meet representatives of the county councils and local authorities and discuss with us our problems.  I am certain he would meet with consideration and help and would only hear what we feel is important.  If he gives us co-operation I am quite sure he will get our co-operation in return.</P>

      <P>I was very pleased to hear Deputy Kyne say that he would appreciate what was in the national interest in a national crisis.  That is no more than I would expect from the Deputy.  But in his criticism of the Minister as regards not being honest and fair with the nation and the local authorities in particular, I think the Deputy must have rather a short memory.  Last April, and I think each year in my time in the county council, the Minister sent down a fixed sum to each council and advised them what they were getting in that year so that they could adjust their schemes and <Col N="283" /> adapt them accordingly.  To me that was nothing but frank and honest, not deluding anybody by false promises or wishful thinking.  For that I thank the Minister although perhaps we had to cut our cloth a little more than we wished to do.  In South Tipperary the Minister came to our assistance again and gave us sufficient money to enable us to commence the building of 23 rural cottages in the county council area.  This was more than welcome but on the occasion of this news being announced I regret to say that the applause at the meeting was not nearly as vocal as the criticism of the Minister in the previous eight or nine months when we heard nothing but: &ldquo;There are no houses being built.&rdquo;  Somebody must be suffering from their imagination because in spite of being told that no houses were being built, in every urban area in South Tipperary houses were in fact being built.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>That is in my constituency. The Deputy is in Waterford County Council and I will leave that end of it to him to deal with.  In Cashel there were eight houses; in Clonmel 68 completed since April and 32 in progress and 24 at the planning stage plus the fact that there is an immense National Building Agency scheme going on there also.  I would say that in this year alone Clonmel must have almost reached the zenith of building since the formation of the State.  In Tipperary town there are 12 houses in progress and almost completed and 28 at the planning stage. In the county council area 37 cottages will be built.  This is no small tribute to the Minister in these times of difficult credit restrictions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="284" /> Another aspect of the Minister's Estimate which I found encouraging was the provision of grants for private housing water supplies and sewerage. This sector alone shows an increase of £365,000 or £1,000 per day.  That is surely a mark of real progress.  The Minister quite rightly pointed to the importance not only of completing plans at present in hand but of getting schemes prepared so that when plans now in hand are completed, there will be a follow-up instead of the interminable delays there have been between the completion of one scheme and the beginning of another.  I am glad Deputy Hogan has arrived to hear me say that in Cashel eight houses have been completed and the trouble is who will get them.  The point is that plans for the future have not been made and a scheme has not been prepared for submission to the Department. This is not peculiar to Cashel.  About 50 per cent of the local authorities who have been asked to submit plans of housing needs in the future have not done so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has been honest with the local authorities.  He has told them exactly how much they will get, and in fact has increased the amounts.  Peculiarly enough, when Deputy L'Estrange's Party were in Coalition on the last occasion, they left one builder in South Tipperary due £58,000 for houses completed.  He had no hope of getting it, and were it not for the goodness of the bank, he would have gone bankrupt.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonalDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>The colossal sum of £25½ million being spent on housing this year represents the biggest sum ever spent in a year.  Admittedly, housing costs have gone up and the full value of this vast amount of money will not be seen in the number of houses built.  However, we are keeping pace with the demand and there will <Col N="285" /> be no diminution in the effort to rehouse our people as satisfactorily and speedily as possible.  It is gratifying to note that the housing target of 11,000 houses is double what it was in 1965-66. We have already superseded the target of the Second Programme in housing, a target which was criticised at the time as a fantasy.  That fantasy has been proved a fact, having been achieved and exceeded.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to a difficulty confronting every local authority, the question of land acquisition.  This has been a real problem which from time to time has upset many schemes.  For instance, the village of Ardfinnan has been left without a scheme.  When money was freer, a scheme for Ardfinnan would have been a reality, had not objections to the acquisition of a site been fostered and prolonged.</P>
      <P>In this matter of housing, there is something we tend to forget.  When we or any other Government build houses, we must remember that when they are completed, there will be demand for more.  Some houses will get old and in a few years will not be suitable for habitation.  A few years later they will not be fit to live in.  There is also the natural growth in the population which will also increase demand for houses. Therefore, we shall never be able to outstep the demand but we can hope to keep pace with it and try to cope with the back-log.  This situation is not peculiar to this country.  Short and long term building programmes are therefore very necessary and we cannot emphasise this too much.  All local authorities fall down here.  Say there is a demand for 30 or 40 houses.  They deal with that demand alone, forgetting that when that scheme has been completed, there will still be 30 or 40 more people in need of housing.  We fail to take sufficient cognisance of this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like the Minister, in future proposals, to provide for grants for dower houses of the prefabricated type.  A number of farmers in my constituency have built such houses and vacated their homesteads but nowadays they are precluded from getting grants.  These timber chalets are quite durable and are guaranteed for 50 <Col N="286" /> years.  The old couples who go into them will hardly be looking for replacements in 50 years' time.  When the old people have no further need for such houses, the structures could be transferred elsewhere, possibly to neighbouring farms, for the accommodation of other aged people in the district.  Such a scheme would have many advantages, not the least of which is that system built houses stabilise employment in the building industry.</P>
    <P>It was very forcibly stressed at a TUC Congress in Britain some years ago that the building industry suffers mostly from the elements.  In winter here, we see the majority of our building personnel disemployed if there is a heavy freeze up.  Many of them emigrate or take alternative employment and many of those who go never return.  They are a great loss because they are skilled craftsmen whom it will take five to seven years to replace. An apprentice serves three years and the acquiring of experience takes another two at least.  By embarking on system-built houses, we would be securing the employment of very important personnel and would be improving our housing conditions.</P>
    <P>The new Planning Act has been referred to.  It is a very good Act which was badly needed.  Before it was enacted, there was a lot of building of an undesirable type.  Many of our scenic areas such as the Glen of Aherlow and various coastal districts were despoiled by the erection of corrugated structures and sheds made of tin cans and old barrels, sometimes adjacent to some excellent schemes. At least the new Act requires that if they are built at all, they must be put in places where they will not be seen and will not take from our amenities.</P>
    <P>There has been criticism of the delays in dealing with objections. Nearly three months ago a project by Hibernian interests for the building of a hotel at Palmer's Hill, Cashel, was passed by the planning officer and outline permission granted.  There was an oral hearing in Cashel on the first Friday in July.  The result of that oral hearing has not yet been <Col N="287" /> made known.  Surely it does not take all that length of time to decide such a simple issue, because that is really what it was.  There was no valid objection.  The weight of evidence was certainly in favour of the proposers of the development, and the objection to it was, to say the least, very scanty and in a court of law would probably be thrown out.</P>
    <P>There is little point in local authorities sending off qualified personnel on courses lasting up to two years at expense not merely to the personnel involved but to the ratepayers and taxpayers, if these people, when they come back, are not considered competent to adjudicate and decide on what is or is not proper.  Admittedly, there must be a right of appeal.  It would be detracting from people's rights if there was not the right of appeal&mdash;a person could be biased one way or the other&mdash;but surely an appeal should not take three months to decide. That is what I object to, this delay at departmental level on this issue.</P>
    <P>On private housing, it is more than encouraging to note that the expenditure on house purchase loans and supplementary grants issued to local authorities in 1965-66 amounted to over £6 million.  This compares more than favourably with the 1964-65 figure and indicates an increase of £1.4 million.  This is real progress and is something of which we on this side of the House feel justly proud and on which we compliment the Minister. I would compliment him at any time, but more especially on this magnificent achievement.</P>
    <P>Another matter which has given rise to much conjecture and quite a lot of misrepresentation is the differential rents structure.  The main aim of this scheme is not to increase people's rent but rather to decrease it for those who cannot afford to pay a high rent, an economic rent or a rent which might be deemed to be economic in respect of these schemes.  It is a boon to people living on old age pensions, widows' pensions, home assistance or social welfare benefits of one kind or another, to find that some of them <Col N="288" /> can have a house for as little as 1/-. This is social justice in the best sense of the term.</P>

      <P>If there were not a differential rent structure, people who have not yet come into possession of local authority housing would later find themselves faced with exorbitant rents, rents which they could not afford to pay or, indeed, which many people of higher incomes could not afford to pay.</P>
      <P>I was perturbed about the question of the allocation of moneys for cottage repairs.  I appreciate that while there is a capital shortage, loans for cottage repairs must take a place in the priority list, but every effort should be made to devote funds to this very worthwhile project.  If a house is left without repairs when needed the cost of the repairs it will require in the end will have far outstripped the original cost.  Therefore, I would ask the Minister to consider urgently the allocation of moneys for house and cottage repairs. In South Tipperary, we have been generous in our allocation of money but it is not possible to find everything from the rates, and we would welcome further help in that direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A great deal of comment and, I might add, political play, has been made on the cost of road development. I suppose it is very hard to blame the Opposition for jumping on everything they can.  However, we ought to take a lesson from the experience in England where they have found the money they expended on the development of roads such as the M.1 has paid off well so far as human lives are <Col N="289" /> concerned.  The volume of traffic there has increased tenfold and the accident rate has not.  Therefore, good roads must, by their very structure and the amenities which they provide, ensure greater safety for road users.</P>
    <P>Today we in Ireland are facing a new era in motorisation.  It is expected that in ten years' time there will be three times as much traffic on the roads as there is today.  If our roads do not keep pace with this, there will be nothing but congestion and horrifying accidents.  An example of the volume of traffic on our roads can be found between here and Naas.  It is relatively light on the dual carriageway but when you come to the end of the dual carriageway and through Rathcoole, cars are practically bumper to bumper, whether you are coming up or going down.  This is the experience day after day when I travel through that area. It brings home very forcibly the amount of traffic that is building up and will continue to build up over the next decade.  If we do not take steps to deal with the situation, it will become very much worse in a few years' time. If we do not make some headway towards providing a proper road service, we shall be doing an injustice not merely to present road users but to the people who will become road users in future years.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased to compliment the designers of the majority of local authority schemes.  They have made provision for green areas.  At first I must confess these areas did not appear to be scenic but now, due to the activities of Muintir na Tíre and other allied voluntary organisations, these areas are bedecked with flower beds.  Due credit must be given to the initiators of the Tidy Towns Competition in urging people to be more civic-minded and to take a greater pride in the town or area in which they live.  It has paid off.  In all the towns that I pass through on my way home, I find that their scenic appearance has increased out of all knowledge compared with the position a few short years ago.  In the town of Abbeyleix, a tremendous effort is being made.  The inhabitants there <Col N="290" /> seem to take a particular pride in their town.  I should like to compliment them on that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> I read through the Minister's rather lengthy document.  He covered many aspects of his Department's activities in his speech and, as was to be expected, he dealt with a matter in which he seems to be particularly interested, the question of road accidents. This is a problem of which every public representative must be conscious in every country.  There will never be a final answer to it.  Here, the Minister intimates that the time may come when he will have car inspection as well as the driver's test to which people now have to submit.</P>
      <P>I have never been able to come to any decision as to whether these beautiful roads that we make prevent accidents or cause them.  I personally believe that on a speedway which encourages speed when an accident does occur the accident will be a very formidable one.  The type of accident we are getting nowadays, a number of them head-on collisions, appear to be peculiarly destructive, from pictures that one sees of a car almost completely written off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it was Deputy P. O'Donnell who used to speak of autobahns being created for bureaucrats when he was Minister for Local Government, but, whatever we do about the driver and whatever we do about the car and whatever we may do about the roads, the ultimate test is behaviour on the road, what a person does when driving. I may pass a test as a driver; I may have an excellent car, and yet I may be a danger on the road.  The <Col N="291" /> ultimate test is how the person drives. That can only be controlled ultimately by the institution of some form of speed control and speed policemen such as they have in the States and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Any of us who drives will have the experience every day we go on the road of finding some chap who cuts out in front of us or comes towards us on the wrong side, driving recklessly. He probably has an excellent car; he probably is a very good driver and has passed his test, but he is a danger on the road, an undue risk.  I do not know how you can control him unless you have the roads policed.  I believe that will have to be the ultimate solution in so far as we can ever find a solution to the road accident problem.  It is a solution which has been adopted in most countries which have a more serious problem than we have and, particularly for areas of high traffic density, ultimately it will be the solution that we will have to adopt here.</P>
    <P>Despite what Deputy Davern and other speakers on the Government side of the House have said about spending on local government housing, there is no question but that the building industry is under serious strain at the present time.  Whenever there is an economic crisis, building is one of the first industries to be hit and in any country the Minister for Local Government or the Minister for Housing, as the case may be, is one of the persons who come in for very severe criticism. He usually has to take the tough end of things, although he personally may be completely or largely blameless for the situation which confronts him.  In so far as building is concerned, in any economic squeeze he is immediately the target for the Opposition and the target for every adverse comment of script writers and members of the public and, indeed, that is so here.  Our present Minister has been severely criticised for his handling of the housing situation.</P>
    <P>To the ordinary public representative here, the Minister's speech has not conveyed deep interest, apart from <Col N="292" /> housing, water supplies and to a less extent, roads.  I have heard representatives from Dublin, Limerick and Cork criticising the housing situation in their areas.  In my constituency we are also badly situated as regards housing.  A few years ago we had difficulty in getting contractors, at a time when there was some money, to build labourers' cottages.  The Department of Local Government had set a ceiling on what they would give to contractors for labourers' cottages.  To overcome the difficulty that arose from that, insofar as we found difficulty in getting contractors, our engineer came to an arrangement with local contractors to specialise and to be available to do a group of cottages as they arose and they advertised these cottages in groups.  That worked satisfactorily insofar as some contractors set themselves aside to do this work.  Now, unfortunately, we find that we have not the work for them and these men who had more or less dropped other activities now find that the county council is not able to give them adequate employment.  This is one small example of what always happens in a stop-go policy as it affects building.</P>
    <P>Indeed, private building in my area has slowed down considerably.  A building contractor living a few doors from me has let off a considerable number of his employees.  He tells me that his only hope is that in the near future there will be still some building coming from church bodies. Apparently, church bodies are able to knock a few bob out of their parishioners when the Government are unable to knock it out of the public and he is still hoping that there will be some work from that source. There has been a slowing up of work in private building and they have been forced to let some of their men go.</P>
    <P>In South Tipperary, according to our officials, we need about 500 houses. These houses at present would be let on a very strict basis.  It is estimated, however, under the more liberal approach of the new Housing Bill, where you can bring in small farmers, three times that number of houses might be required.  But taking the present figure of 500, we have planned <Col N="293" /> to build this year only 15 houses. A few years ago in South Tipperary, we built only one house in one year &mdash;that in a county council where we have perhaps 3,000 or 3,500 houses. Fifteen houses per year would not meet even the normal rate of obsolescence. It is clear we simply cannot solve our housing problem as regards the public sector at that rate.  Despite what some Deputies on the other side may say, it is clear we have not, certainly in my constituency, come to grips with the housing situation as it exists.</P>
    <P>I do not know the position clearly in the urban bodies in my area because I am a member of only a small body, Cashel Urban Council.  For years we have been trying to get a housing scheme going.  We are just completing eight houses.  We looked for 12 and the Department eventually sanctioned eight.  It is clear they should have sanctioned the 12 houses because the demand is there.  In Clonmel, a survey taken some time ago shows there are 90 condemned houses.  In some of the non-urban towns, like Mullinahone and Cahir, there is a large number of condemned houses or houses that should be condemned.</P>
    <P>The Minister is always complaining he cannot get surveys up from local bodies.  He mentioned in his speech that he has only 36 surveys in from 87 public authorities.  I often wonder is it necessary to wait on these surveys. I am quite sure if I went around the towns in my constituency, I could do a town each day and give the Minister a pretty shrewd idea of what houses should be demolished and what houses repaired.  Surely it does not take all that length of time to prepare a rough survey and find out what the housing requirements are?  Furthermore, under the new Housing Bill, there will be many people eligible for rehousing who would not be deemed eligible now.  Will the surveys the Minister has be completely outdated under the new Bill?</P>
    <P>The Planning and Development Act has only barely come into operation and my only experience of it is of its restrictive nature.  There has been criticism made to me by people <Col N="294" /> affected by it that they do not believe it is being operated impartially.  I shall give the Minister one example. Recently a garage proprietor asked for permission to put up a notice about Fiat cars at a place three miles on the Dublin side of Cashel.  It was to be placed in a field 50 yards in from the road on the left-hand side going towards Cashel and perhaps the same distance from a small crossroads.  It was clearly and completely in the country.  Yet he was refused permission to erect this sign by the town planner for South Tipperary.  He appealed to the Minister and the Minister upheld the decision of the town planner.  As you pass further towards Cashel, you meet two signs from another garage proprietor, one quite near Cashel within the outlying view of the Rock.  These two signs are kept there with full permission from the planning authority, South Tipperary County Council, advertising the services of one garage proprietor.  Yet this man who looked for a sign three miles from Cashel, much further away from the Rock or any point of scenic imporatance, was refused.  I find it hard to reconcile sanction being given in one case to these two signs and being refused in the other.  The particular person affected believes that political favouritism was exercised against him. I do not know whether there was or not but he certainly believes it.  I am certainly unable to give any reasonable explanation as to why his application was refused and the others granted.</P>
    <P>I mentioned already that the Minister is being and has been criticised for his failure to meet the housing situation. What we forget, and what I think we ought to recognise, is that it is not the Minister for Local Government we should criticise, but rather the Government, and particularly the Taoiseach.  The Minister for Local Government is merely a member of the Cabinet.  He is not exclusively responsible for the present economic difficulties in which we find ourselves. I am sure he would be only too pleased if he could get money to meet our housing requirements.  We must not forget it was deliberate Government <Col N="295" /> policy to cut down on housing. Even a few years ago, when money was more available to the Government, they did not build houses.  In fact, they were unusually frightened of building houses because they took the notion that the fact of the inter-Party Government building so many houses was a factor in getting them into difficulty in their day.  Therefore, they have been extremely nervous of building houses since they came into office in 1958.</P>
    <P>House building has been regarded as a form of amenity spending: that has been Government policy.  They have regarded it as non-productive expenditure while they have been prepared to regard road mending as productive expenditure on the basis that roads constitute a structure of economic expansion. I do not know how far we can go with that argument but certainly, in proportion to our population, we have a very large number of roads.  It would be interesting to know the <i>per capita</i> expenditure on roads here as compared with Britain and other countries.  It would be very easy for us to be faced with a large <i>per capita</i> expenditure on roads by virtue of the fact that we have a small population and a large mileage.  It is a question of how far we pursue the argument that roads constitute a structure of economic expansion and, therefore, we proceed <i>ad lib</i>, with spending money on roads.  I do not know if it is a matter to which our economists have addressed themselves: I presume it is. I have never heard any Minister for Local Government discuss expenditure on roads from that point of view or saying what the ceiling is or what percentage of our gross national product or of the national income, taking our population and road mileage into consideration, it would be economically advisable to spend on roads and where we should stop.  Is there a figure to which the Department work?  Are we pursuing this blindly and maybe expending too much money on roads?</P>
    <P>I appreciate the claims of motorists. I appreciate that it is desirable to spend money on roads where there is a density of traffic and the people <Col N="296" /> using the roads are paying a substantial amount of money on their motor cars and on petrol but I think we should balance our expenditure on roads with the overall position of our economy.  I have become a little bit suspicious lately that we may be expending too much money on roads. I am judging that by the fact that a very fine job has been done north and south of the town of Cashel but when that is translated into money then the cost per mile is rather frightening.  One asks oneself how many houses could be built with that amount of money.  I should like to know if the Department have any overall figure to which they work as regards expenditure on roads and expenditure on housing.</P>
    <P>In a way, I have a certain amount of sympathy with the Minister, faced as he is with our economic straitened circumstances.  Unlike other Ministers who can flit from Department to Department after making glib promises, the Minister for Local Government has been a long time in the one position.  He has been given a baby and he cannot hand it over to anybody else.  We have seen Ministers moving from the Office of Public Works to the Department of Health and from the Department of Health to the Department of Education, we have seen them moving from the Department of Education into the Department of Industry and Commerce, after a short sojourn in each Department, perhaps a White Paper here and there and a plethora of promises which they know they will never be called upon to redeem or honour.  They can thus secure for themselves quite a degree of popularity.  The unfortunate Minister for Local Government, by virtue of the fact that he has been in the one position continuously, cannot hope to compete with his rotating, more sophisticated and more glamorous colleagues and, therefore, I have a certain amount of sympathy with him on that score.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry and others here seem quite satisfied with our economic position. Their attitude is that there is plenty of money available now to do all the things we want to do: I do <Col N="297" /> not know if anybody believes that. For some time I, amongst others in my local authority, have been putting down section 4 motions.  As the House is aware, a section 4 motion is calculated to compel the manager to do anything that is legal and is availed of in order to get things done.  We have had to put down section 4 motions but we now find that there is no longer any use in putting them down because the manager has got the pat answer that he has no money.</P>
    <P>It is a pity the Minister for Local Government has not been a little more forthright.  I know he has been very loyal to his Party and Party chiefs and that his stock technique is to heap contumely on local bodies and to blame local authorities because houses are not being built and water supplies not being laid on.  We have three large water supplies in my constituency.  We have a couple of million pounds worth of rural water schemes because we are a pioneer county in that respect. We have no hope of getting any money from the Department for these things. It is quite a simple matter for any Minister for Local Government to block the activities of any local body without showing his hand.  Anybody who is familiar with the technique of building, say, labourers' cottages recognises that there are about 14 or 15 different stages between the first stage when one proceeds to view a site and the final stage when one hands the key to the future occupant of the house.  At any one of these stages, the Department's officials can vitally hold up building without in any respect showing their hands.</P>
    <P>This is what has been quietly done, for the simple reason that the money is not there.  It would be far better, I think, for the Minister for Local Government to be more forthright in stating the position.  Instead, he has been trying to shield his Taoiseach and his Government and to unload the blame on to the shoulders of the local authorities.  Then, when local authorities get annoyed, he switches on to the county managers and we are advised to bring pressure to bear on them, to sack them, or do anything we like.  On every occasion he has <Col N="298" /> tried to pass the buck to local authorities, local authorities who are completely blameless.</P>
    <P>Our economic situation is bad.  Only 12 per cent of the recent £5 million loan on the British market was taken up, leaving 82 per cent in the hands of the underwriters.  Consider the position in relation to Imperial Chemical Industries.  They floated a loan for £60 million and, according to reports, the loan will be oversubscribed 50-fold, oversubscribed to that extent, despite an economic crisis in Britain. Money is available for that worthwhile project and the British public are prepared to subscribe £200 million or £300 million to ICI but they were prepared to subscribe only 12 per cent of the miserable £5 million loan we floated on the same market.  The comparison is an appalling one when one considers that it is a matter of the credit-worthiness of a State as compared with the credit-worthiness of a commercial concern.  I do not suppose there was any great difference in the terms of the two loans.  In these circumstances, we should not try to pretend that money is available.  The problem for the Minister is that the Minister for Finance has not got the money.</P>
    <P>With regard to building, both private and public, our building rate is one of the lowest in Europe.  The last OECD report showed that, in terms of building units&mdash;there may be more flats on the Continent than we have here&mdash;we have the lowest record in Europe, with the exception of Turkey.  Remembering that some 500,000 Turkish inhabitants do not need housing at all because of the climatic conditions, this represents a very poor reflection indeed on our building activities.  That is obvious in villages throughout the country.  No worthwhile improvements have been made in these villages over the past 30 or 40 years.  I have known villages in my own county since I was a child and no material improvement of any kind has been made in the majority of them.  Drive through the English countryside and you will see beautiful villages with lovely houses.  At home, after many years of native government, <Col N="299" /> many of our people still live in dilapidated squalor.</P>

      <P>Listening to the debate, which is a debate of great interest, one heard opinions expressed on housing from all parts of the country.  It is perfectly obvious now that modern housing cannot be taken on its own: it has to be brought into the wider context of planning. Having heard a Dublin Deputy speaking last night, it is now abundantly clear to me that the housing requirements of Dublin have no chance of being adequately met within the next 20 years.  They might be met by a tremendous, all-out drive and the complete stoppage of any progress in housing in any other part of the country, but, if that were done, Dublin would grow out of all proportion. Indeed, in my opinion, Dublin has already grown out of all proportion. We have a total population of something in the neighbourhood of 2.85 millions; in the city of Dublin and its environs, over half a million of that total population of 2.85 millions live. Dublin is in the same position as Vienna after the First World War when, out of a population of six million, some two million resided in the capital city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Housing cannot be taken by itself, as factory siting cannot be taken by itself, or tourist development.  One must have an overall planning authority to decide, first of all, and this is of paramount importance, whether or not we will restrict the growth of Dublin and, if we do, in what way will we encourage other areas to develop.  There should be a planned enlargement of other cities and towns.  In order that that may be done, the Government must set an example to private enterprise and to the rest of the country. Every Government Department is sited in Dublin.  Every Government Department is growing.  There is, therefore, a greater demand for housing in Dublin than anywhere else.  The Government will have to take their courage in their hands and transfer some Departments to other areas.  It has always seemed to <Col N="300" /> me utterly wrong to have a Department dealing with the problems of the West and with rural problems situated in Dublin.  If that Department were transferred to some other area, the housing situation in Dublin would be greatly relieved.  I do not see why two or three Government Departments could not be sited in other parts of the country.</P>

      <P>Decentralisation of Government Departments would mean a growth elsewhere than in Dublin.  I will make a few suggestions now.  I find that, whenever one makes suggestions here, one is told they are impossible.  Looking back over the years, occasional suggestions I have made have been taken up by someone else later on the Government side; they then become Government suggestions and are OK.</P>
      <P>I am going to suggest now to the Parliamentary Secretary that, first of all, the Land Commission should be moved from Dublin to Galway.  Galway is a city which is capable of advancement.  Sites for houses are probably much cheaper there and houses can be built cheaper there. There is no excuse for officials who may be directly concerned saying that there are not educational facilities there and so on, because all these things are there already.  I suggest that the first thing the Government should do&mdash;it is the Government who have to submit a plan; there is no use the Minister saying that he has no planning experts because it does not matter if he has 200 or 300 planning experts if there is no plan there is nothing for the planners to do&mdash;is to take the Land Commission out of Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="301" /> I cannot see why the Department of Defence could not also be moved out of Dublin.  That would entail a tremendous removal of personnel to a big centre where there are educational facilities available.  Then <i>ipso facto,</i> you have a tremendous number of houses available; you create a void in the occupied houses in Dublin and you encourage building in other centres and you would have a better and more economic set-up in the community as a whole.  I would go further and say that the city of Kilkenny&mdash; the Parliamentary Secretary will notice how generous I am as I have not yet mentioned my own constituency&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaugeBrennan" hpid="Mr. P. Brennan Mr. P. Brennan">

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and that building would be cheaper there than in Dublin and there would probably be adequate sewerage facilities to deal with an expansion of building.  I suggest that the Government move another Department there.  I do not see why they would not move the Department of Posts and Telegraphs or some other smaller Department there.  Wexford, naturally, is a town which I should like to see expanded. My fellow Deputies will appreciate my great generosity in leaving Wexford to the last.  There is no reason why the Department of Transport and Power should not be sent there because, after all, the Minister for Transport and Power, Deputy Childers, has repeatedly made speeches in Wexford expressing the great tourist potential of that area and which, I fear, Bord Fáilte have not yet fully appreciated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One is continually hearing in this House about how this expert is being called in and how we have got this or that seminar going in which to train people to do this, that and the other thing.  All directions must come not from the Civil Service or from a <Col N="302" /> bureaucratic level but from the Government and the Minister concerned. If we are going to deal with the housing problem that is the only way to do it effectively.  As far as the present administration is concerned their policy is to build houses in Dublin when houses start to fall down.  To say that at present we can build so many houses each year for newly weds is only to scratch the surface of the problem. Last night it was pointed out here by a Labour Deputy that some newly weds would have to wait a considerable time before getting a house and that, in fact, they would have to have a family of three before they got it. That is not social justice but the position could be rectified by spreading the load over the country.</P>
    <P>Like myself, the Parliamentary Secretary is a rural Deputy and he knows the frustrating delays which must exist when you have complete control of housing within the Custom House and the delays that exist during the exchange of views between the local authority and the central Government. However, the Minister should have a definite plan drafted now and he should get the planners to assist him. I am not sure what An Foras Forbartha is for but I think it is for the purpose of planning, and if the Minister gets advisers to advise him on an overall plan for the country as a whole and treat it, as I said at the beginning, from the tourist angle, from the siting of factories and that sort of thing, we might then overtake the difficulties we are facing today.</P>
    <P>In my constituency we are at the moment going to get a few houses built in Gorey, which is a town of approximately 3,000 inhabitants.  We have not had a house built in that town since 1952.  I will repeat what other Deputies have said and which is perfectly true and that is that people have emigrated and have given up good jobs and gone out to the colonies and the new, developing nations for the simple reason that they cannot get houses at home.  This is due to the lack of planning for the future.  Therefore, before I leave this subject, I commend to the Government the suggestion that they start this plan, an overall national plan. <Col N="303" /> It will be of advantage to have the views of the local authority but it should all blend together into one plan.  That is the only way in which the housing problem, which I might say is a national disgrace at the moment, will be solved to a certain extent.</P>
    <P>I want now to say a word about the parking of cars and other vehicles in relation to Dublin city.  I am not a Dublin Deputy but I have the same interest as everybody else who comes to Dublin in trying to find somewhere to park my car.  By 9.30 a.m. every parking place in the centre of the city is occupied.  That is in regard to the streets.  All the main thoroughfares are narrowed because cars are parked on each side and they are parked on each side for the simple reason that there is nowhere else to park them.  I had the opportunity of visiting a great many cities in many different countries over the last 12 years or so and every city I have been to has a parking plan.  Last year or the year before the Minister assured me that 13 new parking places were being put into commission or were being constructed in the city of Dublin. Perhaps when he is replying, he would tell us if the 13 new places have been set up and if they have been where they are.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that it would be a profitable undertaking for Dublin Corporation to float a loan&mdash;I think their credit is reasonably good, better than the credit of some other people &mdash;which could be easily serviced and paid for by charging a parking fee. It might not be a popular thing for the Government to charge a parking fee in Dublin.  Indeed, people to whom I mentioned this proposal said that they might be afraid that they would lose votes in Dublin but they need not worry because they are already losing votes in Dublin.  It might make them unpopular for the good of the community as a whole.  I believe they could build parking places because other cities have done it and it would make for much greater safety within the city.  Indeed, I have always felt that many of the accidents in Dublin are due to some unfortunate country people being involved in accidents <Col N="304" /> because they drive from one street to another trying to find parking places. They are uncertain where they are and one cannot blame them for that. There is nowhere to park from 9.30 in the morning because the city magnates occupy the parking places.  The Minister should do something about this.  It would be money well spent and it would give a profitable return.</P>
    <P>I remember a long time ago before Dublin traffic was anything like what it is at the moment somebody around Stephen's Green set up a private car parking place.  I remember going there and trying to park a car but it was so full up that I could not get in. The Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister should do something about this.</P>
    <P>I notice in the Minister's speech that he referred to safety belts.  May I give him this information?  It is not possible to procure safety belts in this country at the moment.  I do not exactly know what the set-up is but I believe it is like a great many things here.  There is only one wholesale distributor.  I stand corrected if I am wrong but this is the information given to me.  The wholesale distributor says he cannot get safety belts.  Therefore, it is futile for the Minister for Local Government to say that safety belts and proper equipment should be put in cars if we cannot get them.  Further, for the information of the Minister, they are not manufactured in this country.  They are imported from the United Kingdom.  If I am told that is wrong I would be very obliged if the Minister would get me some safety belts.  I have tried to get them and the answer I got from a first-class garage in Dublin is that they are not procurable at the moment.  The Minister should look into that as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies mentioned the fact that the Department of Local Government seem to have got their priorities wrong.  There seems to be some genius in the Custom House&mdash;he may even be from the Department of Justice or some adviser to the Government&mdash;who decides that safety on the roads consists in removing corners and it does not matter what money you spend <Col N="305" /> because the sky is the limit.  No matter what place you go in Ireland today you find extensive road widening taking place and corners being removed. I want to put this point to the House.  In continental Europe where perhaps there are more accidents than anywhere else they are making artificial corners.  At night-time when the headlights are in use and people are travelling fast on the open roads it is found that roads without corners are responsible for more accidents than anything else.  They are doing the reverse of what we are doing.  The Taoiseach tells us we will be in the Common Market by 1970.  He reiterates that every time he is asked about it.  If we are to be in the Common Market by 1970 we should try to do what the continentals are doing with regard to their roads.</P>
    <P>The very straight, wide roads, such as the autobahns in Germany and the autostradas built in Mussolini's time, are responsible for more accidents than the ordinary main roads of Europe.  When people travel on roads without corners they usually travel at 70 miles an hour, 80 miles or even faster.  I have travelled on some of those roads at 100 miles an hour.  That may be all right in good weather but when it is wet it is the cause of many accidents.  It seems to me that while we have this planning genius in the Department of Local Government we are likely to get roads on the autobahn system.</P>
    <P>I see in my own county and in the Parliamentary Secretary's county extensive reconstruction work and roadwidening taking place.  Those roads usually finish in bottle-necks at the end and they are an invitation to serious accidents.  The money devoted to this road-widening work should be put to other uses.  It would be far better to repair the county roads and side-roads and even the third and fourth grade roads.  We could improve those roads by taking a foot or so off the corners. I do not know why we have got to spend a small fortune on those autobahn type roads.  It is beyond my comprehension. With those few words of advice to the Minister for Local Government <Col N="306" /> and the Parliamentary Secretary I shall resume my seat.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I want briefly to refer to a few points on this Estimate.  Many statements have been made regarding the housing position.  This is one situation which it is impossible for any Deputy, who is familiar with his constituency, to exaggerate.  It is impossible for him to exaggerate no matter how strong a statement he makes.  I feel the crisis is such that the Minister should be relieved of his other responsibilities.  Those responsibilities could be given to somebody else or distributed among the other Ministers.  The Minister for Local Government should, for the next few years, have only the housing crisis to look after.</P>
      <P>The Minister's responsibilities are far too many.  He has to deal with other big problems such as road construction, road safety, town planning. I feel that housing, at times, has to take second place.  There are towns and villages throughout the length and breadth of the country which have not got any houses built for 20, 30 or even 40 years.  There are some towns and villages which have not got a single house built since the foundation of the State.  That is true. I can name some of them.  There is one large town in my own constituency, the town of Borris in County Carlow, which has not got a single local authority house built since the State was founded.  That is a very sad reflection on successive Governments and particularly on the Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaugeBrennan" hpid="Mr. P. Brennan Mr. P. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>And the county council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;who have been in office for most of that period.  Carlow County Council have a proposal for 12 houses.  It has been with the Department for some time and the green light has not yet been given.  I would particularly ask the Parliamentary Secretary to do what he can with regard to this.  He would then have the credit that he was the man who caused the first local authority house to be built in Borris, County Carlow, since the State was founded.  There are <Col N="307" /> also other places in the country which are in a similar position.  It is no surprise, therefore, when we have that situation over the years to find ourselves in the position we are in today with, not alone hundreds, but thousands of houses required and thousands of families living in desperately overcrowded and bad conditions.</P>
      <P>We have also big questions such as the provision of water and sewerage schemes.  Progress in water schemes has been fair enough but still needs to be pressed ahead.  These schemes are fairly extensive and expensive, and I still feel that in 1966, at this stage of the 20th century, when we see the housewife having to trot down through fields with her bucket to get water out of an open well, we are living hundreds of years in the past.</P>
      <P>We have towns and villages without any form of sewerage facilities and here again there is no need for me to stress the serious dangers this constitutes for public health, the health of families and the health of children. These schemes also are expensive but, nevertheless, they will have to be provided and provided very soon.  It is no exaggeration to say that there are village, and towns in the country which are no better than villages and towns in the darkest parts of Africa as far as water and sewerage facilities are concerned.  These people might well be out in Africa and, indeed, some of them would be better off there.</P>
      <P>I notice also from the Minister's statement that he has put the question of cottage repairs down in his list of priorities.  I feel this should not be so.  There are cottages going to rack and ruin throughout the country. I know some cottages and local authority houses in which people have to get up in the middle of the night if it rains and move the beds from one end of the room to the other because rainwater comes in through the roof and through the windows, the walls are cracked and it is impossible for them to live decently in these conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="308" /> In my own constituency in Kilkenny, repairs in the past few months have been almost at a standstill and we have people living in local authority houses in the conditions I have outlined.  This is something which should not have been put back and placed in second place but should be in first place with the other major questions because these people have been paying rent and have been good tenants of local authority houses for many years and are entitled to get repairs and get maintenance so as at least to put the house in such a condition that when it rains they will not have to get out in the middle of the night to shift the bed from one corner of the room to the other.</P>
    <P>Now, I want to come to the very thorny question of rents.  The Minister has in his opening statement devoted a page to this question.  I have also seen the circular which he sent to local authorities this year.  As I said, this is a very thorny question and I do not wish to misrepresent the position here, but it has been, unfortunately, misrepresented by a good many Fianna Fáil speakers, who implied that unless we get these rent increases put into force, it will not be possible to repair our houses, that it will not be possible to build new houses and that the present housing difficulty has been brought about by tenants not paying adequate rents. This is serious misrepresentation of the facts.</P>
    <P>This proposal, which the Minister outlines here very scantily in his Estimate speech, means extra taxation under another name, extra taxation on people who are already heavy taxpayers and ratepayers.  I quote from the Minister's statement on page 10:</P>
    <P>I emphasise again that my primary concern in seeking a rationalisation of rents is to ensure that the housing needs of the very poor will be met, and that they are not forced to live in unfit conditions because of their inability to pay rent.  The additional cost of meeting this problem squarely will be substantial, and taxpayers and ratepayers are already carrying a <Col N="309" /> heavy and increasing burden.  It seems to me that the sensible way out of the difficulty is the adoption of our renting structure for housing estates as a whole based on ability to pay and related to the standard of accommodation and amenity provided.</P>
    <P>The thing that strikes me more forcibly than anything else is the reference, to taxpayers and ratepayers who are already carrying an increasing burden.  Who are tenants of county council houses?  Are they taxpayers and ratepayers?  They must not be taxpayers and ratepayers at all.  They are another breed of people but I did not think there was any human being in this country, or, indeed, in any country who was not a taxpayer or a ratepayer; but it is implied in this statement that all cottage tenants and and all people living in corporation houses pay neither taxes nor rates. But, as we all know, the biggest taxpayers and the biggest ratepayers in proportion to what they have are the people living in cottages and in corporation houses.  But, unfortunately, if people living in those houses have a good income, and if their sons and daughters have good incomes, the Minister for Finance makes sure, through PAYE, that they pay on every penny they earn.  Not one penny escapes the taxation net, unlike other forms of income from other forms of business where people can escape one way or another the taxation net.  These people, however, can never escape, but these are the people who are now told&mdash;may be not in so many words&mdash; that they are not taxpayers or ratepayers and that on account of that, they will have to pay increased rents according to their income.</P>
    <P>This proposal, let me repeat, is a new form of taxation and nothing else, taxation on people who are already paying heavy taxes and heavy rates.  It is a new form of turnover tax, if you like, on rents.  It is something parallel to the 25 per cent on the road tax.  It is another way in which revenue can be raised, by applying increases to rents.  This question of rent increases should not and cannot be taken in <Col N="310" /> isolation.  It is related to other questions, particularly rates and valuations on certain buildings.</P>
    <P>I know buildings used for profitable business purposes which are not valued to their proper extent.  They are valued under the old British systems and, perhaps, because in those days they found favour with the then authorities, the old landlords of these buildings got away fairly lightly as far as valuation was concerned.  This question is one which is interlocked with the question of rents because they both go to make up local authority revenue.  It is grossly unjust to pick on rents and leave the question of the valuation of certain buildings, in which are carried on very profitable lines of trade, as it was heretofore.</P>
    <P>This whole question of local authority revenue should be examined under both headings, not merely having regard to one side and conveniently ignoring the other.  I am in favour of a reasonable increase in rents for people who can afford to pay them in order to permit of a reduction in rents for old age pensioners and social welfare recipients.  I am not in favour of an increase in rents for people who cannot afford to pay them.  I feel a scheme could be worked out which would allow a reasonable increase for people who can obviously afford to pay and this increase should be used solely for the purpose of helping to reduce the rents of the less fortunate people.  I do not want to see increases in rents being used as another form of raising money for other purposes.  It should be wholly and solely devoted to helping to provide a cheaper house for the less fortunate.</P>
    <P>If the proposal suggested by the Minister is implemented it will have serious effects and will mean serious steep increases in the rents of many people.  There is another question as to whether or not it is even morally justifiable&mdash;for people who have been on fixed rents for maybe five, ten, 20 or 30 years&mdash;to change them over to a differential rent system.  I do not think that is right or should be done. I agree that a small number of those people at the moment may have large <Col N="311" /> incomes coming into their houses but had they a large income five or six years ago?  I know families with sons and daughters working now where there would be £30 or £40 coming into the house but I knew those families five years ago and they were struggling, on the brink of starvation, trying to educate and rear their families.  Is it right now, when they could reap the benefits of a cheaper house, that they must suffer this penal taxation of increased rents?  I do not think it is right for houses which have been on fixed rents for any period to be changed over to a differential rent system.  I would not be against a proposal to introduce differential rents for all future houses and tenancies because I think there is merit in the scheme but what I am against is the change over of existing tenancies from a fixed to a differential rent.  I hope the Minister will seriously consider this whole question of rent increases because I do not feel it is justified.  It is being used now as an excuse to cover up the failure of the Government to provide houses and to make the necessary revenue available for housing.</P>
    <P>The Government are now giving the impression that we must have increased rents in order to build cheaper houses for future tenants.  This is a wrong idea and I do not subscribe to it. It is misleading when these people are paying rents, contributing their share in other forms of taxation, paying their way in the community and paying their share to help provide houses. The Government have been at fault in not administering properly the revenue which those people have been subscribing through taxes and rates. To come now and ask them for higher rents, with increased taxation, increased turnover tax and increased rates is not just.  I cannot see how a case can be made for that.</P>
    <P>I want to refer briefly to road safety. I hope the new Road Traffic Bill will provide safeguards to make the roads much safer than they are at the present time.  One of the biggest dangers on our roads at the moment is wandering animals.  These are as great a danger as the drunken driver.  A <Col N="312" /> wandering animal on the road can be very dangerous to traffic, every bit as dangerous, to my mind, as the drunken driver.  Special regulations should be made to deal with this problem, which is getting more and more common every day.  I was going home last night on a very busy trunk road, a wide and fast road.  I was travelling in the dark at a reasonable speed and, just in time, saw cattle on the road right in front of me.  Had there been any other cars coming against me or had I been going a little bit faster, I would hardly be here tonight.  That is only one instance.  Every driver on the roads meets these problems every day and every night.  Horses, cattle, dogs and even cats at times can be the cause of danger.</P>
    <P>There is an amazing lack of finish with regard to the provision of new roads.  Big wide roads are made with margins, but there is no indication where the margins are.  Unless a driver knows the road fairly well, he has no indication at night time of where the margins are, and he is likely to go in on the margin, which can also be very dangerous.</P>
    <P>Speaking about new roads and roadworks, I should like to advocate that speed limits should be enforced on all roads which are under repair. It is sometimes frightening to see roadworkers working on the roads. The signs are up: &ldquo;Go slow.&rdquo;&ldquo;Dead slow&rdquo;&mdash;but the motorists take absolutely no notice of them.  They go flying by as if there were no works in progress.  They hope over the rough section of the roads and they throw stones and dust in the eyes of the workmen and are a source of very grave danger to them.  Some motorists have no regard for the roadworkers. They ignore the signs and drive through the roadworkers who must jump out of the way for their lives.</P>
    <P>When roadworks are in progress, speed limit signs should be put up and strictly enforced as they are in towns and villages.  I do not know whether the signs at present put up on roadworks are legally binding.  I do not think they are because I never saw any attempt being made to have them enforced.  &ldquo;Dead slow&rdquo; means <Col N="313" /> nothing to some motorists driving on the roads.</P>
    <P>I want to appeal to the Minister to make special assistance available to the local authorities to provide school traffic wardens in the country towns.  I understand this is a charge on the local finances, on the rates, and because of that many local authorities do not employ these very necessary people.  There are schools adjacent to very busy roads and crossroads, and it is impossible for the Gardaí to be at every school at lunch-time and at finishing time.  The solution is the employment of traffic wardens.  These people must be paid out of the rates.  I think special assistance, or special grants should be given by the Department to help the local authorities to employ these people.  This could save the lives of schoolchildren.  I believe that the lives of many schoolchildren could have been saved if a proper school traffic warden system had been arranged throughout the country.  There is a fairly effective system here in Dublin and we should like to see it extended to the country, or at least to the larger towns and cities throughout the country.</P>
    <P>In connection with planning, I hope the Department will help other local authorities, apart from the few named by the Department of Industry and Commerce, who are endeavouring to provide sites for industrial estates.  I know that special emphasis is being laid on places like Waterford, Galway and Limerick, but I think special assistance should also be given to other places for the development of sites, the provision of proper and adequate water schemes and sewerage schemes, roads to the sites and all the services appertaining to the development of industrial estates.  The Department should be liberal and should give special assistance to local authorities which at the moment are the Cinderellas so far as industrial development is concerned.  Unless these towns and cities have development sites for industrial purposes, they will be passed by in any industrial expansion that takes place.</P>
    <P>I want to make an appeal to the <Col N="314" /> Minister.  I have made representations to him on this point.  I am referring to the £1 tenth round wage increase for roadworkers.  Someone said today that the Department of Lands were the last Department to agree to the £1 wage increase for workers.  I do not totally agree with that.  The Department of Local Government are still behind so far as this is concerned.  The £1 tenth round wage increase has been paid for many months by all the other employers, the good and the not so good.  It has been made retrospective to dates in March, April, May, and even earlier.  The roadworkers are the lowest paid workers in the country. Some of them have a take-home wage of £7 odd per week, and here we have the Department not agreeing to give them the £1 wage increase, retrospective to a reasonable date, a date which would compare on average with their fellow workers in other employment. It has been offered from 1st June.  In my own area the average date for the implementation of the £1 wage increase was about the last week in April.  Some workers got it from 1st April.  Some indeed some people got it from 1st January.</P>
    <P>This wage increase, according to Government speakers, was mainly intended for the lowly-paid workers. It was to bring up the people who are on the bottom rung of the wage ladder.  This is the example we have from Government Departments.  I appeal to the Minister to sanction this increase from dates which were freely negotiated between county managers and unions and not to hold it up any further.  I hope that the Minister will indicate that he is in agreement with sanctioning this £1 wage increase in accordance with dates which were locally negotiated and agreed on between the unions representing the men and the managers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say something about road safety and roads in general to begin with. The whole question of roads and road safety is a very complex subject when you are dealing with big highways and with byways in the country and roads in suburbs and streets in a <Col N="315" /> city.  The problem varies, as do the roads.  On the whole we are dealing with it very well in this country.</P>
      <P>I shall refer to two roads, of which one is the road to Cork.  Every time I travel on it is seems to become better and better.  There was criticism earlier, not necessarily perhaps of the Cork road but of the new roads we are building, and it was said that on the Continent they found that straight roads are dangerous.  Certainly the Cork road can hold its own with any autobahn or Italian autostrada or English motorway.  It is extremely well designed; it undulates and curves and does not have the long, completely straight stretches which are a menace at night.  I congratulate the Department on the engineering which has gone into that road and also I congratulate the local authorities concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I now turn to what I consider one of the worst roads in Ireland&mdash;I shall not go through all the good roads and all the bad roads&mdash;but in my opinion, the Belfast road is in the main a very poor road, narrow and twisted.  I do not know what the accident rates is on it but every time I travel on it, I think that the accident rate must be high, due to the shape of the road. The surface is good and well maintained but the design of the road has not been altered to fit in with modern requirements.  I should say that the stretch out to the airport is particularly bad.  The surface in some places, is wretched and the narrow part going through the village before you come to the airport&mdash;it has now become an industrial centre&mdash;leading to where the Stadium is, in parts, particularly narrow, resulting in a pile-up of traffic.  One would not realise one was on one of the great main roads of Ireland.  I do not know why the people of Dundalk or Drogheda or other towns nearer Dublin on that road have not strenuously objected and forced the authorities to improve the road.  In the main, we can be proud of our roads.  They may be too narrow &mdash;many of them are&mdash;but they are very good from the point of view of <Col N="316" /> surface and many tourists find them attractive and compare them very favourably with English and continental roads.</P>
    <P>Road signs have been mentioned but not in the way in which I am about to deal with them.  The previous speaker spoke of motorists dashing past where road work was in progress and thereby endangering the lives of workmen.  That is, of course, entirely wrong and reprehensible, and I think can only be dealt with, as is sometimes done, by putting up empty tar barrels so that the cars are forced to go very slowly.  I would urge the Minister to tell local authorities to be very careful that when they put a notice on the road such as &ldquo;Men at Work&rdquo; or &ldquo;Tarring in Progress&rdquo; or &ldquo;Dead Slow&rdquo;, in fact there is a reason for it.  I have many times come to a notice &ldquo;Dead Slow&rdquo; and there is nothing happening.  Or it says &ldquo;Men at Work&rdquo; and it is a Sunday and there is not a man in sight.  You have slowed down to perhaps 15 miles an hour and you feel a fool when you come out at the other end and see that there is no work in progress.  I should like to take the individual responsible and tweak his ear if I could catch him.  That sort of thing only brings the law into contempt and the next time the motorist sees a notice like that, he perhaps says: &ldquo;Somebody has forgotten the thing again,&rdquo; while around the next corner there may be in fact some road work in progress.  Local authorities should be very careful not to cry &ldquo;Wolf, wolf&rdquo; to the motorist and, of course, that applies to every other road user also.</P>
    <P>I was down in the south of Ireland last year and travelled over a road surface on a summer day.  There was no notice of &ldquo;Tarring in Progress&rdquo;. We stopped and had lunch by a very beautiful bay in a sort of lay-by. On the opposite side of the road, I noticed two cars and I saw far dripping from them.  They were a mass of tar.  I then looked at my own car and it was dripping with tar.  I had gone over liquid tar but there had been no notice to that effect.  We <Col N="317" /> went where we were going, to a well-known beauty resort and every car there was also dripping with tar.  On the way back I went to considerable trouble to find the council offices in this very small town.  There I told the clerk what I thought of him and his authority for not having put up proper notices on the roads.  The underneath part of my car was and is, I suppose, ever since, a mass of tar.  That should not be.  I was not travelling fast and I did not splash the car.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  What I think happened was that the road had been done some time previously and it was a fairly warm day, although not a blazingly hot day.  I think not sufficient loose chippings were put on the road.  This may be the one swallow that does not make a summer. I merely make the point that the authorities must take care, since a great deal of harm could be done to cars by car.  We have these slogans &ldquo;Men at work&rdquo; and &ldquo;Tarring in Progress&rdquo;. We can achieve a bad result by leading the motorist, so to speak, up the garden path when these notices are left behind even when the work has been completed.  Such neglect tends to make the motorist careless the next time he comes on one of these signs. It is accordingly necessary to exercise great care and vigilance in these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mention was made of driving tests. I heard one Deputy say the tests were too onerous.  I have not heard that anywhere else and I urge the Minister and the Department officials concerned not to lower the standard.  They constitute a long-term method of teaching the motorist how to drive properly. It will be years before the full effect of the driving tests is felt but at all costs the standard of the tests must not be lowered.  To do so would be analogous to saying to the Minister for Education that he should lower the standard of teaching in our schools. These tests and the preparation for them present the only opportunity the community get outside the courts of <Col N="318" /> teaching the motorist the rules of the road and full advantage should therefore be taken of tests.  It is to be noted that in most countries the driving tests are far more onerous than here.</P>
    <P>On the question of Dublin city traffic, last year when the system of one-way streets was comparatively new and when we still were unaccustomed to it, I found I had to go far out of my way to get anywhere&mdash;it was difficult to get to a given point by the shortest route.  This trouble persists but in the main the system is working satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>Still on the question of Dublin traffic flows, one problem about which the authorities will have to be very careful is the provision of pedestrian crossings.  Once, authorities of a school asked me to endeavour to have a pedestrian crossing provided outside their gateway.  One half of the school is on one side of a long, straight stretch of roadway and the other half right across the road, involving children crossing from one side to the other.  When I approached the authorities, they told me: &ldquo;If we put a pedestrian crossing there, it will become a death trap because anyone using it will be liable to be mowed down.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In the handling of pedestrains and motorists, one has to be very careful. Pedestrians may demand crossings at points where such crossings would be most likely to lead to accidents.  We live in an age of organised complaints, and strong pressures are being put on the authorities to provide crossings at all sorts of places, the idea being that the pedestrian should be facilitated and that the motorist should not have it all his own way.  That is perfectly all right and I agree with it, but we must be careful not to give pedestrians crossings at points where they would become endangered.</P>
    <P>Another traffic problem in Dublin is the matter of public parking spaces in the city centre.  This is becoming more and more acute.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceEDockrell" hpid="Mr. M.E. Dockrell Mr. M.E. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Many business people give facilities, where possible, to <Col N="319" /> their employees.  I was interested to hear Deputy Esmonde, in his reference to Dublin parking spaces, say that they do not, exist.  I submit that the Minister should encourage by the provision of money the laying out of many more parking lost in the centre of the city. In the district in which I work&mdash;it is also my constituency&mdash;there are many open spaces that would make wonderful parking lots.  I refer particularly to York Street and Golden Lane.  There are one or two permanent sites there. There is also the Castle Yard.  Of course the civil servants have to be accommodated and there would be a terrible howl if the public were let in.  I suggest they ought to be let in, encouraged to go in.  After all, the primary function of the centre of Dublin is a commercial one, but I shall come to that point in more detail in a few moments.</P>
      <P>We must remember that the vacant sites in York Street and its neighbourhood which serve as parking lots at the moment will not always be available for this purpose.  The ground there is very valuable: various buildings will be erected later on these sites.  What will happen then?  Fewer and fewer parking lots will be available where they are needed most. I hate to use the word &ldquo;agitation&rdquo; because these days all sorts of bodies are marching and counter-marching. There might come a day when the Dublin business community will march on the authorities and say: &ldquo;God knows, we pay enough rates and taxes.  Enough money comes from the residents and business people in the city centre.  Surely you are not, with our own money, going to choke us, because Dublin will die commercially if it is not given parking space.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is what I want to say to the Minister and to the commercial people of Dublin.  Some of the prosperous or comparatively prosperous businesses will not be that in a few years' time if the public cannot get in and have somewhere to park their cars.  I heard somebody refer to the city magnates. The day when the city magnates, whoever they may be, were the only people who came in motor cars has long gone, and a very good thing.  All sorts of <Col N="320" /> people are driving cars, and good luck to them.  We used to hear a few years ago that on building sites in America the builder had to provide parking facilities for his workmen.  That was something that was peculiar to America and perhaps certain other countries with an extraordinarily high standard of living.  I am delighted to say that America is not the only country in which that happens nowadays. It happens here in Dublin.  About a year ago I was coming back from a funeral in Dean's Grange and there were a whole lot of cars parked on the side of the road.  I thought to myself this must be a political meeting and then I said there would not be a political meeting at 11 in the morning.  It was a building site and these were the cars of the building workers that were parked there.</P>
    <P>That is the problem today, that all classes of the community are now getting themselves into cars, and, as I say, good, luck to them.  We are proud of the standard of living we have in this country of ours and want to see it better.  I realise that there are old, sick, infirm people, but at this moment I am not dealing with that aspect of local government.  I am talking of the roads and the problem of how in a community where people are increasingly using cars we can prevent the city of Dublin being choked almost by its own affluence.  That can only be done by enormously increased parking facilities.</P>
    <P>In Paris before the war, in 1938, and that is quite a while ago, I remember having to park a car in which we were touring in a great multi-storey garage, and we used to get it down every morning in a lift and drive away.  I do not remember what the cost was but it was nothing exorbitant.  The cost of the erection of these buildings will have to be faced by the community at large, through the local authority, through the Government or, if not, through the people themselves. It is nearly impossible to get people to put up money for a purpose like that.  The first requisite will be that free parking on the roads either will have become impossible or will not be allowed.  People will not pay for a <Col N="321" /> building and for the parking of their cars in it if they are at liberty to park them on the road outside.</P>
    <P>That problem lies very much ahead for the city of Dublin.  There will be mass meetings.  There will be enormous pressure put on the corporation of Dublin and on the local authority to facilitate that project or to provide it. If not, the centre of the city of Dublin will cease to be the place in which to carry on business because the people will not be able to get into the large shops.  That has already happened in American cities and they have built these places outside the city.  We are already doing that here, but do not think the commercial community of Dublin will view that with any degree of pleasure.  One of these days they will start howling and howling loudly that they have been let down by the Government and by the corporation, and that will come very fast.  I would say to the Minister and his advisers that that is something which is coming very close to his Department.  Millions of pounds are spent on hospitals, and rightly so, and on all sorts of poor, aged and sick people, through the rates.  That money can come only through the trade and employment in the city itself.  If that is affected, we shall find ourselves in a bad situation.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred also to the question of itinerants or, as they are known by the people who have the misfortune to have them living near them, the tinkers.  I, in common with a large number of people, have the utmost sympathy for these itinerants. It is a tremendous problem.  It is not only a Government problem but a problem for the whole community. Not only must sites be found for these people and houses provided, and so on, but the training must be started with them.  Unless they are trained, there is no use in expecting people who had led a nomadic life and, at best, earned their living by a type of horse trading and perhaps a type of scrap collecting, if that is the right term, to become settled persons.  The scrap was not always &ldquo;collected&rdquo;. That is why these people are not the most loved neighbours in the community. <Col N="322" /> Any old thing that is left outside will have a tendency to disappear.</P>
    <P>At any rate, there is a whole form of rehabilitation hidden in this problem of the itinerant people.  They have lived a nomadic life up to now.  They like that; they are accustomed to it. Informed public opinion realises that there is this problem and is sympathetic but nobody, of course, wants to have the itinerants very close to him. That is part of the difficulty and that can only be dealt with in a long-term way by education, and so on.  I will leave that question of the itinerants by saying that it is a matter that must be dealt with very firmly.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the question of planning, town planning and regional planning.  I would say to the Minister and his Department that it is very important that the widest publicity should be given to planning because ultimately planning exists mainly through an informed public opinion and that goes for the members of a local authority and their staff.  As the world is shrinking and as our society is shrinking by virtue of the fact that both central and local government have taken on enormous new duties, we cannot shrug our shoulders and say that some matter is not our concern.  Everything is our concern.  The surface of a road is our concern.  A corner is our concern.  The location of a shop is our concern.  All that comes under planning. I am very glad that there is this association or society in connection with planning and I hope the widest publicity will be given to its findings.</P>
    <P>A few years ago there was in these islands, a good deal of resistance to planning.  Most of us, and certainly the older members of the population, were brought up on the <i>laissez faire</i> policies of the various governments of western Europe.  That is all being swept away now.  We know that there must be planning.  A certain plan may adversely affect an individual but may be for the common good.  Although I might like to think I was perfectly free to erect a house exactly as I wished and where I wished and to use whatever materials I wished, and many citizens do feel that way, we know that that is not the case and that the individual <Col N="323" /> has not the right to put up a structure exactly as he would like.  I have not the right adversely to affect my neighbour in any way and my neighbour should not be driven to the courts to order to obtain redress against me.  Action should be taken before a building is erected and a person should not be permitted to do, something which is not completely in the public interest.</P>
    <P>All of us need to be educated in the principles of planning.  It is easy to say that a local authority or a government are taking upon themselves dictatorial powers, that business people should not be made to close their premises at a certain hour, that people should not be made to do this or to do that.  That is all part of modern living and planning is necessary especially in relation to building and the various aspects of city and rural life.  The problem becomes more acute in a city than in a rural area because in a city conditions are more crowded.  It is immensely important that the public should be educated, with ourselves, in principles of planning.</P>
    <P>Some years ago.  I attended a summer school at which the subject of town planning was discussed.  It was one of the most fascinating things I ever experienced. One listened to experts on various aspects of planning lecturing to local authority officials.  One simple <Col N="324" /> point was brought out.  Occasionally one sees press reports that local authorities or persons in a district objected when certain bus companies were not allowed to bring people into a village or town.  Apparently, in other countries with larger populations than we have if a bus company decides to bring visitors to a town where there might be an historic monument 3,000, 4,000 or 5,000 people may suddenly arrive in that town and the first thing that happens is that milk runs out, water runs out, havatories are broken down, garbage, litter and so on are thrown all over the place. There are all these problems.  The people cannot be fed and cannot be decently accommodated for a few hours because the necessary facilities do not exist.  It may seem a great hardship to lay down that the bus company cannot visit the place but that prohibition is necessary in the public interest until certain arrangements are made. Such an explanation of the necessity for planning can bring home to our citizens the fact that it is not a matter of bureaucrats taking additional power but a matter of these individuals planning for others.</P>
    <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>
