      <P>As announced by my Department on 29th November, three officers of the Department are in the United States investigating the possibility of purchasing Aberdeen Angus stock, both on behalf of the Department and of private breeders, including one AI station.  It is proposed to import, in all, five bulls and up to 20 <Col N="376" /> females.  It is not yet possible to say what the cost might be.</P>
      <P>The reason for the importation is that the popularity of the breed here has been declining, due to a loss of size and substance.  It is hoped that the introduction of selected American strains will materially assist our efforts to restore the breed, particularly in the west of Ireland, where these cattle have been traditionally popular.</P>

    <P>I am informed by the company that, to avoid interference with the primary purpose of the bridge and for reasons of security and to avoid danger to persons and property, it is necessary to limit and control the use of the bridge and that they consider that a <Col N="382" /> permit system will always be necessary for this.

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce what action the Government proposes to take either under the Prices Act, 1965, or otherwise in face of the price increase in flour which is being imposed by the flour millers in defiance of the expressed wishes of the Government; and whether the public will be required to pay this increased price.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

If I obtain evidence that anyone is contravening this Order, a prosecution will be instituted against him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will realise that under the existing prices legislation in connection with a very wide range of commodities and services, it is necessary to give not less than three months notice to the Minister for Industry and Commerce in respect of any proposed increase in price.  In pursuance of that legislation on 5th August, 1966 the Irish Flour Millers Association gave advance notice of their intention to increase the price of flour.  On 28th September, 1966 the association was informed that I had decided to establish a Prices Advisory Body under the Prices Act, 1965, to conduct a public inquiry into flour prices and at the same time, the association was requested that there should be no increase in its prices over the prices obtaining since 1965, until I had had an opportunity of <Col N="383" /> considering the report of the Prices Advisory Body and giving my decision on it.  On 5th October, 1966, I made an order establishing the Prices Advisory Body, and by letter dated 27th October, 1966, the Irish Flour Millers Association requested an interview with me to discuss a proposal for granting an interim increase in the price of flour.  On 28th October, 1966, my Department replied to this request pointing out that I had already met the bakers on 19th October, 1966, that they had made a similar request, that I had found it necessary to reject their request, that as the prices of flour and bread were closely interlinked, I did not see that it would be possible for me to grant their request and therefore saw no useful purpose being served in meeting the association. By letter dated 1st November, 1966, the Flour Millers Association again requested an interview with me for the purpose of discussing a proposed interim increase in flour prices. By letter dated 8th November, 1966, they were informed that I did not see any useful purpose being served by such a meeting.  In the late afternoon of Friday, 9th December, 1966, a letter was received in my Department stating that the Flour Millers Association proposed as from Monday, 12th December, to increase their flour prices.  I then made the Order to which I have referred and which came into operation on 13th December.</P>

    <Title>Institute for Advanced Studies (Amendment) Bill, 1966: Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. O'Malley) Donogh O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>The Institute for Advanced Studies was established under the Institute for Advanced Studies Act, 1940.  Section 19 (1) of that Act states that &ldquo;it shall be the duty of the Council as soon as conveniently may be after the passing of this Act, to prepare and submit to the Minister a scheme for the granting of pensions, gratuities, or other allowances on retirement to such Senior Professors and permanent whole-time members of the academic staff of the several Constituent Schools, and to such permanent whole-time officers of the Institute as the Council, with the approval of the Minister and the concurrence of the Minister for Finance, may determine&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Such a scheme was established by the Council and has been in operation since 1947.  This scheme does not, however, provide for the granting of pensions to the widows of professors and other permanent whole-time <Col N="387" /> officers of the academic staff and the existing provisions of the Act of 1940 do not permit of the amendment of the scheme to allow of such provision being made.</P>
    <P>Superannuation schemes applicable to academic staffs in many universities, including the Colleges of the National University and Trinity College make provision for the granting of pensions to widows of deceased members of the staff.  The Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies has accordingly found itself in the position of experiencing difficulty in attracting certain members to the staff of the Institute because of this lack of comparable financial cover for their families.  In this respect accordingly the desirable mobility of staff between the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies and other institutions of higher learning could be significantly restricted.</P>
    <P>A request has been made to me that section 19 (3) of the Act of 1940 should be amended in such a way as would enable the Council of the Institute to provide in the superannuation scheme for the granting of pensions to widows of deceased members of the permanent wholetime staff.  The purpose of the present Bill is to amend the Act accordingly.</P>
    <P>The main conditions of the scheme which the Council of the Institute proposes to introduce to allow of the payment of pensions to the wives of deceased members are as follows:</P>
    <P>(a)  a contribution towards the cost of the pensions would be made by male members of the academic staff in pensionable posts.  The amount of this contribution would be 1? per cent of salary per annum in the case of a junior member of the staff, 1¾ per cent in the case of the ordinary professor and 2 per cent in the case of the senior professor;</P>
    <P>(b)  to be eligible for a pension under the scheme a widow must have been married to the contributor before he retired from the Institute's service;</P>
    <P>(c)  the amount of the pension would be one-third of the pension payable to the husband if at the date of his death he were already in receipt of a pension <Col N="388" /> from the Institute, or one-third of the pension which would have been payable to him had he retired on pension on the grounds of ill-health at the date of his death while in the service of the Institute;</P>
    <P>(d)  payment of the pension would cease on the death or re-marriage of the recipient;</P>
    <P>(e)  a pension would not be payable unless at least ten years' contributions had been paid by or in respect of the contributor.</P>
    <P>I consider that the measure is required to bring conditions of service for the academic staff of the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies into line with those obtaining generally in Institutes of similar standing and I recommend the Bill to the Dáil for adoption as a non-controversial issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>We accept this measure as non-controversial.  In fact we welcome the provision for widows of professional people in the Institute and would welcome also an extension of the idea to other areas.  Possibly, we might discuss this at a later time. We are aware of the significant restriction that would be placed on the Institute if this scheme were not available to incoming members and, consequently, to their widows.</P>
      <P>There is one matter about which I should like to inquire from the Minister. It is in relation to past members of the staff of the Institute.  Has anyone died there?  I understand that at least one widow of a professor is in poor circumstances.  Will this scheme cover such a case?  On the face of it, it does not look to me as if it will.  Would the Minister accept an amendment to deal with the position of an existing widow? Beyond that, we do not regard this as controversial in any way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not object to this measure either.  I believe such a provision for widows is highly desirable.  I am not aware that this is widespread in the Civil Service, local authority service and the Government service generally.  Such a scheme for the provision of widows ought to be extended.  I know the people for <Col N="389" /> whom the Minister has responsibility may not be many, but this measure he has introduced ought to be copied by other Ministers in respect of their employees to ensure that the widows will not be cut off on the death of the husband.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I declare a vicarious interest in this Bill in that my brother is a senior professor of the Institute.  I want to recommend for the Minister's consideration the matter mentioned by Deputy Lindsay.  I understand that prior to the introduction of this Bill, one of the senior professors of the Institute&mdash;I think he was a professor of mathematics or cosmic physics or some subject related to that branch of the Institute's work&mdash;died leaving his widow in straitened circumstances. As it would appear now that the Minister agrees with the view that it is desirable on all grounds that the terms of service in the Institute should be brought into line with those obtaining in academic institutions both here and in the world at large, it seems rather a hardship if owing to the timing of this legislation, there should be one widow unprovided for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not underestimate the Minister's problem in dealing <i>ad hoc</i> with a difficulty of this kind.  I fully appreciate the thicket of precedents which he may apprehend growing up about him if a retrospective element were introduced into a scheme of this character.  On the other hand, I always recall the words of the late Deputy Alfie Byrne advising a young Deputy starting his political career in this House.  One of the pieces of advice he gave was that among those who would approach the young Deputy for help there would be widows: &ldquo;Always give them a kindly answer, however difficult their request, because when they lost their breadwinner they lost enough to entitle them at least to a sympathetic hearing.&rdquo; Recalling the memory of that distinguished colleague, I venture to suggest to the Minister that on that ground he might find a way to meet exceptional circumstances by departing from the rule against retrospection to cover this particular case.  If it would encourage <Col N="390" /> him, I may tell him I was warned when I was Minister for Agriculture against the breaching of my own regulations which would be involved by making concessions to a widow. I said: &ldquo;Rules were made to be broken in suitable cases.&rdquo; I broke my own rules and I provided for the widow.  Some day perhaps, should the Minister be interested, I will give him further particulars of that case.  It might embolden him to take his courage in his hands in this particular dilemma.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to Deputy Lindsay, Deputy Corish and Deputy Dillon for the co-operative way in which they have received this measure.  I think the matter mentioned by Deputy Lindsay is the same as that which Deputy Dillon had in mind. Yesterday afternoon Deputy Dillon very graciously communicated with me his anxiety with regard to the question of a widow of a professor of the Institute.  This professor, who died suddenly, spent four years and 11 months as a professor with the Institute.  The House will note that this Bill requires ten years service plus contributions. Therefore, even if the deceased professor had a full five years service, his widow would have been entitled to a gratuity but she would not have been entitled to a pension.  I can understand the point made by Deputy Dillon.  I inquired into this case immediately he got in touch with me yesterday.  I have looked into the matter in as sympathetic a light as I possibly could.  I can assure the Deputy that, were it feasible, I would have done something for the widow of this estimable gentleman, who rendered such excellent service to the country in the past.  That is all I have to say.</P>

      <P>It is clear from the terms of the scheme that, even if the professor had lived five years in the service of the Institute, he would not have been entitled to a pension under the terms of the scheme proposed but to a gratuity.  I should be content if the Minister said he would look sympathetically into the question with the Board of the Institute to determine whether it were possible to make some <i>ex gratia</i> payment.  I do not think we can ask him to do the impossible.  I see his difficulty.  Possibly, in discussion with the Board, a way might be found. If it cannot be, then it cannot be.</P>

Indeed, the Institute itself would not be empowered to make an <i>ex gratia</i> payment, I understand, without legislation.  Nevertheless, I shall see if there are any other channels and I shall communicate with the interested Deputies.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 5 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister a question on this section.  It does not relate to the strict text of the Bill.  Our concern under section 5 is to promote, assist and develop Irish industrial design and the improvement of the standard thereof, which is a very laudable and admirable purpose.  I do not know if the Minister's attention has been drawn to the imports into this country of objects manufactured in foreign countries which are of very doubtful aesthetic value and which are labelled in Irish, stating that they are manufactured in a foreign country. Inasmuch as the inscription declaring their place of manufacture is in the Irish language, I think the inscription is in fact designed to suggest to the casual purchaser that the article is of Irish manufacture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main purpose of this section is to raise the general standard of Irish design and doubtless to associate Irish exports with the general impression of <Col N="393" /> excellence, which I think is perfectly right.  Our hopes in the markets of the world must be based on excellence rather than on the prospects of mass production.  I have the feeling that the circulation of objects of the kind to which I have referred interferes with the objectives we have in view in this Bill.  I should be interested to hear from the Minister if that aspect of the question has ever presented itself to his mind and, if so, whether he feels it would be appropriate, in connection with this Bill, to consider what, if any, steps we could take to offset any damage which this kind of trade transaction might do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Colley) George Colley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the abuse &mdash;I think that is the right word&mdash;to which Deputy Dillon referred.  It applies primarily, I think, in the field of souvenirs but not exclusively to souvenirs, and I regard it as an abuse.  There is no doubt, particularly in the case of souvenirs which are bought largely by tourists who may be assumed to have no knowledge of the Irish language, that the inscription in the Irish language may very well not be as informative as it was originally intended to be. However, this is a matter which arises, I think, under the Merchandise Marks Act rather than under this Bill.  It is a matter of which I am aware and one which I am considering, to see what steps we can take to combat it under the Merchandise Marks Act and also under a general programme in regard to consumer protection on which we are embarking.  I do not think it would be appropriate to try to deal with it under this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section is designed to enable Córas Tráchtála to continue and to expand its work in connection with the Kilkenny Design Workshops which have already proved, in my opinion, to be of very great worth and will in my opinion in the future turn out to be one of the most important developments which have taken place in this country for many years in the field of encouraging industry, particularly small industry, in rural areas.  The section is particularly designed to deal <Col N="394" /> with that.  The matter to which Deputy Dillon refers is, I think, more appropriate to be dealt with under the Merchandise Marks Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>With the Bill now in its present form and about to pass, I should like to ask the Minister this question.  Suppose a person here is working with some particular material &mdash;I do not want to be more specific than that&mdash;and has reached the limit of his own ingenuity in design, can he go to some division of Córas Tráchtála with the material in which he is working and say: &ldquo;There are the things I have worked out as being desirable products of this material.  Can you suggest to me any further uses to which I can put this material or are you prepared to help me to test the market with new designs suggested by you because, quite frankly, I am quite prepared to trust your judgment, or at least to give it a run, but I cannot afford to do it at my own expense?&rdquo; What happens then if that application is made?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should perhaps explain that at present the kind of situation which Deputy Dillon visualises is one in which the inquiry should be put to Kilkenny Design Workshops, which is a subsidiary of Córas Tráchtála.  At present, Kilkenny Design Workshops are working in the following fields: woven textiles, printed textiles, poplin weaving, candles, wood-turning, pottery and silverware.  These are their present fields of activity but that is by no means the end of the road.  They will expand into other fields.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the question of coming to them and asking them to assist with designs in a particular kind of <Col N="395" /> material, I think the position is that they will be very willing to do anything they can in providing help with designs.  Furthermore, in regard to the question of expenses involved in trying these out, they will assist in that, too, and Córas Tráchtála have power to give grants which would assist in this regard in testing the market.  I should say that already there have been some very successful ventures arising out of the use of Kilkenny Design Workshops, not at this stage on a very large scale, for reasons which I will explain in a moment.</P>
    <P>There have been several crafts which have almost died out in this country and they have died out because the craftsmen were using designs which were poor imitations usually of old-fashioned English designs and they were trying to compete with mass-produced articles with rather poor designs.  In some of these cases, Kilkenny Design Workshops have produced designs which are based on traditional Irish designs but are modern and suited to modern requirements and have given these to some of the remaining craftsmen in these fields and have found that the market for their goods is vast, that the price available for them is far superior to that available for the poor quality article being produced in the past and that the problem is to get enough of these things produced, and, indeed, they are assisting in every way they can to get more craftsmen trained in these fields.</P>
    <P>I mention this merely as an example of the kind of thing they have been doing and it is the kind of thing of which I have great hopes that on expanding their activities&mdash;and they will be expanding their activities&mdash;they can make a considerable difference. As I say, particularly in rural Ireland, where you may get in a small village one craftsman working at the moment, with this kind of assistance both with design and in marketing he may very well, within a short time, be employing a number of people.  This, of course, can be of very great importance in a small rural area.  It is for that reason that I say that I have great hopes of <Col N="396" /> Kilkenny Design Workshops and their impact on rural Ireland in future, judging by the success which has attended their efforts heretofore.</P>

The question I want to ask is this: May I assume, then, that if some well-intentioned citizen sees some native material being used in a very limited sphere, Córas Tráchtála would welcome their attention being directed to this material so that they might take the initiative in approaching an unimaginative monopolist of that material and saying to him: &ldquo;Why do you not branch out with Kilkenny Design Workshops to widen the scope of your business?&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, this is so and, indeed, in case I have given a wrong impression of their activities, I should also say that they provide designs for larger manufacturers than the kind I have been talking about heretofore&mdash;in textiles, for instance&mdash;certain types of textile goods.  They have provided these designs for the manufacturers and the manufacturers have sold them &mdash;I know of one case in particular&mdash;on the American market very successfully, the tie-up between Kilkenny Design Workshops and Córas Tráchtála enabling them to advise on the requirements of different markets in different parts of the world.</P>

It seems to me that paragraph (2) (i) is completely at variance with what the Minister for Education has been saying.  Does the Minister mean that young people leaving schools to be apprenticed will be dependent for their apprenticeship on the Comhairle deciding whether they should be trained as apprentices?  It seems the Comhairle will grant scholarships and that selection will be made by them.  Has the Minister discussed it with the Minister for Education?  Will the selection be confined to a body?</P>

      <P>Take the case of a man in a rural area, whether he works on a farm, in a sand and gravel pit, with the county council, or with the Forestry Department, which are the usual forms of employment in rural areas, in addition to producing turf for Bord na Móna.  His source of employment ceases.  What happens to him? The Minister says he will qualify for retraining but what will actually happen?  He will go to the labour exchange and sign on as being unemployed. Has he got to find the opening in industry himself?  That is the real point.  Has he got to find the job himself or will there be machinery to find the job for him and for which he will get this training?  This will become a vital issue in the years ahead.</P>
      <P>Yesterday, Gordon Walker said that England would be in the Common Market in three years and I suppose through our Act of Union, we will be in the same position.  The total percentage of the population of England engaged in agriculture is four.  Ours is around 36 per cent.  Due to mechanisation, rationalisation, and so forth, England's figure is four per cent.  It is, therefore, a logical assumption that as the years go on the number departing from agriculture will accelerate in Common Market conditions.  It follows from that that far more workers will be coming off the land as a result of the policy which this Government are setting out upon.  What will happen to the agricultural labourer or the rural worker generally who will find himself out of a job?  What will happen to him as a result of this Bill?  Will this enable him to go to the labour exchange, in the sure knowledge that the State will provide training and the opening for him, or must he find a job himself and then apply for training? What will be the actual machinery?</P>

      <P>The drill will be that when men become unemployed, they report to the labour exchange where normally they can draw benefit or assistance.  Could the Minister say what process starts from there?  Like Deputy Dunne, I am rather interested in finding out whether it will be as it is at present.  I am not being critical of the Minister now.</P>

      <P>I understand.  There will be a new placement service which will be actively seeking openings for such people, seeking to place them in employment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>They go to the exchange and sign on and from there the exchange will contact the new service which will endeavour to find openings.  When the employment exchange idea started, the idea was that men were to be put in employment from there but that has long since disappeared.  Is there any danger of something like this happening under this&mdash;that they will have the name of <Col N="408" /> places where this can be done but that people will merely sign on as at present?</P>

      <P>There will be a new service which will be in a separate part of the exchange.  It was suggested that there should be a separate building but on balance the arguments were in favour of going to the same building for benefit payments and to avail of the services which may be available with regard to training and placement.  We will be dealing with redundancy payment legislation in the next session, I hope.  There will be special offices with specially trained officers in the placement services in the exchanges and these will assess the man's capacity and have available information about available posts, and if the man needs to be trained for such a post, they will arrange to make the training available.</P>

We talk about placing those going out of employment but there is the problem of the backlog. There are at present 50,000 unemployed and I would like to know if efforts will be made to place them first.  There is little use in making arrangements to train people who will become disemployed unless something is done about this backlog of 50,000 a figure which will probably increase by 20,000 or 25,000 persons who would be prepared to sign on in the hope of getting employment.</P>

      <P>The Minister shall from time to time appoint, on such terms and conditions as he shall determine, a person to be the chief executive officer of An Chomhairle, and such person shall be known, and is in this Act referred to, as the Chief Officer.</P>
      <P>Is there any reason why An Chomhairle should not do this?  It is set up by the Minister and the people who will be members of it will be obviously skilled in deciding how they will handle these problems.

It is possible that the function of chief officer may be carried out by a full-time chairman, or there may be a part-time chairman acting as the chief officer.

      <P>Subsection (4) contains provisions which detail the arrangements under which officers and servants of An Chomhairle who become members of either House of the Oireachtas may be seconded from the service of An Chomhairle.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to draw the Minister's attention to subsection (3) of this section because it provides that the rate of remuneration of the servants of An Chomhairle will be subject not alone to the approval of the Minister but also to the approval of the Minister for Finance.  Experience has shown that the rate for the job has often not been paid until it is too late.  I wonder is the Minister satisfied that the provisions in this subsection will enable him to get the best man for the job.  I would ask him to look at this and contrast it with the kind of thing we have been doing in relation to other bodies set up by legislation such as An Bord Iascaigh Mhara and Bord Fáilte to whom a block approval is given.  It is within their discretion to dispense their grant.  This is one of the things the Minister ought to look at from the point of view of the delay it would cause.  There would be two references in this case, a reference in the first instance, to the Minister and then to the Department of Finance, and I regard that as undesirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>The disadvantage is, as the Deputy says, that there could be delay and we have arranged with the Minister for Finance that there would not be undue delay.  The advantage in having consultation is to ensure that uneven levels of salaries would not be created among different bodies under the State thus causing unnecessary leapfrogging and discontent.  There is something to be said for the Minister for Finance having an overall look at the comparable salaries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>This is standard practice in Government Departments and I do not know about the guarantee <Col N="415" /> that there would not be undue delay. We have experience with other Government Departments where decisions which have been referred to the Department of Finance for their comments have not been replied to 18 months later.  The Department say: &ldquo;What are we to do?  The Department of Finance have the last word.  We have got to wait.&rdquo;  The Minister says he has a guarantee.  From whom has he got a guarantee?  Ministers are birds of passage like ourselves.  Nobody is going to live forever.  I do not go all the way with Deputy Jones but I think a lot more is needed than a guarantee from somebody who holds an office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a personal guarantee.  It is a guarantee from the Minister in his official capacity.  There could be a problem in regard to delay but if this matter is not attended to by the Minister in his official capacity then we would have to allow the various bodies to determine their own salaries, which may be undesirable. This is an official undertaking, not a personal one.</P>

      <P>In section 12 it is provided:</P>
      <P>(1)  An Chomhairle shall appoint such and so many persons to be officers (other than the Chief Officer) and servants of An Chomhairle as An Chomhairle from time to time thinks proper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  Subject to subsection (3) of this section, an officer (other than the <Col N="416" /> Chief Officer) or servant of An Chomhairle shall hold his office or employment on such terms and conditions as An Chomhairle from time to time determines.</P>
    <P>The next subsection deals with remuneration. This is contrary to what operates in a large number of semi-State bodies.  In some cases there is a full-time board; in other cases there may be a full-time chairman and part-time members of the board.  But in quite a large number of them the level of salaries and wages is determined by the board.  In this case the Minister is requiring that the approval of the Minister for Finance be obtained.  He is departing from the practice of many semi-State bodies.  To some extent this could possibly hamper the Authority in obtaining the most suitable persons for posts.  The Minister is aware that in the Institute of Industrial Research and Standards, where scales have been laid down, difficulty was experienced in obtaining persons with the requisite qualifications and, in fact, the point of entry to service was raised.  Such action would be denied An Chomhairle Traenála, who may find themselves in difficulty as regards attracting the most qualified personnel. So far as obtaining the approval of the Minister for Finance for individual cases is concerned, it has often proved to be a frustrating and delaying experience.</P>

The principle of the Minister for Finance having an overall view would be applicable to this body only if it became applicable to the others.  I would not want the Comhairle to have this restriction on it, if it were not applied equally to other bodies competing for the same type of personnel.  If the House will leave it to me, I will see if I can do anything about it.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 9, between lines 13 and 14, to insert the following new subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3)  Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section, a grant out of moneys kept in an account mentioned in subsection (1) of section 19 of this Act shall only be made in case&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the person to whom it is intended to make the grant is carrying on a designated industrial activity, and</P>

      <P>Section 19 empowers An Chomhairle to impose training levies on employers in a designated industrial activity.  The moneys raised by such levies will be kept in separate accounts under section 19, subsection (1), and will be paid back to firms in the industry in proportion to the amount and quality of training given by them.  The Joint Committee recommended that provision should be made in the Bill requiring An Chomhairle to consult with the appropriate industrial training committee before it determines the basis on which the money raised by means of levies will be disbursed to employers by means of training grants.

      <P>Subsection (2) (a) of section 18 reads:</P>
      <P>A grant under this section shall not exceed the amount which the Minister shall, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, specify for the purposes of this section from time to time and particular amounts may be so specified in relation to industrial undertakings of a particular class.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not like this not trusting the Minister so that he has again to go to the Minister for Finance.  I do not like the phrase &ldquo;from time to time&rdquo;.  Here is something that will be urgent. People will become unemployed: there will be the problem of retraining and re-employment.  Under this subsection, the Department of Finance has a staying power by virtue of the expression &ldquo;from time to time&rdquo;.  I believe the Minister for Labour is in earnest in <Col N="421" /> regard to this matter but we should not legally tie ourselves up in regard to something which will be urgent when it occurs so that there may be delay.</P>
    <P>A time of change is bound to happen and the Minister envisages it.  We are told there will be changes and problems if we enter the Common Market.  If An Chomhairle must await the consent of the Minister for Finance, in connection, for example, with the amount of the grants, the position will be unsatisfactory because the Minister for Labour cannot sanction, even if he knows it to be necessary. This is a weakening of the section and of the kind of activity for which the Minister is trying to prepare.  I do not think that this will get us the kind of dynamic approach we require for the period of change which lies ahead.  It is akin to what we have already been talking about and which the Minister says he will look at.  I should like him to concentrate now on the expression &ldquo;from time to time&rdquo;. In a period of change, when a problem arises, it becomes immediate and there is no time to wait.  Ready and fast decisions must be taken and we must trust in the body set up to deal with problems which suddenly arise and which we envisage will occur.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) (b) reads:</P>
    <P>A grant under this section for the training of workers in a skilled process of an industrial undertaking in an undeveloped area shall be made neither before the coming into effect of the repeal by this Act of section 7 of the Undeveloped Areas Act, 1952, nor in any case in which a grant was made in respect of the process under the said section 7.</P>
    <P>Here, again, we might equally have the case that completely new workers may be required and this is something that should be covered as well.  In this subsection, there is rather a weakening link in regard to the kind of machinery the Minister is now trying to prepare and this is so because the Minister will not be master in his own Department. In other words, the overall position of the Minister for Finance will dominate a matter of serious import and urgency. I should like the Minister to consider this seriously.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall have a look at the salary question again.  In this instance, it is an improvement, even though it may seem to be otherwise. The existing legislation for training imposes specific limits on the amount of grants&mdash;the grant not to exceed the actual amount of wages paid to a trainee while he is being trained and travelling and subsistence expenses while he is outside the State.  There would be no separate need to go each time to the Minister for Finance.  There would be a general sanction up to that limit.  This provision of having a decision &ldquo;from time to time&rdquo; by the Minister for Finance allows for an extra amount of grant to be made payable, if sanctioned by the Minister.  For the ordinary run of events, there would be general sanction which would not cause any administrative delay.  It would not be necessary to go to the Minister for Finance about every training grant under the subsection.  It would be a general sanction but special high grants could be sought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>In subsection (2) (a) of this section 18, we read that &ldquo;a grant under this section shall not exceed the amount which the Minister shall, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, specify...&rdquo; That is a grant.  Under section 16, which has gone through, the Minister has already had to get the concurrence of the Minister for Finance to make the money available to cover, in general, the administration, the running, money for grants, and so on.  While the amount to An Chomhairle has been provided, under section 16, with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance, we now find in this section 18, that, instead of the Minister for Labour being able to deal with a matter straight away, there is apparently a second requirement on him to obtain the concurrence of the Minister for Finance.  That appears to be fairly definite in respect of a grant: it does not say &ldquo;grants&rdquo; but &ldquo;grant.&rdquo; It would appear that the Minister for Labour must get the consent of the Minister for Finance in respect of expenditure of money for a grant which has already been passed <i>in globo</i> for the expenses of An Chomhairle.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>The only other sanction I could get would be for a specific amount of grant.  I get the money from the taxpayer, through the Minister for Finance.  I could get a specific sanction only as I have already instanced. General decisions can be given administratively.  I would not have to go every time for each individual case.  Those who have been administering the training grants up to now regard this as an improvement on the position as it has hitherto obtained.  I am not limited to anything specified in law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is recognised that this is an improvement from the point of view of the level.  The section refers to moneys at the disposal of An Chomhairle.  These are moneys at its disposal which have already been approved by the Minister for Finance. They may appear to be other moneys but they are moneys at the Minister's disposal which have already been made available to the Minister for Labour with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance.  Yet, according to the subsection, it would appear that the Minister will have to go back to the Minister for Finance and to say, in effect: &ldquo;We have this money which has already been approved by the Minister for Finance but we now want a second approval to expend it in a certain way.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I take it that what the Minister means by this is that each specific sum will be laid down at a particular time and if the Minister agrees to adjust it or if the House agrees to adjust it, because, due to rising costs and things like that, the level of grant may not be sufficient, it can be increased?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>It can be improved. Putting it this way, it allows elbow room.  It allows us to be able to raise the level of grant rather than keep it to the specific limitations which are already in practice affecting, for example, the training grants given by An Foras Tionscal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the point I was <Col N="424" /> trying to make, that the normal procedure is that if you have not sufficient money you look to the Dáil for an excess vote.  Within a Department the amount granted by the Department of Finance for any Department can be used under various subheads and as long as the Minister's Estimate does not exceed the total of the subheads he is all right.  Is the Minister satisfied in regard to this provision that he can so use his subheads as to make money available to An Chomhairle Traenála should they need it in case of urgent necessity?</P>

      <P>In regard to subsection (6), has the Minister any objection to a draft order being laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas so that the Oireachtas would see what type of levies are being imposed before they are imposed?  There is provision made here that the order shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas &ldquo;as soon as may be after it is made&rdquo;.  Is there any reason why this levy order should not be laid before the Oireachtas before it is confirmed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is need for it.  The levy is to equalise the cost of the training and is to ensure that various employers will play their part in paying for the workers who are trained for them.  To bring a draft order through the Dáil would be almost to introduce legislation to implement a levy order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>We would not agree. This House is given the power to confirm or annul.  If a draft order is submitted to this House, one might be thinking in terms of amendments and, from the point of view of getting training for these young people in industry, the value of the Bill would be very seriously interferred with because the matter could be put on the long finger.  There is no doubt that the employers have equal representation under the Bill and there is the right of appeal to an appeal tribunal and there is the provision that an order may be annulled.  There is adequate provision there in case anybody feels that something has been done incorrectly or unjustly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I would agree with Deputy Larkin.  It would make very cumbersome machinery and could mean that we would be arguing for a very long time as to whether somebody was affected.  I am with the Minister that as it is in the Bill is the proper way to deal with it.  Subsection (2) of section 20 says:</P>
      <P>If, on an appeal, the appellant satisfies a tribunal established in accordance with regulations under this section that he ought not to have been assessed to the levy or ought to have been assessed in a smaller amount, the tribunal shall rescind, or as the case may be, reduce the assessment, but in any other case shall confirm it, and any decision of the tribunal shall be final.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thought the Minister might have taken steps to ensure that, if it were <Col N="429" /> found not enough was being charged, provision could be made to have it increased.  Experience may prove that the levy is less than it should be and the Minister, I think, is making a mistake in not including a provision to increase it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>In the normal course, the Comhairle would proceed to bring in an industrial activity under the scope of the Bill by means of an industrial training order, having first carried out consultations with the interested bodies.  It would then set up an industrial training committee under section 22 to advise and assist An Chomhairle in dealing with the training problems of the activity concerned.  In consultation with the committee, An Chomhairle will tackle the various training problems of the industrial <Col N="430" /> activity as a whole.  It will deal with the training of all the workers in the industry, including apprentices, operatives, foremen and supervisors, and with retraining and refresher courses and accelerated vocational training.</P>
      <P>Under another section of the Bill, An Chomhairle could do this without any consultation or without setting up any committee.  Where speed is required, they can do all that without setting up a committee.  In the absence of an industrial training order, they cannot impose a training levy under section 19.  They cannot regulate apprenticeship except where the industry has been designated under the Apprenticeship Act, 1959.  The order may apply to an industry, or a sector of an industry, or sectors of a number of industries.  It could cover the building industry as a whole or a number of trades in the industry.  Alternatively, the order could be made on an occupational basis covering persons engaged in a number of different industries, such as electricians.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 14:</P>
      <P>Before section 23, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>23 (1)  An industrial training committee may, in accordance with proposals submitted to and approved by An Chomhairle&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  appoint committees (which need not include members of the industrial training committee);</P>
      <P>(b)  join with one or more other industrial training committees in appointing joint committees consisting of such persons (whether or not members of an industrial training committee) as may be determined by the industrial training committees;</P>
      <P>and delegate to any such committee, to such extent, whether in whole or in part, as may be stated in the proposals, the function conferred on the industrial training committee by section 22 of this Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  The chairman of a committee appointed under this section shall be paid, out of moneys at the disposal of An Chomhairle, such fee (if any) for attendance at meetings of the committee as the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, <Col N="432" /> determines, and in the absence of the chairman from a meeting of the committee, the fee (if any) that would be payable to him may, if An Chomhairle thinks fit, be paid to the person who acts as chairman of the meeting.</P>
    <P>(3)  Each member of a committee appointed under this section shall be paid, out of moneys at the disposal of An Chomhairle, such allowances (if any) for expenses incurred by him as the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, may sanction.</P>
    <P>(4)  Subject to any directions of the industrial training committee or committees which appointed it, a committee appointed under this section shall regulate, by standing orders or otherwise, the procedure and business of the committee.</P>
    <P>This was recommended by the joint committee.  It empowers the industrial training committee, with the approval of An Chomhairle, to set up a sub-committee or form joint committees and to co-opt to them members from outside the parent committees.  It contains the usual provisions for the payment of fees to the chairman and allowances to the members and for the regulation of the business and procedure of the committees.  Such committees could play a major part in examining specialist aspects of training problems within a particular industry or in determining the course of action which should be taken to tackle training problems common to a number of industries.</P>

      <P>The purpose of amendments Nos. 15 and 16 is to prohibit the obstruction of employers in implementing the following rules:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  Rules made under section 24 of the Bill regulating aspects of apprenticeship, for example, age of entry and educational rules, in designated industrial activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(ii)  Apprentice workshop training rules which may be made by An Chomhairle under Section 46 (1) (d) for certain trades controlled under the Apprenticeship Act, 1959, for which such rules have not been made before An Chomhairle Traenála is set up.  (It is proposed in amendment No. 28 to <Col N="436" /> empower An Chomhairle to make such rules).</P>
    <P>(iii)  Apprenticeship rules made for trades controlled under the Apprenticeship Act, 1959 which will be continued in force by Section 46 (1) (b) of the Bill.</P>
    <P>A similar provision is made in section 51 of the Apprenticeship Act which prohibits interference for the purpose of preventing or obstructing an employer from complying with rules made under that Act.</P>
    <P>The purpose of paragraph (c) in amendment No. 28 is to facilitate the taking of legal proceedings by or against An Chomhairle under Section 46 (8) of the Bill.  In effect it continues in force section 16 (3) of the Apprenticeship Act, 1959 despite the repeal of that Act.</P>
    <P>The inclusion of paragraph (d) in amendment No. 28, has been requested by An Cheard Chomhairle who have represented that it is likely that workshop training rules will not be made for a number of trades controlled under the Apprenticeship Act, 1959 before An Chomhairle Traenála has been established.  The position about apprenticeship rules made or confirmed by An Cheard Chomhairle is that under section 46 (1) (b) of the Bill these rules will be continued in force and will be administered by An Chomhairle Traenála.  These rules may also be amended or revoked by An Chomhairle Traenála.  However, An Chomhairle Traenála are not empowered to make apprenticeship rules for such trades unless the industries concerned have first been designated by Order under Section 21 of the Bill.  In the circumstances, An Cheard Chomhairle have asked that An Chomhairle Traenála should be given power to make apprentice training rules for certain trades in conjunction with the appropriate apprenticeship committees where such rules have not been made before An Chomhairle Traenála is established. The amendment gives effect to An Cheard Chomhairle's request.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Minister is aware of an industry which manufactures tubular steel furniture. I shall give him an instance of a number of young people being recruited from the local technical school as apprentices to this type of work.  Some of them were welding tubular steel, some of them enamelling it.  After some time, an application was made, possibly by the employer, possibly by the local technical school, to the Apprenticeship Board.  Later, an inspector of the board ruled that since the boys were not carrying out a type of work which could be generally accepted as a trade, they were not entitled to be treated as apprentices.  The result was that after two years those young fellows found themselves termed merely as unskilled labourers.  I am giving an instance of one case while I am aware of a number of others.  There are a number of garages throughout the country which employ boys as apprentices and they spend a few years there earning very small money.  After those few years, you find them washing cars and selling petrol and they have not become craftsmen at all.  The employer uses the system to get away with paying a small rate of remuneration and these boys turn out, in fact, to be only unskilled labourers.  What is the possibility of having these things straightened out?  The trade must be designated and I had in mind a trade which has not been designated.</P>

      <P>In subsection (3), page 17, line 29, after &ldquo;determine&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;: Provided that in case a person, at the instance of his employer, attends any such course or avails of any such service or facility, any fee payable to An Chomhairle in respect thereof shall be payable by, and only by, the employer&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment was recommended by the Joint Committee.  The Committee made two criticisms of the subsection. The first was that it was not clear who would be liable to pay fees and the second was that it appeared that An Chomhairle might be empowered to charge fees to people who had not participated in a training course.  An Chomhairle may charge fees if it provides a special course at the request of an employer or groups of employers and it can charge admission fees to these courses and also to conferences and seminars and so on.  It is apparent from subsection (4) of the section that An Chomhairle may recover fees only where a contractual agreement exists between An Chomhairle and the other party.  The amendment ensures that where a person, at the instance of his employer, attends a course for which <Col N="439" /> a fee is charged, that fee will be paid by the employer and not by the employee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the operative part of this amendment is to ensure that where a person attends such a course at the instance of his employer, the fee will be paid by the employer?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the position with regard to a person who attends a course of this nature on his own initiative?  The section empowers An Chomhairle to impose fees on persons who attend particular courses of training and this seems to be oddly at variance with the ideal of free post-primary education.  Is An Chomhairle entitled to impose fees on people who attend courses on their own initiative? The Minister is making provision that where the employee attends a course at the request of his employer, it is right and proper that the employer should pay the fee, but in regard to the section itself, it seems that we are at variance with the idea on which we have all been proceeding that we are to have free post-primary education which is to include vocational training and industrial training.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be courses for which employees will be picked <Col N="440" /> and paid for by their employers.  In the few cases where an employee would not be sent by his employer or would not be selected for the course and elects to go on himself, he would be expected to pay a fee.</P>

      <P>These amendments are recommended by the Joint Committee. Article 27 of the First Schedule provides that the Chairman and all the ordinary members of An Chomhairle shall have a vote.  Section 36 (4), which is similar to section 57 (5) of the Apprenticeship Act, 1959, provides that voting on the granting of exemption from requirements of certain apprenticeship rules should be confined to the Chairman and the workers' and employers' members of An Chomhairle. The Joint Committee recommended that voting on such matters should be open to all members of An Chomhairle and this amendment gives effect to the recommendation.  The section as originally drafted was copied from the 1959 Apprenticeship Act and did not take account of the fact that only the Chairman and the employers' and workers' members were entitled to vote.

      <P>I move amendment No. 23:</P>

    <P>(a) In case a person on whom a notice under paragraph (a) of subsection (2) of section 29 of this Act is served, at any time while failing or neglecting to comply with the requirement of the notice, either is on any premises in the occupation of the employer on whom a notice relating to the person is served under paragraph (b) of the said subsection (2), or does work for or on behalf of the <Col N="447" /> employer, the employer shall be guilty of an offence.</P>
    <P>This was an amendment recommended by the Joint Committee also. Subsection (2) of section 29 enabled An Chomhairle to serve a notice on an employer requiring him to release his apprentices during working hours, and without loss of pay, to attend trade instruction courses in technical schools.  The purpose of this amendment is to cut off any possible loophole which would allow an employer to refuse to release his apprentices to attend such classes.  Under the section as drafted, there is, for instance, a doubt whether an apprentice working on a building site is engaged on work in premises in the occupation of his employer.  It is to seal off a loophole.</P>

      <P>I take it that the Minister, in regard to the matters on which we have been speaking&mdash;the question of the quorum and the question of the limitations which are being imposed, or that seem to be imposed by Finance&mdash; has promised to have a look at it before he takes it to the Seanad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>The point raised by Deputy Jones and Deputy Larkin is that the salaries fixed by An Chomhairle have to be sanctioned by the Minister for Labour in consultation with the Minister for Finance.  The Deputies understood that the basis for it is so that there could be an overall look by the Minister for Finance at the salaries for comparable posts in different State bodies but I agree that this particular body should not be restricted if other bodies are not similarly dealt with.  What I undertake to do is to go back and consult now and see if we can make the change and, if this is possible, to introduce an amendment in the Seanad to bring it about.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, I am sure, could have a list of comparable bodies which may be provided with the necessary finance to operate.  In the case of An Foras Talúntas, the money is voted in bulk.  They have to submit accounts, of course.  In the case of many other bodies, the money is provided and they can make their own decisions.  It can be of tremendous value, particularly from the point of view of efficient operation. The Minister has indicated that he will have the matter considered and we hope that he will be able to amend the sections.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that while it was general practice to permit such bodies to pay the salaries, that practice has resulted in the position that comparable employment in State bodies was not being equally remunerated and this caused leap-frogging.  It was necessary for the Minister for Finance to have some say in it, but, if it is not generally applied, it should not be applied to anyone.  I will try to deal with it as best I can.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the Dáil hereby approves of the Garda Síochána Pensions Order, 1966, made on the 17th day of October, 1966, by the Minister for Justice, with the sanction of the Minister for Finance, under section 13 of the Police Forces Amalgamation Act, 1925.</P>
      <P>The Garda Síochána Pensions Order, 1966, which I am asking the House to approve, contains an amendment to the existing Garda Síochána Pensions Orders, the effects of which are explained in the memorandum which has been circulated to Deputies with the Order.</P>
      <P>As Deputies will observe from the memorandum, the Order provides for the application to members of the Garda Síochána of the benefits of the Pensions (Abatement) Act, 1965, which applies to Civil Servants and Local Government Officials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda Síochána Pensions Orders at present provide for the abatement of the pension of a retired garda <Col N="457" /> who takes up any employment remunerated out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas or out of the Central Fund.  The effect of the new Order is that:</P>
    <P>(1)  there will no longer be any abatement in the pension of a retired member of the force who secures employment, other than in the Garda Síochána,</P>
    <P>(2)  in the case where abatement will continue to apply, namely where the re-employment is in the Garda Síochána, it will be alleviated by being related, not, as heretofore, to the pay at the date of retirement but to the pay currently applying to the member's former position, and</P>
    <P>(3)  the abatement in the pension of a retired member of the force, who is re-appointed to the Garda Síochána, may be waived by the Minister for Finance subject to the condition that the pensioner is re-employed for work, for which he has particular training and experience, and that it is not practicable to meet the requirement otherwise.</P>
    <P>The Order takes effect from the 1st January, 1965, which is the date that the Pensions (Abatement) Act came into force.</P>
    <P>The Order will, thus, operate to the advantage of members of the Garda Síochána and I ask approval of the motion.</P>

      <P>This amendment proposes to change the short title of the Bill from Criminal Justice Act to Criminal Procedure Act.

      <P>In subsection (1) (b), page 3, line 30, to add &ldquo;stating in respect of each such witness the age, occupation, address and relationship (if any) to any party concerned in the proceedings.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment arises out of the discussion on Second Reading.  The Minister will recall that I urged on him, in relation to the information to be furnished, that it should not be regarded as sufficient to furnish information, without, at the same time, furnishing some information in regard to the person making the statement.  I suggested to the Minister then that the kind of information which would be particularly relevant would be the age, occupation and address of the person making the statement, and the relationship, if any, of the person making the statement to any party concerned in the <Col N="461" /> proceedings.  I conceded that some of this information would probably be given in any event as a matter of practice. If the Garda statements were taken in the ordinary way to which we have been accustomed, they would start with: &ldquo;I, so and so, of such and such a place,&rdquo; and then set out the occupation and so forth of the person making the statement.  I imagine that, as a matter of practice, this is what will be done.  But the danger is that this kind of information might not be regarded as important by a layman.  Any lawyer will, of course, agree, that it is the kind of information that could be of very great importance, particularly to those engaged in the defence of the accused.</P>
    <P>While I am reasonably satisfied ordinary practice will ensure that this information is given, nevertheless there will be no obligation on the Garda authorities, unless it is put into the Bill, to ensure that the information is furnished and, for that reason, I urge the Minister to accept the amendment. It certainly will not create any trouble for the authorities.  It will not weaken the Bill in any way.  All that is required is that relevant and, in some cases, essential information must be given.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposed to this amendment.  I agree with Deputy O'Higgins that this will, in fact, be the practice having regard to the good sense of state solicitors.  It has been the practice over a long number of years. I would dislike putting it in as a rigid provision in the Bill.  It is bad legislation to go into too much detail and, so long as we are satisfied that details with regard to age, occupation, address and relationship will be included as a matter of practice, there is no need to make any rigid provision.  It is better to have in the Bill what one might call the basic information&mdash;a statement of the charges against the accused, a list of the witnesses to give evidence, a statement of the evidence of each witness, a list of exhibits.  We should confine ourselves, in my opinion, to that type of basic information.  If we go into details in regard to the matters raised by Deputy O'Higgins, there would be no end to it.  So long as we <Col N="462" /> are satisfied that this information will, in practice, be given we should be content.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that in some cases this kind of information might not be regarded as relevant?  In other cases most people would feel it was essential. Remember, these statements will be taken in private.  The information will be furnished afterwards to the accused person.  It would be very important for the accused's lawyers to be in possession of information as to whether the maker of a statement in support of the prosecutor's case is, for example, related to the prosecutor.  Is the person a child, an adult, a young person, or what?  That kind of information is certainly important; in some cases it could be essential.</P>

      <P>If it is put into the Bill, on the normal interpretation of criminal statutes, one will immediately be open to having an information declared bad on purely technical grounds and you would have the possibility of frustrating litigation.  Suppose the Deputy's amendment were accepted and suppose that, in error, some particular, not relevant really but required statutorily, were omitted, there would be a formal defect immediately and by writing this into this Bill, one could render the proceedings bad.</P>

      <P>I am not quite sure it is as simple as that in a criminal case.  There is a difference between the rules of evidence in criminal cases and in purely civil <Col N="463" /> cases.  I think the Minister's approach is the better one.  I do not think the Deputy will lose anything but I do think a great number of technical defences might be built up, defences with no merit at all but which have always been admitted in criminal cases when they have been attempted.  I suggest the Minister's course is the better one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the nub of the issue.  You would have technical non-compliance upsetting the proceedings. Deputy de Valera put his finger on the trouble.  Once it is written in, in any criminal trial it becomes a technical proof, and non-compliance would succeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy de Valera that it is quite justifiable, particularly in criminal cases, to rely on any technical flaw.  But surely the position is that the Minister presumably and the House will have some confidence in their law officers and in the Garda authorities?  It should not be beyond the wit of the investigating garda or of the State solicitor concerned to ensure that this simple information, which might be vital, should be furnished.  We are requiring them to give a statement of the charges.  It may be that it will not be stated properly, that there will be a technical flaw of which the defence may take advantage.  As it appears here, it is a very general statement and a technical defence could arise from it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We ask for a list of witnesses whom the Attorney General proposes to call at the trial.  It might be of the utmost importance to a person charged with certain types of offence that he should know the material facts concerning a witness.  It might be of importance for him to know whether the witness is related to the person bringing the prosecution.  The Minister made it clear on a previous amendment that the right of private prosecution is being preserved and surely it is right that the accused person should know whether a long list of witnesses against him are all related to the prosecutor?  In certain types of offences, it is of particular <Col N="464" /> importance that the age of the witnesses should be known and should be stated.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that as a matter of practice, that will be done.  If so, it is done because it is regarded as important and as fair to do it.  If it is important and if it is fair to do it, as a matter of practice, it is also important and fair that the Legislature should write it into the legislation being passed.  I am not speaking as a defence lawyer.  I could count on the fingers of one hand the number of times I have appeared as a defence lawyer.  I am not pressing the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It could be vital on the question of whether the defence will require the evidence to be taken on deposition, and the Deputy may know that by an amendment the Minister is to move later that right will now be preserved in a widespread way.  I imagine that if information of this kind is not given, the reaction of defence lawyers will be to request the taking of depositions in most cases and thus to invalidate the good that is in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is missing something.  If we prescribe specifically in an Act formalities of this nature, there is always the possibility of technical non-compliance, and if there is the type of defence set up which the Deputy more or less forecast, that defence will sit tight until the plenary hearing before the trial judge and at that stage will make an objection. I do not see any good or valid reason for this amendment.  The defence can always make a requisition for further information.  How far can this go?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recall a case in a circuit court not very far from Dublin where a point arose not even on a statutory requirement but on the requirement of a reported case.  There was an omission of what was technically required as <Col N="465" /> evidence.  The case on which it rested was that of Russell and Russell.  A flaw was allowed to go to hearing.  I can give the Deputy particulars of that case.  The point I wish to make is that if that can happen on the basis of a reported decision, how much more likely is it to happen where you have a statutory requirement in black and white?  For that reason I strongly urge the Deputy to withdraw his amendment. The Minister's approach is far safer.</P>

    <P>This matter was discussed on Second Reading.  I wish to say at the outset that I do not regard this amendment as having quite the same importance as it had when I put it down, because of a subsequent amendment which the Minister will move.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, the position is that we are now altering the procedure of the courts of justice, a procedure established here about 120 years ago, if not a bit longer, and established in England very much longer.  The system has been that a person is not put in peril of his life or in jeopardy as to his freedom without having some sworn evidence called against him.  The vital change we are making here when this Bill becomes law is that it will be possible for a person to be charged and put on trial without preliminary examination and without sworn evidence being called against him.</P>
    <P>I urged on the Minister during the Second Reading debate that the statements to be taken from witnesses should contain a short affidavit at the foot on the lines of the memorial from the Registry of Deeds.  If that is done, while preserving intact the new system which the Minister suggests, at the same time it will preserve the position in which a person will not be put on trial or in jeopardy in the absence of sworn evidence.</P>
    <P>Because of the greater freedom now being given, I have reason to fall back on the old system, so to speak.  As I have said, this amendment is now of less importance than it was but at the same time, it is worth moving for discussion sake because, notwithstanding the fact that the old system, if one cares to call it that for convenience, may still be operated by an accused person, we are nevertheless introducing a system which if this amendment is not accepted, will provide that a <Col N="467" /> person may go on trial without having a sworn statement against him, simply an unsworn statement.  I am convinced that the Irish people generally have regard for the oath and we may find a situation in which a person will give a straight and careful account of an episode when he is retailing it in conversation or by way of an unsworn statement.  However, if you ask him to put it in the form of an oath, he will be very much more careful and cautious and will do his best to ensure that what goes down in the affidavit under oath will be as accurate as he can make it.</P>
    <P>Therefore, there is a lot to be said for having these statements verified by means of a short affidavit whereby the person making the statement will take an oath confirming the accuracy, so far as he knows, of the contents of his statement.  That is so far as the contents are concerned.  It is also of importance with regard to the general accuracy of justice that there should be some evidence before the court to show that the statements on which the court is being invited to return a person for trial, to put a person in jeopardy as to his freedom, have not been obtained under duress, that the people who made them have not been coerced in any way into making them. I am also suggesting that the affidavit should contain an affirmation to that effect, that the statement was not obtained by duress.  That is of importance.</P>

      <P>I am glad that Deputy O'Higgins made the point that amendment No. 16&mdash;by which we no longer make it necessary for the district justice to decide as to the materiality of the evidence of witnesses, and by which we enable a defence lawyer to call any witnesses he wishes, if he considers it necessary, in addition to what the State deposes&mdash;which meets the point made on the Second Stage by him and other Deputies goes a long way towards lessening the necessity for this amendment.  Having regard to that, my basic reason for opposing this amendment, which I gave on the Second Stage and which still obtains, <Col N="468" /> although now the argument from the other side is not as strong as it was, is an administrative reason.  This is why we decided against the affidavit procedure recommended by the majority of the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure.  This, in effect, would bring in the affidavit procedure again by the back door.</P>
      <P>Consider what the realities of a case would be in which 30 witnesses from all over the country were involved.  Each would have to travel to the State Solicitor's office to swear and the oath to which Deputy O'Higgins refers would not be in the person's mind to the same extent as if he had to go into the witness box and answer under oath each question, being fully aware of the consequences.  While I recognise the average Irish person's regard for the oath, I do not think the same attention would be paid to putting one's name at the bottom of a declaration as would be paid to the formal swearing in open court.</P>
      <P>At any rate, as I say, we would have these journeys from the far ends of the country to the State Solicitor's office and all the expense attached and it is for this reason that we decided instead to enact here the procedure of having a statement of evidence prepared by the State Solicitor on the basis of the Garda evidence.  This is administratively a better procedure, and the procedure in the Bill, whereby we provide for the service of these various statements of evidence on the accused in time before the preliminary examination, contains sufficient safeguards for the accused and at the same time involves less administrative expense.</P>

      <P>There is not in regard to the statement itself, in regard to the Garda statement, but what Deputy O'Higgins suggests in the amendment is a statement of evidence which would be prepared by the State Solicitor on foot of the Garda statement which would then be verified by each witness.  This would involve enormous administrative expense as it would mean bringing people from all over the country merely for the purpose of signing their names.  For this reason, because of the administrative complexity, I decided against the majority recommendation of the Committee, which was that what would be before the trial court would be sworn affidavits of testimony in regard to what each person saw or did not see. At any rate, I agree with Deputy O'Higgins that the fundamental reason behind this amendment is lessened to a considerable extent by amendment No. 16.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Minister because fundamentally the evidence on oath will come at the trial and that is where the sworn evidence is relevant.  I understand the principle on which Deputy O'Higgins has moved his amendment, and I sympathise with him, but first of all, we have to inquire, in section 5, whether the statement of evidence to be given by each witness is an original statement or a prepared statement by the prosecution.  At this stage two separate responsibilities arise.  There is the responsibility of the witness himself who takes an oath and he may be interrogated and almost compelled to testify against a fellow citizen.  There is also the responsibility of the prosecutor to present the case properly.  If the statement is <i>bona fide</i> and the case is properly presented, no problem arises for Deputy O'Higgins, but if there is a failure, if there is impropriety at either end, by either the witness or the prosecution, this will become manifest at the trial, and no doubt&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I know the theory the Deputy is working on.  However, the person is sufficiently protected in a modern society because the fairness of his trial is guaranteed by existing procedure which is not in any way eroded. The statement here is not necessarily a statement of the witness.  That fact would certainly be as much to the advantage of the accused as to his disadvantage. The administrative reasons the Minister invokes are perfectly valid.  Therefore, if there is any fall down, it will show up at the trial stage.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Higgins's point could be met in this way but it is too late to include it in this Bill.  The Minister might possibly consider it in further criminal legislation to attach to acts done within the framework of this procedure the same sanctions as would be attached to affidavits or similar matters in the old dispensation.  For instance, if a witness were to furnish a statement so outrageously at variance with the evidence incorporated in court, as the substantiated evidence, whether criminal or civil, on an affidavit, the Minister might consider at some other time attaching those sanctions.  That is all that would be needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Instead of attempting a formal act in relation to further formalities which <Col N="471" /> are objectionable, both from the point of view we have been discussing on the earlier section and the Minister's point of view, if, on examination, the Minister were to find there were sanctions attached to the old procedures as against the witness for the protection of the accused, it would be a much simpler thing to attach those sanctions to the present procedure than to rewrite the whole thing.  That is what I would ask the Minister to consider.  I think it is too late to do it in this Bill.</P>

      <P>There is always the Report Stage.  Deputy de Valera would make an excellent draftsman. I understand the viewpoint expressed by the Deputy.  He says the whole thing is all right because it will come out in the wash, because it will come out in the trial.  That is true to some extent.  It is true that it may save the innocent accused person from this ultimate penalty that would be imposed if there were a miscarriage of justice and he was innocent, but it does not save the innocent accused person from all the anxiety of mind, trouble and cost which will be involved by the time the case has come to trial.</P>
      <P>It is not good enough, in my view, to dismiss all that by saying it is sufficient protection because it will come out at the time of the trial.  I want to ensure that before the trial comes up, if there is a flaw, and if there is a question of a person light-heartedly making a statement, which he is not prepared to stand over, that can be tested at the time the statement is being made.  It is on those grounds that I would be particularly keen on the Minister giving further consideration to this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another ground.  I may be misreading this section or it may be that it is so drafted that it is difficult to follow.  The Minister, and Deputy de Valera following him, made it quite <Col N="472" /> clear that the statement of evidence referred to at (c) of subsection (1) of section 5 refers to a statement, not a sworn statement of the witness, but a statement prepared by a State Solicitor as a result of a statement which had previously been obtained from the witness by the Garda.  Subsection (c) certainly is open to that interpretation, but if the Minister turns over this page of the Bill and looks at subsection (3) of the section, he will see that the presumption there is that we are talking about a statement which has been made by the witness, not somebody else's statement.</P>
    <P>We are talking here about evidence to be given by any witness whose statement of evidence is the statement of evidence of the witness.  If that is the position and if subsection (3) is correct and not subsection (1) and if the evidence is to be given by the witness, certainly there are no administrative difficulties at all in the way of meeting my amendment.  If the Minister's interpretation is correct, it seems to me he must logically amend the wording of subsection (3).</P>

It is still open to that construction even under subsection (1) (c), although the Minister's interpretation there is certainly clearer than it is later on.  It would seem to me that the Minister has now made it quite clear what is intended here.  It is not a statement of the witness; it is a statement to be prepared by somebody else based on the statement the witness has made to the Garda.  That should be made clear even in subsection (1) (c). It is certainly necessary to amend subsection (3).</P>

If, as I assume, that amendment is accepted, the words &ldquo;in custody or on bail&rdquo; in subsection (4) of this section will be superfluous.  If we go to amendment No. 46, we will get a better grasp of it. Amendment No. 46 is really a drafting amendment to section 19.  It defines more clearly what is entailed by the remand of an accused person by the District Court.  It provides that where the District Court remands a person charged with an offence or sends him forward for trial or sentence, the court may&mdash;(a) commit him to prison or other lawful custody, or (b) release him conditionally on his entering into a recognisance, with or without sureties.

      <P>This amendment arises out of the points made by Deputies M.J. O'Higgins, Ryan and John A. Costello on Second Reading Stage.

    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(2)  The prosecutor and the accused shall each be entitled to require the attendance before the justice of any person, whether included <Col N="475" /> in the supplied list of witnesses or not, and to examine him on sworn deposition.  The witness may be cross-examined and re-examined on his evidence.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>With amendment No. 16, we could take amendments Nos. 17 and 25 which are on the same point.  In its original form, subsection (2) limited the evidence which might be taken on sworn deposition from a witness at a preliminary examination to the amount that the justice considered necessary to enable him to form an opinion on any issue material to the question he had to decide.  The reason for this was to prevent an accused person taking up the time of the court unnecessarily by insisting on the taking on sworn deposition of evidence which was not in dispute or was obviously irrelevant to the matters at issue.  It was felt that by giving the justice the discretion to allow depositions only where he considered that the evidence was material to the question to be decided, any attempt at abuse of the right to depositions would be checked.  I cannot imagine circumstances in which a justice would not grant any request that might be made for the taking of the evidence of a particular witness on deposition, unless it was quite clear that anything the witness could possibly say would not affect the case for sending the accused forward for trial.</P>
    <P>As I said on Second Stage, I do not think any justice would wrongfully limit the evidence, but having regard to the views put forward I have decided to put in this amendment.  I have been impressed by the weight of opinion against imposing any restriction on the right to depositions and by the argument that depositions will normally be requested only where it is considered essential by the party concerned to have the evidence, or the material portions thereof, of an important witness put on record for use at the trial or to test the witness.  I have, therefore, come around to the view that it would be better, in all the circumstances, to allow the taking of depositions at the request of either party without any restriction.  On the basis that this <Col N="476" /> granting of an unrestricted right to have any witness examined will be availed of only in exceptional circumstances, I agree that we should make suitable provision for it and, accordingly, I move this amendment.  I feel we can rely on the legal profession to operate the revised provision in a commonsense manner and to ensure that it will not lead to the re-introduction, as it were through the back-door, of the deposition procedure which this Bill is designed to abolish.</P>
    <P>When moving the original section I thought that it would prevent the bringing in of witnesses unnecessarily thereby delaying the procedure.  The point of view expressed by Deputies O'Higgins, Ryan and Costello is accepted and I think the amendment put down meets the case.</P>

      <P>The new section dealing with witness orders is being added to the Bill to provide a simple means whereby the witnesses, whose statements of evidence or whose depositions have been taken in connection with the preliminary examination, may be required to attend and give evidence at the trial.</P>
      <P>It is envisaged that an order will be made by the justice at the conclusion of the preliminary examination, where he decides to send the accused forward for trial.  Failure to obey such an order will be punished as contempt of court (subsection (2)).  Furthermore, there is provision in subsection (3) for the justice formally binding over a witness should he, on the application of the Attorney General, consider this necessary.</P>
      <P>The section replaces the present system of binding over witnesses to attend the trial, thus giving effect to a recommendation of the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure that this system be abolished in favour of one whereby a notice be served personally on each witness stating that he is required to give evidence at the court of trial when called upon to do so and providing for penalties for his failure to appear.</P>
      <P>The proposed &ldquo;witness order&rdquo; procedure will be more appropriate to the new situation where, normally, there will be no witnesses in attendance at the preliminary examination.</P>

      <P>I am a little bit unhappy about this procedure.  Here we are laying down the groundwork not merely for sending accused people found guilty of an offence to jail but for sending witnesses to prison until the trial.  That is the remedy which is envisaged in this amendment.  If the Attorney General makes an application to the court and if there is reason to believe the witness might not turn up <Col N="480" /> no chance is going to be taken and he is going to be locked up to ensure that he will be available to give evidence. It seems to me that there is something very drastic here.  If you compare this with the treatment of witnesses of an accused person, the change is dramatic. When an accused person applies and his application is granted, what happens is that a witness summons is issued to the witness.  There is no question of locking up his witness until the trial. If his witness does not turn up, it is the ordinary rule which is there which applies: provided he has been served with his witness summons, he can be regarded as being in contempt of court and can be dealt with by the court accordingly.  If the application is made by the Attorney General in respect of the State witness, the precaution that may be taken by the State is that the witness is going to be locked up so as to ensure that he will be available to give evidence.  I do not like it.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 21:</P>
      <P>Before section 8 to insert a new section as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(1)  A summons (in this section referred to as a witness summons) may, on the application of an accused person, be issued out of the court to which the accused has been sent forward for trial requiring the person to whom it is directed to attend before the trial court and give evidence at the trial and to produce any document or thing specified in <Col N="482" /> the summons, unless the court is satisfied that such person cannot give any material evidence or, as the case may be, produce any document or thing likely to be material evidence.</P>
    <P>(2)  A person who without just excuse disobeys a witness summons shall be guilty of contempt of the court out of which the summons was issued.</P>
    <P>(3)  This section is without prejudice to any other powers for enforcing the attendance of witnesses at the trial.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this new section is to enable the defence to have a witness, whose evidence was not available at the preliminary investigation, summoned to appear before the trial court to give evidence on behalf of the accused.  The summons must be issued in every case unless the trial court is satisfied that such person cannot give material evidence.  Subsection (2) provides that failure to obey a witness summons may be punishable as contempt of court.  A witness summons will, where required, be issued from the court of trial at any time between the conclusion of the preliminary investigation and the trial.

It has been complicated a little by writing in&mdash;&ldquo;unless the Attorney General requires the attendance of a witness under section 6&rdquo;.

      <P>I propose that this section be deleted.  As the House knows, this section was intended to replace section 62 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1936, which empowers the Attorney General to direct that a person charged with an indictable offence be sent forward for trial, where a district justice decides not to send him forward.  At the time of drafting of this section this matter was before the Courts, and the President of the High Court took a certain view, a view opposed to the section in the 1936 Act.  This view was overruled <Col N="486" /> by the Supreme Court.  At the time I thought it might be appropriate to provide, as we have here:</P>
      <P>Where a justice of the District Court decides not to send a person forward for trial the High Court, on the application of the Attorney General may, after consideration of the documents required to be supplied to the accused..................... direct that he be sent forward for trial..........................................</P>
      <P>In other words we sought to, if you like, amend the powers of the Attorney General under the 1936 Act by providing that in order to send an accused forward for trial, where the district justice had refused informations, he would have to seek a High Court order.  That sounds very well in theory but, now that the Supreme Court have said that the procedure under the 1936 Act is valid and constitutional, I have considered the matter in greater depth. This power has been used very sparingly and has stood the test of 31 years.  One can, in fact, envisage quite a large number of cases where it operates in ease of the accused.  Where, for instance, the Attorney General takes a certain view of the district justice's ruling and decides to send the accused forward for trial, the accused is not in any way prejudiced, whereas if the matter is brought out in the open before a High Court hearing and the High Court judge decides not to send him forward, there is a complete re-airing of the matter.  While, theoretically, I was attracted to the section at first, I have since come round to the point of view that it is better to leave things as they are, particularly in view of the endorsement of the constitutionality of section 62 of the 1936 Act by the Supreme Court.  That is why I propose to move here that the section be deleted.</P>

A typical example of what I have <Col N="488" /> in mind is the case of a foreign doctor who may have examined persons injured in a road accident but who has now gone abroad.  He would be a vital witness in a road accident case.  That is just an example that comes to my mind.  I think it is only right that the accused himself should be made aware of the fact by the justice, at the preliminary examination stage, that he has this right of cross-examination.  It is important that the accused be informed to that effect in relation to a witness, where it is likely that he will not have an opportunity of cross-examination, later, for instance, in the event of the witness going abroad before the trial.</P>

The section, as it stood, provided that if the deponent was dead, or was so ill or incapacitated as to be unable to attend <Col N="489" /> the trial&mdash;in those circumstances only &mdash;the deposition could be put into evidence.  That was clear and concrete and everyone knew what it meant, but the Minister is suggesting now that instead of the phrase&mdash;&ldquo;or so ill or incapacitated as to be unable to attend the trial&rdquo;, we should enact that the deposition can be used as evidence where the deponent is unable to attend or prevented from attending to give evidence at the trial.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the argument the Minister has made that there are cases, because of absence abroad and that kind of thing, in which it will not be convenient for the witness to attend, but, in fact, it is possible to bring a witness back, to secure the attendance of the witness and the Minister will appreciate&mdash;as we have already discussed in another amendment&mdash;the particular procedure whereby the State can ensure that the witness will remain here in order to give evidence.  I have no objection at all to a state of affairs whereby the deposition can be used as evidence, if the witness is genuinely unable to attend because he is ill or incapacitated&mdash;that is quite proper; we are getting, in effect, the best evidence that can be obtained.  If we are to leave in as open and as general a phrase as the Minister uses in his amendment, while I know what the Minister has in mind, and while the House knows what he has in mind, in fact what is being done here could be used to excuse a witness from attending to give evidence on the flimsiest of excuses, that because he wants to make money at a race meeting or something else, he is unable to attend and a deposition can be used. I know the Minister does not intend that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have said this so often in the House that I am rather tired of hearing myself say it, but what matters is what goes into an Act, not what the Minister or any Deputy says about it.  If we say here that a deposition may be used in evidence if a deponent is unable to attend <i>simpliciter</i>, any excuse may be accepted as sufficient for a witness being unable to attend.  &ldquo;If he is prevented from attending&rdquo;&mdash;by whom? By what?  In what circumstances?  Will <Col N="490" /> it be sufficient that he is prevented because he has another engagement?  The Minister is not improving the section by suggesting this amendment.  I know what he has in mind and I sympathise with him.  I agree with his line of reasoning.  What I am objecting to is the way in which it is worded.  It is far too general and is likely to create great dangers.</P>

      <P>I think the point which is worrying Deputy O'Higgins is met by amendment No. 36, to which he might advert.  It is proposed that a deposition taken under section 6 on the application of the prosecutor shall not be read unless the accused consents. Furthermore, it is proposed in amendment No. 36 that a deposition taken under section 12 shall not be read if the trial judge considers that to do so would not be in the interests of justice.  I think that meets the point made by Deputy O'Higgins, which I appreciate.</P>

      <P>The first thing the Minister mentioned was there already in section 13 which the Minister is deleting and putting in another subsection.  It provided that a deposition could be used only with the consent of the accused, except in the event of the deponent's death. The Minister need not be misled by what I said earlier.  I was talking then from the point of view of a defence lawyer.  I am now looking at it from the point of view of the State as well.</P>

      <P>So long as we circumscribe it sufficiently, I think it is <Col N="491" /> proper that we should allow the deposition of a person who is unable to attend.  A person could be in France or Germany.  There could be the case of a foreign doctor.  A Singalese or Pakistani could disappear and we might want some essential evidence.  It is no harm to have it in, providing it is sufficiently circumscribed.  I think this is ensured in the following amendment, which provides that a deposition shall not be read if the trial judge considers that to do so would not be in the interests of justice.

      <P>I move amendment No. 45:</P>
      <P>In subsection (2), page 8, lines 12 to 16, to delete paragraphs (a) and (b) and substitute:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;( ) by the deletion, at reference number 8, of all the words after &lsquo;the Larceny Act, 1861&rsquo;, by the deletion, at reference number 14, of &lsquo;sections 25, 26 or 27 of&rsquo; and by the deletion of reference number 15;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Paragraph (a) of section 18 (2) proposes to increase from £50 to £100 the monetary limit in offences under the Larceny Act, 1861, and under certain provisions of the Larceny Act of 1916, provided the amount involved is £100 or under, the offence will be triable as a summary offence in the District Court, if that court is of opinion that it is a minor offence and if the accused does not object to summary trial.  The present limit of £50 is contained in the Criminal Justice Act of 1951, the First Schedule to which lists a number of indictable offences that may be dealt with summarily. In only two cases is there a monetary limit.  I fail to understand why these two cases are singled out. The seriousness of a larceny offence, or any other criminal offence for that matter, cannot be determined by the amount of money involved.  Indeed, to use a monetary standard at all is most unreal.  Whether or not an offence is a minor offence must be determined, having regard to all the circumstances of a particular offence. The District Court is entitled under the Constitution to try minor offences. Then we have the Criminal Justice Act, 1951, and under section 2 (2) of that Act, the court must be of opinion that the scheduled offence is a minor offence and the accused has the right to object to summary trial where he wishes to be tried before a jury.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Far more serious offences than larceny are triable under the 1951 Act. Forgery and serious bodily assault are examples.  Furthermore, quite grave offences under the Larceny Act of 1916 are triable summarily, regardless of <Col N="496" /> the monetary value of the property involved.  For instance burglary and housebreaking, for which heavy maximum sentences may be imposed, can be tried summarily.  There seems no reason whatever why we should persist with monetary limits in the two cases in question here.  The criterion should be the nature of the actual offence charged.  The mere fact that a man steals, say, £5, should not itself make the offence a minor offence. Such a theft from a poor woman would be far graver than a theft from a wealthy person.  Again, the stealing of £200 could, in a number of conceivable circumstances be a minor offence.  It all depends on the facts of the individual case.</P>
    <P>We are in no way bound to follow what was done in 1951 when the problem of minor offences does not appear to have received all the consideration it deserved.  I cannot see any reason why we should have what I might call a legal means test for larceny cases.  What I propose is that reference No. 8 in the First Schedule to the 1951 Act should refer simply to &ldquo;an offence under the Larceny Act, 1861&rdquo; and that reference No. 14 should refer simply to &ldquo;an offence under the Larceny Act, 1916&rdquo;.  The deletion of reference No. 15 follows in consequence.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, my amendment will avoid the necessity for periodic revision of the 1951 Act to take account of changing money values.  Further, it will ensure that each minor offence will stand, as it were, on its own feet and will be considered by the District Court, having regard to all the facts involved. I urge the Minister to accept the Amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">

      <P>Deputy Dunne has brought to light an anomaly which does exist and which we were considering in connection with the future Criminal Justice Bill which I hope to have before the House in the new year. However, as he has introduced it now, it can be incorporated in the present measure as it is set out in the amendment. I agree that there is no reason why, as he states, the Larceny Act in <Col N="497" /> particular, should be distinguished in the schedule to the Criminal Justice Act, 1951, from other statutes dealing with more serious crimes.  Under the 1951 Act the larceny of more than £50, is automatically indictable and thereby entitles a person to trial by jury, whereas, more serious offences, such as offences against the person, forgery offences and offences against the various statutes listed could be far more serious.  This is especially the case when one considers that under the 1951 Act a person has the right to opt for trial by jury, if he wishes.</P>
      <P>In effect, what Deputy Dunne suggests is that in any case involving more than £50 under the Larceny Act or more than £100 as proposed in this Bill, where the justice considers on the merits that it is a minor offence, it will be in the same category as offences under the other statutes mentioned. The justice may, if the accused agrees, try the case summarily and thereby save the accused the expense of trial by jury.  On the other hand the accused may, under Deputy Dunne's amendment, opt for trial by jury under the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act, 1951.  I think there is a lot of sense in the amendment.  It puts larceny offences in the same context as offences against other statutes set out in the First Schedule to the 1951 Act and makes no distinction in regard to money values which was a factor heretofore. I can accept the Deputy's amendment as drafted.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;( ) Where there is no sitting of the Court on the day to which a person is remanded, he shall stand remanded to the sitting of the Court next held in the same district court district.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment is to make provision for the possibility of the sitting of a court not taking place on the day to which the accused person has been remanded, due to the illness of a justice or for some other reason. The amendment provides that where there is no sitting of the court on the day to which a person is remanded, he will be remanded to the sitting of the court next held in the same district court district.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 60:</P>
      <P>In page 12, after section 29, in a new Part IV entitled &ldquo;Miscellaneous&rdquo;, to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>(1)  Where, on a question of law, a verdict in favour of an accused person is found by direction of the trial judge, the Attorney General may, without prejudice to the verdict in favour of the accused, refer the question of law to the Supreme Court for determination.</P>
      <P>(2)  The statement of the question to be referred to the Supreme Court shall be settled by the Attorney General after consultation with the judge by whom the direction was given and shall include any observations which the judge may wish to add.</P>
      <P>(3)  The Supreme Court shall assign counsel to argue in support of the decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This new section, which I propose should be added to the Bill, will enable the Attorney General to obtain from the Supreme Court, by way of case stated, a final determination of the law in a case where, in the opinon of the Attorney General, a trial judge was wrong in law in directing the jury to return a verdict in favour of the accused.  The determination of the point of law by the Supreme Court will not prejudice in any way the decision <Col N="505" /> of the trial judge in favour of the accused person.  Provision is made for the trial judge to be consulted by the Attorney General when the statement of case is being drawn up and for his observations to be included in it.  Subsection (3) provides that the Supreme Court shall assign counsel to argue in support of the decision and the Attorney General will, of course, assign counsel to argue his point of view.</P>
    <P>At present where a trial judge directs a jury to discharge an accused person on a point of law there is no means of having the matter reviewed by a Superior Court even though there may be considerable doubt as to whether the judge's interpretation of the law was the correct one.  Not alone does the accused person go free but the direction remains as a precedent for subsequent cases even though the Supreme Court would, if the matter could be submitted to it, rule differently.</P>
    <P>I think the principle underlying this section could, with advantage, be extended to enable decisions in favour of the accused by, say, the Court of Criminal Appeal or by the High Court in <i>habeas corpus</i> proceedings on a point of law to be referred to the Supreme Court for final determination. However, such an extension would be beyond the scope of the present Bill and the method of reference by way of case stated would not, I think, be the most appropriate.  I am having the question examined with a view to including a suitable provision in a Criminal Justice Bill which is now in course of preparation.</P>
    <P>This is very desirable.  At the moment cases stated are limited to an appeal by way of case stated and a consultative case stated from the District Court.  Here we are dealing with the situation where a case stated may be necessary in order to establish a proper precedent and where the Supreme Court may not under existing legislation review the position.  It is desirable that the Supreme Court should be able to determine the rights and wrongs of the trial judge's decision without prejudice to his decision in favour of the accused person.</P>

      <P>There is an aspect of this which I should like to draw to the Minister's attention.  We are introducing here &mdash; I am not sure whether it is anywhere else&mdash;what in a sense is a novel provision in our jurisprudence.  We are asking the Supreme Court to determine the law in advance.  We are here going into territory that could very profitably be considered by the Committee which is considering the Constitution.  Again I was talking off the cuff.  I have not studied this, but as far as I know, this is a new principle.  In our jurisprudence we have the common law; grafted upon that common law is our statute law and, in our case, overriding all is the Constitution to which all our law is related.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>We shall assume that to be what should be.  We have a system whereby such a situation as the Minister envisages is dealt with by the Legislature.  The normal procedure in criminal or civil cases would be to introduce amending legislation, and the function of the courts, in the tradition of our jurisprudence, is to decide cases in the concrete, not in the abstract.  If that verbiage seems a little confused, let me put it this way: our courts, in our tradition, decide particular cases.  When the courts decide a particular case, they set a precedent which will be followed, and the lawyers read into that certain principles. The fact remains that it is the function of the courts to decide these particular cases in accordance with the law.  It is the function of the Legislature to make the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to oppose the Minister in this, but I am, as many other Deputies may be, taken somewhat by surprise by the depth of it.  I would be constrained to press the Minister if this Committee were not sitting, and it is to this body I want to address the <Col N="507" /> importance of the point involved here. We are now asking the Supreme Court to legislate, in effect, where normally a Bill would be enacted here which would be fully subject to the Constitution. The Supreme Court are being asked to legislate without appeal. Where is the constitutional safeguard? I am not in any way impeaching the various bodies involved in this, but we are putting the Supreme Court in the anomalous position that it has to decide, so to speak, the constitutionality of its own legislation.</P>
    <P>I am not raising this in relation to the particular point here.  I can understand it perfectly, but in making the analogy with a case stated, if the Minister will allow me, I want to point out a vital distinction.  Our courts know the process of case stated.  It usually occurs like this: there is a case in the lower court which comes in the normal way to appeal.  The trial judge decides it, but there may be a point of law and one side or the other decides to have a case stated to the Supreme Court.  So far, so good for the analogy, but, remember, when that is done, that rules the case.  Remember, the Supreme Court does no more than try a concrete case.  It is not legislation, and the case is decided by this.  In regard to this new principle which the Minister is introducing, it cannot, and we are all with him in this, affect the interests of the accused.  The Attorney General cannot appeal that way to secure a conviction.</P>
    <P>But the effect of this procedure is much broader than what the Minister has introduced here.  I would like to ask the Minister why we have to do this and not do what has been done in the past.  I myself have appeared in cases, when I was practising, in which a decision was got.  I recall one case in particular: it was not on the criminal side.  The normal procedure was adopted.  The necessary amending legislation was there to close the gap. I know the administrative mind will say that takes time.  The administrative mind will further say that the constitutionality of that legislation will be questioned.  Why not cut the whole thing out and give it to the <Col N="508" /> Supreme Court, in the first instance? It is precisely there that the danger of cutting across our whole constitutional setup is to be found.</P>
    <P>Because this Committee to examine our constitutional position is sitting and because we have a system of courts here second to none, with a very fine tradition and with the complete confidence of the community, I would not go so far in the House as to oppose the Minister.  I do not oppose this, but I do wish to go on the general principle and, as a Deputy, to bring to the notice of that Committee, the other organs of State and the court concerned the dangers involved. That may not be the correct word.  A decision may be taken in modern life to change our traditional pattern.  I do say there are vital changes inherent and implied in a procedure of this nature, and with that I will be content. In the particular circumstances, I do not wish to oppose the Minister. This goes beyond the Minister's Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to reassure the House that there is no question of the Supreme Court legislating.  This is merely an extension of the case stated procedure from the District Court to the High Court and, on appeal, to the Supreme Court.  It is a translation of that procedure to the case where the trial judge has made an order releasing a prisoner and it is desirable that the Supreme Court should review the decision.  The Attorney General is then empowered to refer to them a case stated for their examination.  This is merely a translation of the existing case stated procedure to a case decided by a trial judge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to emphasise again that this in no way prejudices the verdict of the trial court.  If the prisoner is released by the judge or jury in the trial court, that prisoner goes free.  But the interest in this matter is not merely administrative. A considerable number of members of the legal profession have represented to me that it is illogical in a case of this kind, where a bad point of law has been made by the trial <Col N="509" /> judge, that a precedent should be established which future judges may feel bound to follow.  Without prejudice to the accused person, who is allowed to go free however wrong the trial judge may have been, the verdict stands.  This is proper and basic to our system of jurisprudence.</P>
    <P>I am suggesting that it is entirely reasonable that once the verdict has been disposed of and the accused has gone free, the Attorney General should have the right to consult the Supreme Court by way of case stated on the question of whether or not the trial judge misdirected himself in law on some aspects of the case during the hearing.  I do not think that is an extraordinary thing to suggest.  It is merely a translation of the existing system of case stated in the District Court, which has operated very successfully over the years, to the higher courts.  I think, when it is considered by Deputies that it will be welcomed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make quite clear that this is an extension, the word the Minister used.  The reasonableness of what the Minister wishes to do can be understood, but it is an extension.  The very fact that it does not affect the trial concerned is an innovation.  But the fact remains that in our system it is taking over what heretofore would normally have been the functions of the Legislature.</P>
      <P>Lastly, there is a very vital distinction from the ordinary case stated procedure.  The Minister's analogy breaks down completely by reason of the fact that the ordinary case stated procedure determines the case.  This case stated procedure does not determine the case but is, in effect, legislation.  I am open to argument on all this.  I merely want to ensure that the principle I have tried to underline is considered.  That is the important thing.</P>

      <P>The important point here is that the Supreme Court keeps itself free to deal with cases as they arise.  It keeps itself free to fulfil its obligations under the Constitution, and do that from case to case.  Again, <Col N="511" /> I am back to this objection of what I might call dealing with the thing in the abstract rather than the concrete, from the point of view of the Supreme Court.  Far be it from me to say how the Supreme Court should operate.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Higgins and the Minister have a point.  I am pleading a particular point of view.  I want to do so because I think it of great importance for the community.  I understand the Supreme Court has affirmed that it holds itself free.  I would say that we here, as the Legislature, find it a good principle.  It keeps itself free to give justice in every single case that appears before it.  If the Supreme Court is free on that point, what exactly is being gained by this case stated?  I do not want to labour the point at this hour: we could argue it for quite some time.  Again, let me say that I merely wanted to bring this point of view to the attention of the people who are involved in such matters.  I do not wish to oppose this amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 61:</P>
      <P>In page 12, after section 29, in a new Part IV entitled &ldquo;Miscellaneous&rdquo;, to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>(1)  For the purposes of Part III of the Extradition Act, 1965&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a)  an offence punishable under the law of Scotland by death or by imprisonment for a maximum period of at least six months shall be treated as being an indictable <Col N="512" /> offence and not also a summary offence if it is certified by a Procurator Fiscal that the offence is an indictable offence so punishable and that it will not be prosecuted summarily, and</P>
    <P>(b)  an offence punishable under the said law by such imprisonment shall be treated as being a summary offence if it is certified, as aforesaid, that it will be prosecuted summarily and that it is so punishable.</P>
    <P>(2)  A certificate appearing to be given by a Procurator Fiscal may without further evidence&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  be accepted by the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána,</P>
    <P>(b)  be admitted in any proceedings, unless the court sees good reason to the contrary,</P>
    <P>as evidence of the matters so certified.</P>
    <P>(3)  In this section &ldquo;Procurator Fiscal&rdquo; includes a Depute.</P>
    <P>(4)  This section shall be construed as one with Part III of the Extradition Act, 1965.</P>
    <P>This amendment and amendment No. 62 are designed to remove purely procedural difficulties which the Scottish and Channel Islands authorities have encountered in the practical operation of Part III of the Extradition Act, 1965.  This Act provides for the enforcement in this country of British and Northern Ireland warrants of arrest for indictable offences and for summary offences which carry a maximum penalty of at least six months' imprisonment.  Reciprocal arrangements exist in Britain and Northern Ireland, also under an Act of 1965, for the enforcement of our warrants, and both Acts make provision for various documents to accompany warrants, including a certificate as to whether the offence is triable on indictment or summarily.  These amendments are designed to remove technical difficulties which have arisen for the Scottish and Channel Islands authorities in giving a certificate in the precise terms required by our Act.  These difficulties stem from the somewhat different <Col N="513" /> systems of legal procedure in these jurisdictions.</P>

      <P>(3)  A certificate appearing to be given by the appropriate Attorney General may without further evidence&mdash;</P>

      <P>Section 11 of the Bill was intended to replace section 62 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1936.  Now that section 11 has been deleted, it is necessary to retain section 62 of the 1936 Act.
