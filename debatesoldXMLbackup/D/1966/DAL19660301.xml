      <P>I propose, with your permission, Sir, to circulate in the Official Report a statement showing the total wages, salaries and pensions (including employers' contribution to social insurance) received by persons resident in the State in each year 1955 to 1964. Pensions include only those received in respect of past employment and exclude social insurance payments.  It is not possible to give separate data for wages and salaries only.  The aggregate number of persons in receipt of wages, salaries and pensions is not available but the total number of employees at work, as returned at the 1961 Census of Population, was 649,621.</P>

    <P>Under the Valuation Acts, it is the function of the local authority to initiate the valuation of new buildings or the revision of valuations in other cases by referring all such cases to the Commissioner of Valuation.  The valuation of buildings, appeals against valuations, etc., follow a statutory procedure with which I cannot interfere. It is the function of the local authority to publish, on the 1st March in each year, a revised valuation list showing the properties valued for rating in accordance with the statutory procedure and conditions.  Particulars of all properties valued for rating in Dublin will be found in the lists published today.  As the steps necessary to secure valuation of properties and to publish information concerning valuations lie with the local authorities, inquiries about the rateability of particular <Col N="553" /> properties should be more appropriately addressed to these authorities.</P>

      <P>Section 51 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, provides with some exceptions that it is an offence for any person to make noise, in a public place or in premises, which is such as to give reasonable cause for annoyance.  The planning authority has a general power to prosecute offences under the Act, but any person with grounds for prosecution under section 51 may undertake it.</P>
      <P>If the source of noise is a private premises, proceedings may not take place unless the noise continues after a warning notice signed by at least three residents or business people in the area has been served.</P>
      <P>It seems to me, therefore, that when a noise nuisance exists the remedy lies with the people affected.

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he will enumerate the municipal services furnished by the Dublin Corporation to <Col N="559" /> the State in respect of O'Connell Bridge House, Hawkins House, St. Stephen's Green House, Ansley House and Liberty Hall; whether the corporation have received from the State any monetary payment in respect of those services; if so, how much; and, if not, why.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by Dublin Corporation that the municipal services furnished to the premises mentioned comprise water supply, and sewage and garbage disposal.  It is understood that, with the exception of Ansley House, these premises are held by the State from the landlords under leases which require the provision by the landlords of these services. The question of direct payment by the State to the corporation does not arise.  As Ansley House is not yet occupied, the corporation are not providing any service to it at present.</P>

      <P>The Minister appreciates that, while the corporation are providing services for these substantial buildings at a cost to the Dublin ratepayers, no revenue whatsoever is being collected at present and it appears will not be collected for some time in respect of these services?</P>

      <P>The aggregate value of tenders for local authority housing which are at various stages of consideration in my Department at present is about £2,184,433.  This sum includes £37,069 in respect of proposals submitted by housing authorities in County Louth.</P>
      <P>Contracts have not been signed in the case of some tenders already sanctioned because of the normal requirement that no expenditure should be incurred until the local authority have been notified of sanction to the loan.  I am not in a position to give the aggregate value of such tenders because in some areas unexpended balances of composite loans, already approved, are available.  Separate details of such cases are not available in my Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that a number of residential properties along the Grand Canal which were located in an area zoned by Dublin Corporation for mixed residential and office use have been demolished to make way for proposed new office development.  I have no information that the proposed development is related to any speculation about the future of the canal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the last part of the question, I have no power to prevent the <Col N="564" /> demolition of such buildings.  Planning permission for the demolition of buildings is not required except in the case of buildings proposed for preservation. The temporary provisions of the Housing Act, 1948, which gave housing authorities power to control the demolition and use of dwellings lapsed at the end of 1962.</P>
    <P>I have been concerned for some time past with the loss of housing which has been taking place in Dublin as a result of redevelopment schemes, usually involving new office buildings, and, when I met a deputation from Dublin Corporation last December to discuss general housing questions, I raised the matter with them and asked them to consider whether new measures were needed to preserve the existing stock of dwellings having regard to the present shortage.  On 17th January, 1966, the City Council adopted a report containing a recommendation that the control provisions of the Housing Act, 1948, should be re-enacted.  I am at present considering this proposal.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 46 and 47 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The application from Offaly County Council for sanction to a loan of £40,000 for the making of house purchase loans was received in my Department on 22nd October, 1965, and is under consideration.  On the general question of procedure in dealing with such loans, I would refer the Deputy <Col N="565" /> to the terms of my reply of 9th February to Question Nos. 22 and 23 asked by Deputy Coughlan.  A decision on the application will be given when finality has been reached in the detailed consultations which are at present in progress with housing authorities, generally, in regard to capital allocations for various housing purposes in the coming financial year.</P>
    <P>I understand that the local authority decided recently to defer the issue of approvals under their house-purchase loans scheme in cases such as that referred to by the Deputy, pending the approval to a further loan.  I might add that there is still a fairly substantial balance of a previously approved loan undrawn by the local authority.</P>

      <P>A reciprocal agreement covering benefits for sickness, maternity and unemployment was made with Great Britain on 29th March, 1960, and came into operation on 2nd May, 1960. That agreement replaced and extended a previous agreement made in January, 1953.</P>

      <Col N="568" /> This agreement provides for reciprocity in relation to old age, retirement and widows' pensions.

Negotiations had been entered into for a premises which had been approved by Córas Tráchtála as suitable and discussions took place as to the type of business to be carried on and the particular concern was approved and given certain advice.

      <P>I think it is possible that what I said already is the case: a shop already in existence in London, selling Irish goods and receiving quite a degree of support and advice from CTT, objected to the operation by CTT of a shop in Ireland House.  This other person did not seek to operate a shop in Ireland House or the shop premises there.  In any event, if the Deputy is thinking of that person, he has been assured that the shop in Ireland House would be given to private enterprise if private enterprise <Col N="575" /> would have it, that it would be run on a commercial basis and that it should stimulate further interest in Irish goods and so help the other shop.

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the whole basis of the shop in Ireland House is as a showroom of quality Irish goods.  It is the experience of CTT that the showing of goods without being able to sell them is discouraging to people whose interest has been attracted and this was the basis of the decision to have a shop which would show goods and also permit people to buy them.  In this way they will be in competition but not over the full range and certainly the existence of this showroom of high-quality Irish goods should stimulate interest in Irish goods and stimulate trade in the other shop.</P>

I do not think that it would be desirable to introduce legislation on one particular aspect until decisions can be reached on the general question of consumer protection.

      <P>Is the Minister aware&mdash; if not, I suggest his better half might be aware&mdash;of the growing practice of stating false basic retail prices so as to give the impression that considerable discounts are being given on goods when in fact they are not being given? Is he aware that commodities such as electric light bulbs, which have a standard price, are being quoted in shop windows and in newspapers at <Col N="580" /> prices which are far above the standard selling price and this is being maintained unfairly to attract business for retailers and, having regard to the urgency of this problem, will the Minister expedite consideration of it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No. I mean that a commodity costing a set price of 1/- is quoted as having a normal price of 1/4 or 1/6, but that as a special bargain people can get it for 6d. or 9d.  The impression is given that there is a discount of 7d. or 9d. when, in fact, it is very much less.</P>

I do not think that it is sufficient to say in this area that the shopkeeper can look after himself or herself.

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he will state with reference to the handball alley at the Templemore Garda depot the estimated and actual cost; the number of occasions upon which it has been used; whether there are any defects therein; if so, if he will state the nature thereof, and the steps being taken to remedy them; the dates of commencement and completion of its construction; and when the alley will be available for regular use.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are three handball alleys at Templemore Garda Training Centre, two outdoor and one indoor.</P>
      <P>The estimated cost of the two outdoor alleys together was £3,500; the final cost is expected to be about £4,500.  Work on these alleys started in November, 1963 and was completed in May, 1964.  There are no defects in these alleys and they are being regularly used.</P>
      <P>The estimated cost of the indoor alley, with which is incorporated toilet accommodation for general use, was £11,000, and the final cost is expected to be about £13,000.  Only limited use has been made of this alley up to now. Defects consist of cracks in the wall plastering and rough patches in the floors.  Work on this alley started in May, 1963 and was completed in August, 1964.  The consultant architect has arranged to have the defects rectified without cost to the State, and it is expected that the alley will be available for regular use in a month's time.</P>

    <P>There are already two small automatic exchanges in County Mayo but before automatic service can be provided in the county generally a number of preliminary projects will have to be undertaken.

This work will <Col N="588" /> probably be completed by the end of 1969.</P>
    <P>The provision of an automanual exchange will be required at Castlebar at which subscribers connected to automatic exchanges will be answered for calls required via operator.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £17,337,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1967, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Health (including Oifig an Ard-Chlaraitheora), and certain services administered by that Office, including Grants to Local Authorities, miscellaneous Grants and a Grant-in-Aid.</P>
      <P>I should first like to thank the House for facilitating me in arranging to take together the Supplementary Estimate for Health for this year, the main Estimates for Health and for the Central Mental Hospital for the coming year and the motion on the White Paper on the Health Services and Their Further Development.</P>
      <P>When speaking in the House in November on the motion put down by Labour Deputies in relation to the services, I indicated that an opportunity would be given for a discussion in the House on the White Paper proposals and I have thought that, to avoid duplicate debates on health policy this year, this discussion should be combined with the normal one on the Estimates.  I am appreciative of the House's acceptance of this suggestion.</P>
      <P>In previous years, the Minister for Health has commenced his introductory statement on his Department's Estimates by giving statistics in relation to births, deaths and marriages and the incidence of various diseases, and then has commented in some detail on developments in the various health services during the year which he was reviewing.  I do not today intend to follow that precedent as I think that, with the White Paper before the House, Deputies will be more interested in the future than in the past, so it is mainly to the future of the health services that I will direct my remarks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="596" /> Statistical material such as was formerly given in the Minister's opening statement and information on hospitals construction projects have, however, been circulated in a statement to Deputies. I hope they will find this useful. One cannot sensibly discuss the future of the health services, of course, without referring to their past and, as I comment on the White Paper, my remarks will include some references to developments in the services during the past year.</P>
    <P>The White Paper on the health services and their further development was laid before the House on 19th January last.  As indicated in the introduction to it, the Government wish that the various proposals in the different parts of the White Paper should be the subject of wide public discussion before any final decisions are taken on their detailed development.  Therefore, in opening my remarks, I think I should stress that the Government are not committed to all the details of what is in the White Paper.  It represents what, in general, the Government consider to be the proper lines for the future planning of the health services, but we are quite prepared to consider modifications if, when we have heard the views of interested parties and have held consultations, these seem necessary.  I expect that the process of consultation on the various proposals in the White Paper will be complicated and fairly lengthy and it will be a fitting prelude to these discussions to have this debate in the House.  I am confident that at the end of the debate, the House will give its general approval to the proposals in the White Paper and that the debate will be of great benefit to the Government in the further development of their policy.</P>
    <P>When speaking on 1st June last on the Estimate for Health for the current financial year, I told the House that I was undertaking a general review of the health services.  In this review, I went back over the history of the development of the services and surveyed their general pattern, relying for this, to a great extent, on the documents which had been prepared for the Select Committee on the Health Services.  I was struck by the complexity of the <Col N="597" /> present services and felt, therefore, that before any major revisions of them were introduced, it would be desirable that their development up to the present should be explained in a White Paper which would also set out the factors governing further developments and then, in this context, the Government's proposals for the future.  I would ask Deputies to note particularly the title of the White Paper&mdash;The Health Services and Their Further Development. This choice of title was very deliberate and, if you like, challenging.  For what we think is needed is a progressive improvement of our system of health services, which we regard as basically sound&mdash;not a root and branch replacement of these services by a health service based on a different principle.  I have on many occasions made it clear that I accept fully the main principles on which the present services are based, which are defined as follows in paragraph 15 of the White Paper:</P>
    <P>In developing the services on the lines summarised above the Government did not accept the proposition that the State had a duty to provide unconditionally all medical, dental and other health services free of charge for everyone, without regard to individual need or circumstances. On the other hand, no service is designed so that a person must show dire want before he can avail himself of it.</P>
    <P>Without departing from this main principle, the White Paper proposes many changes.  Each of the present services is reviewed.  Where a service is considered satisfactory by the Government, this is stated; where it is not, the changes which the Government think should be made are explained and justified.  When, after consultations with the public representatives, professional organisations and others concerned, final decisions are taken as to the form of these changes, the Government will take steps to see that they are brought into effect.</P>
    <P>The White Paper proposes a number of important changes in the general medical service.  It is intended to introduce a choice of doctor in the service and, we hope, a choice of chemist; it <Col N="598" /> is intended that the limits for the categories eligible for the service will be clearly defined, instead of being subject to individual local interpretations of a rather vague legal formula, as at present.  It is proposed that there should be better arrangements for helping the middle income group in obtaining drugs and medicines prescribed by general practitioners, where hardship would be involved in buying them privately, and it is intended to proceed with the further development of the district nursing service and to provide a home help service, particularly for the aged and chronic sick.  These radical changes in this service will pose a number of problems.  The most outstanding of these is, of course, the fact that at present we have permanent salaried district medical officers in about 550 dispensary districts throughout the country.  One of the big problems in bringing in this scheme for choice of doctor will arise from the arrangements which will have to be made to fit these into it.  In some areas, particularly in the West, the dispensary doctors will have to be retained on a salaried basis because, in practice, there will be no choice of doctor.  However, in most of the country we must look forward to the eventual abolition of the post of dispensary doctor, and existing holders must be fitted into the new scheme with due regard to their present position and pension rights.  I cannot say now what the exact answer to this problem will be, and indeed there may be a number of answers varying from area to area.  I have, however, promised the Irish Medical Association, when they sought clarification of my intentions in this regard, that I will attempt to ensure that permanent and pensionable district medical officers who continue to provide, in their present areas, services on the scale on which they provide them at present will not suffer any decrease in remuneration from public funds as a result of the change in the service, and I expect that, in the event, the present dispensary doctors will be satisfactorily fitted into the new service.</P>
    <P>This question is only one of many which, in the coming months, my <Col N="599" /> Department and myself will be discussing with the Irish Medical Association and the Medical Union.  I cannot, therefore, give the House today a detailed picture of how the service with choice of doctor will operate.  I can go no further than what is stated in paragraph 44 of the White Paper, which shows that the Government will aim to provide, for the category eligible, a service not outwardly distinguishable from that which doctors provide for their private patients.</P>
    <P>Obviously, if this is the aim where the doctor is concerned, we should also try to make similar arrangements with the chemists.  Discussions with their representatives are, in fact, proceeding now and I hope that we will be able to negotiate a satisfactory and economical scheme under which, as far as possible, persons can bring their prescriptions to any convenient participating chemist.</P>
    <P>It is generally accepted that there are many people in what we call the middle income group who can afford to pay fees to their family doctor but cannot afford to pay, without hardship, for the drugs and medicines which he may prescribe.  The present law allows health authorities to help in circumstances like these and my Department has, on a number of occasions, reminded the health authorities of this power.  However, I think that, particularly with the other changes which I have just mentioned, we should have a more formal scheme under which persons in the middle income group will have the right to assistance from the health administration in specified circumstances, where hardship would be involved in meeting their entire needs privately.  I do not think that the present arrangements under which a person is dependent on a subjective local assessment of hardship is entirely satisfactory.  It is intended, therefore, to specify a fixed sum and where a person in the middle income group has found it necessary to spend that amount in a fixed period, in buying drugs and medicines, he will be entitled to get assistance in further purchases. Legislation will be necessary to introduce <Col N="600" /> this change.  As stated in the White Paper it is not intended that the legislation should set out the details of the scheme but that these should be fixed in regulations made later.</P>
    <P>Finally, in relation to the general medical service, the Government propose that legislation should be introduced to permit the Minister for Health to fix limits for eligibility. Paragraphs 51 to 53 of the White Paper dealt with this.  There has been much dissatisfaction with the application of the present legal formula under which eligibility for the service is determined locally and in accordance with varying standards, the application of which is illustrated in the table shown on page 28 of the White Paper. I think that the specification of limits, which will be made public and, indeed, widely publicised, will represent a big step forward.</P>
    <P>The intention is that the limits will be specified by regulations which would be subject to the approval of each House of the Oireachtas.  The Dáil will therefore have an opportunity in the future to discuss the actual limits, so I do not intend to say anything today on what these might be.</P>
    <P>Side by side with these changes in the constitution of the general medical service, the development of the district nursing services will be speeded up, so that the doctors working in the new service will eventually have available, in all districts, nurses to help them. The need for a home help service, especially for old people and for the chronic sick, is also recognised and it is intended to provide for this in the legislation.</P>
    <P>All these changes will be expensive. They will involve much planning and preparation before they can be made but I am satisfied that this will be well worth while and that the money put into the improvement and development of the general medical service will be well spent.</P>
    <P>When we turn to the hospital services, it will be seen that the White Paper does not propose any comparable changes.  With the extension of the eligibility limits, to be effective from 1st April next, under the Health <Col N="601" /> and Mental Treatment (Amendment) Act, 1966, these hospital and specialist services will be available to over 90 per cent of the population.  Hospital care is, of course, a burden which can be met privately only by a small minority and the cost to public funds of these services is at present very considerable&mdash;about £24 million for this year.  While the White Paper does not propose any radical change in the hospital service itself, it does underline the fact that, when we have expenditure of this size on hospitals, it is important that we should see that the money is well spent, that the hospitals which we have are used to the best advantage and that there is proper co-ordination between the various hospital services.  I will be saying more on that when discussing the administrative proposals in the White Paper.</P>
    <P>I expect, having regard to earlier debates in the House on health policy, that I will be criticised for not proposing the abolition of the charges for intern hospital care at present levied on some in the middle income group, This, I should say, was carefully considered by the Government but I do not think it would be reasonable to abolish these charges.  The revenue from them is quite considerable&mdash; almost £½ million a year&mdash;and I think that paying the charges imposed should cause little hardship, when we bear in mind that the maximum charge is ten shillings a day, that the maximum is levied only in a minority of cases and that the average stay in hospital is only a few weeks.  Indeed, now that the income and valuation limits for eligibility for the hospital services are being increased, I think it reasonable that there will be some increase in the income from these charges and that endeavours should be made to this end.</P>
    <P>Deputies will note, on the other hand, that it is proposed to abolish the charges for out-patient specialist services, which are at the rate of 7/6d for X-rays and 2/6d for other specialist services.  This may seem inconsistent, but the object of this abolition is to encourage the use of out-patient services <Col N="602" /> instead of intern hospital services where this is appropriate.  In any event, the administrative costs involved in collecting these small sums are disproportionately high.</P>
    <P>The White Paper stresses the need for proper planning and co-ordination of our hospitals.  While much has been accomplished in the field of hospital building to meet the country's essential needs, the extent of the requirements still remaining to be met is quite vast. For very good reasons the main concentration in the past was on the provision of accommodation to cater for patients suffering from infectious diseases, the establishment of modern hospital buildings for the acutely ill, mainly outside Dublin and Cork, the making available of a considerable amount of accommodation for mentally handicapped persons, the establishment of certain special hospitals such as St. Luke's Hospital and Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Dublin, and the National Medical Rehabilitation Centre at Dún Laoghaire and the provision of much needed accommodation for maternity patients throughout the country generally. There are a number of major sectors, however, towards which we must now direct our energies.</P>
    <P>The teaching hospitals are of special importance and the White Paper has announced the Government's intention to make further progress towards the provision of suitable buildings to meet their needs.  Galway has already been provided for.  The new St. Vincent's Hospital at Elm Park, Dublin, which is expected to be completed by the end of 1967 or early 1968, the new Coombe Maternity Hospital, which will be ready this year and a major extension which is in progress at Holles Street Hospital will further improve the standards of treatment and teaching facilities available in Dublin.  I am taking steps to establish in the very near future a special body representative of the Cork Health Authority, University College, Cork, the Department of Education and my own Department to plan and erect a major general hospital and a new dental hospital in Cork, and, towards that end, to organise the holding of an international <Col N="603" /> architectural competition to select a suitable design.  Preliminary planning work is already under way in connection with the proposed replacement of the present St. Laurence's Hospital on a site at Cabra.  In addition, the Central Council of the Federated Dublin Voluntary Hospitals are formulating basic policy in relation to the erection of one large hospital to replace a number of their smaller units.</P>
    <P>The Cork General Hospital and St. Laurence's Hospital schemes have been on the mat for a long time and quite a lot of planning work was carried out up to about ten years ago.  Progress in medicine does not stand still, however, and, in view of the very large financial involvement and the great importance of these projects, it is essential that our planning concepts be completely reassessed to ensure a better anticipation of future needs in the light of developments in the practice and teaching of medicine and in the structure of the population.</P>
    <P>In regard to the mentally handicapped, the recent report of the Commission on Mental Handicap indicates the extent of the accommodation which the Commission considered should be provided.  It would be unwise to attempt to estimate the cost without a more precise definition of the manner in which the new accommodation should be provided, whether it should be at existing centres or in entirely new ones, and whether some existing institutions now used for other purposes could be given over to the mentally handicapped.  If the accommodation were to be provided at entirely new centres the total cost would be not less than £5 million.  I hope to issue soon a White Paper in which proposals arising from the Commission's Report will be set out.</P>
    <P>Our major institutional needs relate to the provision of suitable accommodation for the mentally ill and the aged chronic sick.  We are making progress in regard to the latter.  Many Deputies will be aware of the work already done at Mullingar, Mountmellick and Stranorlar and of the work in progress at Castleblaney, Clonakilty, <Col N="604" /> Ennis, Longford and Trim.  Similar schemes are soon to commence at Athy and Castlebar.  Planning work on improvement schemes at other homes is also well advanced.  The extent of the problem generally may be judged from the estimates of the cost involved &mdash;about £3 million for work in progress or sanctioned, and about £8½ million for what still remains to be done.</P>
    <P>We can anticipate that the Commission on Mental Illness, which is expected to report this year, will have a lot to say in regard to the physical environmental facilities available for the mentally ill.  The existing hospitals are, in the main, almost one hundred years old.  They were designed in an era when the concepts of care were utterly different from those consistent with current medical standards.  I am sorry to say that the buildings in many instances have not been well maintained and that there is a pressing need for improvement of the standard of patient comfort.  I do not wish at this stage to anticipate in any way the line the Commission may take in regard to new hospital facilities for the mentally ill but I have little doubt from my own knowledge of existing conditions that we will find ourselves facing a very heavy capital programme in this field of activity also.</P>
    <P>From preliminary assessments which have been made in my Department, it seems clear that the capital cost of financing even the programme of works so far approved will be formidable. The coming years are bound to bring to light other needs, and all this points to the need to establish priorities and to concentrate available resources on the achievement of the more urgent objectives. This is a task to which I have been giving attention.</P>
    <P>In my general review of the services when preparing the White Paper, I took a special interest in how they apply in the case of old people.  The aged must have proper health services and this I will regard as a high priority in developing the White Paper proposals.  Of course, this object will be partially attained in the general development of the various other services. <Col N="605" /> For example, the general medical services will, when the new limits are prescribed, be available free to a majority of old people.  Over one-half of those over 70 years of age will automatically be entitled to this service as recipients of old age pensions. Again, hospital and specialist services will be available free, or at modest charges, for practically all old people. as it is to be assumed that very few who are over the age for retirement would have an income exceeding £1,200 a year.  In the case of these services, one problem is in seeing that the old people know of their entitlement and that they can readily use the services.  This involves a co-ordination of activities by a number of bodies and Government Departments and the Minister for Health is to be given responsibility for seeing that this co-ordination is effective.</P>
    <P>I have already arranged for the appointment of an interdepartmental committee with representatives of my Department and the Departments of Social Welfare and Local Government and I intend that a wider body should be established on a national basis with representatives of the various voluntary bodies operating in this field.  There is a tremendous amount of goodwill throughout the country towards the aged and there is a great amount of good work being done by various voluntary bodies.  I can assure the House that I will take very seriously my responsibility for seeing that the public services and the voluntary services are co-ordinated so that they will offer to the aged all the help and solace they can.</P>
    <P>The White Paper does not dwell very long on the other health services and neither will I.  Our services for the health care of mothers and children are, on the whole, satisfactory and no major changes are suggested in them. In fact, the only major change proposed is that the rate of the maternity cash grant will be increased from £4 to £8 and that there will be a double grant where twins are born and so on.</P>
    <P>Our dental, ophthalmic and aural services are not satisfactory and, for practical reasons, it has not been possible to extend these to the middle income <Col N="606" /> groups as was provided for in section 21 of the Health Act, 1953. We cannot expect to be able to make such an entension immediately, but it is part of the policy under the White Paper that, as soon as the facilities are available, this extension will be effected.  Therefore, I hope that, in the not too distant future, comprehensive dental, ophthalmic and aural services for the middle income group will be available.</P>
    <P>Finally, on the services, I would like to say a few words on the future of the preventive services.  Since the begining of the present century, but particularly in recent years, very effective public services were organised for preventing the outbreak and spread of infectious diseases.  We are very fortunate in the standard of these services. Take poliomyelitis, for example. There were only five cases of this disease in 1965, by far the lowest number since we started to keep complete statistics in 1942.  As recently as 1960, however, there were 183 cases and 1955, our worst year, featured a total of 499 cases.  It is certainly to be hoped that the trend of the last few years, showing a consistent fall, will continue. We share the good fortune of other countries in this relief and it is to be hoped that the present picture signifies a lasting diminution.  This, indeed, is the opinion of many international experts on the subject who consider that the widespread fall in the incidence of poliomyelitis over the past few years is directly attributable to the introduction of vaccination procedures. However, a high level of immunity must be maintained if we are to avoid the danger of a resurgence of the disease and parents should know that it is unwise to neglect the protection offered for their young children, who are the group most susceptible.</P>
    <P>There is welcome evidence that the public do appreciate this need.  The nation-wide campaign of oral polio vaccination with the simple and highly effective &ldquo;sugar lump&rdquo; vaccine last year was very successful.  The latest statistics from local health authorities show that of the one million, approximately, in the eligible age-group from six months to 18 years, about 80 per <Col N="607" /> cent got the protection of the vaccination. I would like to take this opportunity of expressing my thanks to all who contributed to the success of this campaign and in particular to the chief medical officers and the public health staffs of the local health authorities.</P>
    <P>It is still necessary to ask for the co-operation of those who have not so far availed themselves of this costfree and trouble-free service, and to underline the necessity for preserving the present substantial degree of community protection by ensuring that, as a matter of routine, every infant will be given this oral vaccination as soon as convenient after six months of age. Health authorities are continuing to make arrangements for this purpose.</P>
    <P>What I have said about polio applies equally to other infectious diseases, notably diphtheria.</P>
    <P>Some of the techniques developed for diagnosing and preventing infectious diseases can be used in the future in relation to some non-infectious diseases.  There are complex issues in this approach to such diseases, involving medical research and health education on such things as the prevention of heart disease and cancer.  I intend that the preventive services will in the future become geared for this.  I also intend that the possibilities of &ldquo;screening&rdquo; of large sections of the population for hidden symptoms of disease should be explored and that services for such screening should be brought in where practicable for particular diseases.  We recently introduced such a service for a condition known as phenylketonuria, which can cause mental handicap, and we are developing a similar service for cancer of the cervix of the uterus.</P>
    <P>When, in my review, I had considered the services and the improvements which seem necessary, obviously I had next to tot up the bill and see what the cost of the specific improvements which I had in mind would be. This turned out to be quite substantial. A total of £4,265,000 is mentioned in paragraph 115 of the White Paper as the annual extra cost of some improvements already made this year and of <Col N="608" /> other improvements proposed in the White Paper.  As this increase would be additional to normal rises in the cost of the services, it seemed clear that it could not be financed in the traditional way, that is, on a 50-50 basis between the health services grant and the rates. The Government decided, therefore, that the cost of the further extensions mentioned in the White Paper should not be met in any proportion by the local rates.  Other possible sources of revenue are being considered but it seems likely that general taxation must bear the major part of the increase.</P>
    <P>As well as reaching this conclusion relating to the financing of extensions and improvements, the Government decided that, pending further consideration of the methods by which extensions of the health services will be financed in future years, they would make arrangements which will ensure that the total cost of the services falling on local rates in respect of the year 1966-67 will not exceed the cost in respect of the year 1965-66.  In reply to a recent Parliamentary Question, I assured the House that no deterioration in the present health services would be permitted as a consequence of this decision to relieve the rates. On the contrary, it is my intention that the ordinary progressive improvement of these services should continue. Deputies will, however, appreciate that I am in no position to give <i>carte blanche</i> to local authorities in spending money on health services, so I have asked health authorities to obtain my prior approval for any departure from the estimates already prepared by them for the year 1966-67, except where there are increases arising from variations in general costs or in the levels of demand for existing services. Provision to meet the additional Exchequer liability arising from this Government decision is contained in Subhead G of the Estimate for 1966-67.</P>
    <P>I cannot say, at present, what arrangements will be made on this aspect of financing the health services for future years.  The White Paper refers to an examination of other possible sources of revenue.  This will <Col N="609" /> be a comprehensive serious examination of all possible sources but I should say that I am not too sanguine myself on the possibilities of finding another major source of finance for the health services.  The most obvious possible alternative&mdash;and one which has often been advocated in this House&mdash;is insurance contributions.  I have already expressed here my misgivings on this as a source of finance, but I am prepared to consider this afresh, to see if it would be possible to have some system of such contributions which would not have the disadvantages which have been mentioned here on previous occasions&mdash;that they are, in fact, a regressive form of taxation and would be difficult to collect from self-employed persons, including farmers.</P>
    <P>We have, of course already got another source of finance for our health services, that is, the Hospitals Trust Fund.  The income into that Fund now provides over £3 million a year towards capital and revenue expenditure on hospitals.  I do not think it likely that we are going to find another such fruitful source of revenue.  After all the Revenue Commissioners have for many years been casting their net widely and it is quite unlikely that a source of revenue is available to us now which has evaded their diligence and ingenuity.  However, I shall report on another occasion to the House on the results of my further examination of this subject.</P>
    <P>The White Paper proposes that the administration of the services will be transferred from the present local health authorities to specially-established regional boards, with members nominated by the Minister for Health &mdash;these will include representatives of the medical and related professions and, where appropriate, the voluntary hospitals&mdash;in addition to members elected by the local authorities.  This development is a logical sequel to the other proposals in the White Paper. From the financial viewpoint, it would be unwise to continue full local administration of the services, as at present, if the local authorities had not to worry about the increased cost arising from extensions and improvements of the <Col N="610" /> services.  Apart from this, it has become clear that the county is too small a unit for the organisation of many of the health services.</P>
    <P>The White Paper deliberately avoids going into detail on the constitution of these regional boards and the areas which they will serve.  I think this will be understood, as there is no point in going into these details until a decision is taken in principle on the establishment of these boards.  The House will have an opportunity later, if this proposal is accepted, to discuss the details of the new regional administration. There are many matters to be considered before then&mdash;the exact delineation of the regions, the combination, within the membership of the boards, of the members of the local authorities, the professional interests and others, the training and qualifications of the chief executive officers of the boards, and the relationship between the boards and the central authority.</P>
    <P>This development is, I think, the logical outcome, not only of the other proposals in the White Paper, but of the long-term trend in the administration of the health services.  Originating in comparatively small organisations&mdash; the boards of guardians, the rural districts councils and the urban district councils&mdash;the health services have over the years, as needs required, become a function of bodies covering larger areas, that is, the county councils and the joint health authorities.  It is clear that many of these are not large enough now and that it is necessary to accept the regional concept for the best administration of the services in the future.</P>
    <P>Public comment on the proposals in the White Paper has in general been very favourable, but there has been some disappointment at the time-table which I have announced for bringing in the change proposed.  I have explained that it is my aim that the legislation necessary for these changes will be introduced in the late autumn and that I would hope that most of this legislation could be brought into effect before the end of next year.  Now this may seem a rather slow process, but any member of the House who has <Col N="611" /> had the responsibility of office will know that radical changes such as are proposed in the White Paper cannot be brought in overnight, or in a matter of a few weeks, or a few months.  The proposals for the 1953 Health Act were first published in a White Paper issued in July, 1952, and the major changes under that Act did not come into effect until 1956.  The British National Health Service was first advocated in a White Paper published early in 1944; the National Health Service Act was passed in 1946 and the service did not, in fact, commence until 1948.</P>
    <P>To return home again, the proposals on which the Voluntary Health Insurance Act of 1957 was based were published in a report issued in May, 1956, but the Act did not become effective until October, 1957.  This is rather a better schedule than I propose, but then this Act was on a much more restricted plane than the White Paper. Finally, to quote what may be the most respectable precedent in so far as the Labour Party, in any event, are concerned, a White Paper was published in October, 1949, proposing changes in the social welfare services, but legal effect was not given to these until the Social Welfare Act was passed in 1952 and became law in January, 1953.  These precedents show that the time-table which I have mentioned is a realistic one and does not allow for any dallying in bringing the White Paper proposals into effect.</P>
    <P>I think we must recognise, in any event, that, at the present time, it would be unwise to impose the taxation needed to pay for the changes proposed. Indeed, it would have been easy for the Government to justify a decision to publish their plans for the health services only when times got better.  However, the more responsible thing to do was what we have done, that is, to publish the White Paper, so that we can plan now for changes to be brought in when the money is available. I can assure the House that it is my personal intention to see that the detailed planning of these proposals and the preparation of the necessary legislation will be pushed on as rapidly <Col N="612" /> as possible by my Department and I am confident that, in this work, the full co-operation of all involved&mdash;the local authorities and the many professional bodies concerned&mdash;can be expected in the months ahead.</P>
    <P>The Government are satisfied that the plans in the White Paper are reasonable and that they can be financed out of our future economic development.  Perhaps I should conclude my remarks on the White Paper by saying a few words on the relationship of these plans to our economic situation.  The object of all economic development is, of course, to provide a better life for our people.  It is not an end in itself and if we were to regard the accumulation of material wealth as our only aim, this would be entirely contrary to our past traditions. The primary aim of economic development, as I see it, is to give the people the means to meet their material needs so that they can live in dignity and independence. But independence cannot be complete.  When sick, a person needs, and is dependent on, care given by others and this is often expensive and complicated to arrange.  We must recognise that many people cannot arrange such care privately without financial help and that the State must, therefore, organise efficient health services for them&mdash;or see that they are organised.  The Government will not, therefore, hesitate to propose that there should be allocated from the future increase in our national wealth a sufficient proportion to meet the needs of the health services.  It is a challenge to us all to ensure that, when the State will thus wish to divert some of the fruits of our economic development from private consumption to public welfare, the people will accept that this is necessary.  I am confident that they will and am confident, too, that when effect is given to the proposals in this White Paper, we will have in this country a logical pattern of health services which will meet our needs in accordance with our past traditions.</P>
    <P>To turn now to the Estimates before the House, Deputies will see that there is a Supplementary Estimate <Col N="613" /> seeking an additional sum of £900,000 to meet the liabilities on the Vote for Health in the current financial year.  There is provision for increases of £980,000 in the health services grant to local authorities and of £20,000 under the subhead for the salaries, wages and allowances of the staff of my Department.  These are offset by a saving of £100,000 in the Grant-in-Aid to the Hospitals Trust Fund.  In regard to that saving, I might say that it does not reflect any cutback on capital spending.  The programme of capital works within the year has proceeded according to plan.</P>
    <P>The increase in the requirements under the heading of Grants to Health Authorities is, of course, a direct consequence of increases in the expenditure of these authorities, as now ascertained, over that on which the original Estimates were based.  The estimated additional requirement of £980,000 is made up of £100,000 in respect of balances of grants for years prior to 1965-66 and £880,000 in respect of grants for the year 1965-66.  Approximately £650,000 out of the total of £980,000 is attributable to increases in the remuneration of health authority staffs.  The increases in the rates of allowances to disabled persons and to persons suffering from infectious diseases which became effective from 1st August, 1965, account for a further £151,000 of the additional sum and the balance of the Supplementary Estimate is attributable to increases in the costs of the health services under a variety of headings, including the estimated extra cost of hospital and specialist services for the additional group which became eligible for these services by reason of the raising of the income limit under the Social Welfare Acts from £800 to £1,200 a year, which became effective from 6th September last.</P>
    <P>To turn now to the Estimate for the year 1966-67, Deputies will, of course, appreciate that it has not been possible to show in the 1965-66 column the effect of the Supplementary Estimate for that year which is now before the House and will no doubt bear this in mind when making comparisons <Col N="614" /> between the figures for the two years.</P>
    <P>There is only one new item in the Estimate&mdash;the provision in Subhead G for Supplementary Grants to Health Authorities to relieve the burden of health charges on the rates.  I have already referred to this in my remarks on the White Paper proposals, and I do not think that it calls for further comment.</P>
    <P>In regard to Subhead G generally, I might add that, in addition to making provision for the operation for the full year 1966-67 of the factors which I have mentioned which came into operation in the course of the year 1965-66&mdash;that is to say, the extension of hospital and specialist services to persons who become insurable under the Social Welfare Acts as a result of extended insurable limits, and the increased allowances under the Health Acts to disabled persons and persons suffering from infectious diseases&mdash; there is provision for the extension of eligibility for hospital and specialist services which will result from the operation from 1st April next of the Health and Mental Treatment Act, 1966.  Under this Act, the valuation limit for farmers will be raised from £50 to £60 and the income limit for other self-employed persons from £800 to £1,200 a year.</P>
    <P>The reasons for such variations as exist in the case of the remaining subheads between the provision proposed for 1966-67 and the figures for 1965-66, adjusted by the current Supplementary Estimate, will be apparent from the face of the Estimate and do not call for explanation.  In conclusion, I should like again to thank Deputies for facilitating me in taking the Estimates and the White Paper motion together.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> As the Minister has told the House, he is seeking approval on this occasion for a Supplementary Estimate for 1965-66, for the Estimate for the year ending 31st March, 1967 and for the proposals contained in his White Paper.  This, as the Minister has told the House, is somewhat unusual but <Col N="615" /> the House has agreed to it and, for reasons which I shall mention later, I think the Minister is extremely fortunate in his first year of office to be in a position to join these three proposals together.</P>
      <P>There is nothing new in the Estimate for the year 1966-67.  It discloses a continuation of the inadequate and, indeed, somewhat degrading type of health services which has been in operation in this country for some time and is being operated at the moment.  It contains a lot of the stamp of the old poor law system of health services: there is no choice of doctor for the people catered for by the State-operated health services; there is the means test operated at its worst and most stringent manner; people are compelled to present themselves at dispensaries to get medical treatment, thereby branding themselves as a section of the community apart.</P>
      <P>This system of catering for the people of the country who need attention is being continued for a further 12 months at least.  This type of health service has been denounced as unacceptable and beneath human dignity by the Fine Gael Party on several occasions during an interval of years. It has been denounced by the people of the country as unacceptable and degrading.  That is the type of health services, at any rate, we are to be provided with by the Minister during the next 12 months.  I suppose it would be impossible for him to change overnight. I am glad the Government and the Minister have at last come to recognise the inadequacies of the present system and the indignities it imposes on the people who have to avail of it.  Therefore, the Minister is fortunate to have something else, however inadequate it may be, to talk about other than the Estimates as they are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before coming to the White Paper, I should like to mention one subject which is more proper to the Estimates and which requires attention earlier than it would possibly get under the proposals in the White Paper.  It is essential that the personnel operating <Col N="616" /> the health services should be properly remunerated and, even more important, should have proper conditions of work. I come immediately to the provision of living accommodation in nurses' homes, about which I had occasion to speak to the Minister in one instance previously. The Minister has an obligation towards the nursing profession.  It cannot be denied that some of the homes in which nurses are expected to live are quite unsuitable and the living conditions in them deplorable.  These girls have dedicated their lives to the nursing profession. In some nurses' homes provided by local authorities, they are expected to share rooms.  That is a deplorable state of affairs.  In some cases even nurses on night duty and nurses on day duty share the same rooms.  This means that during the spare time of the nurse on day duty she has not access to her private quarters, lest she disturb the nightnurse who is resting.  I would ask the Minister to take this matter up at once with the authorities concerned and see that it is remedied.  I do not wish to dwell further on it except to say the Minister should concern himself with it immediately.</P>
    <P>In the course of his speech, the Minister dealt to a large extent with the White Paper.  From time to time in this House over the past 12 to 18 months, we have had long, sometimes learned and sometimes not so learned discussions on various topics involving the expenditure of considerable sums of money.  Take the Land Bill of 1965; the discussions we had last week and the week before on the revision of the educational system necessitating the building of new, larger schools; and the announcements made in interim reports to planning authorities in the south of the provision of new cities and new estates.  Now we have this White Paper on Health, which is not for immediate implementation, to say the least of it.</P>
    <P>I want to suggest to the House and to the country that this type of discussion here, introducing new policies of this sort and committing the country to vast sums of money at this time, is nothing more than a smokescreen to <Col N="617" /> divert the attention of the people from the fact that nothing is being done about health, about education and about the land settlement question because, in effect, there is no money to do it.  It may be good politics to talk loudest about the provision of adequate health services at a time when the Taoiseach has stated there is no money for health or for education. Therefore, I think we should approach this White Paper in a realistic way, in the light of existing circumstances and in the knowledge that nothing will be done about health for a considerable time.</P>
    <P>I have read the White Paper carefully on a number of occasions.  I found it in many places vague and ambiguous.  I found a lot of careful Civil Service phraseology.  I came here this evening in the hope I would hear from the Minister a speech which would clarify the White Paper, which might fill in some of the gaps and supply some of the missing information. I do not think I am being offensive to the Minister or that I am misrepresenting his speech if I say that, having heard him, we are not anything wiser than we were when we read the White Paper.  By and large, the Minister read the White Paper again.  I say that, largely, that is a fair interpretation of the Minister's speech.</P>
    <P>It may be that the Government have not given a great deal of thought to the proposals in the White Paper and that the Minister is hindered in expressing his views here clearly by his advisers in the Civil Service and by the Department of Finance.  All this leads me to believe that there is really nothing very definite about the proposals and that there is no hope of implementing them in the near future. The Minister keeps saying that he hopes to have legislation introduced this year and passed early next year in order that he may be able to put his proposals into operation by the end of 1967.  Although he says that, the vague manner in which he deals with the various proposals and the statement on page 9 of the White Paper, which says nothing about 1967, leads me to <Col N="618" /> the belief that it will be very much longer before these proposals become a reality.  In so far as there are worthwhile proposals in the White Paper, I hope that that will not be the case.</P>
    <P>Let us get down now to the White Paper.  It is my function to tell the House and the country what the attitude of the Fine Gael Party is to this White Paper and what the Party's reaction is to the terms and proposals contained in the White Paper.  I propose to do so as briefly as I can.  The Fine Gael Party accept this White Paper for what it is, a small, inadequate and very belated instalment of Fine Gael policy in relation to health. It contains provisions for a choice of doctor for a limited category.  That is a move in the right direction.  We have advocated that for many years and we are glad that the Minister has at last turned his back on his predecessors in office and accepted that.  Nevertheless, it is an inadequate and belated instalment of our policy on health.  We do not agree that it provides a health service in keeping with the dignity and desires of the Ireland of 1966, nearly 50 years after obtaining our freedom, an Ireland that is knocking at the door of Europe.</P>
    <P>It is proposed in the White Paper to provide drugs free of charge for the lower income groups and to supply those drugs through chemists' shops instead of through dispensaries.  Again that is a move in the right direction. But these drugs are to be supplied by the chemist from stocks supplied by the health authority from a national formulary compiled by the Civil Service, admittedly after consultation with others, but nevertheless compiled by civil servants for the use of doctors operating the scheme.  I cannot accept that.  I cannot accept that people in the Custom House, who are not practising medical practitioners, are the correct people to tell the general practitioner down the country what drugs he will prescribe for his patients.</P>
    <P>The benefit of this free general medical service and free drugs is to be confined to a limited number of people.  The means test is to be retained. It is stated that the Government <Col N="619" /> do not think the scheme should be extended to include a high proportion of the population, to use the words of paragraph 53 of the White Paper.  The Minister has not elaborated on that.  He has not dealt with the percentage which should be included in what will continue to be called &ldquo;the lower income group&rdquo;.  It is reasonable, I think, to say therefore that it will be in or about the old 30 per cent.  It is stated elsewhere in the White Paper that it is not suggested that the test should be one of dire need.  The test at the moment is one of dire need.  No one at the moment qualifies for a health card, as it is commonly called, unless he is in dire need.  No one qualifies at the present time for a disability allowance unless he is destitute.  This proposal means that the means test will be retained and operated rigidly as it is operated at present.  That is deplorable. There will never be a satisfactory general medical service or, indeed, hospital service, until the means test is abolished and abolished once and for all.  It is humiliating; it is degrading; and it is unworkable.</P>
    <P>There is no Member of this House who has not had the experience of having these people who are in search of a medical card imploring him to get this one, that one or the other to get him a health card.  As long as the means test is there, that sort of thing will go on.  The Minister admits that it is impossible to say at the present time who is entitled to a health card. It will still be impossible, notwith standing the Minister's proposed regulations, as far as a great number of people are concerned, people who are not on a fixed income.  There will always be the appeal to the country manager; there will always be the approach to the county councillor, the TD, the Senator or other public representative. That is something to which the working people of this country should not be subjected.  In that regard Ireland is out on a limb.  We share the stigma with Finland of being the only two countries in western Europe who operate a system of this kind, a system where people have to go with their hats <Col N="620" /> in their hands to get what they should be entitled to.  Therefore, I say that this free choice of doctor, glad as we are to see it coming in, is destroyed by this rigid application of the means test which will be continued.</P>
    <P>It might be opportune at this time to deal with the position of the dispensary doctor who will be displaced, perhaps, as a result of this new scheme.  At page 32, paragraph 46, there is this sentence, dealing, presumably, with the compensation to be paid to the displaced or replaced doctors: &ldquo;The general position under the new service of those now holding permanent offices of district medical officer will be discussed specially with the medical organisations at an early date.&rdquo;  That is a glorious bit of Civil Service jargon.  Is the position of dispensary doctors not quite clear?  Dispensary doctors have binding contracts with the various local authorities and they cannot be displaced by the Minister or anybody else unless they are compensated.  I do not know what the Minister has told these organisations or what he has told these doctors, but it is time to tell the medical profession that they will not suffer any loss of income as a result of the implementation of the free choice of doctor provisions of this White Paper.  That should be made perfectly clear to them, much clearer than it is made in paragraph 46 of the White Paper. Probably the Minister means that, but why does he not say it, and what is the mystery about?</P>
    <P>Now we come to the middle-income group.  It is proposed to provide drugs, in certain circumstances, for the middle-income group.  The expression is: &ldquo;where undue expense arises.&rdquo;  This is another form of means test, another form of inquisition or investigation into the private affairs of people, which does not lead to the health services being properly availed of.  Again it is a move in the right direction; I am not saying it is not.  The Fine Gael proposal is that the middle-income group should have drugs at half cost without any investigation.  There are people in the middle-income group suffering severe hardships in purchasing drugs <Col N="621" /> and who are entitled to get assistance from the local authority if they apply for it.  In the case of hardship they can get a limited health card or get a contribution towards the purchase of drugs.  However, I know, and I am sure the Minister knows, as practically every Deputy knows, that people refuse to avail of this relief because, in order to do so, they are compelled to subject themselves to a visit from the home assistance officer, who is very often a neighbour, and they are compelled to have their private affairs and private circumstances pried into.  That is something which could be abolished by another approach to this.</P>
    <P>Another part of the White Paper dealing with the middle-income group which is to be deplored is the statement, which has been repeated here by the Minister today, that it is proposed to continue the hospital charge of up to 10/- a day.  The Minister speaks of 10/- as the charge that is applicable at present; it can, of course, be changed by regulation.  There is no justification at all for the continuance of this charge of up to, to use the Minister's words, 10/- a day for the middle-income group.  Again it is an imposition of the means test which entails visits from the home assistance officer to the house of sick people or to the relatives of sick people.  It entails answering innumerable questions, giving a lot of information which people should not be asked to give.  The result of it is that people are afraid to go into hospital because of the cost it may involve.  When they come out of hospital they are again compelled to see the local county councillor, Senator or TD to get their hospital bills reduced. The retention of the 10/- a day for the middle-income group could only be justified, even under the existing system, on economic grounds.  If our system were accepted, it could not even be considered.</P>
    <P>Let us get to grips with this charge of 10/- a day for hospital maintenance. Is it worth while?  Does the income from it justify the hardship and the indignities it imposes on people availing of hospital treatment?  Obviously, <Col N="622" /> it does not.  The Minister has told us today and previously that 60 per cent of the middle-income group paid nothing in a recent given year for hospital maintenance and of the remaining 40 per cent, he tells us only 50 per cent were called upon to pay more than 5/- a day.  Therefore, only 20 per cent are paying between 5/- and 10/- per day.  You do not have to accept my word; that is what the Minister said.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister and the House what those unfortunates have had to go through, first of all, in the case of the 60 per cent who were charged nothing in order to get their hospital bills wiped out.  How many of those bills were wiped out as a result of representations from someone or other to the country manager?  How many of those people received large or crippling or considerable bills after leaving hospital?  The same applies to the 20 per cent who did not pay more than 5/- per day and to those who paid less than 10/-.  I put it to the Minister and the House that it is the experience of everybody in the House who is in touch with his constituents that he is daily being asked to approach the health authority to get hospital bills reduced.  The tragedy of it is that some of these people before going to hospital approach the local representative to be assured that he will be able to do something for them towards getting the bill reduced.  That cannot be the best way of getting well; it cannot create a proper disposition on the part of the patient.  God knows, people have enough to worry about when going into hospital, perhaps to undergo an operation, without having to worry about the hardships the financial strain will impose on them.</P>
    <P>The Minister has told us that the 10/- a day charge on the middle-income group brings in a worthwhile sum, nearly £500,000.  The exact figure which he gives in his White Paper is something less than that.  I should like to ask him what does it cost to collect this sum.  Mark you, it is collected not in Dublin city or in one county but this, as the Minister for Transport and Power would say, nugatory £500,000 <Col N="623" /> is collected from every county of the Twenty-Six Counties.  I should like the Minister to break down the cost of collecting: the cost of keeping necessary records in every county, the cost of sending out accounts time and again, the cost of retaining and paying the home assistance officers who are employed to go out and investigate these accounts.  It would be interesting to know what their travelling expenses alone amount to.  I suggest that if the cost of collecting this amount were deducted from the £500,000, the net gain is not worth talking about, certainly not worth what is imposed on the middle-income group.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael policy on health is that there should be no means test for the lower or middle-income groups, that is, for roughly 85 per cent of the people catered for here, and that there should be a free choice of doctor and free hospital treatment.  I am taking the White Paper more or less in the order in which it is paragraphed.  The Minister has paid some compliments to the Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme and says the Government propose to encourage the directors of the scheme to extend it.  I could not agree more.  I am glad the Minister&mdash;I am not being offensive&mdash;unlike his predecessors in his Party, has come to regard the Voluntary Health Scheme introduced by Deputy O'Higgins as a very worthwhile contribution to our health services, indeed as the only thing that got the health services off the ground, so to speak, and showed a bit of clear and original thinking in regard to health in this country.</P>
    <P>The mentally ill and the mentally handicapped are being dealt with by a Commission of 1961 whose report will be out in a few months, the Minister hopes, and in the report of a Commission which was published in 1965 and is being considered.  We may, therefore, exclude those two categories from the discussions here today.</P>
    <P>The maternity grant has been increased from £4 to £8, and that is good.  It has been at £4 since 1953. Of course £4 is worth a lot less in 1966 than it was in 1953 and I am <Col N="624" /> glad the Minister recognises that and proposes to implement the new grant. Without appearing ungrateful, I should like to ask him: when?  The extension of the dental, ophthalmic and aural services to the middle-income group is announced in the White Paper.  This is something which is laughable because section 21 of the 1953 Health Act provided for this very service.  It provided that aural, ophthalmic and dental services should be available to the middle-income group free of charge or at reduced charges.  That was 13 years ago.  Nothing has been done about it since.</P>
    <P>If that is to be taken as an indication of what we may expect in the future, then I was probably correct in referring to many of the provisions in the White Paper as a smokescreen. Not alone are these services not available to the middle-income group in accordance with the provisions of the 1953 Act but they are not available to the lower-income group.  They are not compulsory.  The county councils have certain authority to provide dentures but there are counties in which you can have your teeth removed free, gratis and for nothing, and if you cannot afford to replace them, you can go without teeth for the rest of your life.  That is the position for the lower-income group, not to mention the middle-income group.  Many of the lower-income group throughout the country are toothless because they have had their teeth extracted and cannot afford to replace them, and neither the Minister, the local authorities nor anybody else will assist them.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about the difficulties involved in implementing the extension about which I have spoken.  I should like to know what the difficulties are.  There are many dentists in the country and we are exporting dentists and have been exporting them for years.  I am sure there are ample ophthalmic and aural specialists in the country.  I should like to know what the difficulties are and when we may expect the Minister, without awaiting further legislation, will implement section 21 of the 1953 Act.</P>
    <P>We come again now to disability <Col N="625" /> allowances.  These certainly will not be provided unless the need is dire, to use the words of the White Paper.  At present, when assessing the means of an unfortunate incapacitated person, the means of everybody belonging to him are taken into account, the means of his brothers, or sisters, or anybody living in the house, or who should be living in the house.  A person would require to be destitute to qualify and the Minister accepts that that is so because in future he is going to provide, according to the White Paper, that only the means of the spouse of the applicant for the disability allowance will be taken into account.  That is a good thing but, again, when may we expect this legislation?  A short Act, or a section of an Act of Parliament, would make the necessary alteration.</P>
    <P>Most people have read this White Paper or have read extracts in the national press, or heard about it on radio or television, and have a general idea of what it is all about but there are two questions which the country wants answered and which the White Paper does not answer and which the Minister did not answer this evening. The first is: when will the provisions of the White Paper come into operation; and the second, how will they be paid for?  These two questions are agitating the mind of everybody.  The Minister did make an effort to answer the first one when he repeated the statement that he hopes to implement the provisions by the end of next year but anybody listening to the Minister's speech and hearing him use such words about the provisions as that &ldquo;they will be complex, they will need consideration, the legislation will need long debates here, various people will have to be consulted&rdquo; would have to come to the conclusion that it is most unlikely that they will be implemented by the end of 1967.  However, time will tell.</P>
    <P>The following is an extract from page 9 of the introduction to the White Paper:</P>
    <P>The changes proposed are complex and fairly costly.  Their complexity rules out any question of their introduction in the immediate <Col N="626" /> future, as it will take some time to prepare and consider the legislation which will be needed to give effect to them.  Expenditure on developments in the services of the order proposed could not, in any event, be undertaken in the existing financial circumstances.</P>
    <P>I think it all means that we are going to have to wait and wait for a long time.  That is why I suggest that the Minister should give effect immediately to such proposals as the extension of ophthalmic, dental, and aural facilities, the increasing of the maternity grant from £4 to £8 and the lessening of the means test for the disability allowance. Those are things which can be dealt with without any consultation, except perhaps with the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>The next question is how is this to be financed?  The Minister has been gloriously vague here.  In paragraph 116 of the White Paper, in black print we have the following:</P>
    <P>They propose,&mdash;</P>
    <P>that is, the Government&mdash;</P>
    <P>therefore, that the cost of the further extensions of the services should not be met in any proportion by the local rates.</P>
    <P>End of black print.  In small print, it continues:</P>
    <P>Following this decision, other possible sources of revenue to meet the additional costs are being considered but it seems likely that the general body of the central taxation must bear the major part of the burden.</P>
    <P>End of small print, and then again in black print:</P>
    <P>Pending further consideration of the methods by which extension of the health services will be financed in future years, the Government have decided to make arrangements which will ensure that the total cost of the services falling on local rates in respect of the year 1966-67 will not exceed the cost in respect of the year 1965-66.</P>
    <P>You have some vague expressions there by the Minister that other sources are being explored.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="627" /> I was glad to hear the Minister say that he was considering a compulsory social insurance fund because, you know, that is the Fine Gael suggestion. That has been the Fine Gael suggestion for financing any such scheme down the years.  We never advocated that the State should provide a free-for-all health service, but we did suggest, and we do suggest, that it is the duty of the State to organise such a service, which is a very different thing.  It is the duty of the State to organise an adequate service and it should be paid for by contributions from the employer, from the employee and by the self-employed, with a subvention from the State.</P>
    <P>There are plenty of precedents for that.  There is a precedent for it in the Social Welfare Act, about which the Minister spoke today.  Workmen's compensation is now being taken over by the State and run on a somewhat similar basis.  I am glad to see that even at this late stage, the Minister, having accepted the Fine Gael provision of a free choice of doctor, has gone one further step, and says that he is now considering the Fine Gael method of financing the scheme.  I am convinced that if the Minister considers it sufficiently and with an unbiased mind, if he considers it on his own, without being bedevilled by some of his colleagues, he will come down on the side of the social insurance system of financing the scheme as the only system in keeping with the provision of a proper health system and in keeping with the dignity of the people who use it.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in paragraph 117 of his White Paper, goes on to suggest some sort of a national charge in which the poor counties would be relieved and the richer counties would have to bear a greater portion of the burden. That, again, is certainly quite a way from the system whereby the rates have to bear their proportion of the health services.  The Minister, in this White Paper, has displayed here and there some thinking which is difficult to follow and which seems to be out of keeping with Government&mdash;I was going to say &ldquo;thinking&rdquo;&mdash;propaganda <Col N="628" /> over the years.  On page 25 of the White Paper, it is disclosed that we have a smaller number of people between the ages of 15 and 65 in this country in relation to our population than any country in Europe.  It is no harm to go through them.  I have not bored the House with statistics so far but this is very interesting.  The percentage of people between the ages of 15 and 65 in this country and some western European countries, in relation to the population, disregarding the odd figures, is: Ireland, 57; Belgium, 64; Denmark, 64; England, 65; France, 62; Germany, 67; Netherlands, 60; Northern Ireland, 61; Norway, 63; Scotland, 64; Spain, 64; Sweden 66; Switzerland, 66.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I think I did, but I will give it again: page 25, paragraph 33 of the White Paper, which we are discussing.  That shows that we have a smaller proportion of working people, productive people in relation to our population than any country in Europe.  That, of course, is clearly due to emigration over the years.  I do not propose to initiate a discussion on emigration but I am amazed to see that that is something the Government propose to take note of in the development in future years of our health services.</P>
      <P>Further down, this paragraph states:</P>
      <P>Thus, the health services for each one hundred of the population in Ireland must be paid for by only 58 economically active persons, while in the other countries listed there are from 61 to 67 such person to pay for the health services for each one hundred in the population.  The lesson from this is obvious: if the burden of our health services on the limited numbers who will have to pay for them is to be tolerable, then their development must be planned so as to ensure the utmost efficiency and economy in their administration and so as to avoid expenditure on services (or extensions of services) not demonstrated to be reasonably necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="629" /> I object to the thinking there because, as I say, it is out of line with Government propaganda.</P>
    <P>We seem to be planning our health services for the years to come on the basis that we are going to have a very small percentage of our people working and producing wealth.  That is a sorry outlook.  I would rather see the Minister proceeding on the basis that in some years to come, even the mythical year of 1970, we would have a much bigger proportion of our people productively engaged at home.</P>
    <P>As I have said, I shall deal briefly, before I conclude, with the Fine Gael proposals for health and the Fine Gael way of providing the wherewithal to operate the health services.  One thing struck me, and I do not think we should close a discussion on the White Paper without referring to it, that is, the capital expenditure over the past number of years, from 1948 to 1965, nearly 20 years, which amounted to something like £34 million.  The capital expenditure on health&mdash;the provision, I presume, of hospitals and that sort of thing&mdash;amounted to £34 million from 1948 to 1965.  I do not think we broke our hearts in providing that amount of money for the provision of hospitals. An important thing with regard to this is that out of that approximate sum of £34 million, £21.6 million was provided by the Hospitals Trust Fund.  It would be less than grateful to close this debate without expressing the gratitude of the House and of the country to the directors of the Hospitals Trust Fund for providing that amount of money.  When you compare that with the State's contribution from the national Exchequer which amounted to only £7.3 million, the local contribution being £6 million approximately, as I say, I do not think we broke our hearts.</P>
    <P>The final part of the White Paper deals with the proposal to abolish the county unit, as we understand it today, and to operate presumably the hospital and specialist provisions on a regional basis.  I do not propose to go over that in detail but I concede that in the year 1966 the county unit is most probably too small and that it is not possible to give a highly <Col N="630" /> specialised specialist and hospital service on a county basis.  I agree that that is something which will have to be looked into carefully.  It would be a pity to go from one extreme to the other.  Regions with a quarter of a million people in each could be too large.  The Minister must be thinking in terms of the present regions because I think there is a region comprising Cavan, Longford, Louth and Meath for orthopaedic services with something more than a quarter of a million people in it.  That is probably too large. It is something which needs careful consideration before any definite decision is taken on it.  Furthermore, if a specialised hospital is to be set up in one county, say, a surgical hospital in one county, the medical hospital should be situate in another, and so on.  In other words, there should be a fair distribution of the services throughout the country.</P>
    <P>So much for the White Paper.  It has its shortcomings.  The choice of doctor is accepted for what it is.  The retention of the means test in any shape or form is to be deplored.  We have heard the Minister from those benches time and again querying the health policy of Fine Gael.  Yet he comes in here this evening accepting the cardinal principle of that policy&mdash;the free choice of doctor&mdash;and telling us he is seriously considering the financial aspect of it.  The Fine Gael health policy is quite simple.  We propose that there should be a comprehensive health service organised by the State which will provide a free choice of doctor for 85 per cent of the people, provide free hospital treatment for the groups now known as the lower-and middle-income groups, without this half million pounds contribution; that it should be financed by a compulsory social insurance contribution from the employer, from the employed and from the self-employed, with a contribution of approximately one-third from the State.  There is no mystery about that. It is workable, and has been worked in one form or another, in practically every country in Europe.  We share, with Finland, the stigma of being the only countries in Western Europe which have failed to organise&mdash;and <Col N="631" />&ldquo;organise&rdquo; is the word, rather than provide&mdash;a proper health system for their people.</P>
    <P>It is vitally important that we should have such a health service at the present time.  Over the past two or three years, we had the Minister for Justice introducing a Succession Bill on the basis that we must keep up with Europe if we are going in there.  We also had a Patents Bill on the ground that it was essential that we should keep in touch with continental patent laws if we were to enter the Common Market of Europe.  We had a Copyright Bill on the same basis, and all those were introduced in 1962 and 1963, but it is not until 1966 that we have a White Paper on health which&mdash; even with its shortcomings&mdash;might equip us to enter Europe.  I take it the Minister agrees and the House agrees that a proper health system, in keeping with continental standards, is much more of a condition precedent to entering Europe than a Succession Bill, an Extradition Bill, a Patents Bill or a Copyright Bill.  In so far as the Minister may want any assistance from the Fine Gael Party in providing that, he will get it.  The Minister has stated it will take a long time to talk about this, to get it through the Dáil.  I will give him this assurance on behalf of the Fine Gael Party&mdash;we will facilitate the passage through this House and Seanad Éireann of the proposals in this White Paper as an instalment of a proper health service for the people of this country, but only as an instalment of the policy which we advocate.</P>
    <P>The Minister will be facilitated in every way by this Party in this House and in the Seanad but we will accept these proposals only as a belated instalment of a proper health service. We will continue to advocate in the House and in the country the full implementation of the Fine Gael policy on health.  We assure the Minister that, on taking office, we will implement such of the remainder of our policy as he and his Government may fail to put into force during their sojourn over there, although, if he accepts the free choice of doctor&mdash;as he has&mdash;and if he <Col N="632" /> is considering the financing of our proposal, I would appeal to him to go the whole hog and abolish the means test. If he is going to finance it on our lines, as apparently he is now seriously considering doing, is there any reason why he should not abolish the means test?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Dr. Hillery) Patrick J. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Dr. Hillery)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to answer only a few points made on this Estimate, but before doing so, I want to deal with a point which would not normally come within the scope of the Supplementary Estimate, that is, the question of the Dundalk Engineering Company referred to by Deputy Donegan.  This company since its inception has been financed by Government financial agencies and the Minister and the Department have never interfered in its operation and development.  We <Col N="633" /> have had no function in this matter at all and no money sought for it flowed from the Government.</P>
      <P>I understand that the necessary financial facilities were extended to these companies for as long as there was any hope of viability.  The most up-to-date appraisal of their present prospects was obtained before the decision was made to appoint a receiver.  It was never intended that these companies should be given a permanent status of uneconomic undertakings subsidised for social purposes and no one would question the right of the sole debenture shareholders to appoint a receiver, if they thought the situation necessitated such a procedure. The appointment of a receiver will not inhibit the economic development of these companies in so far as such development is possible.</P>
      <P>With regard to other points raised, the first was in relation to market development grants and with regard to this, I have to say that there are only two firms which have sent in applications for grants more than two weeks ago and which have not yet been paid.  I say that in reply to Deputy Donegan who lightly but firmly stated that there was a general complaint against the Department that there is a delay in the payment of these grants. It would not have killed Deputy Donegan to say that there was one complaint from an industry in his own constituency.  I may say that that firm has had very individual attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this matter the one complaint referred to had its basis in the very complex nature of the case.  That claim has been paid and I do not think, in fairness, that an allegation should have been made that a general slowness of payment existed.  The scheme is working quite smoothly and to the general satisfaction of the people availing of it.  Most firms have now developed a procedure which enables them to present their claims in less than two weeks.  In some cases payment is made on deposit of the documentation, pending final determination by the British customs authorities of the value of the goods.  In these cases a percentage is paid, pending production of evidence of the final assessment and on receipt <Col N="634" /> of this evidence, full payment is made. I do not think that any Deputy would see fairness in the allegation that there is a general delay.</P>
    <P>Recently in this House Deputy Donegan, who speaks for Fine Gael in these matters, suggested that the rate of growth this year of 3.8 per cent fell short of the average target over ten years of the <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i> and he suggested that this represented some failure.  Only a week before, I had been congratulating Irish industry on attaining this level of increase over the record year of 1964, in spite of the enormous difficulties put in the way of Irish industry by the British Government's temporary charge on imports.  I repeat that it is a matter of congratulation that in the face of this obstacle, the record figure of 1964 was not alone maintained but surpassed. I do not think any balanced judgment would support Deputy Donegan's claim that this represents a failure in any way.</P>
    <P>Deputy Donegan did say, and Deputy Treacy also said, that the market development grants were a good thing.  Speaking in the House on the need for a review of our support for exports, I can say that industry itself was quick to acknowledge that the Government had acted well in their immediate reaction to the British surcharge by giving these grants and that acknowledgment was clearly stated in Killarney by one of the spokesmen for Irish industry.  It is easy to say that things are not up to our target but it is quite wrong to say that the Government did not react well and quickly to the situation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Treacy asked if I could say what effect the British levy has had on our exports.  It is very difficult to make a clear assessment of this but in the months immediately following the imposition of the surcharge, up to the middle of 1965, exports of goods from here to Britain subject to the surcharge showed a considerable reduction as compared with the corresponding period in 1964, but from July to October, 1965 they were only slightly lower than for the corresponding months in 1964.  In November, 1965 <Col N="635" /> they were considerably higher than in November, 1964 but the import charge was 15 per cent in the earlier part of the year and ten per cent in the later part.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies raised the question of the extra provision for salaries, wages and <Col N="636" /> allowances.  Having accepted the allowances throughout the Civil Service. I do not think Deputies meant that they should not be voted to the officers of the Department of Industry and Commerce as an exceptional measure.  This is the implementation of a general measure which has already been discussed.</P>
    <P>It was under the heading of industrial development that Deputies raised the question of grants.  Deputy Donegan asked why as high a percentage grant is not given for the adaptation of established industries as is given in the case of new industries.  I could refer him to an answer given to him in the Dáil before this, which pointed out that an established firm has the advantage of plant and machinery which has been depreciated and allowed for, workers who have been trained, and in some cases tariff protection for many years.  In the case of new firms, grants of 50 per cent are the maximum which are made available for the purpose of manufacturing something which has not been produced here before, or to a sufficient extent, or alternatively, exclusively intended for export.  I do not think any real case was made by Deputy Donegan in relation to these adaptation grants which he mentioned.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask industry to look again to the availability of grants and not to miss the opportunity of benefiting by them in the time available. The provision of these adaptation grants is the only thing the Government can do to get industry ready for free trade.  The Government can go no further if industry does not make use of the helps made available.</P>

    <P>That a sum not exceeding £17,337,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1967, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Health (including Oifig an Ard-Chlaraitheora), and certain services administered by that Office, including Grants to Local Authorities, miscellaneous Grants and a Grant-in-Aid.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to begin by stating on behalf of the Labour Party that we welcome this White Paper as a basis for a discussion of the proposed improvements in the health services. Certainly I found it very amusing today to listen to claims being made by the Fine Gael representative as to the long time over which they have been proposing ideas not as good as those now being proposed by the Minister, but far exceeding them.  I thought back to the shades of 1953 when the last Health Bill was going through this House, and I think anyone reading the debates which took place at that time would find it difficult to reconcile the complete conversion from the point of view <Col N="638" /> then expressed to that expressed today. We welcome the fact that the Fine Gael Party have been converted.</P>
      <P>No matter which of the two big Parties actually wrote the White Paper, the only regret we have is that whichever of them took it from our 1958 programme did not take the complete programme as we outlined it.  I do not think either side can claim to have gone back as far as 1958 and introduced a health programme, other than the scheme produced in 1953 by the Fianna Fáil Government.  I have with me a copy of the health programme which was discussed in public in 1958 in Dublin city at the annual conference of the Labour Party and published in the Sunday papers.  I should like to quote from page 2, paragraph 6, because this gives a synopsis of the whole health services that we thought were necessary during the period of time we were passing through then.  I quote:</P>
      <P>Briefly we propose that a new health scheme should be introduced which would cover general practitioner service, hospital treatment, specialist services, dental services, ophthalmic services and pharmaceutical services.  There would be no direct charge for the general practitioner service, hospital treatment or specialist services.  There would be partial charge to some persons for the remaining services (dental, eye and pharmaceutical) but these services would be without direct charge to certain categories of persons.  The dispensary system in its present form would be abolished and all persons covered by the scheme would have a free choice of doctor.  The present charges for hospital treatment would be abolished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have with me a copy of the Fine Gael policy on health as presented to the Select Committee on Health Services. It includes most of the things we advocated but not all of them.  Certainly, Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil have been converted to Labour Party policy in this matter.  Of course the Labour Party do not worry about this.  So long as the health services we have been advocating are brought in, we do not <Col N="639" /> care who will be using them.  It is a matter of indifference to us.  I have here a copy of <i>Pulse</i>, an international medical magazine, dated 18th April, 1964. It carries an interview with the Leader of my Party, Deputy Corish, and with me.  I shall quote some of it:</P>
    <P>Then we got down to the burning questions.  Deputy Kyne rattled off the facts and figures: abolish dispensaries; free choice of doctor where possible; capitation system of remuneration&mdash;Northern Ireland's 24/- per capita would, he thought, be a fair offer; limitation of lists or panel to 1,500 to 2,000 patients; group practice and rota systems; national health board with local health committees to administer the service; total cost of GP manpower &mdash;£3 million.</P>
    <P>I do not think some of the people now claiming pride of place in the matter of modern health policy came into the field as early as we did, in 1964.  However, we welcome any improvements and their source is a matter of indifference to us.</P>
    <P>The Select Committee dissolved after three years during which I had to travel to the meetings, sometimes at great personal inconvenience, a distance of 130 miles in the winter.  The Labour Party were forced to the conclusion that it was a waste of time to continue and they withdrew from the Committee.  In retrospect, I believe the Committee did some good because it seems to have convinced the other two Parties that there was a public demand for a vastly improved health service, that there was need for a much more comprehensive scheme on a much more liberal basis.</P>
    <P>I often sat with the Minister during meetings of the Committee and I gathered that his personal view was that there was need for a much improved service.  I do not propose to go into any of the confidential information given to us while the Committee were in session in connection with the various organisations who came before us, but I think it is common knowledge that practically all the organisations and individuals who came before us and gave evidence advocated many of <Col N="640" /> the things the Minister now proposes, the most important being the free choice of doctor.  As a Labour representative, I welcome that especially.  I gave my reasons during a debate on a health motion before Christmas.</P>
    <P>It is not only desirable but absolutely necessary that people in the lower-income groups, if they are to get a first-class service, must have a choice of doctor.  At the present time, the doctor-patient relationship could be upset to the disadvantage of not only the patient but the doctor attending him.  The patient could be affected by the fact that he was compelled to attend the one doctor with whom, perhaps, he might have strained relations. For that improvement alone, I welcome this step forward.  The fact that the dispensary system is to go and that patients will be treated in doctors' surgeries in the same manner as private patients are treated at the moment is another excellent suggestion well worth looking forward to.</P>
    <P>Since the Minister published his White Paper in January&mdash;I wish to thank him for having sent me a copy personally&mdash;I have studied it and have endeavoured, within the limited means at my command, to compare the proposed new position here with the health services in some west European countries.  I have here a document dealing with western Europe issued by the Offices of Health Economics in Great Britain in May, 1963.  It may not be as up to date as some similar papers published on the subject, but it gives in a condensed, digest form the various health services operated in 16 countries, including Britain.  The health services proposed in the White Paper compare very favourably with those of most of the countries listed in the document.</P>
    <P>Of course it is difficult to make comparisons because in many countries social welfare and health services are a combined operation, under the one Ministry in many cases.  In some, the health services are administered by corporations and insurance societies. Only in Great Britain and one other country are they administered directly by the State.  In Finland, health services <Col N="641" /> are non-existent practically except for children and through certain insurance schemes.  On the whole, it is fair to say that Ireland will not come out badly except in comparison with Great Britain where they have the highly specialised health services we should like to see operated here.</P>
    <P>I was impressed by one point in connection with Ireland.  In the various countries of Western Europe, the bed ratio per head of the population varies from one per 100 of the population up to one per 150 of the population, but in Ireland and Sweden, the figure has been estimated at one for each 50 of the population.  That a majority of these beds are occupied by people in mental hospitals or those chronically ill should not detract from the figure, because mental illness is not a problem in Ireland alone.  All the other countries have to devote a certain number of beds to that type of patient.  I expect the finance provided by the Hospitals Trust Fund has helped to create that favourable position.  It is nice to find that in some respects at least we are ahead of Great Britain. In general, the western European nations provide hospital coverage for from 75 per cent to 85 per cent of their populations.  With the new proposals in the White Paper, it is estimated that we should cover about 90 per cent of our population.</P>
    <P>There are certain defects in our health services and it is just as well to admit this.  On page 5 of the <i>Health Services in Western Europe</i> report dealing with the schemes in various countries I read:</P>
    <P>Hospital care is invariably covered by the schemes and only in France and Ireland must the patient pay a proportion of the hospital costs personally.</P>
    <P>That means that only in Ireland and France is there a direct charge on the patient.  I do not wish to quote out of context.  I know the report goes on to say that there is a limited hospital stay in some of those countries and that in some of them social welfare benefits&mdash;which indeed are large in comparison with ours&mdash;have to be deducted for the keep of a patient <Col N="642" /> in hospital.  But there is no direct charge as such for hospitalisation in any countries other than France and Ireland.  This is a defect we should get over.  In most of the European countries, social welfare and health contributions are combined and are graded in proportion to the amount of earnings.  A person earning £9 a week would pay less than a person earning £11 or £12 per week.  Whether or not a contributory system is introduced here&mdash;the Labour Party feel it should&mdash;the Minister will have to decide whether to have a graduated scale of contributions from workers and employers.</P>
    <P>A graduated scale is attractive in some ways, but it has its snags.  It introduces a means test which means an investigation into what is being paid and double checking.  Very often the cost of administering and collecting such contributions would offset any advantages gained.  In Great Britain, Denmark and Ireland, there is a flat payment.  I am inclined to believe that, if contributions are to be collected, a flat payment is more economical in the long run.  Even though the man with the low wage has to pay as much as the man with the bigger income, there are other ways of getting at the man with the big income through some system of income tax or otherwise.</P>
    <P>I should like to go through the White Paper briefly.  Let us assume the promises it contains will be honoured in two years' time and let us see what we have.  As far as the Labour Party are concerned, the two big things are the choice of doctor and the fact that the patient will now attend at the doctor's surgery rather than some old-fashioned, draughty and ill-equipped dispensary.  These two things alone are worth the White Paper and I give it my unstinted praise and support.</P>
    <P>In regard to the other matters dealt with, I have a cutting here from the <i>Irish Times</i> of January 21st, the day following the introduction of the White Paper, which examines its highlights under 12 headings.  It says, first:</P>
    <P>Those who are entitled to take part in the general medical service <Col N="643" /> will be clearly defined, thus ending the present system under which the bases of eligibility vary from one local authority to another.</P>
    <P>That is quite true.  I made that point when speaking on the Labour Party motion on the health services.  In South Tipperary, for instance, you may get a medical card if you have a certain income, while the income limit is different in Waterford and different still in Kilkenny and Cork.  It is good that the Minister now proposes to list entitlement so that each person will know as soon as possible to what he is entitled, depending on his occupation.  There will be no difficulty so far as income and valuation are concerned but the self-employed person may present some difficulty.  However, the charge will be uniform.</P>
    <P>The Minister made it clear in page 35 of the White Paper how far he thought the other improvements would go.  It says, starting on page 34:</P>
    <P>The Government are aware of proposals recently made for the extension of the general practitioner service, with a choice of doctor, to the whole population or to the entire middle income group.  In the Government's view, however, satisfactory evidence has not been offered to show that such an extension is necessary. Indeed, the evidence that is available would indicate that hardship is seldom caused in the middle income group through family doctors' bills.</P>
    <P>Now comes the portion I would wish to underline:</P>
    <P>As a wide extension of State-operated or State-organised general medical services has not been demonstrated to be necessary, the Government would regard it as undersirable and would not, therefore, propose that the limits to be fixed by the regulations mentioned in the preceding paragraph would be such as to include a high proportion of the population.</P>
    <P>In other words, what the Minister appears to me to be saying there is that, even though he will make definite, <Col N="644" /> rigid and uniform rules in relation to entitlement to the card, nobody need expect that the position will be any more all-embracing than the 30 per cent who now get medical cards.  That, at least, is my interpretation of it.  If I am wrong the Minister will correct me.</P>
    <P>We have heard the Minister's statements, and we are bearing in mind the suggestion made in the White Paper, that rent and other expenses not normally allowed by county managers in investigating entitlement to a medical card will be considered and that the number of children will likewise be taken into account. Children enter into the consideration at the moment but not, I think, to the extent the Minister is contemplating; the fact that a man is married, with eight children, and has other exceptional commitments which limit his means in relation to payment for GP services will be taken into account. Unfortunately page 35 seems to prohibit me from believing that we should expect any great improvement, if any, in the issuing of medical cards.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have done away with the family income concept.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so.  I should give credit for that.  One of my complaints in the past was that the incomes of the sons and daughters were added to that of the father, thereby depriving the parents and the sons and daughters of a medical card.  That is a most desirable change.  I am sure that it will qualify a far greater number of people than formerly for GP services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next point is drugs and medicines.  These will be provided through the chemists and not in the dispensaries.  We certainly applaud that change.  It is an excellent one. Patients will no longer have to queue up in the rain waiting for their prescriptions. Under the proposed new scheme, they will be able to go to the chemist of their choice.  There is only one drawback.  The private patient will still be able to get anything he likes while the other group will be supplied with a standard prescription from a listed number of medicines and <Col N="645" /> drugs.  Is that not so?  The Minister shakes his head.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Not necessarily, There will be a national formulary, but the doctor will use his discretion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>The White Papers says something about being as economical as the health of the patient will permit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the same as in Great Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>I know, but it makes a distinction unfortunately.  Perhaps it is a distinction without a difference, but any distinction is, to my mind, undesirable.  I agree that there is no other way other than by recklessly allowing any type of prescription the doctor likes.  If that were the case, then there would be no way of assessing the cost of the health services in any one year.  I just mention that in passing.</P>
      <P>People in the middle-income group will be eligible for general medical services and will in certain cases be able to buy drugs and medicines at reduced prices.  That, of course, is merely an extension of the circular sent out by the Minister's predecessor in July, 1964.  That facility was not availed of to any great extent largely because people were ignorant of its existence.  I was unaware of the circular until Deputy Tully drew my attention to it here and, indeed, the attention of the House also.  In Waterford, the health authority is a separate entity and the circular was not read at all.  After Deputy Tully drew attention to it, the Minister issued a warning and directed attention to this entitlement and advised that it should be brought to the notice of members of local authorities and of the public. After that it was freely availed of in Waterford.  I am glad the Minister is now considering extending that further. It is a most desirable advance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>More district nurses will be recruited and home nursing services extended. There will be co-ordination of services for the aged.  These are all promises for the future.  However, I believe the Minister will endeavour to <Col N="646" /> co-ordinate the various services, including the voluntary bodies, and will also provide home nursing services.  All that will cost money and it will all take time but we accept it as a principle and the quicker it is implemented, the better it will be as far as we are concerned.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay tribute now to some of the voluntary organisations that give such valuable help to the aged.  In my particular town, the Friends of St. Martin, a group of young boys and girls, visit the aged weekly or nightly.  They have whitewashed and painted the houses of these people. During their absence in hospital, they have done up the little homes so that the patients, when they return, find their places neat and tidy.  They provide social evenings for the lonely and the aged.  All this is done out of their own pockets, out of money subscribed by them at their meetings.  There is no State aid.  It is excellent work and they deserve the thanks of the people for doing it.  It will bring a blessing on them.  I am glad the Minister proposes to co-ordinate these services.  Any help he gives should be extended to this group.</P>
    <P>The next point is the abolition of the charges for outpatients, specialist services, X-rays, etc.  That is a good move and the Minister is very wise in doing this since I believe it will encourage people to make more use of the outpatient department and put an end to this needless occupation of beds. The cost&mdash;2/6 for a specialist&mdash;of collection so diminishes that amount that it is hardly worth collecting at all.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick referred to the doubling of maternity grants.  I would estimate that £6 would be the equivalent of the £4 given in 1953, but it is a good thing that it has been increased to £8, as is also the doubling of the grant for multiple births.  The only regret I have is that there may be a long delay before this will be introduced. The present moment may not be the most opportune time but if the Minister could, by some process, bring certain things into operation earlier than others, that is one thing I would <Col N="647" /> like to see brought in as early as possible.</P>
    <P>Dental and ophthalmic services and the supply of spectacles are to be extended to the middle-income group. In connection with the dental services, even the lower-income group who, by virtue of their medical cards, are entitled to dentures cannot be supplied. It is said in our county that it is due to the shortage of dentists.  I believe that is true.  We did get permission from the Department of Health to employ dentists even on a part-time basis. We were not able to get them in sufficient numbers, and if they came, they went very quickly again.</P>
    <P>There seems to be no trouble about people getting extractions.  The difficulty is in regard to having plates and dentures made.  There is an association with headquarters here in Dublin which covers the technicians who make these teeth.  This is a recognised body and they are permitted to make dentures and to fit them.  In no case do our country dentists do anything other than take the impression and send it off to these technicians and wait until it comes back by post. If the teeth do not fit properly, they may file them if it is a minor fault, but if it is anything serious, they must send them back to these technicians to get them reshaped or re-done in some way.  The people who really do the work are not permitted by law to do this thing except through a dentist, and it is certainly a restrictive practice.  I would recommend to the Minister to read, if he has not already done so, the Journal of the Irish Dental Association which has an article in the December, 1965, issue on auxiliary dental personnel.  It lists three categories: dental technicians, dental mechanics and dental craftsmen. There is another category composed of dental surgery assistants, chairside assistants and dental nurses.  They have divided their assistants or helpers into four categories, two of which are not permitted to go anywhere near the patient and two of which are permitted to be in the extraction room and, to a limited extent, to give care of the mouth and, in certain cases, to go and examine school children's teeth and <Col N="648" /> recommend the defects to surgeons or that a further check is necessary by a dentist.</P>
    <P>It should be possible to speed up the supply of dentures.  It is most unedifying, when a woman gets all her teeth removed at the age of 35 or 40 years, that she has to go through life without dentures, with consequent danger of having stomach trouble because of not being able to masticate her food, all due to the fact that she has not sufficient money to provide dentures.</P>
    <P>Dentures as provided to health authorities can be made at a very reasonable price.  I happen to know because at one time I was chairman of a health authority and had to sign the contract documents.  I was amazed to find the difference, not in quality but in price, between the dentures supplied to one of our patients and those supplied to a private patient. It would make one wonder either how the technicians were able to make them so cheaply or how dentists with private patients were not able to retire from dentistry after a very short period of years having made more than enough to keep them for life.</P>
    <P>The proposed ophthalmic and dental facilities are all for the future.  We welcome any improvement in these but I suspect there will be a considerable delay before they will be implemented. We regard them more as a principle accepted and as something which will be given, when funds will be available. The immediate thing is to establish a system of priorities and try to give the most needed things as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>In regard to the control of pep pills, I do not know why the <i>Irish Times</i> selected that as one of the highlights of the Minister's White Paper.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the only new thing in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have regarded it as not of the greatest importance. It is certainly a good thing that there should be some limit if there is danger involved for the health of teenagers, dance band leaders or other people who take them.  I do not bother about <Col N="649" /> them beyond an odd Aspro.  That meets my requirements.  I am not an expert on these things, but if there is need for control, it is desirable to introduce it without delay.  It certainly will not cost a great deal.</P>
      <P>The screening of certain diseases such as cancer and various other things is also dealt with.  That is an extension of the infectious diseases section. Anything that will help early diagnosis so that treatment can be effective must be welcomed by everybody.</P>
      <P>I should like to deal with the cost of the extension of general medical services to all classes of the people, that is, the right, say, for all the people to have a free GP.  I know it will be said we just cannot afford that, that it is impossible to give all the people a free service.  We are giving a hospital service to 90 per cent of the people.  It is true there is a limited charge which, as the Minister pointed out, is not a very serious one but which brings in a certain amount of money.  When anyone proposes that a GP service should be given to all the people, we must realise that there is a percentage of higher grade people who will never accept health services.  They just will not go in with the common herd.  If they feel like that and have enough money to pay up, I have no grievance on their account.  It is their privilege if they want to pay for exclusive attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The suggestion is to give free medical service so that people can call the doctor when they need him without thought of how much must be paid or whether it is possible to pay him at all.  This is quite a big factor with ordinary middle-class people.  I do not know what doctors in Dublin charge per visit but I think it varies according to the doctor, from as low as 7/6d to 12/6 per visit.  I know that in the country, certainly in my area, and I can say this without fear of contradiction, the charge is £1 per visit to the house, irrespective of how many times the house is visited in a week.  If a doctor is necessary for a middle-income group person, if his wife or child is ill, and if it requires 10 or 14 visits by the <Col N="650" /> doctor to the house, it is £1 per visit, and very often it is £1 if you attend at the surgery and 30/- if the doctor comes to the house, depending on which doctor you get.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is proper to say, as the Minister said in the White Paper, that this is not a factor in the lives of the middle-income group.  I know of cases were people have deliberately gone without medical service because of that very fear.  They could not pay for it and thus were deprived of it.  I should like to read from a Tuairim pamphlet which deals with this point as I think it is worth quoting.  &ldquo;Wealth Producing as well as Health Producing&rdquo; is the heading and it says:</P>
    <P>It certainly shows a superficial grasp of the functions of the social services to regard them as a dead weight on the productive members of the community by which the unproductive&mdash;those no longer able to work&mdash;are supported or helped. For the social services, and especially health and education, pay partly if not wholly for themselves; they can be, in other words, an economic investment for a community.</P>
    <P>Health services are wealth as well as health producing; they add to the national product in many indirect ways; they reduce the death rate, make for a larger and more efficient labour force and greater output per head by workers; they reduce the number of work-days lost to the economy by absenteeism due to illness, many times more serious than the loss caused by the industrial disputes so often deplored in the press.</P>
    <P>Many people, who say the country cannot afford it, forget that if this service is paid through the rates and if it is costly in taxes and contributions the national economy so benefits that we can get back practically all we lose. The article goes on to say that indirectly even the payment of benefits to people incapable of work may have favourable reactions on the health and well-being of the next generation of workers.  Not only does it pay dividends in the present generation but it <Col N="651" /> can be reflected in a stronger and healthier race of children.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party programme for the extension of general medical services to all the people is something that will come.  We may delay it, but every country in Western Europe is heading in that direction and the programme, as outlined by the Labour Party as far back as 1958, will in time become the policy of some Government here and certainly the policy of a Labour Government, if and when we assume power. The question of whether we can afford it has been mentioned.  As I understand it, at present we pay some £30 million for health services.  That may not be the exact figure but it is in that neighbourhood.  Now we shall pay another £4 million or £5 million for these improved services, making £35 million. In Northern Ireland with approximately half our population it costs, I think, £25 million to give all the health services they ahve which include all we are seeking, free GP service, hospital service, dental and optical treatment and so on.  Assuming that with double the population here the expenditure would be twice as much, that would be roughly £50 million.  That is a pretty big figure but we are already spending or proposing to spend £35 million.  It would mean increased taxation in some cases but I think it could be met to a limited extent, to the extent of £5 million or perhaps £10 million by the payment of contributions by employers and workers and by State grants.</P>
    <P>Certainly the trade union movement and the ordinary worker have never kicked about paying increased contributions provided the returns are worth while.  Even the farming community I think would have no objection. The Voluntary Health Insurance had a survey some time ago&mdash;I have their figures but I do not want to go into details now&mdash;which showed that over a number of test cases, about 1,000, the cost worked out on average at £7 10s per head per year.  Outside hospital services, that covered drugs, specialist and GP services.  In a family of four or five that would mean £30 or £35 and the limited&mdash;very limited <Col N="652" /> at times&mdash;voluntary health coverage costs about the same amount.  I believe the workers aided by their employers, and by the State and the self-employed shopkeepers and farmers would willingly agree to pay a good proportion of the contribution in order to get similar cover to that given in Britain or Northern Ireland because fear of the day when you get sick is always haunting the minds of parents, and of wives particularly.</P>
    <P>I have had practical experience of it this year when for an illness of ten days in hospital I had to pay £34 19s. in hospital charges alone, apart altogether from what was paid to the doctor who attended and the specialist who did a minor operation.  I should feel that any contribution I was called on to pay either by way of a weekly stamp or whatever system is devised would be well worth while so that I would know that whatever I suffered from or any member of my family suffered from, whether a recurrent illness or not, would be taken care of and get specialist attention if required, irrespective of my means.</P>
    <P>There must be a considerable grievance amongst the white-collar workers and the farmers who are still over, say, the £60 valuation.  Civil servants who earn over £1,200 a year, and there must be quite a number of them, journalists, all sorts of clerical workers and non-manual workers who are earning over £1,200, are completely outside the scope of the health services, but as individual ratepayers, they are contributing to the health charges.  In my constituency they pay 23/6 in the £1 for health charges but they will never benefit by even 1/- of that money. Should they go into hospital, they will have to pay at an extraordinary rate, even though they are already contributing 23/6 in the £1.  I believe that they would welcome an extension to include them and that they would be prepared to pay a considerable amount of contribution in order to obtain the benefits of the health services and to be covered for free hospital charges in the manner advocated by Fine Gael for the middle-income group.  Fine Gael <Col N="653" /> should have gone further and covered all the people and it could have been optional for the higher-income group.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly if it were optional, I would say that the man who did not want to go in could worry about himself.  I think five per cent of the remaining ten per cent would come in and accept coverage. I got into some controversy with the management of the Voluntary Health Insurance Board following a news conference which we had in connection with the White Paper and the Labour Party Health policy.  I said that one of the defects which I found in their scheme and of which I had proof&mdash;and indeed I have got much more proof since then&mdash;was that many people who joined and who suffered from an ailment found after a year either that they were charged increased premiums or the period of their entitlement to hospital charges was reduced or, in two or three cases, they were refused cover altogether.  That is not a good service.  I would say that probably for the vast majority of people joining the scheme it does offer a service but it will never be able to replace free-for-all health services supplied by the State.  In an article written by John Murdoch in one of the newspapers, Mr. O'Malley answered questions and he admitted that it could not and was never intended to take the place of an overall scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know of a case involving an ordinary working girl in Dublin who joined the Voluntary Health Scheme in 1962 and because one of the questions relating to previous health history had not been properly completed, the Board, after she had spent quite a long time in hospital with a serious illness, refused to pay something like £80 or £90 and that girl had to remain on and work in the hospital.  She is today working in one of our Dublin hospitals trying to pay back what should have been the responsibility of the Voluntary Health Insurance Board. They accepted her money in 1962, in <Col N="654" /> 1963 and in 1964, and in 1965 when she became ill, they went back over a period of five years and discovered a flaw which permitted them to get out of their commitments.  That was a dastardly thing to do and it made me feel that this scheme was not of any great value.</P>
    <P>There are a few questions which I should like to ask the Minister which perhaps he will be able to answer. What does the Minister propose to do where a doctor has a patient on his panel whom he does not want to treat? Who does the Minister think should decide whether that doctor should have to accept that patient?</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, the principal thing is that medical treatment would have to be rendered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>But who gives it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The doctor will have to give it, and if he has a crib&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>What I suggest is that should the point arise it should be dealt with, as in the case of the mother-and-child scheme, where the chief medical officer of health decides whether or not a doctor must accept an application by a mother for attention.  That, I admit, is the rare case where a doctor, or perhaps all the doctors, say: &ldquo;I just do not want to attend that particular patient&rdquo;.  Some hard and fast rule will have to be made because we do have people of that type whom no doctor wants to attend but being human beings, they will have to be attended to if they become ill and someone will have to make the decision.  This is a point brought to my notice by someone who is keenly interested in the administrative end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is something which will be watched but the main thing is that medical attention will be given.  There is nothing wrong at all with a high percentage of these people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>The man who thinks he is sick is just as sick as the man who is sick.  Another point raised by somebody in the administrative group of health services was: does the Mini-chil <Col N="655" /> ster think that in certain cases, particularly in the case of old age pensioners or people over a certain age, the medical card should not have to be renewed every 12 months and&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that there should be an extension for life or perhaps for three years?  A great deal of office work, investigation and checking which appears to be unnecessary has to be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">

    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>I would say that would be preferable.  Another point is in regard to the provision of drugs for people in rural areas.  Will the doctor do the compounding or will the people have the right to go to the nearest chemist?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be certain areas in rural Ireland where the dispensary system will be retained and the doctor will compound medicine and make up prescriptions.  In other cases, in rural towns and villages, and so on&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>They would be so near civilisation that they would be able to go to the nearest pharmacist.  I think that will cover it.  I do not want to cross-examine the Minister and perhaps when he is replying, he could answer this question.  How soon does he think he will be able to cover the question of eligibility for medical cards?  This is really a burning question and every day we have people saying to us: &ldquo;Look, my next-door neighbour has a card and her husband is earning just as much as mine is, and in fact we have more children than she has, and they have a car&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, he must be left that. Some kind of a flare-up may be necessary to avoid all the annoyance that members of health authorities, Dáil Deputies and, I am sure, anyone in any position dealing with local authorities go through.  It would be a great help, indeed, if the Minister could speed up a decision on this.</P>
      <P>I am keenly interested in the conditions obtaining in the nursing profession. I always have been and more so now because I have a daughter who is a nurse.  I felt that nurses were the Cinderellas of the medical profession, notwithstanding the fact that were it not for their zeal and attention much of the medical skill which goes into bringing patients back on the road to recovery would be wasted.</P>
      <P>I am afraid that in many of our hospitals nurses with four or five years' service and who have to have a high standard of education, at least the leaving certificate, are asked to do very menial tasks.  It is very wrong that a nurse should have to do such things. It is a waste of a nurse's time because many of those duties could be performed very well by hospital orderlies or girls who have no medical skill. Indeed, in some of our smaller voluntary hospitals some of our student nurses are expected to do very degrading work.  In the best interests of the profession they should not be asked to do such work.  This drives people from the profession who would otherwise stay on and be very useful to society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The pay which nurses receive is completely inadequate.  The nursing profession, unfortunately, suffers from the defect that they believe that theirs is a vocation as the secretary of their organisation reminded me one time when I suggested that nurses had only themselves to blame because they did not go on strike.  She said: &ldquo;Mr. Kyne, ours is a vocation&rdquo;.  I said: &ldquo;If it is, why are you worried about getting paid for it?  If your organisation said to <Col N="657" /> the health authorities that on and after a certain date, unless certain conditions and improvements came into operation, the officials would have to do the nursing themselves, I think you would have done much softening up.&rdquo;  I still believe that.  We would all deplore a situation in which attention was withdrawn from any patient in hospital. Because people are devoted enough not to take advantage of what they could do and go on strike, there should be some system of arbitration whereby their case would be dealt with fairly and honestly.</P>
    <P>Some of the hours nurses work are incredible.  I know Dr. Browne did an excellent job for a start when he reduced the hours from 48 to, I think, 45 at present.  The 45 hours are very broken up.  In the case I am thinking about nurses start at 8 and finish at 2 or maybe 2.30, depending on whether a doctor comes in to see a patient. They get a break from then until 5 but when they take their dinner break out of that they have but two hours.  You cannot go to sleep and have recreation in two hours.  The nurses go back from 5 o'clock to 8 o'clock.  Then there is night duty which is from 8 o'clock at night until 8 or 9 o'clock in the morning.  If an ambulance calls you may be out two or three hours longer. It is true that they get this time made up but that does not compensate for the irregular hours.</P>
    <P>The pay given by local authorities&mdash; it is better than that given in the voluntary hospitals&mdash;is very poor.  The Minister should endeavour to see that the scale of pay, the time and conditions of service are improved so that they will be a credit to the health authorities.  Indeed, I regret very much, when the Minister visited our county home at Dungarvan, that I had not an opportunity of meeting him there.  I am afraid that because his visit was short he did not have time to see things. There are things I could have told him about.  Indeed, I intended to do so but I missed him.  I was there before he came and after he was gone but not when he was there.</P>
    <P>The nurses live in the town and they have to cycle to work, a distance of <Col N="658" /> probably a mile, in windy weather or in rain.  They have not even a place to change their clothes.  They have to change in the kitchen.  There is no place else to change.  If they eat a meal they have to eat in the kitchen. There is no place to put their bicycles, no rest-room and no special wash-up in the hospital.  The hospital attendants and the nurses have to use the one toilet.  When they made a protest to the local authority all the satisfaction they got was a reply to say that the letter was noted.  Indeed, I intended to draw the Minister's attention to this by way of a Parliamentary question or by a letter asking him to investigate the conditions under which those qualified girls have to carry out their duties.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister was in office when I raised this matter last year.  I refer to the International Health Conference held in Germany. A number of nurses in the Dublin Health Authority applied for leave of absence to attend it.  They were travelling there at their own expense.  They were not asking for anything other than permission to attend the conference. I think it was in Berlin.  At least three of them applied from St. Mary's and various other hospitals. They were refused permission to go. They went but they had that stopped out of their holidays, notwithstanding the fact that some of the officials of the Dublin Health Authority, who were not nurses, or connected with the medical profession, were there.  Not only had they not to take it out of their holidays but they went at the health authority's expense.  Nurses who are willing to pay their way to a health conference so that they may learn something and keep up to date with progress in the medical and nursing professions should, indeed, be encouraged rather than hindered, as they were in this case.</P>
    <P>I put down a Parliamentary question in regard to this matter and I think the answer from the Dublin Health Authority was that the applications were not received in time.  The applications were in long before there was any need to have any decision at all.  In fact, they were in for months <Col N="659" /> before the conference took place.  The officials made no application at all. They were simply appointed and sent out.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the Minister's consideration for the aged.  I want to pay a tribute again to the Friends of St. Martin as well as to the voluntary organisations.  In areas where it is not possible to get volunteers to visit aged people, maybe to wash and tidy up a patient, partially trained girls would be quite suitable for this work.  They do not need full nursing qualifications to help old people.  Indeed, the district nurse's duties very often consist of work which could quite easily be done by untrained assistants.  The local authorities should be encouraged to employ that type of help for old people Those people could visit the homes, tidy them up, prepare meals and do ordinary tasks which are necessary and they could leave the nursing to be carried out by the district nurse on her visits.</P>
    <P>There is one thing in connection with the voluntary health which the Minister spoke about and I want to say it will be very hard for him to look for help from voluntary organisations in so far as the Civil Defence groups, who have ambulances and various other medical equipment are concerned.  They have refused completely to co-operate with anyone dealing with the aged or, indeed, the lonely people.  I know of an organisation that went to the trouble of taking some old people on an outing. They gave them a picnic at a seaside place in County Waterford and they sought a loan of some equipment&mdash;I think it was a field kitchen&mdash;from the Civil Defence authorities but under some Army regulation it was refused.</P>
    <P>I wonder would the Minister endeavour to see the Minister for Defence and get a loosening up of whatever conditions there are which prevent the Civil Defence unit from lending either ambulances, field equipment or other equipment?  One would think that using their ambulances for that type of work, either on the field or to transport old people, would form a part of their training in that respect.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="660" /> It will be very hard to get voluntary organisations to co-operate and help out our local health authorities, unless our State-sponsored organisations, which again are not voluntary but are uniformed and financed by the State, do so.  Unless they do it, you cannot expect the voluntary organisations to give the one hundred per cent co-operation they wish to give.</P>
    <P>The question of the charge of 10/-per day was pretty well dealt with by Deputy Fitzpatrick <i>(Cavan)</i>.  I shall not prolong the House by dwelling on that.  Indeed, I know he was quite correct in saying that, of the £500,000 collected, 50 per cent goes in administration, in collection.  That is so in certain areas because I have had the figures examined.  Certain health authorities anyhow estimate that 50 per cent goes between solicitors' fees, postage, investigation, medical officers, health inspectors and all the people who have to travel around.  Indeed, in most cases the repayments are completely forced on the health authority because of the inability of the people to pay.  I have seen people getting a bill from a health authority running up to £40 or £50 when those people had not 40/- or 50/- to their name.  There was more expense involved in investigating it than would pay the bill itself.  I know of one case where a man was asked what was his income, would he get a certificate from his employer to show his income for the year and then, would he get a certificate from his employer to show his income plus his overtime.  The employer said: &ldquo;I would rather pay the bill myself than have all the trouble you are giving me&rdquo;.  That is all added expense.</P>
    <P>Even if the Minister feels that some money must be obtained, would he not consider the simple expedient of adding something to the social welfare scheme and so cover all people in hospital?  He could collect it that way quite easily.  People would pay it, as they worked, and they would not have the worry.  I get continuous letters from women saying: &ldquo;I hope my husband will not be in hospital long because we have not got the money to pay the bill.&rdquo;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>I was particularly interested in it.  I intend to deal only with the first part of it.  It commences by saying:</P>
      <P>In view of the proposals in the White Paper, it is pertinent to consider the various ways in a scheme of socialised medicine in which doctors might be required to carry out their duties.  In doing so one must consider the experience of other countries and bear in mind the doctor's position, having regard to the system of remuneration adopted and how such system affects ...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>and then they list four points.  These points are so interrelated, they cannot be taken separately.  Point (1) is: The doctor's professional work standards. That is one of the considerations which must be taken into account. Surely a doctor is expected to live up to his profession, to give as good a service as he is capable of giving?  I cannot see what other way he would give service.  Surely it is not suggesting that if he does not get a special type of pay, he will give a substandard medicine?  I would hope that very few doctors would accept a contract if <Col N="662" /> they were not satisfied with it, and if they did accept a contract with which they were not satisfied, surely they should not take it out on the patient by giving him substandard medicine?</P>
    <P>Point (2) is: his work load, including administrative duties.  Surely the capitation system would take care of that, and there would be a limit on the number of patients he would be permitted to take?  If he exceeded that, he always has the power to take in a partner and have a rota system of some sort.  Point (3) is: the doctor-patient relationship.  I would imagine that a choice of doctor and, perhaps, the doctor having a choice of patient, should take care of that.</P>
    <P>I suspect that point (4), his net income, is really the big point.  Surely that is a matter between the doctors and the Department?  I am sure the Medical Union and the IMA are very well able to put their case.  Just like nurses, they should not be deprived of the right to get a proper income.  They should be paid for their services.  They do a wonderful service, a service we all value when we need it, and all of us hope that we shall never need it. Just the same, it is desirable that there should be goodwill in the medical profession because, if we are to have a socialised State-sponsored health service at all, we can have it only with the goodwill and co-operation of the medical profession.  I am sure it is the wish of everybody in this House that good relations should continue to exist between the Department and the medical profession.  I am sure the Minister will endeavour to establish these good relations.</P>
    <P>I should like to conclude by complimenting the Minister on his personal views on the needs of the people of the country as regards medical services. I believe the Department is in good hands in his care and I can assure him he will get the fullest co-operation from the Labour Party.  But, while we are satisfied with everything the Minister proposes to do, we are not satisfied that he is doing everything we would like him to do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCarty" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. Carty) Michael Carty">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. Carty)</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I must <Col N="663" /> congratulate Deputy Kyne on his forth-right and down-to-earth approach to this problem of the health services.  I was particularly gratified that, even at this late hour, a tribute was paid to the work of the Select Committee on the Health Services, of which I was Chairman.  Deputy Kyne said&mdash;and I think it holds for all of us&mdash;that we got a lot of useful information about the operation of the health services during the couple of years the Committee met.  He stated&mdash;and indeed it could be said of many others of the Members&mdash;that he travelled many miles, at great inconvenience, to meetings of that Committee.  We met in rather difficult conditions, oftentimes outside Leinster House, and we had to leave these other establishements to come back to the House in the event of the bells ringing.  We had many other difficulties to contend with, but, by and large, we did learn a lot about the health services and from that pool of information the Minister has admitted that he drew a lot in formulating his proposals for the White Paper.</P>
      <P>I listened to Deputy Fitzpatrick of Fine Gael stating that the Fine Gael policy will be based on socialised insurance or, perhaps, he used the words &ldquo;social insurance.&rdquo;  I have followed as best I could the information that emanated from time to time from Fine Gael on their insurance policy and I must say that I am at a loss to understand what exactly Fine Gael have in mind.  I have here a copy of part of the speech made by Deputy Declan Costello on 1st June, 1965, as reported in Dáil Debates, Vol. 216, Columns 58 and 59.  He says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is only one way we can extend the health services to give the people what they need, that is, through health insurance.  They have done it in other countries.  There is no way in which we can bring about the necessary reforms unless we use health insurance and I give the Minister a guarantee not only on my own behalf but, I feel certain, on behalf of all my colleagues, that we shall forget what the Taoiseach and the former Minister for Health said about the insurance principle and <Col N="664" /> shall not refer to it again if in fact he accepts this principle and brings it in because there is no other way of doing it, taking into account the standard of health of the country, our system of payment to the health authorities and general level of taxation.</P>
    <P>Then he goes on:</P>
    <P>If we had a system of health insurance, it would mean there could be a free choice of doctor for all. It would mean there would be free treatment in hospital for all insured persons.  It would mean giving a free general medical practitioner service.</P>
    <P>He goes on to say:</P>
    <P>When I say &ldquo;free&rdquo;, of course, I know Deputies will understand exactly what I mean.  We have never said the services can be provided otherwise than by health insurance and have suggested that the people would willingly accept the need for a weekly contribution in respect of the services they would be given in return.</P>
    <P>Later on, also on 1st June, 1965, in columns 97 and 99 Deputy T. F. O'Higgins said:</P>
    <P>We can, of course, do it without difficulty provided people are rational and do not close their minds.  We can do it by insurance.  I do not believe we can do it otherwise.  It was unnecessary, and I think politically unsound for the Minister's predecessor to endeavour to intimidate and frighten people by picking figures from the sky and saying: &ldquo;This is going to cost £34 million or £35 million&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That is exactly what it is going to cost now.  He goes on:</P>
    <P>The need and the object of these proposals is to provide a cover in relation to personal health services, that is the services of the individual outside hospital when he is sick&mdash; nothing more than that.</P>
    <P>How can these two statements made by two responsible spokesmen of Fine <Col N="665" /> Gael, one the former Minister for Health and the other the spokesman for Health and Social Welfare of the Fine Gael Party be reconciled?  He goes on to say:</P>
    <P>Our proposals related to personal health services and we can cover these and extend them and improve them on the lines of insurance.</P>
    <P>What exactly do Fine Gael mean?</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCarty" hpid="Mr. Carty Mr. Carty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carty</NameTxt>
      <P>There we have it.  I will read these two again for you.  On the one hand, we had Deputy Costello saying:</P>
      <P>If we had a system of health insurance, it would mean there could be a free choice of doctor for all.  It would mean there would be free treatment in hospital for all insured persons.  It would mean giving a free medical practitioner service.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, we have Deputy T.F. O'Higgins saying:</P>
      <P>Nobody contemplated or suggested that the hospital service should be run on insurance lines.</P>
      <P>What is one to draw from these two statements?  Deputy O'Higgins went on:</P>
      <P>but it was not part of, or in any way concerned with, the proposals we made.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael do not know what they are talking about and then how are the people to understand or know what they are talking about?  Deputy Costello says: &ldquo;A free hospital service&rdquo; and Deputy O'Higgins says: &ldquo;No hospital insurance service&rdquo;.  Where are we to find out what they mean? Deputy O'Higgins says that it is nonsense to talk of expenditure of the nature of £34 million or £35 million but expenditure this year is running at the level of £30 million and with the improvements envisaged in the White Paper, expenditure will run to £35 million or £36 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I propose to deal briefly with the proposals outlined in the White Paper <Col N="666" /> on the Health Services and their Future Development.  Part I of the White Paper deals with the development of the present services which is of academic interest to us.  We know that they developed, as Deputy Fitzpatrick has said, from the poor law system.  We carried out great improvements in the Health Acts of 1947 and 1953 and we know that there will be further improvements and developments with the growth of preventive medicine.</P>
    <P>I would like to concern myself with the things of which I have some knowledge, having served on a health authority for some 21 years.  The first question is in relation to the eligibility of persons for the health services, Valid complaints have been made that there is no uniform method to determine who is entitled to have his name placed on the general medical register. I remember that in 1952 and 1953 when Deputy T.F. O'Higgins was Minister for Health, he paid a visit to us in Galway and addressed the health authority there.  He asked the county councillors to indicate to him what they thought would be a proper basis for the determination of who should get health cards, what the income should be in the case of a single person, what the family income should be, what the poor law valuation should be.</P>
    <P>It was impossible, and I think it still is more or less impossible, in relation to farmers, to say in terms of poor law valuation who should be entitled to a medical card.  It might be possible to do something in relation to personal income or salaries.  That, of course, would vary from area to area.  I assume it would be harder to live on £x income in Dublin than down the country.  I accept that, but in relation to farming, we are immediately presented with a difficulty because the poor law land valuation varies so much from district to district.  In one place land might be valued at only 5/- an acre, and in other places, depending on the former landlord, it might be valued at £2 per acre, and oftentimes it is, in various parts of Ireland, I understand.</P>
    <P>The Minister has stated that he proposes to specify certain limits or <Col N="667" /> certain standards in relation to incomes and to farming.  I hope he will be successful.  If he is, I feel sure he will go a long way towards solving the problem, but if that could be done, it would immediately let many people know whether or not they are entitled to medical cards.  As the previous speaker said, oftentimes people come to us and say: &ldquo;My neighbour has a medical card and my circumstances are more or less the same.  I have a more or less similar job.  I am earning more or less the same weekly income. I have the same number of family dependants. How is it that he has a medical card and I have none?&rdquo; By laying down certain standards&mdash;if they could be laid down&mdash;the Minister will go a long way towards solving the problem of convincing people that they are not losing something to which they feel they are entitled, and in respect of which they feel they are being deprived of their entitlement by a decision made by the health authority, which means the county manager.  If the Minister succeeds in doing this, he will achieve a great deal.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kyne expressed the opinion that while this might facilitate matters and grant an easement to certain people, he could not see the total overall figure rising much above the 30 per cent at which it is at present.  I doubt that.  I think it might rise to a higher figure of the population.  There is one thing that amazes me in relation to these medical cards.  It is something I noticed this evening when I was having a second look at the figures given in the White Paper.  I see that in a county like Leitrim, it is&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The ratio between Carlow and Leitrim is two to one.  That cannot be justified.  There cannot be a different standard in Leitrim for determining entitlement to medical cards.</P>
      <P>In Roscommon, the figure is 44.9 per cent.  Roscommon is one of my neighbouring counties but it is far wealthier than Leitrim.  The figure for Galway, which I know best, is 40 per cent.</P>

      <P>The figure for Cork county, excluding the county borough, is 25.1 per cent.  For Dublin county borough, it is 16.2 per cent.  In many counties the figure ranges between 30 per cent and 40 per cent, and the highest proportion of all, I think, is in County Carlow where 47.1 per cent of the population are covered by medical cards.  In his proposal the Minister seeks to establish a more or less <Col N="669" /> uniform system for determining entitlement to these cards.  Whatever efforts he can make, and whatever he can do to bring that about, should be commended, and I wish him luck.</P>
      <P>In my opinion, many people look for medical cards when they are faced with a period in hospital.  When the father of a family is told he has to go to hospital, and that he may have to spend a lengthy period there, or when he is told that his wife or one of the children has to go to hospital, he then, and not till then, looks for a medical card.  He regards it as a form of insurance&mdash;if I may use the word not in the Fine Gael sense&mdash;against hospital maintenance charges.  He looks for the medical card and he gets it, and that entitles him and his dependants to free hospitalisation.  In many cases the father has no objection to paying his local doctor whose charges are oftentimes very modest, but he certainly is a bit diffident about facing the hospital charges, particularly if his period in hospital is to be of long duration.  The Minister is to set up standards for determining entitlement to medical cards and I welcome that so far as it will be practicable.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The White Paper refers to the abolition of dispensary districts. Nobody knows more about this than I.  I damn near lost my seat over the abolition of a dispensary district. Dispensary districts are a feature of Irish life and the Minister has indicated that dispensary districts are to go. While I agree there is a case for the <Col N="670" /> abolition of dispensary districts in many parts of Ireland, there are remote parts of the country where there must be a dispensary district&mdash;otherwise you will not get a doctor to live, work and cater for the people living in such districts.  You can provide a choice of doctor in other parts of the country because doctors tend to congregate in towns but for the moment and, I am afraid, for many years to come, we must retain the dispensary districts.</P>

The medical officers appointed to look after these dispensary districts are all highly qualified men.  All, I assume, have been appointed by the Appointment Commissioners. They have years of practice &mdash;they must have at least five years&mdash; and in addition must have done some post-graduate work.  I fear that if choice of doctor is offered to the lower-income group there will be a deterioration in the standards of the men appointed.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCarty" hpid="Mr. Carty Mr. Carty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carty</NameTxt>
      <P>I was referring to drugs, medicines and appliances, not to the Verolme Dockyard.  Many people look for a medical card for the reasons I gave.  Many people feel that the cost of a supply of drugs, medicines and appliances will be a cause of great hardship to them.  In the White Paper, the hardship clause referred to by <Col N="672" /> Deputy Kyne and issued in a circular in June, 1964, is to be continued on a much broader basis.  That will be welcomed by most people.  Many of the antibiotics, the wonder drugs of today, are very costly and on a tight income or a modest budget, 30/- a week for drugs and medicines could be regarded as severe hardship on a young family. The Minister is to be congratulated for continuing the hardship clause and making it apply to people of that kind.</P>
      <P>The White Paper also mentions the practicability of providing a choice of doctor.  During the sessions of the Select Committee on the Health Services we heard evidence from many responsible bodies, and others sent us written submissions.  Quite a number of those bodies stated they were in favour of a choice of doctor, particularly the trade unions, the Congress of Trade Unions, the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union, the IMA &mdash;we did not have evidence from the Irish Medical Union&mdash;the Dublin Health Authority&mdash;they came out very strongly in favour of it&mdash;the Dublin Council of Trade Unions, the Limerick Health Authority and the Association of Medical Officers of Health.  Most of them recommended a choice for the lower-income group within the proposed scheme and some of them recommended an extension to the middle-income group.</P>
      <P>I think the Minister was right in confining it to the lower-income group because the middle-income group are in a better position to avail of choice of doctor.  They are not as confined to a dispensary medical officer as are those in the lower-income group and the cost of an extension of the choice of doctor to the middle-income group would be out of all proportion to the anticipated benefit.  Although most people in the lower-income group have received excellent care and attention from the district medical officers, for many reasons some of them did not feel they were getting the best service. There might have been some little nark, something that made it awkward for them to attend the doctor locally, some little row.  They should be given a free choice and they are now to be given that choice at a cost of something in the region of £1 million a year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="673" /> On the question of the institutional and specialist services, other speakers mentioned the figure of 10/- a day which is being retained.  Deputy Kyne said he thought it was not worthwhile and that a large proportion of the £500,000 collected was spent on administration.  I understand it is estimated that the amount spent on administration is £60,000, which is not a very high proportion.  I think the 10/-charge also acts as a deterrent because many people would go to hospital for any old reason, if there were not some charge.  I found in my own county that in many cases the charge was reduced, if hardship was proved.  A sum of £3 10s. a week for hospitalisation, which includes drugs, operations, X-rays and so on, cannot be regarded as excessive.</P>

I am pleased to know the Minister proposes to abolish outpatient specialist charges.  There used to be a charge of 2/6 to 7/6.  There is mention in the White Paper of choice of hospital.  That is something that has concerned me over the years.  I know doctors in my area would like to send patients to a particular hospital rather than a local hospital but they are more or less hamstrung.  They would, perhaps, like to send the patient to a voluntary hospital in Dublin where <Col N="674" /> there was a specialist with a particular reputation.  I say that without casting any reflection on the local surgeons and physicians.  But the doctors who wish to do that were frowned upon by the administrators of the local authorities. If a local doctor is part of the service, he should have a right to send a patient to the hospital with the surgeon or physician of his choice.  I now read in the White Paper that this is contemplated and I welcome it.</P>

The Minister also dealt briefly with proposals for the care of the mentally ill and the mentally handicapped. These two problems are at present being examined by Commissions and only brief reference is made to them in the White Paper.  I welcome the references in the White Paper to the care of the aged.  This year is especially devoted to that problem.  We were all asked to help in one way or another and a very good lead has been given by the Irish Red Cross Society. The problem really is to keep the aged at home.  People will have to face up to their responsibilities to the aged members of their families to look after them as well as they can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know there is a problem here.  A young couple may not be able to look after old people and so on.  The service could be further improved by providing home aids in addition to the district nurse who could call from time to time and help out with this work.  It is often a very irksome and tiresome task for the mother of a young family to have to look after old people.  However, too many people are inclined to put the aged into homes.  While the homes themselves are good and provide excellent care and attention, old people like to live in the surroundings to which they are accustomed, probably where they were born and reared.  They resent being sent to institutions, no matter how good they are.  They remind them of the bad old days when people were <Col N="675" /> sent into the workhouses.  Any help that can be given to keep old people in their homes should be encouraged. Whatever steps can be taken to help with the care and management of old people should be investigated and embodied in legislation, if possible.  I had better steer away from the maternity grant because Deputy Fitzpatrick might say it was no concern of mine.</P>

      <P>Now I come to Part IV of the White Paper, Financing the Health Services, which concerns me most as a member of a local authority.  We are all aware of the present system of financing the health services.  Roughly, it is on a 50-50 basis.  In western countries, we strove down through the years to bring our health services up to the required standard and we found ourselves faced with really staggering health rates.  That was true of most of the western countries, but particularly true of Galway, Kerry, Mayo and, to a lesser extent, Donegal.  We had to look after new hospitals, sanatoria, cottage hospitals, clinics and all the rest.  I was looking at the figures for the health rate three or four years ago&mdash;I have not got a breakdown of the current figures&mdash;and the two highest health rates at that time were Galway and Kerry.  In both the rate was around 24/- in the £&mdash;24/5 in Kerry and 24/4 in Galway.  It is a great deal more now.  At the same time the health rate in Meath was 9/-in the £.</P>

The Minister has given an assurance that the future financing of the health services will come out of the Central Fund.  Further, he stated at his press conference that he is devising a formula in consulation with the Minister for Local Government to ensure uniformity in health charges as between the different countries.  I am sure Deputy Tully will not like that.</P>

      <P>Reference was made to the need for a change in the administration of the services and the setting up of regions throughout the country as single entities for the administration of the services. Any step in that direction which will effect economies is to be welcomed, but I should like to be informed as to how it will operate.  I should like to know how the proposed new bodies will be constituted.  If the State is paying a bigger proportion of the cost of running the services, it would certainly be entitled to increased representation.  However, I hope the Minister will give the local bodies a majority because local bodies generally&mdash;this has been my experience&mdash; are very careful about expenditure. When the rates come to be struck, estimates are prepared and there is a detailed examination of all the items making up the expenditure.  That will be done on these new bodies if you have on them a majority of solidheaded country councillors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> This White Paper is a classic example of Government by Opposition since, as Deputy Fitzpatrick put it, it represents the first instalment of Fine Gael health policy.  I was a member of the Select Committee.  The former Minister for Health was also a member.  It was chaired by the good-natured Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Carty, in so far as the less good-natured Deputy MacEntee would allow him to be chairman.  We took a great deal of evidence and, towards the end of our deliberations, it certainly looked as if Deputy MacEntee was inclined to drag his feet; first Labour left the Select Health Committee and finally Fine Gael.</P>
      <P>At the penultimate stage, no meeting was held for about ten months. When Deputy MacEntee was questioned by Deputy T.F. O'Higgins here in the House, he replied that the reason was obvious: the Dáil was being repaired and there was no place to meet. That was a rather weak reply and it was apparent to me that, at that stage. Deputy MacEntee had virtually lost interest in the Select Committee.  In fact, at no stage was he prepared to agree to the ideas now adumbrated in this White Paper.  He may have been acting as devil's advocate but he certainly gave the impression that he was against the proposals adumbrated in this White Paper.  His attitude consistently was that there was not any great public demand for any change, the dispensary system was very cheap and it had the added advantage that you could easily sack the doctor.</P>
      <P>There was a general election and the Taoiseach announced that Deputy</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="679" /> MacEntee was no longer seeking ministerial portfolio.  At the same time, it was announced that Fianna Fáil would introduce a health system with a free choice of doctor for those who did not have that choice up to then.  It is not clear from this White Paper what percentage of people will ultimately be covered.  I do not suppose the Minister or anybody else could say at this stage what the figure may be.  The lower-income group represents some 30 per cent of the population but, when one comes to examine the percentage in the different counties, and realises that there is such a small percentage on the western seaboard with health cards, it must suggest that, with a universal system of assessment, free of the restraints which must have operated in the minds of county managers on the western seaboard, the percentage will probably rise from 30 to 40.  It is believed it will end up around 40.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael Party policy document advocated an 85 per cent coverage.  I have never been able to decide why exactly they picked 85 per cent.  I rather imagine it may have been to harmonise with the percentage of people in the lower and middle-income groups who are already entitled to a free hospital or near-free hospital service; it may have been expedient to have the same percentage of people entitled to free medical treatment outside hospitals.</P>
    <P>Whatever may be the reason, I have no fixed mathematical notion about what that percentage should be, but I would not go so far as Deputy Kyne and say that there should be 100 per cent coverage.  I certainly do not see any purpose in providing free domiciliary service for some man with two motor cars outside his door or some man who has got a status increase of £900 in the past couple of years.  We are not such a poor nation as not to have ten to 20 per cent of upper income people able to pay and easily able to pay for their general medical services.  I see no reason for providing 100 per cent coverage in respect of general medical services, unless one is a doctrinaire socialist, and if one is a doctrinaire socialist, one must socialise everything to the limit.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="680" /> There are three cardinal points in this White Paper about which the Minister has not been particularly clear, although I admit he has difficulties. First, there is finance; secondly, remuneration; and, thirdly, coverage. I have not got the gift of prophecy but I believe that whatever coverage we provide now will gradually extend.  It may start off at 35 per cent, go on to 40 per cent and 50 per cent.  That has been the pattern in most countries over the years and this country will probably prove no exception.</P>
    <P>In the long term, therefore, the Minister has not given us a method of financing the service that one could feel was completely satisfactory.  All he has said is that he will freeze the health charge moiety on the local rates and that any further increase in health charges will be borne by central funds. He has not said how long that freeze will last or whether it will be removed in different circumstances in the future. Probably no Minister in his position could give us any reassurance over any considerable period ahead.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not, as I have said, given us a percentage and is in no position to give us a percentage of the coverage which the scheme envisages. Furthermore, he has not given us any adequate indication of the method of remuneration of the doctors under the new scheme.  He has mentioned as a possibility the capitation system, but he has also made it clear that at this stage his mind is open and that he is not tied to any particular method of remuneration.</P>
    <P>The question of how any general medical service should be provided, how it should be remunerated and what coverage should be provided under it, are three important points which we are not facing now.  We shall have to face them at some future date, and certainly if there is to be an agreement made with the medical profession on the question of remuneration, it will have to be faced immediately.</P>
    <P>There are basically four methods of medical remuneration in operation in the world, extending from the Russian system to the American system, extending from the salaried system <Col N="681" /> obtaining in Russia, where the profit motive is anathema, to the private enterprise system of the United States where everybody pays for everything. Within that broad spectrum of remuneration, there are all sorts of variations from the red of Russia to the violet or ultraviolet of the United States.</P>
    <P>The system of financing medical services has, by and large, been a system of insurance, voluntary or compulsory, and the system of remuneration outside the two extremes, Russia and the United States, has been either on a capitation basis or a fee per service basis.  In this country I think people in general are more familiar with the notion of a capitation system and that largely derives from the fact that the system is capitation in the United Kingdom.  There was and has been for a long time in Great Britain a system of club practice.  It was a poor system in which in industrial firms and at pitheads a few pence were collected to remunerate doctors and general practitioner services for the members.  In 1913 an English Prime Minister whose name should be well remembered in this House, Mr. Lloyd George, introduced his national health insurance.  It was called by the ordinary patient coming into the surgery &ldquo;the Lloyd George.&rdquo;  Every patient coming in immediately said&rdquo; I am on the Lloyd George.&rdquo;  That system covered insured persons but not their dependants and it continued for a number of years.</P>
    <P>Doctors were still allowed to do private practice mostly upon relatives of insured persons and they could buy and sell their practices, but in 1948 Aneurin Bevan introduced the present national health service operated in Britain.  The full national health insurance service was a compulsory insurance system and the new system introduced by Aneurin Bevan therefore was a compulsory insurance system covering 100 per cent of the population.  It gave complete general practitioner and hospital coverage, with free drugs or sometimes a token payment for drugs. The question of drug payments has varied since the system was introduced. Various Governments have come and <Col N="682" /> gone without altering the system except to alter at different times the drugs payment in order to prevent, as they maintained, abuse of the drug system. Specialists were paid on a sessional or sometimes salary basis.  The doctors were paid out of a central pool.</P>
    <P>Under the present system doctors are not free to enter the present insurance scheme: they must enter through a medical practitioner committee which is mostly composed of local medical practitioners.  There is now no more selling or buying of practices.  It is important that we should realise the implications of the British system because doctors are free to go to Britain from this country and <i>vice versa</i>.  We must always secure that, whatever system we adopt, the livelihood given to doctors will be in some fashion comparable with the livelihood they can obtain in Britain if we are to hold the better members of the medical profession here.  So far, I believe we have been happy in that regard.  Many Irish doctors for one reason or another like to return here, but if medical services became unduly depressed here, that trend might not continue.</P>
    <P>The capitation system in Britain has been reviewed by commissions and there are very mixed feelings about it. Personally, I think the income doctors enjoy there is quite good but I am also satisfied that the working conditions are not satisfactory.  The capitation system, as such, leads to overcrowded surgeries, large visiting lists and to general abuse of the system by the public.  Much of the dissatisfaction arising from the capitation system arises on the score, not of income but because the doctors feel they are not doing a worthwhile job.  In some places it has become so bad, with overcrowded surgeries, that doctors find it very difficult to give satisfactory individual attention and they become, in effect, nothing more than signposts to hospitals.  Before we talk about the capitation system here, we should weigh up these inherent defects.  It is not because such a system operates in Britain that it would necessarily be the system for this country.</P>
    <P>I have examined some of the systems <Col N="683" /> operating on the Continent.  Whether our proposed entry into the Common Market has any bearing on the medical systems obtaining there I do not know. Deputy Kyne already briefly dealt with the type of practices and the methods of medical control in some European countries.  When you pass from Britain, the next country you meet which has a capitation system is Holland where they have compulsory insurance of employed persons up to a given wage limit and there is provision for voluntary insurance for others, providing coverage for 70 per cent of the population. Payment is on a capitation basis, with special fees for maternity work.</P>
    <P>Holland is a country of about 11 million people, with a substantial agricultural community, not as big as ours, 20 per cent.  There is an industrial population of 40 per cent.  The medical system there follows largely the British pattern in that they have general practice, public health system and hospital system, a tripartite arrangement which is characteristic of British medicine and characteristic of our own medical services. They have 93,000 hospital beds or 8.2 per 1,000 of the population, considerably less than we have.  We have more beds than any country in the world.  Deputy Kyne thinks that is good but I should not be prepared to agree with him.  I have always felt that what we want is fewer and better beds.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> As in Britain, no fee is payable by insured persons and specialists are paid not on a sessional basis but on an item-per service basis.  The system is administered by insurance funds, not as in Britain, by the State.  That is the other country which is predominantly worked on a capitation basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Germany has a very complex system worked out in great detail, very formalised and typical of the Germanic mind.  It sprang from the guilds, the friendly societies of the Middle Ages, and it was the first country to introduce a compulsory medical insurance system as we know it.  It was introduced <Col N="684" /> by Bismarck and that is the system which Lloyd George later imitated and modified when he introduced his own insurance system in 1913.  It is, as I said, a complicated system, but it is basically a fee for service system and the benefits are both in cash and in kind.  By that I mean that there are medical benefits and also cash benefits and the insurance is compulsory.  In Germany, there are 70,000 doctors and of the number of independent doctors, about two-thirds are general practitioners. The system is financed on the insurance principle, employer and employee solely paying insurance, and the employee's contribution is based on a percentage, usually seven per cent or eight per cent of his basic wage up to a certain limit, and there is no Government contribution.</P>
    <P>Denmark, in contradistinction, has a voluntary insurance system for about 90 per cent of the population and its medical profession are remunerated on both a fee for service and a capitation system.  It is financed to the extent of 70 per cent by the members and 30 per cent by the State.  The State's contribution is partly central and partly local.  General practitioners enjoy a high level of practice.  They do about half the maternity work of their country in their own homes and they have access to hospital and X-ray facilities.  In fact, in Copenhagen, the insurance funds have provided a laboratory service completely for the general practitioners who are in the insurance funds.  Specialists seek cases mostly by reference, in contradistinction to what obtains in many other parts of the Continent and the family doctor principle is preserved.</P>
    <P>Partnerships are rare but they have introduced a duty doctor system which is operated particularly in the large cities and by which the ordinary practitioner does no duty work from 8 o'clock in the evening until 8 o'clock next morning.  He is helped by a rota of doctors who are appointed for this particular work.  They have divided the remunerative system into what they call Tariff 1 and Tariff 2.  Tariff 1 is a capitation system which applies mostly in the bigger centres; Tariff 2, which is a fee for service system, <Col N="685" /> applies mostly in the rural areas.  The areas in which these particular systems are applied are arrived at by agreement between the medical association and the health authorities and if there is disagreement, there is provision for arbitration.  There is some restriction on entry into practice in the larger centres, but not in Copenhagen, but there is no restriction on practice for any registered practitioner outside the capital.  A fee for service system is arranged on an extensive, itemised tariff list and has a peculiar and unusual feature in that it is related to a retail price index.</P>
    <P>In Austria, we again have compulsory insurance, free choice of doctor system, and remuneration is on a case payment method and also on a fee per service basis.  That payment method is a modification of the fee for service system in so far as it extends halfway between the capitation system and the fee for service system.  The doctors are paid quarterly on the number of patient cases which they have treated and not on the number of treatments they have given.  Austria is a country somewhat like our own where there is a substantial rural population with, perhaps, an even larger capital, Vienna.  The insurance companies there not alone provide funds for general practice but some have their own hospitals.  One of the major accident hospitals in Europe, and one of the first to be regarded as an accident hospital, was founded in Vienna by an insurance company and was used as part of their benefits under their insurance system.  Afterwards it was controlled and directed by Laurence Bohler, who ultimately became the Director of Fracture Services to the German army during the last war.  The financing of the Austrian system is again half by the employer and half by the employee with very little subvention from the State.  I may add that in 1939 the German system was introduced but it was ultimately re-cast as not suited to the conditions appertaining in Austria.</P>
    <P>In Switzerland which, again, has a voluntary insurance basis for medical services, remuneration is on a fee for <Col N="686" /> service basis.  The insurance there covers about 70 per cent of the population. They also have provision, as indeed we have here under our own voluntary system, for a collective insurance system of insurance by groups in a factory.  Again, with the number of hospital beds, the general pattern obtains, 9.5 per 1,000 of the population. In general, the figure is about 11.10 per thousand in contradistinction to ours which is somewhere in the region of 20.</P>
    <P>There is no uniformity in the system in Switzerland in as much as it varies from canton to canton.  There are 25 cantons in the country and three national languages.  The general pattern, while varied, is a voluntary insurance system, which, of course, has a free choice of doctor.  The system operates quite simply.  As in all fee for service systems, there is no such thing as a panel list.  The patient merely goes to the doctor of his choice.  He pays his doctor, then goes to his local insurance office and is refunded the payment which he has made in whole or in part.</P>
    <P>Sweden is often held out as a classic example of a socialist country at its best.  Therefore, the Swedish system is worth examining.  They have a compulsory insurance system with 100 per cent coverage.  The system operates simply by the patient paying his medical adviser for the particular service and then being reimbursed by the insurance fund to the extent of 75 per cent of its cost.  In most of those refund or reimbursement systems on which the fee for service method of remuneration is based, there is a varying amount to be paid by the patient, except those who are, of course, poor. This is regarded as being desirable, socially, even, for example, in a country like Sweden which is 100 per cent socialist.  It is regarded as being desirable to prevent unnecessary abuse of the system.</P>
    <P>Sweden has a slightly higher rate of hospital beds than some of the other countries.  It has 15 per 1,000.  Its hospitals are run on a county basis. They are financed by local rates and State grants, something on the same basis as our own.  Hospital charges, <Col N="687" /> again, are something on the same style as ours, in so far as they are very low. They amount to about one-tenth the actual cost.  Social assistance is run by the communes.</P>
    <P>Originally, the Swedish system was the insurance system and it had progressed to cover about two-thirds of the population a few years ago.  It ultimately culminated in the introduction of the 100 per cent compulsory insurance system by legislation.  Like many of those systems, as Deputy Kyne pointed out, there is fusion between the social services and the medical benefits.  In most cases the insurance gives coverage, not alone for medical benefits, but also for cash payments during the period of illness.  In the financing of the Swedish system the insured person pays 50 per cent, the employer pays 25 per cent and the Government pay 25 per cent, that is 2:1:1.</P>
    <P>It is provided that the employee's contribution must not exceed two per cent of his taxable income.  It will be appreciated, when I say that the employee must not pay more than two per cent of his taxable income, that the average income of a citizen in Sweden is pretty high.  I understand they have a pretty high living standard.  The employer's contribution is, equally, fixed at 1.4 per cent of his earnings. Pensioners, or low income people, make no contribution.  The usual system in most of those countries for the people who are really poor is that they get their free choice by going to the local insurance doctor; he is refunded from the local funds and they, in turn, refund it from the home assistance service provided by the local communities.</P>
    <P>While there is free choice of doctor in Sweden, it has got many remote areas.  There are 2,000 doctors in general practice there but they have got 800 district medical officers and these men would correspond, I suppose, to our dispensary doctors.  They are utilised to staff the more remote areas where medical men&mdash;if they had a free choice&mdash;would not be inclined to go.  They have a similar system in England where they have, what they call, inducement payments to encourage <Col N="688" /> doctors to practise in the more remote parts of the country and in places where their income would, of necessity, tend to be smaller.  I imagine that the Minister will have to accept the position that he, too, will have to pay doctors by some such method to induce them to stay in the more remote areas.  The natural tendency in a free movement system&mdash;which most of those countries have&mdash;is for the doctors to gravitate towards the large centres of population.</P>
    <P>The district medical officers in Sweden are also allowed, of course, to have a private practice, again, on the free choice service basis on the reimbursement principle and, like our own dispensary doctors here, they have to provide a 24 hour service.  The position of the patient is that he can go to any doctor of his choice, be he an insurance doctor, a district medical officer or a specialist, but the refund he gets is the same.  If, on the other hand, he is referred to a specialist, he is allowed a larger refund.</P>
    <P>Norway has a universal compulsory insurance with free choice of doctor and reimbursement of 60 per cent to 100 per cent on an itemised basis.</P>

        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> There are two systems of refund in operation in Norway.  One is called the patient refund system and the other is called the doctor refund system.  If, for <Col N="689" /> example, the fee for a service is £1 and if, by agreement, it is arranged with the insurance funds, that the patient is entitled to a refund of 15/-, he may be refunded in two ways.  He may go to the doctor of his choice, pay a £1 and then go to his insurance company and receive back 15/-.  Alter-natively, he may pay his doctor the 5/-and the doctor afterwards collects 15/-from the insurance fund.  That is called the doctor refund system.  That second system probably suits the poorer type of patient better than the first.  Both systems are in operation.  It is quite a flexible service but the patient can elect to pay or be paid under either type of refund.</P>
      <P>In France they have a compulsory insurance system again and, traditionally, the French are as individualistic as the Irish.  There has been a considerable amount of discussion and agitation between the French medical profession and the French Government down through the years.  The French system in general has been mentioned here amongst medical people on several occasions as one which might be desirable or appropriate in this country.  It is an insurance system paid on an itemised service basis, with a percentage reimbursement from the insurance funds.  It is financed mainly by the employer and the employee and, to a limited extent, by the State.  In the medical forms used in the French system they have adopted a code to preserve professional secrecy.  In the presentation of each service a code number is used so that professional secrecy is maintained and those operating the insurance fund are not acquainted with the particular ailment for which the patient is being treated.  But there is a medical advisory service attached to each fund and the insurance doctor is obliged to discuss the diagnosis or treatment for which he claims payment with the medical authority who is appointed by the central authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Only two countries in the British Commonwealth have adopted an insurance scheme comparable with the continental one.  These are New <Col N="690" /> Zealand and Australia.  New Zealand has a social insurance scheme covering the entire country and financed by a special social security income tax and by Government grant.  There is free choice of doctor and payment is on a fee for service basis.  The Australian system has been much discussed in medical circles here and an article on the matter appeared last summer in the <i>Irish Medical Journal</i>.  It is a system of insurance and payment is on a fee for service basis.  The Australian system seems to have given complete satisfaction to the public, the politicians and the doctors in Australia.</P>
    <P>For years there was considerable disharmony about it and two Health Bills introduced were declared unconstitutional. It was not until 1950 under a coalition Government headed by Sir Robert Menzies that the present system was evolved.  Menzies was assisted by Sir Harold Pagie, himself a medical man, who was Minister of Health and the present Australian Ambassador in Ireland was a colleague of his.  The Australian system was introduced in stages.  First of all, there was a pharmaceutical service started in 1950 through which they provided most of the antibiotics and expensive drugs.  Later they introduced a pension system and in 1952 they introduced hospital benefits.  In 1952 they introduced medical benefits covering general practice with which we are mainly dealing in this debate.</P>
    <P>These services are financed by a voluntary insurance scheme which covers 71 per cent of the population. There is a 65 per cent refund of charges made by doctors to patients and it is hoped to increase that refund to 80 per cent.  The general complaint is that the Government contribution has not been adequate.  There is complete freedom of choice of doctor and the Government has remained outside the working of the scheme, has not tried to fix fees or intervene in any way. There is an itemised charge list covering about 900 services and, in effect, the patient still pays about one-third of the cost of his general medical attention.</P>
    <P>I have endeavoured to cover in a rather brief fashion a rather extended <Col N="691" /> subject.  It will be clear that there is no uniformity of remuneration as from one country to another but, on balance, it would seem that the fee for service payment system is in operation for a large number of the population of this part of the world. On the one hand you have the Russian system, with which I have not dealt in detail, but which is on a purely salary basis under complete governmental control.  On the other hand, you have the United States system which is a very intricate system with the exception of the Medicare system which the late President Kennedy, amongst others, helped to introduce to the United States.</P>
    <P>I have stressed this question of remuneration and it may seem to the Minister that I have stressed it unduly. However, if he has been reading the papers recently he will have seen conditions in Belgium where the Government threatened to resign and the King had to intervene.  It would be very desirable to introduce a scheme in which one can get medical co-operation. The success of any scheme will ultimately depend in a large measure upon the degree of co-operation forthcoming from the doctors who have to run it.</P>
    <P>There are objections to the capitation system and equally there may be objections to the fee for service payment system.  You cannot have free choice in any of the other systems. We are trying to provide a scheme for people who cannot pay their doctors directly and we are left with a choice between the capitation system and the fee for service payment system.  A decision will have to be taken in this country if we are to have free choice of doctor for the lower income groups or any percentage of the people.</P>
    <P>I have no very firm or preconceived notions as between one system and the other.  I have worked under the capitation system and I have seen its limitations.  Doubtless there are limitations to the other system with which I may not be familiar.  In so far as the objective in any State system we provide should be to bring it as near as <Col N="692" /> possible to private practice, then I would be inclined to think that the fee for service system is probably better. I am expressing my own personal view. I do not think Fine Gael have ever considered this, and I do not think that as a Party they have got convictions one way or the other on this.  I doubt if Fianna Fáil are disthe other.  It may be that the Labour Party may be more disposed to a capitation system. They have not said so.  Deputy Kyne mentioned it, but he has not ruled out an alternative system.</P>
    <P>On page 31 of the White Paper paragraph 42 reads:</P>
    <P>The Government propose, therefore, that the general practitioner service organised by the health authorities should be re-arranged so that those whose medical care is paid for by the health authorities will be able to get the same kind of service as others can now get through private arrangement.  This proposal involves substituting for the dispensary service a service with the greatest practicable choice of doctor and the least practicable distinction between private patients and those availing themselves of the service.</P>
    <P>My own view is that a system remunerated on the basis of item per service would more closely approach that which obtains in private practice than a capitation basis where the doctor is paid so much per year per head.</P>
    <P>We have a memorandum here from the Irish Medical Union and I think they, too, would fear that in the conditions obtaining here, particularly in the rural community, an item per service basis of remuneration would be more satisfactory.  In some European countries they had a capitation system provisionally which in most cases has given way to an item per service remuneration system.  By and large, the reimbursement system or refunding system, in so far as it is more closely related to the system of private practice and the independence associated with it, would appear to be the better of the two.  I accept the fact that it may be somewhat more expensive.  It depends entirely on the level of reto <Col N="693" /> more abuses than the other system, because every system is open to abuse. Anything of that nature which is free or partially free is open to abuse by the public or by the doctors, but there are statistical controls which are carried out by the medical profession in most countries, and usually a word from the insurance fund that a doctor might be overprescribing or transgressing in some other way would suffice, and there is usually an arrangement by which the doctor could be brought before a disciplinary body of his own colleagues to be fined or suspended. That system is in operation in other countries and there is no reason why it could not be made to operate here.</P>
    <P>I have little else to say on this White Paper.  There are several other things one could discuss, or one might like to discuss, but we will have another opportunity on the Supplementary Estimate which will no doubt arrive later in the year to discuss the other aspects of our medical services. I should like to talk about the possibility of group practice and the question of our accident services.  Both are subjects which need airing, review and discussion.  Indeed, another matter which might profitably be dealt with is the medical education of graduates and undergraduates and perhaps the maternity services.</P>
    <P>I spoke last year on the question of centralisation and decentralisation in our medical services.  On that occasion I advocated the centralisation of our acute medical services on the basis that it was impossible to provide the type of services which modern society demands, and in view of the increasing specialisation in medical practice, to provide the type of service we would like to provide in small units.  That day seems to be gone.  The trend is otherwise and we cannot reverse it.  Probably originally we were wrong to build the county hospitals because we cannot provide the medical manpower and the variety of medical personnel either financially or in the numbers we need in the present comprehensive services.  What will have to be done in the years to come will be very difficult.</P>
    <P>the two items together.  I know that the</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="694" /> On the other hand, we probably centralise too much our chronic work in so far as we tend to perpetuate the old poor law system, the workhouse system, and to keep our country homes as large central institutions to which our old people are sent.  About half of the cases in those hospitals are there for residential care, and about half can be classified medically as chronic.  It is clear that they do not require any highly concentrated nursing services and it would be better if they could be sent to smaller centres near their own homes.  The saddest feature of the county homes is the old people in them, 40 miles from their relatives and never seen by them again.  Perhaps they pay them one visit and no more. We have many small district hospitals and I do not see why a ward in those hospitals could not be set aside for some chronically old people.  Naturally, doctors like to have patients for whom they can do something, and the tendency would be for any hospital doctor to deal with an acute medical case in which he will feel the satisfaction of doing a good day's work, and consequently there is less interest in looking after old and feeble people.</P>
    <P>We must remember that these people are our own, that they are with us, that we have a moral responsibility which we cannot avoid.  In so far as we have to look after them.  I believe the move to centralise them in country homes is a bad one.  They should be kept as much as possible in their homes and when that is not possible the most desirable development would be to provide little homes within a reasonable distance of their old home where they could be kept with people whom they knew instead of being transplanted to central institutions which is too much for them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate involving the White Paper and the Health Estimate has developed into a spate of statistics which might be all right and probably is all right for those who are giving them.  I think a bad mistake has been made in debating muneration that is agreed upon.  I do not accept the notion that it is open <Col N="695" /> Labour Party, Fine Gael and the Government agreed to have them debated together but when one finds an Estimate for £17,337,000 being debated in the House with scarcely a reference to the fact that the Estimate is before the House, and when one hears a speech from the Minister with a bare reference to the figure of the Estimate but with no comparison made with last year and no details of how the money will be spent, one wonders if the whole idea was to avoid going into details: &ldquo;They will talk about the White Paper anyway; it does not matter about the Estimate&rdquo;.  That appears to be the general approach and I am very dissatisfied that we have not got the usual details before us of an Estimate of such size.</P>
      <P>I am aware that a few days ago the heads of the Estimate were published by the Department of Health but in his speech the Minister did not make any reference to any specific head.  We just had repeated references to the White Paper.  In so far as the White Paper is concerned, the first thing that struck me, having read it, was the similarity between it and our document of 1958.  The Minister says it cannot be put into operation before November, 1967.  That is a nice convenient date&mdash;leave it for two years and anything you say now will be reasonably safe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nobody can blame the Minister, having adopted that attitude, if he does not do something to put it into operation.  I agree that the proposals in the White Paper are desirable: most of them are things everybody in the House would like to see in operation. If money is to be found for anything it should be found for the improvement of the health services.  The Minister is as well aware of this and is as anxious to do it as we are.  It appears that having drawn up this scheme and having spent, as we know he must have, a tremendous amount of time and study to produce the document&mdash; he says he did not see our document of 1958 and we know that to reach similar decisions to ours he must have spent a lot of time and study on it&mdash;<Col N="696" /> it is just too bad the Minister finds the money is not available.</P>
    <P>I do not blame the Minister for that. In fact, I am sure he is most anxious to improve matters.  A disturbing feature is that at this early stage we have all the vested interests in the country trying to get their spoke in, trying to say what should and should not be done: &ldquo;It is a good scheme but do not touch us; it is a good scheme but make sure the interests of certain sections are protected&rdquo;.  Let me say at this stage that from personal knowledge I know that most of the dispensary doctors are dedicated men and women who do an excellent job, but included in the group are people who, while they are prepared to accept a reasonably well remunerated post with living accommodation, as soon as they get that post they start laying down rules under which they will attend or refuse to attend people who are unable to pay for medical attention.  Whenever the telephone rings they are not available. The telephone may not ring at all or it may appear to be engaged.  They are not to be telephoned after 10 o'clock in the morning except for private cases.</P>
    <P>The Minister does not know of all those cases but it will be possible to give him details.  There are doctors who have not got the necessary medicines. The dispensary depot where dispensary medicines are kept may not be reached. The doctor can only prescribe in such cases and the patients must go to a chemist and pay more than they can afford.  These are things requiring immediate attention and I am very disappointed that no effort will apparently be made before November, 1967.</P>
    <P>I think the three speeches we have heard&mdash;by the Minister, Deputy Fitzpatrick from Cavan and Deputy Kyne &mdash;were the best made in the House for a long time.  I think Deputy Kyne's was a masterpiece, covering more ground in an interesting way than most people are capable of doing in a debate of this kind.  However, it does not matter what speeches are made or what decisions are taken in this House as long as we have a situation where conditions are allowed to continue after our decisions <Col N="697" /> have been taken.  Something is very wrong.  If a vacancy is declared for a dispensary doctor in any of the popular parts of the country, at least half a dozen applications are received and after the post has been filled the people who want free medical services will be put under a compliment before they can get them.</P>
    <P>The vast majority of the dispensary doctors give excellent service but we have the few black sheep who made the last Health Act almost unworkable in the areas in which they operate and who will, despite anything this House does or the Minister may do, make the new Act unworkable.  From the debate so far, it might be assumed that the only payment made to doctors is the salary for their posts.  In respect of the insured worker who needs a certificate for the purpose of drawing sickness benefit, the doctor is paid from the insurance fund.  There has been a suggestion that in future payments should be made by patients and three-quarters of it refunded afterwards.  Do we not all know that people in this income bracket might not have the necessary money when the doctor calls and the doctor says: &ldquo;It is just too bad.  My fee is so much and I must be paid?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the sort of thing we must guard against.  Insured workers have been paying fairly hefty insurance.  It is important that people who require medical treatment should get it, not because they hold medical cards or go to the doctor with cap in hand but because they are entitled to it as of right.  Even if a little extra has to be paid for that treatment, the important thing is to preserve the patient's right to get it.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made in a document issued by the Medical Union to this question of patients' rights.  The way to preserve a patient's rights is to ensure he does not have to beg for medical treatment.  Unless very definite rules are laid down by the Department, I am afraid when the new scheme is in operation, if ever, we will have the same system as we have now, where to my own knowledge a workman's wife was made to stand one and a half <Col N="698" /> hours outside a doctor's door.  Her daughter needed treatment and had been referred to the local hospital.  She was referred back to the doctor for examination but it was not the dispensary day.  Because it was not the dispensary day that unfortunate person had to wait an hour and a half until the doctor thought fit to attend.  That is an isolated case.  It only happens occasionally.  But if it happens once a year anywhere in this country there is something wrong with our medical service.</P>
    <P>We heard a lot about the way hospitals have been run.  I live in an area pretty close to two good hospitals in the neighbouring county.  The local authority of which I am a member realised that if there was an urgent case the sensible thing to do was to send the patient to the nearest hospital, which was across the border in another county.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach made reference to rates.  He said that because counties around the city, including Meath, were using the voluntary hospitals they were able to keep the rates down because they were getting free treatment. Either he was joking or knows nothing whatever about the way the medical services operate.  The cost per patient per week is very much more in a voluntary hospital than in the County Hospital in Navan.  The extraordinary thing is that the medical card holders in the county in which the hospitals I refer to are situated cannot avail of them but must go 20 miles to the county hospital.  If the Minister is serious about improving the health services he should ensure that the interest of the patient must come first. This matter of trying to ensure the county hospitals are full before patients are directed elsewhere has resulted in considerable hardship to patients in the area to which I am referring.</P>
    <P>Reference is made in the White Paper to the wiping out of the extra charges.  This is one of the anomalies that have been allowed to continue down through the years.  One of the hospitals beside where I live can carry out an X-ray at a cost of £3 3s. 0d. But instead of having the X-ray there <Col N="699" /> patients from this area are brought, either by taxi or ambulance, 24 miles to the county hospital and back home again.  Would the Minister hazard a guess as to which is the cheaper way of having the X-ray?  Why has not some system been evolved by which patients can have X-rays in the nearest hospital?  The same applies to most out-patient treatment.  They cannot have it in the nearest hospital but must go to the hospital in the county. As a result, there is an excess charge either for an ambulance or some other car to take the patient over and back. This system seems to be in operation in most counties.  Before we introduce a new health system, the old system should be overhauled.</P>
    <P>We also have this position.  A patient goes to hospital and is examined by the doctor.  Perhaps the doctor sends him home again saying he does not require hospital treatment. But the patient feels he does and goes to a doctor other than the dispensary doctor.  He is sent to a hospital somewhere in the country and examined by a specialist.  The result is that the specialist's fees will not be met by the local authority because the patient did not go through his own local authority in the first place.  This sort of thing goes on and on.  There is no reason why with a bit of commonsense it could not be easily dealt with.</P>
    <P>There is also a situation arising now, of which the Minister is aware, where there is grave discontent among a certain section of hospital employees. Under the present system ambulance drivers are required in many cases to work 24 hours in order to provide service.  The trade unions concerned have been trying to get the county managers to agree to some system by which the men would be paid a reasonable wage and by which an adequate number of ambulances and drivers would be available.  A new association has been formed outside the trade union movement.  I understand the Minister has been approached to meet it.  I hope he is sensible enough not to cut across the trade union movement in this matter.  The Minister must seriously consider what <Col N="700" /> is to be done about the whole ambulance service.  It is entirely inadequate. When you see the same man who started to drive an ambulance at 8 o'clock one morning still driving it at 2 o'clock the next morning, there is something wrong with the system. Yet that is the situation in this country. Recently I saw an experiment to try to provide a 24 hour service.  It resulted in the drivers concerned finding themselves on almost 24 hour duty. It is something which requires urgent attention.  Small blame to those involved if they complain and say they cannot give the service required of them because they do not get a chance.</P>
    <P>We also have&mdash;this is something which has been mentioned on more than one occasion in this House&mdash;the situation in which patients going into hospital are required to pay a certain part of the cost&mdash;10/- per day.  The Minister referred to the fact that this 10/- per day is the exception rather than the rule; they do not pay the full 10/-; usually they pay much less.  In answer to a Parliamentary question, it would appear that the average amount collected runs somewhere around £3,000 to £4,000 per year per county. Is there any reason why this charge should be continued?  It causes a great deal of annoyance to those who get it hard to pay.  It costs a great deal to investigate and find out whether or not they should be asked to pay and the people who collect it do not appear to receive anything worth talking about. In my own county it is something in the region of slightly over a penny in the rates annually.  Most other counties are, I think, in the same position.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary also referred to the difference in the rate and the fact that this year the Minister is tying the rate to the figure at which it was last year.  I agree that is being done.  It will save my county 5¾d in the rates.  That is welcome because the rate is almost 5/- in the £.  In Meath the rates are low because of the Griffith valuation of 1857 but the rateable valuation in Meath is the highest in Ireland, and the result is that, though we have a low rate, that does not mean <Col N="701" /> we pay less than those in other parts who have a low valuation and a high rate.  Again, that did not seem to strike the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>He was not an insured worker.  He was in that vague middle-income group and he has not got £1,200 a year.  It is only a point, but is happening, and I am sure the county managers who have been consulted by the Minister and whom the Minister <Col N="702" /> has advised from time to time would be able to give him the necessary information, if he requires it.  They have it at their fingertips because all of us from time to time have made representations to have the charge reduced, and unsuccessfully.</P>
      <P>With regard to the issue of drugs and medicines, as Deputy Kyne remarked, the Minister's predecessor issued a circular saying that in certain circumstances drugs and medicines could be issued free of charge through the local authority to people who were either paying for expensive drugs over a short period or less expensive drugs over a long period.  This has worked reasonably well but usually the person concerned has bought a considerable amount of drugs before he eventually succeeds in getting the local authority to accept responsibility because the local authority will not pay for drugs bought prior to their decision to accept responsibility.  That is something that should be changed.  Any delay causes a great deal of hardship for those who are unfortunate enough to be unable to pay for their treatment.</P>
      <P>Nearly all the proposals in the White Paper relate to future improvements. The biggest snag is the fact that they are so far away in the future.  If the Minister gives a choice of doctor, he will certainly do something very desirable. All of us know cases in which a family has fallen out, for one reason or another, with what was the family doctor and they are reluctant to go to him when they fall ill.  From that point of view a choice of doctor is essential.</P>
      <P>The Minister earlier said&mdash;he was corrected by Deputy Kyne&mdash;that there are people who may not be ill at all but who insist they are ill and insist on attending the doctor.  That type of person is usually very ill; if he were not, he would not be pretending to be ill. If he does not need ordinary medical treatment, there is another type of treatment which could be recommended for him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The worst difficulty of all is where, even in a thickly populated area, one finds a doctor not available.  At the present time, because of influenza, <Col N="703" /> doctors are literally run off their feet, even in country districts.  Possibly the answer to the doctor problem in most of the bigger areas is the rota system. It is most unfair to expect a doctor who has been on duty all day to go out night after night to treat somebody who is ill.  Nevertheless, there should be a doctor available and, particularly where there are three or four doctors living around a big town, there is no reason why there should not be a rota system evolved so that at least one doctor would be able to have a rest during the day and be available for night-calls.</P>
    <P>I had the experience some years ago of being the only person in my district who had a telephone.  I often spent hours at night trying to get a doctor, and every doctor I phoned would either be out with a patient or, having been out on one or two cases, was feeling unwell and would be unable to answer the call.  It brought home very forcibly to me the necessity for having some system other than the one we are operating for the purpose of treating people who are ill.</P>
    <P>The likelihood of the disappearance of the dispensary system was mentioned here.  Under the existing system we still have&mdash;some people will deny it; most doctors will deny it and most county managers will deny it&mdash;unheated dispensaries, dispensaries which are supposed to open at 10 o'clock but do not open until 12 o'clock, possibly because the doctor is away somewhere else and is unable to open the dispensary in time.  No medicines are kept at the dispensary and the doctor may say to a patient: &ldquo;Come to my house at 3 or 4 o'clock and I will have a bottle ready.&rdquo;  That person who is ill may have a bicycle with him or may not even have a bicycle and have to walk to the house which is perhaps four or five miles further away. All this tends to bring discredit on a system which, by and large, is not so bad.</P>
    <P>The original Health Act, if properly administered, should be working reasonably well, but the greatest difficulty <Col N="704" /> of all is the blue card or the green card system.  The medical card is issued under certain conditions and there is a secret code.  The House heard Deputy Hogan talking about a secret code which is used in France, but there is some secret code used here whereby it is decided whether a person is entitled to a medical card or not.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Except that no one knows what the code is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall tell the Minister what it is.  However, one finds that Tom Smith who is earning £9 a week and who has a wife and four young children, is refused a medical card because of his earnings, and then Tom Brown who works with him at exactly the same job and who has £2 a week more and two children less, has for some extraordinary reason, got a medical card.  It is bad enough for a person who thinks he is entitled to a medical card to be deprived of it, but it is worse when he finds that his neighbour or his workmate has got a card, though he knows the workmate is much better off financially than he is.  The only way in which the matter can be rectified is to report the situation, as he sees it, to the county manager. This usually results in the second man losing the card, at least for a while, but the man who reports it does not succeed in getting a card for himself. That soon stops that sort of report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference was also made to the county home system.  A great deal of money is being spent on county homes, including one in County Meath where a new home has been built.  These homes are well looked after.  Both the nursing staff and the other staff of the homes seem to take a special interest to ensure the people there are comfortable. However, the unfortunate person who has to go into one of these homes and who has been living in a reasonably comfortable home of his or her own can never be really happy.  I mentioned here before something that an old man told me in the county home.  Because he and his wife were unable to look after themselves <Col N="705" /> at home, they had been brought to the county home and when they came to the door, one went to the right and the other went to the left and that was the last they saw of each other.  Both had been put to bed and they were unable to leave it except in a coffin.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether we shall ever reach the stage of making accommodation available for old couples to live together.  An effort should be made to do that.  I cannot see how small homes around the country could be run, as was suggested by some Deputies, because one could not afford to put staff in them.  No matter how small the home would be, there would have to be staff to look after them and under the present system that would not be so easy.  Some effort should be made to meet the requirements.  It might have been all right 50 or 100 years ago to say that the man should go to one side and the woman to the other side and that that is the way it should be left. In a Christian country there should be greater consideration given to old people, many of whom have reared big families and whose families have gone off and left them there to fend for themselves.  It amazes me when I hear people talking about the respect we have for our aged.  All anybody has to do is to go into any of our county homes to realise what little respect so many people have for their aged parents.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Minister's White Paper, possibly we will say he has not gone far enough and that he has taken far too long to introduce the proposals. But no matter what the Minister may do, he will find that, as long as he goes on the lines laid down in the White Paper, and even if he wants to go very much further on this road, he will get the full support of the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>The choice of doctor is one of the greatest benefits that can be given to the people.  Not alone will they have choice of doctor but they can also get to know whether or not they are entitled to free treatment, having regard to family commitments.  They will know that if under a certain <Col N="706" /> income or if they comply with certain conditions laid down, they will be entitled to a card.</P>

      <P>When I refer to family, I mean husband and wife.  I am aware that the children's income is being disregarded, which is a good idea.  We have all had experience of county managers assessing the non-existing income from the family where there were children who were looking for money from their parents instead of giving money to the parents.  What they were earning was counted against the family when they applied for medical cards.  Incidentally, there is one other thing which the Minister might consider.  Dublin County Council have recently introduced it and I suggest it should be done in other places.  If a check is being made on income for a medical card, it is wrong that the employer of the applicant should receive a circular from the local health authority stating that an inquiry is being made for health reasons.  It does give the wrong impression.  Dublin County Council have recently altered their query form because it was found to be causing embarrassment.  I suggest that other local authorities might be required to take the same step.</P>
      <P>As far as we in the Labour Party are concerned, we are prepared to support the Minister's proposals, but we want them to go very much further. We want free choice of doctor.  We want the free medical service, that is, free to the patient, to be paid on an insurance basis.  We want the payments to hospitals, which at the present time are more of a joke than anything else, to be discontinued.  We also want the issue of the necessary drugs and medicines to those who require them made easier, and we want the Minister to bring forward the date which he has set &ldquo;not earlier than 1st November, 1967&rdquo; to, possibly, 1st November, 1966.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>It gives me great pleasure to support this Bill and the White Paper.  This measure concerns every single person in the nation. <Col N="707" /> There is not a man, woman or child who at some time or other in his or her lifetime does not need to go to a doctor or to get some treatment of some kind or another.  The health services are very much bound up with the lives of our people.  If one escapes illness oneself for a time, usually a relative needs treatment of some kind by some doctor or hospital.  The present young Minister has taken his position very seriously and in a very short time has tried to do something worthwhile to improve health services. The choice of doctor is a big advance, as is the choice of hospital.  No matter how it was boosted, the dispensary system was still associated with the old red ticket of bygone days and getting rid of it was a great step forward.  I want to pay a compliment to the dispensary doctors who were in many cases distinguished men doing their very best and in earlier days very poorly paid.</P>
      <P>It is the democratic right of every citizen in a free country to have the doctor of his choice; if we cannot achieve that, we have failed to do something worthwhile.  I cannot over-emphasise how much this will be appreciated by all concerned.  Everybody has likes and dislikes and freedom of choice of doctor and hospital is a great boon for a patient.  Even though St. Kevin's Hospital in Dublin has been brought thoroughly up to date, staffed with the best available surgeons, nurses and doctors and splendidly equipped, many people, both in Dublin city and county, do not want to go there.  It will take another generation to remove the old stigma even though it is now a first-class hospital.  A choice of hospital gives the patient a &ldquo;lift&rdquo; that was never before available.  In the case of St. Kevin's, every possible improvement has been made; the name and the atmosphere have been changed; the old walls have been taken away, but old associations are hard to kill and it will probably be another generation before the past is completely forgotten.  While much has been done since the State was founded, much still remains un-done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="708" /> The present Minister had local authority experience as Mayor of Limerick; he had grown up with the authority and he had seen what was needed.  He is now applying his experience in his Department.  It is not possible in certain rural areas to give a choice of doctor and that will have to be another day's work, but at least in these areas there will be a choice of hospital and specialist treatment.  The old dispensary system with the queues waiting for attention for perhaps a long time, is going and that is a step in the right direction.  The doctors who have been appointed were appointed on merit and were highly qualified men, the best that could be got, but the time had come when the change was necessary and I am delighted it is now being made.</P>
    <P>The provision of free drugs for the middle-income group is another very big advance.  The cost of drugs fell heavily on people who for instance were buying their own homes.  I know of this in my own constituency and in Dublin city.  Both Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council, I suppose, have lent over £20 million under the SDA scheme to people buying their own homes.  These people, while subscribing to the health services, were not entitled to any concessions up to now. While they might be able to meet the doctor's fees, the purchase of exclusive drugs was beyond them.  As a member of the Dublin Health Authority, I had to appeal to the CEO to alleviate the hardship involved for these people in trying to buy drugs.  The doctor might charge 10/-, 15/- or £1 but frequently when one went to get the drugs he prescribed, one had to pay £2 and this, perhaps, repeatedly.  I know people who had to get drugs for certain ailments which cost them £3 per week.  They had only low pay and were repaying loans on their houses and they could not carry on.  They had to ask their public representatives to do something. The Minister has come to their aid and these people in the lower middle-income group who are finding it very hard to exist will welcome the new provision.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="709" /> It might be asked why they did not join the Voluntary Health Scheme. That would mean that they would be provided with the drugs while they were in hospital but it is not easy for a man on a moderate income who is purchasing his own home to cope with all <Col N="710" /> his outgoings, even if he has £15 or £16 a week.</P>
    <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>
